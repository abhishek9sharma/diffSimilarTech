4800108
post	put
i think that link_to put the arguments into the query string as it is creating with html link even if you put method post if js is disabled

4800115
atoi	atof
which is why atoi works and atof doesn t

4800132
int	double
but the return type of such a function is assumed to be int not double which is why the program executes incorrectly

4800132
atoi	atof
tangentially never use atoi nor atof they hide input errors

4800132
strtol	strtod
use strtol and strtod instead

we run quartz with spring and it s just an xml file with the jobs defined and cron expressions

4800272

if we think of a fifo queue as a pipe adding more page space is like making the pipe bigger

4800293

i am looking at the usual list of candidates including drupal alfresco wordpress joomla and also more general frameworks like django

4800535
queue	fifo
the reason that when using fifo increasing the number of pages can increase the fault rate in some access patterns is because when you have more pages recently requested pages can remain at the bottom of the fifo queue longer

4800535
queue	fifo
belady s anomaly points out that it is possible to exploit the fact that larger cache sizes can cause items in the cache to be raised in the fifo queue later than smaller cache sizes in order to cause larger cache sizes to have a higher fault rate under a particular and possibly rare access pattern

4800560
post	get
this post suggests that you should be able to get the ie developer toolbar to show you the xpath for an element you click on if you turn on the select element by click option

4800930
put	get
to get better performance you could put your overlay in another window either by using windowmanager.addview or by using a poupwindow

4800971
getter	setter
you can t avoid some of the places where you might not want those heavy stuffs since every declaration creates getter and setter implicitly but application development in grails is very fast you will have a habit of using cool things as versioning in current data but if you have transactions then why do you need those i don t know if you don t want to get into the nuisance of scaffolding but still want to see it as a reference then you can have two copies one code generated from scaffolding and other without it so that you can develop your own version with carefully crafting the application with a reference to the scaffolded version

4800985
post	get
i ve been trying to get this working forever and have found every blog post and message i could but none cover this situation and the docs don t help at all

4801171
width	height
it points to the same space that containera does in your design and takes up the entire container div s space because of width and height 100

4801181
width	height
an interesting design issue about these notifications is that they cannot have a specified width height is fixed - they should be able to handle in ascii drawing 1 and 1000 where 1000 is not a perfectly rounded circle but instead looks more like a capsule

4801195
int	double
the compiler looks at the types of the operands for a single operation and promotes both to the larger type if one is int and the other double it ll convert the int to double then do the operation

4801195
division	multiplication
this means the division would be done on integers giving an integer result and only after that integer result was obtained would that integer be converted to a float for multiplication by pi

4801195
int	double
converting to a combination of float and long will save about 14 bytes of data storage but then add around 14 bytes of extra instructions to handle all the conversions between int float and double at the right times so you ll end up with slower code that uses just as much memory anyway

4801196

here you output the int 0 followed by the chars newline to the standard output stream

4801320
std	ostream
next you see that the function returns a std ostream

4801320
std	ostream
std ostream is in fact typedef d as and therefore your function can only output telegram objects to streams that work on char types

4801320
std	ostream
the reason the function returns a std ostream is so that you can chain calls to the function

4801320
std	ostream
the first parameter a std ostream is taken by reference

finally if you want to loop over the elements of the vector adding them together you probably don t want to be reading the file as strings but rather as int s or double s

hi i m creating an app in which i want to hide a part of app and want to show another part

4804783
filesystems	xfs
mysql has a reputation for recovering poorly from inconsistent disk states xfs essentially pauses io to the filesystems whilst the snapshot takes place

4804783
lvm	xfs
lvm is a bit more fiddly than xfs but i ve had issues with xfs in the past crapping out on large numbers of files in a single directory where ext3 was fine

4804806
google-chrome	safari
so far it works fine in google-chrome but in safari it doesn t do anything

4804811
width	height
width and height

4804821
width	height
all you have to do is get its x and y and then fiddle with adding its width and or height to figure out what you need

4804854
width	height
assuming you re talking just about width and not about height

4804862
button	checkbox
on the demo you can check uncheck some checkbox and cick the export data to xml button

4804881
children	parent
you re trying to make the parent s height dependent on the children s height and children s height dependent on parent s height

4804894
kerberos	ldap
i would like to ask you a question about implementing mutual authentication with kerberos using sspi and ldap api

4805025
actionscript	mxml
i am trying to navigate from one mxml page to another via actionscript code

4805063
superclass	subclassing
i want a subclassing bb to get a instance of a subclassing of a which is one of the fields of its superclass b through the method in the superclass b

4805066
folder	directory
the first tells the compiler search for include files in your include folder while the second says look into source files directory

4805071
pentaho	olap

4805071
primefaces	icefaces
components primefaces icefaces and adf of oracle

4805100
post	get
i ve looked at a couple of blog post about this but can t seem to get it right

4805105
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
first the aggregate-functions such as min max avg count sum will all use a group by if there is another column involved such as your example.

4805135
folder	directory
if i would have like 1000 directory on my ftp root i mean jan2011-26 jan2011-25 jan2011-24 jan2011-23 jan2011-22 and so on... is would be bad to check every single folder i don t even want that

4805135
folder	directory
it s fine if the script only checks the last 5 directory so only jan2011-26 jan2011-25 jan2011-24 jan2011-23 jan2011-22 but it has to check if any new directory is created in these 5 folder

4805147
button	checkbox
encased in the alt tag of multiple checkbox and radio button is an id that corresponds to the ids of hidden containers and fields

4805147
button	checkbox
therefore the combination of button and checkbox that are checked determines what hidden areas are visible as seen here

4805154
decoder	encoder
it uses the service provider interface for supporting other formats for which you can provide a decoder encoder

4805155
button	checkbox
so if the user clicks on the choose file the normal response occurs but if the user clicks on a button that says choose from library they then get prompted with a facebox screen where they choose an item by means of radio or checkbox inputs when they are then done or submits from the facebox screen the first form gets updated with the data

4805169
pop-up	dialog
if you right-click on a maven project and select properties from the pop-up menu you enter the project preferences dialog which has a maven- lifecycle section allowing to customize which build phases should be bound to the build lifecycle whenever the project is refreshed or clean-built

4805169
put	get
however these customizations are coarse-grained and get lost upon project-configuration-update same if you put file org.maven.ide.eclipse.prefs where these settings are saved under version control .

4805184
width	height
after this set the height and width properties to 100

4805190
django	turbogears
pyscreensaver plus maybe some turbogears or django for managing the database on the server side if you don t have anything for that yet

4805258
for-loop	loops
the project has a for-loop nested inside a while loops

4805258
for-loop	loops
i tried to put a boolean operator in the while loops that controls the for-loop but that doesn t control what goes on inside the for-loop until the for-loop gets to the end

4805280
put	get
i ve been looking for where the user s layout config is stored so i could set the dashboard up as i want it to be in the preset and then look at this user s config to get figure out how to put this in as the default in presets.xml but i can t find where they re put

4805295
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
otherwise you can use a gridview repeater listview third party control etc for display with entity framework ado.net linq to sql etc for data access

4805296
for-loop	loops
i tried to put a boolean operator in the while loops that controls the for-loop but that doesn t control what goes on inside the for-loop until the for-loop gets to the end

4805298
width	margin
my first idea was to make a wrapper div for each section which handles the background and another content div inside of it with width 950px and margin 0 auto

4805325
int	boolean
b if your preference supports only a single key value pair then you can use the helper save methods persistboolean boolean persistfloat float persistint int persistlong long persiststring string when you persist the changed preference value in ondialogclosed

4805331
rss	feed
to parse a rss feed www.rssfeedhomepage.com rssfeed.xml i want to use a module from the cpan homepage because it s much easer than create an own one

4805331
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux as a vm on windows 7

4805371
width	margin
width 50 with a negative margin hack quite simple but column-bottom borders are a little tricky

4805430
innodb	myisam
depending on the engine blobs are either stored inline myisam partially off-page innodb or entirely off-page innodb plugin in some cases

4805440
profiler	aqtime
search here for delphi profiler for some suggestions if you re using delphi xe you can use the included aqtime

4805454
children	parent
let say i have a predicate for sorting tree roots together and another predicate to sort children of a common parent together

4805454
children	parent
each node have a parent accessor and a children enumerator

4805461
getter	setter
aside from implementing a usertype you can enable property access in jpa 1.0 - by moving all annotations to properties in jpa 2.0 you can configure access type for individual property with access and implement conversion logic in getter and setter

4805526
dlsym	dlopen
we just used dlopen and dlsym along with a pair of extern c static functions that must be defined in the dll

4805576
stdout	stderr
my python code spawns the child process and it prints out messages both stdout and stderr

4805576
stdout	stderr
i need to print out the stderr and stdout as soon as the child process prints out something

4805578
maven	m2e
i use commandline shell rather than m2e for maven

4805584
int	double
personally i think it is unlikely that a switch from int to double precision floating point operations is likely to yield performance improvements

4805587
kerberos	ntlm
i can t use kerberos ntlm as the server isn t on a domain and ntlm is weak anyway

4805595
hide	show
in both methods i m able to hide them but if i tried to show them the scripts takes to long to load and stops

4805599
integer	unsigned
firebug detects array-like objects simply by looking if they have a length property whose its value is an unsigned 32-bit integer less than 2 32 - 1 and if they have a splice property that is a function for example the following object will be detected and printed as an array on the firebug s console

4805617
stdout	stderr
i mean lines printed as soon as the spawned process prints something to stdout or stderr then you can do something like

4805617
stdout	stderr
in this case two threads will print every time that a line is written either to stdout or stderr

4805617
stdout	stderr
the parameter type_pipe just makes the distinction when the lines are printed to know if they are coming from stderr or stdout

4805638
translation	localization
i recommend using the if statements as you suggest then tapping into the localization system by using to translation your strings in the template file adding the translation to the locale csv files if necessary

4805697
postgresql	mysql
i m mainly interested in postgresql and mysql but any other pointers would be appreciated as well

4805704
ocaml	sml
in ml derivatives such as ocaml sml f# there are references which can be used as mutable variables

4805711
button	checkbox
i have a fairly large search form text box radio button checkbox collection_select etc.

4805717
put	get
i ve managed to find tuts on how to get the picture if you provide the url but i want to get the addy from my dictionary to then be put into my uiimageview

4805730
int	double
you can then represent a date as an nsdate instance as a double or if you desperately need to save memory as an int like unix timestamp

4805782
hide	show
if you are using jquery ajax then you can use ajaxstart and ajaxstop functions to show and hide visual feedback ui

4805815
children	parent
you will have 1 parent the first query that produces then children the second query now there could be 2 10 20 etc

4805840
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4805859
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
i can lazy load one-to-many and many-to-one associations but i can t with the many-to-many associations

4805877
salt	md5
so in ournamespace_openid_provider_storage_db checkuser the second argument the password is provided as md5 string including a salt openid which i cannot check in our own user table

4805910
put	get
i can t get over what appears to be a simple css formatting problem in chrome i want to put a table towards the right and a label and some buttons toward the left inside the same paragraph

4805910
google-chrome	firefox
this works easy enough in other browsers firefox ie7 8 but in google-chrome the table stretches over the entire page under the label

4806018
jpql	hql
by using join fetch clause in hql jpql query

4806057
gif	png
you will need to convert these images to the same time in order for this to work one large png jpeg or gif or one of each type if their color spaces are incompatible

4806094
hide	show
#timer01 stops data 01 hide #timer02 starts displays #timer02 seconds remaining show data 02

4806094
hide	show
#timer02 stops data 02 hide #timer01 continues #timer01 spawns as a new timer displays conflicting times for both old and new #timer01 show data 01 old timer hide data 01 before new timer is up

4806094
hide	show
#timer02 stops data 02 hide #timer01 restarts with new time displays new time remaining show data 01

4806138
post	get
after a post on here regular expression to allow numbers between -90.0 and +90.0 i thought i could use the logic and get it sussed but can t

4806154
folder	directory
if you change directory to directory you will not get git to recognize it unless you move to another temp folder commit move back and commit again

4806201
postgresql	mysql
if you are talking about relational databases like oracle mysql postgresql then

4806229
tcombobox	timagelist
i assume that i will have to install at runtime the resource providing the image to tcombobox into a timagelist to make it available to my tbuttonededits

4806310
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works only on google-chrome opera and firefox

4806407
stdout	stderr
i m using the code below but it hangs at the press enter point and doesn t give any feedback from the ssh channel either as stdout or stderr

4806447
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol that contains a bunch tabitem

4806476
hide	show
the way i would do it would be to give the two columns i wanted to hide unique id and using the jquery toggle function show and hide them

4806522
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following works great in google-chrome safari firefox but in ie8 it sits to the far left

4806529
slideup	slidedown
i am having an issue with the jquery slidedown slideup

4806547
backgrounding	multitasking
the application get crashed only when the many application runs in the backgrounding multitasking

4806560
hudson	bamboo
well i haven t used bamboo so far but one difference is that hudson is free libre open-source software

4806595
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
valums upload script latest version sends file information by ajax xhr stream when using firefox google-chrome or safari

4806652
fast-forward	merge
that will ensure that your pull request can be applied in a fast-forward manner without any merge conflict

4806668
jobs	cron
the only way i can think of is run cron jobs to pre-fill the cache

4806706
put	get
if i however put them the way i would like i get a classnotfoundexception

4806757
post	put
simply put iphone will post its location lat long and rails will archive it

4806844
addclass	removeclass
you don t include the leading dot when you re calling addclass removeclass toggleclass

4806894
google-chrome	firefox
i ve created a web-application and been testing it up until now only on google-chrome and firefox

4806894
google-chrome	firefox
in the beginning i had the same problem with google-chrome and firefox but after i added this

4806903
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that is being populated with data from a sqldatasource

4806911
put	get
for instance if i put print abc bac i get true

4806959
ant	maven
i think the only option available right now is using the maven antrun plugin and executing the ant unzip task

4806984
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome safari firefox work perfectly

4807019
listview	gridview
i would try creating a datatemplate with a listview gridview in it and an expander

4807037
prepare	execute
i would like to execute one time release prepare and then execute release perform for each environment to generate the corresponding package file

4807047
portrait	landscape
there is a hack that will accomplish this but i seriously advise against using it - your design should adapt to whether someone is in portrait or landscape mode

4807047
portrait	landscape
step 1 query the window.orientation property to see if you re in landscape or portrait mode

4807047
portrait	landscape
step 2 if you re in portrait mode use a -webkit-transform rotate -90 on a div that s wrapping your entire page to force it into a landscape layout

4807047
portrait	landscape
this won t work quite correctly - the browser ui will still be in portrait mode but presumably the user will figure out that they re supposed to rotate the phone back into landscape mode in order to view the content

4807070
mouse	keyboard
this has the side-effect that the selecteditem will always be displayed on the top even if it was selected by mouse keyboard etc

4807072
versioning	upgrade
the original setup on this computer was xampp with a versioning of php 5.2 that was upgrade to php 5.3.4 via the php installer

4807072
versioning	upgrade
without being able to come up with a solution i upgrade to a versioning of xampp that has php 5.3.1 built in

4807102
capitalize	capitalization
just set css style text-transform capitalize and when processing form data put the text through some capitalization function

4807169
width	height
the other ads code is basically the same save with different width height and name

4807178
width	height
so first you add 100 width and height div to fill whole screen and all inside that div positioned in center and in center you add another diw wich will be lets say 900 width and here will be all the content

4807178
width	height
after that you add header wich is 100 width and 180 height all those divs position is absolute so you can type where each one goes

4807179
post	get
however i am working right now on adding presence in the chat sense so that your app can register to get a post when a client connects to or disconnects from a channel created with a given client id

4807193
stdout	stderr
if your python script doesn t feed the foo process fast enough then you could offload reading stdout stderr to threads

4807203
put	get
as an example lets say i m working with a product that requires i put s onto my page which then get embedded into my existing website

4807204
getter	setter
getter setter and other member functions ommited for brevity

4807204
getter	setter
if you have public getter and setter which are just boilerplate consider marking the corresponding data members as public instead

4807287
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and ie8 on windows are having the same problem of not showing the number 7 in front of the element

4807303
post	put
a couple of years ago i looked into this and the state of things then was that there was a way to work online with equifax but rather than a regular web service you had to manually put together a post request to a page they hosted and could then read the relevant response

4807311
mouse	keyboard
if i use the actual keyboard autocomplete works but if i use the virtual keyboard by pressing with mouse autocomplete does not work

4807314
rss	feed
you can use the following site to retrieve an rss feed that you could probably disseminate for the data you want

4807317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have no problem parsing the string with but safari and ie won t stand for it

4807340
cvs	rcs
i ve always used some sort of version control for my private projects #programmers 1 in the beginning just copies with numbers later rcs then cvs then subversion

4807379
post	get
i was looking around a found a mention of changing the post method of a form to a get method

4807399
post	get
i thought i would post it here and see if there is a way that i can get my comparison done via generics

4807409
post	get
i tried changing over from get to post and got the exact same

4807425
comparator	icomparer
you could accept an icomparer that will do the comparison for you and that comparator can define what it means for one string to be less than of greater than another

4807431
abstract-class	superclass
so the answer is yes an abstract-class can extends a superclass in php

4807471
single-quotes	double-quotes
when you use echo there s a big difference between wrapping the guts in double-quotes and wrapping them in single-quotes

4807476
width	height
i assume you re putting a full width height div with a higher z-index than the original page

4807500
client-side	server-side
some third-party controls that support just-in-time loading supply both client-side and server-side logic while others try to solve the problem 100 client-side

4807505
ubuntu	debian
second part of the problem was that ubuntu probably debian as well has two apt packages for the above pgpool and pgpool2

4807511
width	margin
if you have a div or other tag that you want centered on the page you need to specify a width for it and then using the margin rule center it

4807528
folder	directory
you get that error message because you might be asking the webserver for the directory listing of www folder

4807528
apache	nginx
apache is also terrible at sending static files so i have my apache setup on port 8080 and nginx setup on port 80 which forwards to apache

4807529
mouse	keyboard
first java.awt.robot allows you to emulate keyboard and mouse events

4807591
ssl	https
i m getting the http error 403.4 - forbidden ssl is required to view the resource error using iis6 even though the url starts with https

4807623
int	chars
the document contains the chars â œ and â java int code 8220 and 8221

4807677
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
i am looking into building a login system and after reading the php manual when you pass a 2 digit salt to the crypt function it returns a hash string and the first 2 digits of the string are the salt that you used

4807707
springboard	backgrounding
resuming the app from the springboard works as expected the orientation is the same as when it was sent to the backgrounding

4807732
hide	show
this way users can hide show fonts as they see fit but also hide all fonts inappropriate for their region

4807734
hide	show
when the menu item is accessed it will call the querystatus method which you can then determine if you want to show hide menu items

4807744
cpu	processors
we had some projects building an x86 variant some building an x64 variant and the configuration manager had solution platforms for any cpu and mixed processors

4807767
post	get
according remus post i ve tried to use the event notification to get the exact moment when the queue stops

4807771
hash	salt
yes the salt is supposed to be kept secret but then so is the password hash

4807771
hash	salt
to check a password against the hash you have to combine the salt with the password and then check it against the hash

4807771
hash	salt
so any user or process with the right to see the password hash should also have the right to see the salt since the password hash by itself is not useful for checking passwords unless you re going to brute-force the salt

4807771
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is so that if two different users have the same password they ll hash to different things

4807771
hash	salt
but knowledge of the salt by itself doesn t mean you can reverse the password hash

4807771
hash	salt
if you can find a way to keep the salt more secure than the hash value it certainly wouldn t be a bad thing but it s hard to see how this is feasible when any program which needs access to one needs access to both

4807783
hash	md5
for any modern password usage you d be better off with more modern hash such as sha1 sha256 md5

4807788
width	height
recently i needed to find width and height for setting default size of .dialog representing graph

4807792
getter	setter
i thought adding public getter and setter would enable me to unit test this properly and would be useful for my app

4807794
hash	salt
the salt is appended to the has so that you will know which salt to use when you get the password and want to see if it matches the hash

4807794
hash	salt
the idea here is to use a different salt for every password so that someone cannot precompute a hash table

4807809
crypt	hash
php crypt inherits this behaviour from the unix crypt function which was used for generating password hash in the unix passwd file

4807809
hash	salt
for best practice you should not publish your salt in the same way that you should not publish your password hash

4807809
hash	salt
giving an attacker the hash and salt makes it easy for them to run a brute-force attack without generating suspicious traffic to your system

4807809
hash	salt
however the system should still be secure even if an attacker can see both salt and hash password

4807822
ivar	subclassing
the cell subclassing is doing some relatively complex layout of uicontrol instances and then storing its height based on the layout of those controls in an ivar

4807832
folder	directory
alternatively move your java source file under project src directory which is the default java source folder for web projects in eclipse

multiplying	multiplication
the usual matrix multiplication is a waste because it spends so much time in multiplying zeros .

4807907
post	get
i have a rails 3 application where i want to redirect an incoming post request to an external get request

4807967
width	height
you re thinking right but one important thing to remember is that body and html elements need to have width and height set on 100 also

4808000
post	get
you can use the curl library with it s wide range of options to perform get post head etc

4808030
atexit	main
if it s after main returns then according to the standard all destructors have been run although i wouldn t put it past an implementation to fudge this some unless the function atexit has been used

cassini	iis
the following code works fine under cassini but not at all under iis

4808062
centos	linux
i have recently installed birt viewer version 2.6.1 in tomcat on a centos linux machine

4808087
arp	icmp
and the documentation is unclear excessively minimalist about what happens if the ping times out or fails failure would be lack of a network connection a missing arp entry for local peers icmp destination unreachable response from an intervening router for remote peers etc

4808091
keydown	keyup
it would run the function when something was typed in hence the keydown keyup keypress

okay so it s in the form of a language called vml which only ie supports rather than svg but it is there and you can use it

4809396
svg	vml
google maps among others will detect the browser capabilities to determine whether to serve svg or vml

4809396
svg	vml
then there s the raphael library which is a javascript browswer-based graphics library which supports either svg or vml again depending on the browser

4809396
svg	vml
see also the top answer to this question for example xsl transform svg to vml

4809459
post	get
i m not an expert but you may try using get instead of post

4809560
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
however if you just create a uinavcontroller inside of your view controller then you need to implement viewwillappear viewdidappear and so on and forward those to your nav controller

4809586
backtracking	greedy
traditional nfa engines run so-called greedy match backtracking algorithms testing all possible expansions of a regular expression in a specific order and accepting the first match

4809586

we have a stable version of a new app ready to submit but wondering if we can post an update with new features even while the app is under review after few days of initial submission

4809846

spy++	sendmessage
if you re using sendmessage you can use spy++ to search for the class and name of the textbox which will allow you to get a handle to the textbox

4809908
ant	maven
if you add all transitive depedencies as direct depedencies you are not making full use of maven and future maintainers will not thank you because upgrading a depedency will be as difficult as it was in ant the versions of transitive depedencies have to be updated manually

4809936
put	get
if you want to hack it yourself you will need to get a copy of joomlainstall modules mod_mainmenu tmpl default.php and put it in joomlainstall templates yourtemplate mod_mainmenu default.php once you have made the modifications

4809971
google-chrome	safari	mouseover	mouseout
it works like this if your mouse is still and a div programmatically moves underneath your mouse a mouseover event will not be trigged in google-chrome safari - same goes for mouseout

4809971
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
just let the div oscillate under your mouse works fine in firefox not in google-chrome or safari - have yet to test in ie

4809971

basically rolling my own mouseenter and mouseleave events using this

4810006

4810127
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am currently taking the user back to the root controller using the uinavigationcontroller method - nsarray poptorootviewcontrolleranimated bool animated with animated being yes if i immediately call the uiviewcontroller method - void presentmodalviewcontroller uiviewcontroller modalviewcontroller animated bool animated it does both animations together looking a little messy

4810140
int	chars
if the string does not contain any of the chars . e or e and the numeric value fits into int type limits as defined by php_int_max the string will be evaluated as an int

4810160
for-loop	loops
so if i had 1 2 3 4 i d be iterating over 1 first then trying to advance the iteration to 2 within the for-loop so that when loops started again it d be at 3

4810167
scheme	racket
so i have the following code block in racket scheme

4810185

4810185
versioning	upgrade
upgrade are triggered by changing the database versioning number in the res values strings.xml file

4810220
tcpdf	fpdf
so any code you already have for fpdf might work with tcpdf

i use the infragistics ultratree control in a winforms application as a treelist outlook mode

4810325
put	get
is it possible that between the get lastname and put firstname new person that another thread could get the inner map

4810357
put	get
with the same lastname then it s possible for one thread to get the inner map then the other thread gets the inner map then both call put at the same time and break everything

4810367
width	height
width height and depth are meaningless in this context

4810387
inherited	subclassing
and if you write your own uiviewcontroller subclassing you re responsible for passing down any of these inherited method calls

4810387
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
built-in uiviewcontroller like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontrollers explicitly pass down these calls to their children that s why it seems like a broadcast when they arrive but when you insert your own uinavigationcontroller subclass to the vc hierarchy you must yourself pass down these calls to any children uinavigationcontroller

4810437
google-chrome	safari
the url works fine in safari google-chrome and firefox.

4810443
getter	setter
or provide your own implementation for both the getter and setter which is what you want judging from your example

4810457
int	chars
for example casting from a chars to an int

4810457
int	chars
so if you have a pointer to a chars and you cast that to a pointer to an int that will cause undefined behaviour

4810469
ant	maven
in some way it s like dependency build ie maven ant ivy

4810471
getter	setter
you need to either provide a body for both the getter and setter or neither

4810471
getter	setter
since you have non-trivial logic in your setter you need a manually-implemented getter like so

4810491
post	put
not sure where i should post it .i put under c# but again not sure

4810540
lisp	prolog
paul graham is a lisp person nonetheless he argues that prolog is really good for 2 of the problems i am myself like to break this 2 down and figure how he d come up with such number

4810574
instances	transient
instances - save the transient instances

4810574
instances	transient
why is it a transient instances

4810611
int	chars
basically you are passing the id if it exists you read the widget model see the notes above null as 1st param read the entire table and then you are using model set to st the field to a value one greater than itself - remember to cast to int if you store the field as a chars varchar - and then save the model

4810637
google-chrome	firefox
we have to support the last two revisions of ie google-chrome and firefox and i have a feeling this isn t possible with ie 7 8 but perhaps i m missing something

4810640

4810677
onkeyup	onkeydown
i am using js onkeyup and onkeydown function to check the key pressed by the user

stdout	stderr
#note all output must be redirected to stderr with 1 2 as all stdout output is written to the output file

4810692

4810757
put	get
when i only put rewriteengine on no problems happen when i type another line i get the error

4810834
filtering	grouping
if the filtering on results in multiple cal1.communications_id s then you will want to grouping by communications_id doesn t matter from cal1 or cal2 - they are the same

4810858
next	except
i d like to look for strings that have any number of characters except an x and y next to each other...the regex above doesn t work since it blocks x s and y s separately

4810877
swt	swing
the dj native swing project has several html editors implemented using the swt browser this is an implementation detail

4810884
min	max
1 server generates a random salt rand min max sends it with the page upon request computes and stores the sha1 un pw salt along with the server timestamp of the request to a database

4810886
width	height
when it should use 256 as width and height it throws an exception

4810886
width	height
when i change the parameter width height to 128 the exception disappears but the cubes show wrong colors

4810901
margin	height
you might want to take a look at this sticky footer page -- you can modify that technique by not making the height of the footer and the negative margin of the previous element the same

4810916
post	get
the method get or post

4810997
width	height
bewildr elements will have width and height methods available in the next release a few days from now - the code s checked in and working

4811001
button	checkbox
if you re using paypal button make sure that the appropriate checkbox are checked when created the button to ask for the buyers address otherwise it may not ask at all

4811017
put	get
then i would also change the way you get the answer because you want readystate and status not or as you put it

4811022
put	get
so if i get some put all of them into an arraylist of objs2

4811036
gridview	repeater
but if i try to bind it to a gridview or repeater i get the error the data source for gridview with id gv did not have any properties or attributes from which to generate columns

4811046
post	get
when views need to call something into the controller they no longer use any postbacks or events they use standard html artifacts such as anchor links for sending get requests and forms for sending post requests

4811062
mate	puremvc
i also recommend you to take a look at mate framework it is like puremvc + data binding + flex events

4811072
width	height
you ll have to wrap your td s content into a div and set that div s width and height can t hide overflow content

4811096
wordpress	joomla
however the steps listed below break down some very involved steps as i found required to debug in wordpress and joomla

4811096
wordpress	joomla
i m doing a lot of custom integration with wordpress joomla and .net applications

4811115
for-loop	arrays
i think this is perhaps because i did not define it as an arrays and am redefining it constantly in my for-loop

4811149
jtree	jtable
my component has a jtree a jtable and then a part that is totally custom painted hopefully ending up to be quite ms project-esque ganttview

4811217
post	put
the better way is to put those parameters as hidden values in your form and as your form is submitted as post

4811235
xlwt	xlutils
or there s a lilinks to xlrd xlwt and xlutils at

4811275
put	get
when i put the correct bundle id of com.app.name i get the dreaded error of your applicationâ s code signing entitlements file do not match those specified in your provisioning profile.

4811293
post	get
take a look into ajax as this is typically a way to get around the post back issue that i remember with asp.net where usually on a form submission the screen would flicker as it reloaded the entire page

4811333
listboxitem	textbox
when i click on an item in the listbox i want to be able to edit the selecteditem s value in the textbox that gets populated tab off the textbox and have the listboxitem update its value and i want the sum to be updated in the label as well

4811348
rel	src
i am trying to pass along both the src and the rel tag values

4811351
ostream	istream
update 1 please remember to share links for articles so i can learn more about ostream and istream objects

4811359
children	parent
there s no rule in the language that says if all the children of an element are nillable then the parent should be nillable too

4811388
ostream	noncopyable
because ostream is noncopyable class

4811410
std	ostream
std ostream s copy constructor is private - which means you cannot create a copy of a stream object

4811451

my post aren t in kata form but you might find them useful to suggest an ordering and they could give you hints if you get stuck

4811485
getter	setter
i ran into an issue where i needed a custom getter with a vanilla setter

4811492
put	get
i still get the same message terminate called after throwing an instance of swig directormethodexception no matter what i put in the module.i file

4811524
csv	tsv
i need to create a java j2ee application that allows people to generate views on large csv tsv tabular data

sorting	filtering
views might include things like pagination through the data sorting filtering pivoting and perhaps charting

4811528
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari 3+ google-chrome 2+ firefox 2+ and opera 9.5+ all support these properties.

4811558
vb.net	vb6
the tools that take vb.net to c# are far from perfect so i highly doubt that going from vb6 to c# is going to be painless

4811571
implements	extends
implements mypasswordview extends passwordview and overrides drawechocharacter

4811571
implements	extends
implements mypasswordui extends basicpasswordfieldui that overrides view create element elem and creates instance of mypasswordview

4811588
puts	gets
i ran through a similar test scenario a few months ago where i had a test client generating load on a 3 lead-server cluster with a variety of puts gets and removes

4811738
jobs	cron
i want to know how i can see exactly what the cron jobs are doing on each execution

4811744
postgresql	mysql
i know that solutions like mysql postgresql and ms sql server are relational database systems and nosql mongodb etc

4811753
put	get
but it s possible for instances to be created that don t get put into the dictionary which could lead to problems

4811754
getter	setter
note that you do not need those jsonproperty annotations since you have getter and setter which imply title as per bean naming convention

4811796
put	get	post	get	post	put
i would expect to be able to send a put or post with my topobject as i want it to be after the modifications and get a 200 ok back possibly with a link to get that information back

4811820
children	parent
there is no way in css to style an element based on what its children elements are or to change a parent s style from a child element s style declaration

4811863
children	parent
you have to inherit the parent pom in the sub-projects and specify the children in the parent as modules

4811899
maven	pom.xml
take a look at maven parent pom.xml vs modules pom.xml

4811925
width	height
the new width height are not everytime set by css but i need to get the real width height of that height when everytime it changes

4811925
google-chrome	safari
it must work in google-chrome ff2 ff3 ie6 if can t work i might lag user s browser with a timer xd ie7 safari opera.

4811986
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in general it is better to put everything in httpd.conf because all the rules are created at the start of apache instance and live in the memory not on the disk like .htaccess with filesystem access

4812024
google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome and firefox everything works for the most part but you may have to tweak the margins and size specifically for the select element

4812037
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of using the mouseout try using mouseleave for the tag

4812095
hudson	bamboo
automated builds are a must for any serious organization and you should pick an scm that can be access by your build systems hudson cruisecontrol bamboo etc.

4812111
rss	feed
there is a rss feed that can be limited to one of the shared folders but it kind of filters events to keep volumes low

4812145
versioning	upgrade
i also upgrade for 10 to the versioning that lets you search within directories and not just files

4812199
width	height
the problem i am having issues in attacking is how to resize the sidebar width when the nested nssplitview s height is altered

4812199
width	height
the way i have it setup now is to set the inner scrollview s delegate to be the windowcontroller that owns the main splitview then do a calculation on the height to alter the width of the info panel

4812264
config	ini
there is one drawback to ini or config files and that is locating them if the user has the option to select where the program is installed

4812296
width	height
now whenever your mysplitview resizes it will automatically update the height of the view to match the width

4812298
cublas	cufft
if you re trying to work with cublas or cufft you should use cucomplex

4812299
width	height
i have no control over the size of the images being uploaded i suppose i could restrict the width and height but that wouldn t be practical in this situation

4812299
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
now what i would like to do with the above code is to take out the width height and margin specifications so as to allow an image no matter how big or small to be exactly centred and without the use of javascript

4812300
bash	subshell
in bash the double parentheses set up an arithmetic context in which dollar signs are mostly optional by the way for a comparison also used in and arithmetic expansion and is used to distinguish the sequence from a set of single parentheses which creates a subshell

4812316
width	height
as for the size of the image element you can specify it s width and height so that whatever size the image the user will upload it will still be the same

4812317
ubuntu	debian
the default usr lib is the correct value for finding libjpeg.so.62 on debian ubuntu

4812342
innodb	myisam

4812347
google-chrome	firefox
no error is displayed in ie and they work fine in firefox and google-chrome

4812388
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome safari and ie8 but doesn t work at all in ie7

4812398
int	boolean
however if you enter the wrong type of text it turns into an infinite loop even if you enter an int next and skips assigning the boolean value to true

4812429
csla	.net
csla .net forum thread on this topic

4812439
for-loop	loops

imo you should only consider rolling your own format and implementing the corresponding serializable deserialization code if you have a clear requirement to do so or if you have clear evidence that the existing alternatives won t work

4812502
google-chrome	firefox
quicktime with data url works with both firefox and google-chrome recent releases no betas you have to follow instructions from quicktime website initialize quicktime by calling qt_writeobject function i had to provide initial valid src pointing to beethoven s mp3 file just to keep it from complaining - maybe it s not necessary register listeners as detailed in the said reference and after getting callback qt_load call document.movie1.seturl mydataurl method

getter	setter
them really the next thing you need to remember is that value is both a getter and a setter

4812733
width	height
then i have mod_rewrite which reads the file from xyzdir into a php script which then translates the width and height and returns the image

4812736

looking at the book 2a of the intel instruction set reference manual it can only be done using jmp ptr16 32 where the ptr16 32 is an immediate value or using jmp m16 32 where the m16 32 is a memory location containing the 48-bit jump address the 16 32

4812827
cos	sin
if you want it to move in an ellipse the easiest way that i know of would be to give the y values as a function of time with sin and the x values as a function of time with cos

4812827
cos	sin
then the y value would be radius in the y direction sin elapsedtime speed + y value of the center of your ellipse and the x value would be radius in the x direction cos elapsedtime speed + x value at the center of your ellipse

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in this case safari google-chrome andoid and ios would use the video tag while ie firefox and opera would use flash

also - the processors in newer fancier ethernet cards offload a lot of work from the cpu so you shouldn t necessarily expect a cpu hit

4813951
postgresql	mysql
you should definitely go with mysql or postgresql

git-rebase	undo
but hgsvn has the drawback that it does no automatic git-rebase for stuff which gets back into svn so when you have had to merge in terms of a mercurial merge the svn history with your local history you can t export every local commit only the merge commit there is the way to export every commit even when there is a merge but the first local commit will undo the recent svn history and the merge commit will redo it which causes a defect svn history

4815368
width	height
if you explicitly set values to width height yourself those values will be ignored

4815368
width	height
when setting a fixed value in mxml for width height that value gets saved in explicitwidth explicitheight etc while percentages get stored in percentagewidth percentageheight and so on.

int	chars
according to the assembler dump here 32 bytes have been allocated because 16 4+16 32 however i expected int a to be allocated on the first 16 bytes and then the chars array to be allocated on the next 16 bytes leaving a space of 12 bytes in-between

4817473
int	chars
but it seems both the int and the chars array have been allocated a contiguous chunk of 20 bytes which is inefficient as per the discussion i referred above

4817540
width	height
the limit on the size i want to make 250 in width and 250 in height

4817540
width	height
this does not mean that if i upload an image 1000h500 then it must do 250x250 which means that the width we re doing 250 pixels and the height is proportional to the first dimension is 125

4817550
rss	feed
if all you need to do is read and or write some basic xml exchanging data with an xml service or reading a rss feed then you can use either

you hide all items instantaneously and then show with animation the divs you are interested in

4818429
hash	md5
instead to have as few moving parts as possible the script would just create a unique hash for my url based on an algorithm like md5 except an md5 would be too long

4818453
width	height
for example if you want your fixed view to always remain 100 px from the top of the scrollview set its initial frame to 0 100 width height and then in the callback set the frame to 0 contentoffset.y + 100 width height

4818494

on unix a directory is a file with some special properties so maybe directory could even inherited from file although that gets kind of ugly with class clusters so exercise caution if doing so

4818640
int	chars
in particular if you are not casting to chars or a sufficiently large int type it may always be ub to cast a pointer to a different pointer type - even without dereferencing it

4818640
integer	unsigned
this is because the types may have different alignment and there is no general portable way to make sure different types have compatible alignment except for some special cases such as signed unsigned integer type pairs

4819035
pull	push
if you can integrate via web services or push pull into an enterprise system db then you can still use an odbms but there might be political pressure against it

4819043
for-loop	arrays
using a for-loop allows you to keep track of which index you are at using an int allowing you to just use standard arrays notation to get the items in the collection

hide	show
also from your code we do not see a div with id add_pal and therefore there s no add_pal div to hide or show

4819168
hide	show
the method call was not show in the trace because the jit optimizer inlined the method this is the only way to hide methods in the stack trace

4819181
x86	64bit
however a very simple test indicates that on a 64bit machine sha256managed hashes a 10 mb byte array almost twice as slowly if the application is x86 than if it is x64

4819185
quicksort	mergesort
from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm

im having a problem on a spring based webapp that is being deployed to websphere and interacts with ibm mq

4819188
jsf	seam
i have no idea about the seam part it might have different approaches for this but in standard jsf you normally define it as in faces-config.xml

4819202
min	max	range	max	range	min
a good approximation so that you don t have to iterate over each and every vertex is using the objects bounding spheres and positions add subract the bounding sphere radius to it s position to get min max range

4819212
integer	fractions
you have to store them in some sort of fractions class with two integer fields

4819263

4819486
maven	pom.xml
i have multiple maven projects with their individual pom.xml s an a parent pom.xml

4819496
children	parent
the problem is that you are attempting to insert a parent and its children in one operation

4819564
jsf	seam
so the advantage of using seam + validator seam will transform that component in the background to a jsf validator so you do no longer need jsf validator tags or any other configuration in faces-config.xml

4819600
put	get
when we google search we get links in return i am trying to put my extension icon after each link like wot extension has done

4819663
vsto	add-in
to deploy a vsto add-in for office 2007 for all users you have two options

4819665
hide	show
within each fragment transaction you can specify in and out animations that will be used for show and hide respectively or both when replace is used

4819665
hide	show
to achieve the same thing with hiding or showing a fragment you d simply call ft.show or ft.hide passing in the fragment you wish to show or hide respectively

4819685
inherited	properties
it looks to me like you might create a class or classes which inherited from system.eventargs and then define a custom properties to access your custom parameter

mouse and or keyboard anything what you like

4819743
mouse	keyboard
but one could created custom profiles too assigning any mouse or keyboard action to any of they physical keys of the phone

4819756
quicksort	mergesort
technically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

4819756
quicksort	mergesort
so it is quite possible to find inputs for which mergesort outperforms quicksort

4819821
int	chars
when you log don t just log the strings log the unicode chars that make up the strings as int

4819821
int	chars
just cast each chars in the string to an int and log it

4819865

your alternative is to wrap the tag in a panel and hide or show that

4820489
hide	show
often you ll find the use of placeholders to show and hide content on pages or in asp.net mvc you might see the use of inline code blocks such as .

4820514
mouseleave	mouseenter
i prefer mouseenter docs and mouseleave docs in this situation as it behaves better when hovering over children

4820514
slideup	slidedown
i then restructured your javascript to use .mask-layer for the hover events and simplified the animation with slideup docs and slidedown docs as follows

translation	localization
all of my forms have localization enabled and are translation into 3 languages

4820519
gmail	hotmail
and you probably already know normal css style tag is not working in webmail like gmail and hotmail

4820520
hide	show
first of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls unless you need new data

4820520
hide	show
second any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control s id class name or whatever css selector

4820520
post	get
moreover using a javascript post get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback

4820536
post	get
focus on simple html forms and use post get cookies files and server variables that rapache provides and then manipulate inputs within r script

4820578

width	height
the obvious solution to this is to simply set the width height property manually with the pixel measurements of my background image but this seems too naive

4820806
width	height
how i get uploaded image height and width for display in it s original size

4820859
post	get
so i need get data no from post db table bu from users

4820887
put	get
bdb offers bulk get put apis

4820894
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show radcombobox depending on the result

4820917
mouse	keyboard
the user activity can be tested by listening on javascript keyboard keyup and mouse click events

4820921
setinterval	settimeout
you could use javascript s settimeout or setinterval to do this or look into jquery s timers

4820945
width	height
newwidth width newheight height

4820982
inherited	properties
i want the plugins themselves to be as simple as possible to write so i want them all to inherited some basic methods and properties from an action class

4821024
width	height
you can bind width and height to pixelwidth and pixelheight of the imagesource for imagebrush like this

4821082
portrait	landscape
i ve got an activity which should have two rather different layouts depending on whether the user holds it in landscape or portrait mode

4821082
portrait	landscape
i ve got a method to determine if the phone is currently in portrait or landscape mode - if getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay .getwidth is larger than getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay .getheight then it s in landscape

4821082
portrait	landscape
in my portrait layout xml file i have a few image views which are not present in the landscape layout xml file

4821082
portrait	landscape
this all works fine for switching from portrait to landscape but then when switching back into portrait my code that is executed only for portrait mode gives a null pointer exception - it can t find the view elements

4821082
portrait	landscape
the portrait version of the layout file contains these spacers but the landscape version does not

4821082
portrait	landscape
the code all works fine going from portrait to landscape but when going back to portrait i get the nullpointerexception

4821082
portrait	landscape
obviously this landscape layout is working fine - the error occurs when going from portrait to landscape and then back to portrait

4821082
portrait	landscape
it would certainly still be good to get input on this problem - it seems like a very powerful feature of android to be able to have completely different layouts for landscape and portrait

4821091
multiplying	add
when the user types a number ex 6 we shift the existing number left one decimal place ex 0.000 00.00 multiplying the typed number by 0.01 6 0.06 and add that to our existing number 00.00 00.06

4821091
multiplying	add
shift left 00.06 00.60 multiplying the typed number by 0.01 1 0.01 and add 00.60 00.61

4821091
multiplying	subtract
when the user hits the delete button if there is one we take the last number entered ex 1 multiplying it be 0.01 1 0.01 subtract it from our number 0.61 0.6 and then shift our number right one decimal place 0.6 0.06

4821156
put	get
if i put the same date but put it in as a date type 2 i would get

4821156
minimum	max
so for each set of rules there will be a minimum of 3 possible max of 6 for now this could always expand at any time i will basically be entering a starting date.

4821180
jar	war
that way if you later split the modules into several jar war files into separate maven project for example they are already in the correct directory structure to split them by module

4821203
x86	64bit
if it was possible to run them in a 64bit shell i m pretty sure ms would have shipped both x86 and x64 management shells

4821229
width	height
imagebrush isn t best solution for such requirements because it hasn t width height properties and does not present in visualtree it s just a tool for rendering

4821239
apache	nginx
as you get to needing more performance you might use nginx or apache as a reverse proxy serving your static files quickly and something like thin to make your application run faster

4821254
try-catch	exception-handling
well if you need to truely handle the exception-handling then you ll need try-catch blocks in your code where the exception-handling might happen

4821268
public	protected
both public and protected members of are accessible in class

4821274
post	get
very important point to note if i post to the action with no angle brackets i get the form data as expected

4821280
min	max
check if there are non-transparent pixels on the cut line if so remember min max for bounding box

4821309
stdout	stderr
it s not that sneaky bastich bug where java punishes you if you don t manually drain stderr and stdout when making a system call

4821312
setinterval	settimeout
info using setinterval instead of settimeout shouldn t and doesn t change anything

4821362
uiview	calayer
i d suggest looking at the documentation for uiview and calayer youview.layer and include quartzcore framework in your project

4821365
bash	zsh
if that is the case you can also set this into your terminal profile like .bashrc if you use bash or .zshrc if you use zsh etc

4821454
screens	tablet
if you want to design an app for a tablet you should be looking at the screens size

4821536
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream	bytearrayinputstream	audioinputstream	fileinputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	audioinputstream	fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
the inputstream could be backed by a audioinputstream bytearrayinputstream fileinputstream filterinputstream inputstream objectinputstream pipedinputstream sequenceinputstream stringbufferinputstream or any other kind of inputstream

maven	m2e
new maven project_ wizard i assume you have m2e installed

4821585
draggable	droppable
using jquery ui i have a div foo which is both draggable and droppable and a div bar which is only droppable

4821585
draggable	droppable
i just said foo and bar and draggable and droppable so many times that even i m confused but this example should clear things up

4821592
restrict	shared
the network and cpus are shared io is restrict you can t use all resources

4821656
calloc	malloc
personally i would use calloc rather than malloc so that your new nodes have zeroed contents

4821715
google-chrome	safari
you could probably achieve it using css3 webkit animations but the trade off is it will only work in the likes of google-chrome and safari but you won t require any javascript at all

4821744
median	max	min	median	min	max	range	median	range	max	range	min
basically you need to get the range of data min and max possible needed index values subdivide into segments let s say 100 segments and then determine a value for each segment by some algorithm average value median value etc.

4821782
google-chrome	safari
in general you shouldn t need to do this with modern browsers ff3.6 google-chrome ie9 safari

4821814
width	height
and how can i access image s size height width

4821877
filtering	grouping
i d also want to be able to create a query so that we can filtering on that grouping as well

4821978
ubuntu	debian
i use php 5.3 php-fpm on ubuntu debian

4822017
width	height
the image will render in its natural size if the img tag has no width and height attribute and the css does not define style width and height for it

4822026
int	double
adding an index to the format it would be int double double

4822051
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show radcombobox

4822096
ubuntu	linux
i completely switched over to ubuntu linux

4822144
textview	listactivity
when i scroll down to view the rest of the listactivity in my current tab i want the textview above the tab to scroll out of sight

4822226
fgets	fread
the best way to do this is use fread and fgets to read line by line this is extreamly fast as only one line is read at one time and not the while file

4822260
geocoding	geocode
from apple s developer docs each map kit application has a limited amount of reverse geocoding capacity so it is to your advantage to use reverse geocode requests sparingly.

4822292
versioning	upgrade
the database was created by or upgrade by versioning 10.5

4822340
folder	directory
the .git folder is only stored in the root directory of the repo not all the sub-directories like subversion

4822350
cvs	svn
unlike other source control systems like svn or cvs git stores all of its metadata in a single directory rather than in every subdirectory of the project

4822355
updatepanel	scriptmanager
leaving the updatepanel in i have used the debugger to ensure that the script is indeed registered with the scriptmanager both immediately after the call to registerstartupscript in the web application project and in the onprerender method of the page in the main project

4822372
portrait	landscape
ideally i want the new viewcontroller that i m pushing onto the stack to start off initially in portrait not landscape

4822372
portrait	landscape
my only guess is that apple doesn t want a user transitioning from landscape to portrait despite allowing us to go from landscape back to a previous controller that is in portrait

4822418
equals	tostring
the implementation of hashcode equals and tostring

4822418
equals	tostring
equals and tostring delegate to guava again whereas equals uses pattern matching

4822449
serializable	deserialization
i am using gson to handle json serializable deserialization

4822450
submit	submission
each form submission should return a value asynchronously so that they could submit just two of the tests and then see the return values of the tests without refreshing the page

4822498
updatepanel	scriptmanager
registers a startup script block for a control that is inside an updatepanel by using the scriptmanager control and adds the script block to the page

4822564
min	max
even more how do i set bounds of max and min scaling

4822574
accessor	properties
the problem is probably that you are using the properties accessor for the initial setting of the arrays in -viewdidload

4822574
accessor	properties
since well-implemented properties accessor will retain the object you are getting 1 retain from the +alloc and another retain from assigning it

4822600
width	height
chrome you can can drag and drop onto a file upload so you can do drag and drop but you have to fake it by hiding the form via opacity 0 but make it large via a wrapping div and a width 100 and height 100

4822600
google-chrome	safari
safari is the same as google-chrome except you can only do one file at a time more on this at the link above at the end of the post thecssninja link

4822620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
again firefox is fast at doing this but google-chrome safari are way too slow

4822636
post	get
but now for every post again let s assume thousands millions whatever... i have to first query for a list of id s and then again to get each post s content

4822660
tinyint	varchar
at the moment the column type is tinyint but i need to convert this to a varchar since it now needs to store a

4822672
typedef	typename
even if it does exist you still have to typedef typename base size_type size_type

4822675
put	get
20 000 get requests 2 000 put

4822688
tinyint	varchar
others could give you a headache but tinyint to varchar s pretty straight-up.

4822730
vmware	virtualbox	rtos	ecos
a do-it-your-self solution is possible using virtualisation you could for example use the free virtualbox vmware server or virtual pc and run a free or open source rtos such as ecos in the vm

int	boolean
they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean flags

4822883
google-chrome	safari
in safari 4 and google-chrome 8 it returns 6

4822907
apache	nginx
nginx will still proxy the request because it s not your media path and then apache will deliver the file back to nginx

4822953
getter	setter
in javascript there is the possibility to create getter and setter the following way

4822953
getter	setter
to pass values from the a -field of a b -object to the a -field of a a -object i need to get the setter getter function before overriding them

4822958
int	chars
main int argc 1 const chars argv 0x003e63e8 line 115 + 0xa5 bytes c++

4822968
udp	tcp
we will be sending unicast and multicast udp tcp and broadcast ip traffic through the devices

4822968
subnet	packets
our devices then act like simple passthrough routers and have two interfaces one on the 10.0.0.0 24 subnet one on the 10.0.1.0 24 subnet which they just forward packets back and forth from

4822968
udp	tcp
packet injection is probably feasible for udp and broadcast ip but very likely not so for tcp

4823015
google-chrome	firefox
it fires in firefox and i haven t checked google-chrome

4823015
google-chrome	firefox
you will notice that ie does not trigger the change event while firefox and google-chrome does

4823042
queue	fifo
if the incidents should be in lifo or fifo order consider queue and stacks

4823064
union	distinct
however if you re certain the data from the top and bottom queries will not overlap use union all where union attempts to make the results distinct making the engine do additional work which can be considerable if there are a lot of records

4823154
int	chars
i m attempting to write a structure consisting of a an array of chars an int value and a pointer to a pipe

jruby	rubinius
and if you want to use an alternative implementation of ruby try out jruby or rubinius once these runtimes implement full 1.9.2 compatibility both are currently fully 1.8.7-compatible and working on 1.9.2 compatiblity

4823204
jruby	rubinius
both of these alternative runtimes are better equipped to provide extraordinarily better performance jruby can take advantage of the hotspot jvm and rubinius can take advantage of llvm

4823204
thin	unicorn	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
additionally ree is best when used with phusion passenger but there are new ways of deploying rails apps nginx in front of thin or unicorn that provide strong benefits and which do not make use of phusion passenger

4823209
free	malloc
it is important to maintain the original pointer returned by malloc so that you can free it later

4823217
textview	imageview
i need a layout for a list row which contains two imageview and one textview in the middle

4823222
inherited	subclassing
they cannot be instantiated directly and a subclassing of an abstract-class can only be instantiated directly if all inherited pure virtual methods have been implemented by that class or a parent class

4823224
chown	sudo
if that still doesn t do it try the bit up at the top about sudo chown -r root wheel library startupitems mysqlcom

4823244
int	chars
the problem here is twofold - a you increment the pointer before you check the value read in and b you ignore the fact that fgetc returns an int instead of a chars

4823264
gdi	directdraw
so cross-platform here means using gdi though some older directdraw apis might work in that case you have a much easier time with hardware overlays and better performance

4823284
tablet	galaxy
afaik tablet like the galaxy of samsung have large sizes

4823304
google-chrome	safari
visit any video with an html5-capable browser works with at least safari google-chrome and ie9 and choose to switch to html5 player.

4823360
getter	setter
getter and setter do not count for a behaviour.

4823363
width	height
you can do this by calculating and adding to your view s center point the offset based on the difference between the initial and final anchorpoints multiplied by your view s width height or you could set the view s center to the initial touch point

4823386
opera	firefox
works perfectly on opera firefox webkit browsers

4823487
int	double
accept at least int double string parameters

4823488
rss	feed
i am developing a website that will display the most recent item from a rss feed

this will make the page display much quicker since i plan on caching 50+ rss feed

4823544
unixodbc	iodbc
linux driver managers unixodbc and iodbc are the free ones both use the same configuration files odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini or .odbc.ini and .odbcinst.ini in your home directory

4823566
google-chrome	firefox
he has a drupal based website which is working perfectly in firefox google-chrome

4823582
filesystems	fat
on the other hand i don t know if filesystems that do not offer security at all fat would be so concerned to give you the content of the clusters that they happened to allocate for the new part of the file

4823632
chown	chmod
edit you will want to use the chmod shell command to grant read write permissions on the directory to other unless you don t want to let anyone write there just www-data in which case you ll need to use chown as well

4823639
google-chrome	firefox
to check this use a dom inspector firebug in firefox or the dev tools in ie8 or google-chrome to see where the element containing the lightbox is it s usually at the end of the page

4823651
rvm	bundler
people seem to be addressing issues as they come up ie bundler rspec2 rails3 rvm

4823654
opera	firefox
however when the very same construct is used from the target url firefox and opera keep refreshing the page every 3 seconds making http requests to the server regardless of the fact that the url for redirect has already been reached

4823666
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
if you want to scan a hexadecimal short integer you need to use hx but this also means you need to provide the address of an unsigned short rather than a plain short

4823694
wordpress	joomla
next plenty of pro sites use joomla wordpress and drupal

4823697
strlen	memmove
you might consider a combination of strlen and memmove instead

4823709
getter	setter
this is why for example chains of degenerate getter and setter in java beans don t actually translate to huge heaping piles of wasted register space at runtime

4823713

4823956
std	ostream
your compiler is being nice to you one is the built-in std ostream overload that looks like this

4823956
std	ostream
with the first candidate the first argument requires a derived-to-base conversion the std ofstream needs to be converted to a std ostream for the function to be called

4823956
int	double
the second argument requires the use of the built-in double to int conversion then the use of your converting constructor to convert from int to base

4824023
google-chrome	firefox
at all of these companies we develop and debug using firefox and google-chrome and then tackle ie compatibility issues later as an afterthought on a severity basis functionality first then display correctness or aesthetics second

4824054
uilabel	nsstring
note that it can be a simpler variant of the method to really populate the data - instead of actually resizing a uilabel in a cell for example it can just use the nsstring height methods to determine how tall the uilabel would be in the final cell and then use the total cell height plus a border on the bottom and uilabel placement to determine the real height

4824101
post	get
there is no other change other than using post versus get method

4824133
mouse	keyboard
when you get this event your application has been activated by the user either mouse click or keyboard focus switched to it

4824186
inherited	subclassing
but as image is a subclassing of bmp shouldnt it inherited the functions in bmp

4824200
width	height
i want the image to scale so the width fills the screen and the height adjust proportionally

4824200
width	height
what is happening is the image is scaling down so the height fills the list row but there is plenty of room for the width to be bigger

4824221
public	protected
it needs to be protected or public for the image class to be able to access it and it needs to be also virtual if you want to be able to override it in the image class

4824222
post	get

width	height
#nivo-slider is supposed to have a height and width specified you re applying dimentions to its parent container #nivo-slider-wrapper

4824355
free	malloc
space reserved using malloc will not be reallocated or reused until it is explicitly released by calling free

4824368
google-chrome	firefox
good thing i have managed the users switch to firefox or google-chrome

4824372
free	malloc
the danger here is that you have to deallocate free everything you allocated using malloc and if you forget you create a memory leak

4824378
put	get
when i put a url as a parameter i could use this api to get page form s all contents

4824378
put	get
then how could i get the elements value and put them to a mapping as the key-value module

4824388

chunked	transfer-encoding
if the client sends a message with transfer-encoding chunked you will need to parse the somewhat complicated chunked transfer encoding syntax

4824748
for-loop	arrays
first of all while the arguments object available within a function is not an arrays it is array-like enough such that an incremental for-loop is preferable - not only because it runs faster but also because it avoids other pitfalls - one of which is exactly what you re falling into

4824748
inherited	properties
first let s focus on all - by which i mean to say not just properties of the object itself but also potentially properties said object has inherited from its prototype or its prototype s prototype or so on

prepare	execute
in languages such as esql c you prepare the execute procedure statement then declare a cursor for it followed by open fetch in a loop and close

4825385
prepare	execute
the analogous operations should work in jdbc and java too - with the possible difference that you may not need to separate the prepare and execute phases

4825452
intersect	contains
so the result would contains the data integers corresponding to the intersect integers

4825525

then the remaining interface methods have to be implements by the concrete class that extends the abstract class

4825911
super	implements
since you are just inheriting what s being implements in super class uiviewcontroller if you don t call super methods then implementation that needs to be done is not done

4825911
super	implements
if i am correct it seems like super loadview implements something very critical to avoid the loop

4825940
hide	show
my script for hide and show

4825966
multiplying	add
those two methods already use two different objects to synchronize on so you already can call and execute add and multiplying at the same time from different threads

further it tells me that i do not need to define a corresponding properties in the implementation object but that i will have to write custom accessor setter methods

4826013
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp + hudson codeigniter env

4826026
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will work but it seems better practice to use .each if for no other reason just because you don t have to hard-code the values -- if you use for then if you ever change the number of properties you ll have to go update that loops too

4826031
implements	extends
arraylist extends abstractlist and implements list cloneable serializable

4826032
switching	screens
it allows you to switching between threads and by having the call stack and locals visible on the screens you should then start to get a feeling for where you are

4826047

4826421
opera	safari
however ie opera have not implemented it and safari have partial support for this

my understanding is that the google-chrome and firefox are only two browsers today to have support for the drag drop file to web browsers feature

4826423
next	except
next the grep is trying to throw away all the other lines except the ones that start with free shipping so its output should be like

int	double
math.sqrt returns a double but in your first class method you re trying to return this directly from a method that returns int

4826589
int	double
type mismatch cannot convert from double to int

4826589
int	double
by the way a square root of an int can be double so by having a return type int you are truncating possibly important information

floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
in ieee standard binary floating-point format actually representing numbers by scientific notation i know that an integer value of one is always assumed to be added to the fractions part illustrated by the significand part of the binary and is not included in the binary so what confuses me is how to how to distinguish between 1 and zero floating-point values because i assume both have a totally zero significand and i guess the differentiation here should be done by exponent part but don t know how

4827195
ftp	telnet
ftp passwd telnet etc

4829857
put	get
take for instance the s3 client it gives you the ability to put get list objects etc

4829912
persistent	transient
because onsaveinstancestate is not always called you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity not to store persistent data

4829912
onresume	onpause
basically any persistant data should be written out in your onpause method and read back in onresume

4829933

mouseup	mousedown
in wpf most controls have mouseup and mousedown events and the mouse-button-specific variations but not a simple click event that can be used right away

4830164
mouseup	mousedown
the obvious problem is that you cannot simply omit the mousedown event because if your click is started on another control and it is released over the control that only handles mouseup your supposed click will fire while it really should not both mouseup and mousedown should occur over the same control

4830220
width	height
with this particular version of the method you can send in the array of colors you get with getpixels and set an offset and the width and height that you want to copy

setinterval	settimeout
the simplest way to produce asynchronous non-blocking code is using settimeout i strongly discourage using setinterval as others have suggested but there is no performance benefit to doing so

4831569

the ideal solution would be if i could simply write to two different std ostream objects

4831634
rsa	aes
in our installer created by vs2008 we re encrypting our connection string with aes key and iv and then creating a rsa key-pair and storing them in machinekeystore

4831634
rsa	aes
the installer will use the rsa public key to encrypt the aes key and iv and store the encrpted key and iv with the encrypted connection string

4831634
rsa	aes
after installation our application will read the encrypted connection string with the encrypted aes key and iv back and use the rsa private key from machinekeystore to decrypt the aes key and iv and then decrypt the connection string with the aes key and iv

4831634
rsa	aes
the encryption in the installer works with aes and rsa public key

4831634
rsa	aes
doing the same thing with aes and rsa encryption for the connection string within our application without the installer involved works fine

screens	tablet
i m creating a drawing app for tablet and am interested in how to best handle the drawing canvas relating to screens orientation changes

4831824
portrait	landscape
the issue relates to the different size of x y in portrait landscape modes

4831824
portrait	landscape
if a user has a canvas that fills the screen minus notification and title bars and in portrait mode draws near the bottom of the canvas say at point 140 460 on a 320x480 screen when the screen gets flipped to landscape and recreated from the x y vectors that i ve stored the point at 140 460 is now out of the bounds of the screen because the screen is now 480x320

4831824
portrait	landscape
likewise if they draw points in landscape near the right-hand edge of the screen and flip back to portrait those points will be out of bounds

4831824
screens	tablet
as i m designing this for a tablet i d like to give the user the flexibility to draw as they like yet maintain some sanity when it comes to the screens bounds etc

4831824
portrait	landscape
i thought about the possibility of hiding the title bar showing notification allowing orientation change and then if the screen is rotated to landscape rotating the canvas back to portrait but when the navigation bar moves from what would have been the top in portrait to the right-hand side in landscape i still get the same x y bounding issues just to a much smaller degree the width of the notification bar effectively

4831827
width	margin
if the negative margin is working you can get the centering back by adding a wrapper div with a fixed width and margin 0 auto

4831827
width	margin
in my testing the negative margin didn t change the width of the box

4831827
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
update instead of negative margins you can probably use box-sizing border-box so that the border doesn t add to the element s width in the first place

i figured that i could calculate the md5 hash values of the client-side and server-side and see if they re the same but what s happening is i use my application to decompress a zip file and then without changing any of the underlying files i use my application to re-compress it but the old and new zip files have different md5 hash

also on the page will be a form with 3 options listed with a checkbox by each option and a button at the bottom of the form that says print.

button	checkbox
so i need a form that will have a checkbox for each of the 3 letters a submit button that prints the entire page upon clicking and for the form to apply a class to each of the selected letter s div when the print button is clicked so the print.css will only print the divs that have this class applied to it

first of all nowadays i recommend using an atom feed instead of rss

4832591
rss	feed
the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it

4832591

i compared the memebers of delegation and multicastdelegate classes in object browser and i couldn t find any new additional member present in multicastdelegate

multicastdelegate	delegation
basically the split of delegation and multicastdelegate is for historical reasons

4833071

sadly you need to be aware of both of these classes because even though all delegation types you create have multicastdelegate as a base class you ll occasionally manipulate your delegation types by using methods defined by the delegation class instead of the multicastdelegate class

4834226
mouse	keyboard
the example only shows how to retrieve keyboard input events but it wasn t that difficult to change it to listen for mouse move events instead

4834231
hash	salt
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

4834286
division	multiplication
i know the loop is clumsy but my mind s gone blank and i can t rephrase it so that everything fits neatly into it but you should get the general idea which is basically perform the multiplication bit by bit while you re doing the division

4834761
post	get
but i discoved today mvc assumes a get to be a post if a page request a get from itself

4834763
apache	nginx
if you do not require the performance of nginx then you may find a pragmatic solution is to just use apache

4834963
profiling	instrumentation
instrumenting profiling put a lot of overhead into each function call and if all you want is an overall speed difference it won t be accurate because you re partly measuring the cost of the instrumentation itself

4834963
profiling	instrumentation
a wall-clock-time stack-sampling profiling not instrumentation that reports line-level percent is your best bet

4834969
equals	gethashcode
not that it is relevant to the posed problem do read up on overriding equals you need to override gethashcode too and check for error cases like null type-mismatch

4834977

# function to summarize with logic mean if max min 1.5 else median

4835202
median	max	min	median	min	max
summarize - function x ifelse max x min x 1.5 mean x median x

4835202
min	max
note that if the summarize function were to just return min or max there is no error though there is the warning message about no non-missing arguments. thank you for any suggestion

4835309
fink	macports
it s somewhat of an aside but i strongly recommend setting up a separate perl on the machine -- either by fink macports or from source -- and leaving the mac s system perl and its libraries alone

4835353
put	get
this still leaves open the question of where to put this code since if you put it in textfielddidbeginediting you might get an infinite loop

4835381
post	get
sorry i can t post a full working example but this should be enough to get you started

4835427

haskell	ocaml
there are other functional languages out there like scala haskell ocaml etc but they seem to be more of academic languages

you can get more subtle cases with int vs unsigned int rather than int vs chars

4838079
postgresql	mysql

4838550
int	double
i meant the reference type int and double

4838568
int	double
you could do something like that but you would have to pass int and double as strings to another argument perhaps a constructor that would instantiate the type variables you are looking for

4838578
int	double
if you replace int by integer.class and double by double.class it will work just fine

4838583
int	double
you will need to assign to a supertype of double or int to get this to work

4838606

4838926
accessor	properties
usually you want the accessor generated by synthesize to handle the retain release when the properties is set to a new value

4838926
getter	setter
you can then use synthesize to generate the default getter and setter

4838926
getter	setter
if you do not use the self.myiblabel notation you are bipassing the getter and setter and working with the ivar directly

4838959
onresize	onload
with plain javascript you can control when the code runs for example onload or onresize

4839008

jquery	anythingslider
this method is used my jquery anythingslider

4839221
rss	feed
yes it would be possible to make charts from an rss feed but it really depends on the data you re trying to graph

4839221
rss	feed
there may be a public api for obtaining this data rather than using an rss feed

4839222

i m trying to use jquery to show hide div tags based on the selected index of a drop down menu however it isn t working

4839268

4839516
inherited	properties
you could get around this by checking to see if each properties name refers to a properties that wasn t inherited from the prototype using the hasownproperty function but again this would be much less efficient than

4839618

if working for vista or greater and just want to grab very basic information via checkbox radio button etc then have a look at this vista_taskdialog_wrapper and vgtaskdialog

4839726
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

4839731
fflush	gets
this is because the exception occurs when the session gets fflush

4839731
fflush	gets
and perhaps it gets fflush when the transaction is committed - by the spring proxy

4839781
put	get
only difference is that the engine of chrome os is put directly onto the hardware allowing the webpage to get a better performance because it has only one abstraction layer to the hardware instead of 3 or 4

4839812
put	get	post	get	post	put
in our case this one matches get word - this header could use get post put or delete words

4839843
getter	setter
further some feel that encapsulating the fields with getter and setter is a good idea but again it would greatly expand the code length

4839857
button	checkbox
many of the standard ui items radio button button checkbox etc will have a different look than the ui builder will show

4839869

4839897
uiview	subviews
have a uiview in the nib file and add remove the viewcontroller s views as subviews as they are needed

4839897
uiview	subviews
have a uiview in the nib file as an iboutlet and replace the uiview with the viewcontroller s view so that they are subviews of the mytabbarcontroller s view directly

4839897
uiview	subviews
don t have a uiview in the nib and programmatically set the frame of the viewcontrollers as they are added so they are subviews of the mytabbarcontroller s view directly

4839916

4839920
metal	opencl
i could have chosen between 5 choices out there opencl cuda firestream close to metal directcompute

4839920

4840051
g++	gcc
my problem is that after gcc compiles the code with no errors g++ starts to complain it can not find one of my class definitions more details below

4840051
g++	gcc
as you can see gcc compiles my code fine but when g++ does its thing it fails to find the definition of my mesh constructor which i define in my header file

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
if you re talking about clicking a link it is probably because there isn t a default behavior to prevent for mousedown and mouseup

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
the default behavior of clicking a link requires a combination of mousedown plus mouseup on the link

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
if you mousedown then drag off the link before you mouseup the link is not followed

4840064
mouseup	mousedown
only when you mousedown then mouseup is the default behavior activated

this means that whenever it processes an event such as selecting an item in a select list it does an http post back to the server to get the new html

4840502
lisp	smalltalk
ruby draws inspiration from smalltalk lisp and perl but there s no reason you d need to know them before learning ruby as a matter of fact it s probably easier to learn than the former two and learning perl will probably teach you some habits you ll need to unlearn to write idiomatic ruby

4840529
slideup	slidedown
you can then call slidedown on all the reportdivs as a group before calling slideup on the one you need via its id from the dropdown

4840530
keydown	keyup
keydown is preferred after all because keyup will only be fired after the first key is pressed - and respectively not capture the first key typed in my search field

4840595
inherited	properties
i ve noticed that the pathitem inherited the position properties from pageitem and position

4840598
lisp	scheme
for a background into the basis for a lot of this stuff you would be well advised to start looking into impmenting continuations and other techniques pioneered in lisp scheme

4840598
lisp	scheme
as it happens lisp scheme are the perfect languages for writing dsl s and other languages in and if you haven t already merely learning them will improve your programming in exactly the areas you are looking for right now

4840625
getter	setter
if you want instances of the foo interface to implement a variable then the interface should define getter and setter methods and these methods should be implemented in an implementing class for example to hold the corresponding state in a private instance variable declared by the class

note that the md5sum and md5 utilities have a command-line option that can verify all the md5 hash listed in an md5sum file automatically

4840841
versioning	upgrade
if it even happens at all what it means for you is in 1-5 years when you upgrade to a new versioning of twisted you ll get a couple of deprecation warnings change some import lines in your code from from nevow.page import ..

4840844
post	get
basically i developed a script which access the main script using multi-curl get request to generates some random tempid for each 500 records and finally makes another multi-curl request using post with all the generated tempids

4840891
hide	show
my problem is when i want to hide or show these list items

4840891
hide	show
i have two buttons that simply call jquery hide or show when clicked

4840891
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
again this runs fast in firefox opera even ie pretty well in safari but in google-chrome it can take over 30 seconds which brings up the dialog window asking if you want to kill the page because a script is running to long

4840897
width	height
but if the new video s size is larger than the preset width and height it won t automatically fit to the video screen i tried everything i can think of and read up but to no avail

width	height
play with the width height and the last two values of background

4840999
width	height
essentially you would use div elements defined with the height and width that you desire for the image

4841001
children	parent
looks like this has nothing to do with jquery and just is a problem with chrome hiding an parent element that has a huge number of children elements

4841019
put	get
the reason i put it that way is to avoid key collisions that would ruin my data and more importantly so i can do a quick asort and get my results in order

4841104
hide	show
and it show and hide instantly

4841126
waitpid	fork
also this is just an example a test to see why it does not work i call fork twice once for both commands and waitpid because i have nothing else to do

4841134
superclass	subclassing
i m working on modifying part of an existing rails app to use the class-table-inheritance gem all s well except that i have defined some instance methods in my superclass -- person which all subclassing need to be able to access

4841134
inherited	subclassing
since the cti gem doesn t actually use ruby inherited all subclassing still inherited from activerecord base and the gem does some funky voodoo to link the activerecord fields together i can t access these methods in the subclassing i ve created

4841135
post	get
i realize the query should be get not post but i m pretty sure that s not the problem

caanimation	catransition
caanimation which catransition is a subclass of has the delegate method animationdidstop finished which you can use

4841206
vbscript	vb6
escaping quotes in vb6 or vbscript strings is simple in theory although often frightening when viewed

4841222
temp	tmp
if the tmp alias is recognized as a temp buffer of the preliminary query as defined by the outer from clause i might have something that will work.

4841255
printf	strncpy
while strncpy can be dangerous in the hands of someone not used to it it can be quicker in terms of execution time compared to a printf printf printf style solution since there is none of the overhead of dealing with the formatting strings

4841378
put	get
i downloaded the 2 certificates from my friend s account on the dev center and put them in my keychain along with the general apple certificate but i still get the same error

4841440
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
does similar for subtraction multiplication and division

4841610
google-chrome	firefox
ie has a js debugger built-in as of ie8 i think firebug is probably the way to go in firefox and i m pretty sure google-chrome also has a built-in debugger

4841618
google-chrome	firefox
you can use firebug under firefox or the google-chrome inspector right click on the page and inspect... under google-chrome

4841625
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer has a javascript debugger built in hit f12 google-chrome has one built in too but there is also a firebug lite that should work if you like firebug for firefox

4841719
zlib	libpng
whit this information i looked on the include files of the libraries dependencies of poppler like zlib libpng cairo ... and i found in various cases that they don t have a preprocessor directive to especify the static version of the lib

4841725
nginx	lighttpd
i just stumbled on this question and it seems that http.sys does in fact use io completion ports which should provide nearly all of the same benifits that evented io node.js nginx lighttpd c10k etc... have

4841737
google-chrome	safari
it works in google-chrome and safari but in ie the new elements of the are appearing behind the place of the previously showed s

4841741
integer	fractions
by default in python 2 the operator performs integer division when using integer operands which discards fractions parts of the result

4841759
width	height
make sure you specify the size height or width of the container ie tends to flow its content opposed to overwrite positions

4841766
multiplying	division
alternatively you can force floating point division by specifying a decimal or by multiplying by 1.0

4841795
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine and adjust the list window according to the longest option s text

4841806
umbraco	dotnetnuke
i also had good result with umbraco cms it s a bit more lean than dotnetnuke but not as user friendly and definitely not as popular

4841844
daemon	cron
run it from the command-line either as a daemon or as a cron job

4841910
hide	show
additionally you can achieve the show hide effect by following following code

4841939
width	height
that will help you see what different things margins padding height and width do

4842010
disk	ram
it could be achieved though by creating a ram disk

4842010
disk	ram
have a look at this link linux ram disk creating a filesystem in ram

4842030
width	height
as you will see you just have to set up the height and width to half the border-radius

4842075
implements	extends
it also means that you can have them in separate namespaces and that a given type can extends both 1 of them without any nameclash because they are namespaced in opposition to java where a single class can t implements two interfaces with homonymous methods

4842121
avassetwriter	avassetreader
i am using avassetreader and avassetwriter to transcode video from one file to another

4842121

4842143
post	get
in the receiving script unseralize the post data to get back the object

4842205
inherited	properties
the same settings work for all the other dlls in the project cli and c++ and they inherited the same properties

4842228
mvp	presenter
which at least partly breaks separation of the view and the presenter if you re trying to work with the mvp pattern

4842228
mvp	presenter
now if you wanted to delegate all logic to a presenter class again in an mvp setting you would manually have to forward events such as a button click from your view to the presenter

4842230
dictionary	map
map the database dictionary tables and read the required data from them

4842253
disk	ram
when a process tries to access memory that isn t currently mapped into ram the mmu signals the cpu that a fault has occurred and the cpu suspends the process to load the requested memory page from disk

4842258
put	get
you do have a 3rd option that will no doubt get me some burning commentary and that s to put the contentprovider 1 in an apk all of it s own

4842269
rational-numbers	floating-point
python does not represent rational-numbers with a built-in type - just integers and floating-point numbers

4842301
getter	setter
and getter and setter

4842308
put	get
also compile with the -o3 flags whenever you don t all those people who put a lot of hours into making ghc super-fast get big ol puppy eyes at you

4842348
cvs	svn
svn or some other source code repository git mercurial cvs etc helps you keep a history of the changes you have been making and allows you to wind things back to an earlier state if you make a big mistake

4842350
tostring	string.format
you can use it with either string.format or the overloaded tostring method for a numeric type

4842361
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
mr.developer lets you pull in dependencies eggs or otherwise from mercurial repositories as well as git bazaar darcs subversion and even cvs repositories

4842368
google-chrome	firefox
this happened to me in ie8 only while in google-chrome and firefox it was fine

4842368
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it seems to be working as expected button click causes current time to display in the user control nothing else happens but in ie8 the div inside the user control loses its styles background color borders

4842388
mouse	keyboard
you still need to redirect keyboard and mouse input events to your subclass

4842390
button	checkbox
worth mentioning is that i had a custom layout on my list items there is an icon a title a description and then the checkbox or radio button depending on if it s a single or multiple choice list

4842390
button	checkbox
that you will automatically get checkbox if you set the android choicemode attribute to multiplechoice and radio button if you set it to singlechoice provided you use the above implementation

4842396
cvs	svn
i ve only used cvs and svn from these two i d say definitely go with svn

4842431
int	chars
to fix this try typecasting the chars to int befor printing them out

4842453
printf	getchar
it may perform direct serial output or it may be more sophisticated and provide library retargetting code such that standard i o library calls such as printf and getchar will work over the serial port

4842474
public	protected
but this order may be disrupted at any place where the access-specifiers private protected public are encountered

4842474

google-chrome	firefox
when i m using firefox google-chrome it works fine but when i m using ie the position is not registered while i m on the dragging time

4842494
client-side	server-side
this splits my client-side logic from server-side but easier in the long run over trying to inject js from the server-side logic

4842516
post	get
the only problem with that is that i have no idea how to authenticate using oauth if anyone could shine some light on this matter post a code snippit of how i can get all of the followers pics or maybe even point me to some useful tutorials or resources that would be a great help

4842537
children	parent
if i have a grandfather object that contains an array of parent objects that contains an array of children objects

4842545
children	parent
simply call release on the grandfather object - it ll then release the parent objects who will release the children objects etc

4842577
web2py	tipfy	django	web2py
have a look to web2py authorization django auth or tipfy acl extension for some pretty neat solutions

4842581

intercepting and re-creating mouse and keyboard actions is entirely different

4842608
subtract	add
i am trying to add and subtract values when the user clicks on the radio button

4842624
base	fractions
example for base 2 with 8 bit fractions and 8 bit exponent

4842624
base	fractions
in order to understand this better try to experiment with different base and sizes for fractions and exponential part

4842624
base	fractions
once you grasp how this representation works you should be able to write code to obtain representation of any number in any base fractions exponential part combination

4842632
windows	wow64
and 32-bit applications run on 64-bit versions of windows in the windows-on-windows wow64 subsystem

4842661
lisp	scheme
copying generator states might be a bit easier in a language with first-class continuations like scheme but if all generators follow some predefined structure abstracting it away with a define-generator macro or some such should be possible in common lisp as well

4842681
maven	pom.xml
if your project is maven based you can either add update the application name in pom.xml found in project files folder or go to file project properties and add update the application name

4842682

4842870
post	get
when i try to post i get the

4842883
int	boolean
the only left place to use arrays is for primitive data types int boolean etc.

4842939
highcharts	raphael
i have been quite impressed with highcharts theme default and raphael but neither of those have implemented annotated news headlines by default so it would require a lot of work to get it done

4842954
post	put
i can work out how to send a response if i was the server but how can i generate a response header and use my idhttp1 client to post or put send etc just the header

4842959
realloc	malloc
you can try growing one with realloc 3 but it can fail and the original must be allocated with malloc 3 in the first place

4842976
terminate	timeout
an integer timeout value means that the supervisor will tell the child process to terminate by calling exit child shutdown and then wait for an exit signal with reason shutdown back from the child process

4843005
hide	show
is it possible that when user clicks on button it show or hide content

4843057
post	get
consider to switch from get to post since that action changes the state of your data

4843091
hide	show
you can create a custom button add inside it a uilable or uiimage and hide show and animate it as you wish

4843131
setinterval	settimeout
i ve read that there s some sort of problem with setinterval and objects so probably there s one with settimeout as well

4843134
mkmapview	mkannotationview
in the viewforannotation delegate method of mkmapview you provide an mkannotationview for your annotations

4843183
spaces	delimiter
assuming that spaces is delimiter

4843183
spaces	delimiter
if the values are delimiter by several spaces an or in unconsistent way you can match delimiter with regular expression

4843211
int	chars
chars short int long enum

4843214
versioning	upgrade
people can either download the lite versioning and then upgrade to pro through in-app purchase or they can immediately buy the pro versioning from the app store

4843214
versioning	upgrade
i was thinking of implementing a bool flag in the standarduserdefaults which when set to yes unlocks the upgrade this is for the lite versioning

4843221
mouseup	mousedown
use the mousedown and mouseup events to change the background back and forth

4843238
mouseup	mousedown
alternatively u could use the mousedown and mouseup events but that method is not very flexible if you want to change something else

4843252
int	boolean
if you want to be compatible with versions lower than 2.5 you can exploit the fact that boolean are subclasses from int and that true behaves like 1 whereas false behaves like 0

4843253
dictionary	map
looking at the json string you posted response.groups.items looks to be an array containing one item a map dictionary containing one key categories. logging it out to a string is going to traverse the whole tree but to access it programmatically you have to walk the tree yourself

4843311
pow	math.h
there s no operator for power you ll need to use pow function from math.h or some other similar function

4843333
put	get
i think if i change the value of the â pythonpathâ define i ll get a python interpreter seeking his files in a relative directory so i ll just have to build it both for gnu linux and window and to put the both executables on a pen-drive then i ll get a portable python environment

4843349
qobject	qmetaobject
if it is complicated you could use qmetaobject facilities for reverse-engineering qobject at run-time

4843424
implements	extends
from a quick look into the sdk there is an oninfolistener interface which you can implements in a class extends mediaplayer

4843424
int	boolean
that needs you to have public boolean oninfo mediaplayer mp int what int extra implemented

4843444
int	double
note that i also cast the result to int as all pow overloads return double not int

4843465
profiler	yourkit
when i tried to check memory usage of application i used yourkit java profiler for these needs i see that it uses a lot of memory for one session

4843529
cart	oscommerce
i ve messed with oscommerce way back and a little zen cart more recently

4843540
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i think that putting firefox safari google-chrome ie and iphone as the first statements would mean it only goes through all elseifs if the browser is different to those above and otherwise stop executing

4843607
inherited	properties
i ve used single table inherited in the past for modeling complex systems that have related components which share common properties and behavior

4843610
goto	break
goto operator can be used to break multi-level loops

4843610
goto	break
you may jump out of these and a common use is to use a goto in place of a multi-level break

4843641
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i don t know for sure if this is the wrong approach but i would subclass the uitabbarcontroller sooner than the uinavigationcontroller

4843648
goto	break
goto has been in large replaced by specialized statements like continue break try...catch

4843648
goto	break
in the hard cases you can still exorcise the goto in nine out of ten cases you can break the code into smaller routines use try-finally use nested ifs test and retest a status variable or restructure a conditional

4843650
int	chars
because strcmp is slow but an int compare is fast if all your commands are 4 chars long - which happens to fit in a 32bit int - you can cast each string to a 32bit number and then switch based on that

4843721
logmein	hamachi
i have setup logmein hamachi and i can connect to an office machine and see shared resources folders and printers on that machine

4843750
profiler	perf
with the new pricing model where you can license just bc or just the perf profiler dps should be much more accessible than it ever was under compuware stewardship and lofty pricing

4843775
min	max
ideally i d like to have a vertical line as well indicating a max min for each row

4843809
portrait	landscape
when i rotate the screen on my nexus s at least the activity s oncreate gets called when i rotate from portrait to landscape mode

4843809
portrait	landscape
when i rotate from one landscape mode to the other with the top edge raised oncreate gets called twice once for portrait orientation and once for the target landscape mode

4843958
post	get
there do exists solution to those mistakes however but still you should be selective when choosing between post and get

4843966
post	get
1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

4843966
post	get
however before the final decision to use http get or post please also consider considerations for sensitive data and practical considerations

4843966
put	get	post	get	post	put
note that there is not just get and post in the http protocol but a couple of other verbs like put head delete etc as well

4843978
post	get
if the user is logging in to a website that has effects on future requests so it should be a post not a get

4843978
post	get
it s easier to for the user to change query string get values but it s not too difficult for the user to change post values

4843978
post	get
using post for security isn t really a valid reason except for the fact that post variables aren t part of the url and aren t bookmarked while get variables are

4844018
nsstring	nsdata
i m using the encoding decoding methods from this answer to convert my nsstring objects to nsdata objects and vice versa

4844036
prng	random
for random choices for example for next track in a player or next page in the browser a trivial unmodified prng is fine

you ll also want to check out apc memcached for caching

4844689
content-length	content-type
the code there is bare minimum and it looks as if it does not set properly the content-type and content-length of the request

4844689
content-length	content-type
content-length is there so is the content-type and all the other fields

4844693
uiview	calayer

to the best of my knowledge the outputstream is not like a socket it is not directly connected to an inputstream on the server

4844959
awt	swing
i know java has a drawing api awt and swing - but probably no the best for the animation factor - on the other hand there is also flash that has new capabilities within as3 to produce such an effect but if this app was to traverse into mobile development flash wouldn t be a great choice

4844963
consistency	acid
3 b transactions b if you need to make transactions multi-step operations that need to act like they re one step you may have difficulties with many non-relational systems because they tend to sacrifice more than they strictly need to with respect to acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability

4844967
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if so make sure you get the case rightâ you don t want your app to be broken for people who run it from a case-sensitive volume nor do you want it to be broken for people who use the default case-insensitive file-system

4845122
outputstream	inputstream	system.in	system.out
what i need in java are inputstream and outputstream objects connected to these file-descriptors just like system.in system.out and system.error are connected to file-desctiptors 0 1 and 2

4845122

use new fileinputstream dev fd 3 and new fileoutputstream dev fd 4 to get the streams connected to the filedescriptors the paths are for freebsd replace with your operating systems paths

4845164
decoder	encoder
i suggest using as3corelib which is a library full of useful helper classes including a json encoder decoder

4845165
prng	random
assuming that r is a standard seeded prng function if r x is random then r x is also random since it is simply an alternate seed to your prng

4845168
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i m pretty sure this can t be done using pure java -- you ll probably have to use native code to bind a file descriptor to a filedescriptor object or a fileinputstream or fileoutputstream object

4845187
folder	directory
i m writing a small ruby program to list directory differences between two folder locations

4845275

my suggestion would be to use a build system like teamcity or cruisecontrol to pull the latest code from your source control build it and package it up as an msi

4845533
fflush	gets
you can periodically fflush all records under a certain rank say anyone ranking under 100 gets removed from the scores table to keep recomputations fast since nobody would ever climb in rank after being knocked down by a higher score

you could try jquery with fancybox or colorbox plugin

4845630
superclass	subclassing
let s see why superclass must be initialized before subclassing

4845630

hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
i know vb uses a md5 algorithm to hash it s passwords with a salt

4845771
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
your rpi function is using u16 unsigned short i guess as data type which is far too small for an integer with the value 42949672

4845822
salt	md5
i m asking this as i m using a form to log people in but i m also hashing their passwords with md5 together with a salt for verification

4845844
ssl	https
https is a protocol used to prevent watching the data being sent between you and the server by isps or public wifi hijackers and other cases it may not prevent a spyware on your server to read it to post data using ssl you only need to set the action attribute to a full https end url assuming you already installed an ssl certificate

4845844
salt	md5
about the md5 i believe that your combination of md5 and salt technique is fairly secure and it prevents hackers to easily find popular passwords if they gained access to your database

4845870
inherited	subclassing
will be inherited from the parent when you instantiate a subclassing so you simply need to use

post	get
the gymnastics below are only needed if you want to get the winforms designers to pick up images inside this resource file as described in the post above from douglas

4846028
dictionary	map
in this case 7 0 and 8 4 are the keys and what they map to 1 and 8 respectively are the values of a dictionary

4846049
int	boolean
essentially what i need to store are three things one string two int and maybe two boolean

4846055
inherited	properties
in the first case new foo the new object created by foo has no properties of its own only inherited ones and so size ends up being 0 whereas sizeinherited is 2 because it inherited two properties from its prototype

4846055
inherited	properties
it inherited no properties from its prototype and so sizeinherited is also 2

4846055
inherited	properties
in the third case bar has both two inherited properties and one properties of its own so size is 3 and sizeinherited is 2

4846055
inherited	properties
to find how many properties total it has including inherited ones

4846066
folder	directory
say you have a resources folder under your project s root directory

4846066
folder	directory
make sure that the build action in the properties window for all files under this folder that you want to access is set to content and the copy to output directory option is set to copy if newer or copy always

4846101
int	boolean
starting with .net 4 you could also use a tuple of string int int nullable of boolean nullable of boolean

4846131
google-chrome	firefox
to make this work in firefox and google-chrome and ie8 i removed these styles

4846156
profiling	benchmarking
unless performance is particularly important in which case you d be benchmarking and profiling none of these are very strong reasons

4846182
hash	salt
it s probable that vbulleting uses another way to create the password hash from the password and salt

4846184
width	height
knock out the height and width img attributes - they re not needed - and use css max-width 100

4846229
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
as the author of ilist you can freely choose to derive from icollection only or from icollection and ienumerable

4846249
superclass	subclassing
as you know having a superclass know about subclassing functionality is a big no-no which is why you wanted the abstract method

4846249
superclass	subclassing
then you can call it in the superclass and the subclassing will call its own version but the superclass won t throw an error

4846255
width	height
i tried just excluding them and it animated fine but the width height i was setting were not being respected so i ended up creating a simple rotation animation and an imageview to apply it to

4846293
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
i ve been looking at php s crypt function and a few questions on stackoverflow and i m trying to figure out salt and hash passwords

4846293
hash	salt
salt with 1 you get a hash with an

4846293
hash	salt
but the part that really stumps me is how do i compare a user-entered password against a salt hash password if the salt is randomly generated upon user creation.

4846311
pop-up	dialog
the only problem is that it doesn t wait for me to confirm or cancel the dialog just pop-up and it redirects to the url

4846318
hash	salt
the purpose of the salt is to ensure that two users with the same password get different hash

4846371
width	height
basically i m drawing some text onto an nsview and need to know the physical height and width of the glyphs being drawn

4846456
hash	salt
since you know the encryption type and salt you can naturally reproduce the hash with the password they provide thus authenticating the user

4846456
hash	salt
it is one example of how salt are stored and associated with hash

google-chrome	safari
then i knew initkeyboardevent is not supported on google-chrome safari inituievent i ve tried it didn t work also

4846731
mouseover	mouseout
it is because by design mouseover and mouseout fire the handler when you enter leave descendants of .thumbnail as well

4846731
mouseleave	mouseenter
to avoid this use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

4846772
stdout	stderr
the c standard says that the file streams stdin stdout and stderr shall be connected somewhere but they don t specify where of course

google-chrome	firefox
i did test this in firefox and it worked but i was having trouble with it in google-chrome - my google-chrome installation is pretty messed up so that could be the problem but there are chromium bugs filed that relate to this issue bug #7771 and bug #8939

depending on your requirements application-wide configuration files can be placed outside the jar war so that they can be modified without having to rebuild the jar

4852935
hash	md5
short way if its the same black image always - compare file byte by byte or md5 hash to a sample black image

4852964
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that in source code of transformed site both on google-chrome and firefox syntax is highlighted up to the closing head tag

4852977
postgresql	mysql
summarizing i think that what you need is just a single commit_on_success around process_post possibly supported by transaction savepoints - which unfortunately are available only in postgresql backend even though mysql 5.x supports them as well

4853036
int	double
it is not converting data into double but just using int binary data as double

4853095
int	double
you re taking a vector of int and telling it to use the raw bytes as double which isn t going to work right

4853097
uiview	subviews
the nib file contains a root vanilla uiview where all of the gui is laid out and then in the awakefromnib method of the widget this nib view is added to the widget itself as a subviews

4853117
multiplying	multiplication
in order for divide and conquer matrix multiplication to work it needs to be able to multiplying two potentially different matrixes together

4853171
google-chrome	firefox
i can use ie9 or the latest google-chrome of firefox

4853192
int	double
if you decide for whatever reason that you really need to use gsl it looks like you ll have to copy your array of int s to an array of double s first then use gsl on the result

4853211
cpu	processors
one ec2 compute unit provides the equivalent cpu capacity of a 1.0-1.2 ghz 2007 opteron or 2007 xeon processors

4853212
hash	md5
due to the difference in encoding between a jpg and gif the 2 will not have the same md5 hash

4853214
hash	md5
an md5 hash is of the actual binary data so different formats will have completely different binary data

4853214
hash	md5
so for md5 hash to match they must be identical files

4853218
hash	md5
md5 is a hash

4853279
onresume	onpause	oncreate	onstart
life cycle methods include oncreate onstart onresume onpause and onstop

4853279
oncreate	ondestroy
there s also ondestroy -- the complement to oncreate -- but i don t currently use it

4853279
onresume	onpause
these methods are called in response to various events like pressing the home button but what was important in my case was that minimizing the application calls onpause and maximizing it calls onresume

4853279
oncreate	ondestroy
hence i needed to call my set up and tear down methods from those locations and not for instance from oncreate and ondestroy

4853281
button	checkbox
i have some jquery checkbox button and they work fine

4853283
xrange	enumerate
for loops can use both enumerate and xrange at the same time though it would be silly

4853315
hash	md5
in otherwords comparing the on-disk bytes of the same image in two different format is pretty much guaranteed to produce two different md5 hash since the file s contents differ - even if the actual image is the same picture

4853341
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm so it does not compare images but it compares data

4853366
google-chrome	firefox
this renders fine under ie8 firefox and google-chrome

4853388
put	get
here you get the request uri as in php the path and convert it to one line string and put in the before mentioned string statte var

4853447
fink	macports
see either what to do if libxml2 is being a jerk or if like me you prefer to build from source instead of using fink or macports use libxml from source

4853466
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox but it doesn t work on the iphone or ipad

4853478
post	get
i found another post which i m unable to find now that stated when using wcf to get the physical application path you should use hostingenvironment.applicationphysicalpath

4853487
jobs	cron
on a windows server you won t be creating cron jobs the equivalent is the task scheduler which can be used to run the scripts on an automated basis

4853552
rss	feed
im creating an rss feed for my site and going with this way of building it

4853576
touchesbegan	touchesended	super	implements
to implements these view changes i counter-intuitively put the display code in a touchesbegan withevent and z touchesended withevent before calling their respective super methods

4853576
touchesbegan	touchesended
one thing i m guessing is that the visual appearance of the buttons shouldn t be manipulated in the touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent but then where

4853623
tabcontrol	tabitem
this should let you recursively walk up until you find the tabitem then walk up to the tabcontrol from there

4853628
fadein	fadeout
here is a custom fadein fadeout fadeto to solve your problem

4853631
firefox	safari
this script works fine in ie firefox not in safari 5

4853646
width	height
inside oncreate you can grab an instance of display using getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay and query its width height and or rotation to decide if you want a title feature all before setting the content view

4853654
folder	directory
i m unaware of a plug-in macro or other tool that ll import a directory into an actual project with folder that mirror the file system s

4853725
public	protected
this is an abuse of inheritance to an extent but the advantages over a nested impl class are 1 you can access each member as name rather than data.name reducing code changes when refactoring and 2 though only sometimes desired you can promote individual members to protected or public without affecting other members

4853726
width	height
this should be all that s necessary if your layout doesn t have any controls that increase their height as width is constrained like wrapped label

4853732
jboss	weblogic
we use openejb on tomcat used to run on jboss weblogic etc.

4853734
hide	show
well if you are trying to dynamically show and hide it during the lifetime of the activity i am not sure if you can do that with the official window title due to the note that has been mentioned about window features needing to be set before setcontentview is called

4853734
hide	show
one thing that you could do is implement your own title bar and dynamically show and hide that.

4853734
hide	show
since when you change orientation your app goes through a set of lifecycle changes you have an opportunity in oncreate to show or hide your title

4853737
getter	setter
also assumed strlist was a public field otherwise it should be called strlist and have an appropriate getter setter as that would be following java conventions

4853738
vsto	add-in
i m trying to run an excel 2007 vsto 3.0 add-in we ve created

4853785
for-loop	loops
if you use file to read the file you can just use a counter inside a for-loop counting the number of iterations then when you need to go back to where loops stopped use that counter

4853805
setinterval	settimeout
it sounds like something is calling either setinterval or settimeout every time you

4853816
maven-install-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
once you ve disabled maven-jar-plugin maven-install-plugin may give you trouble too

4853817
codeigniter	pyrocms
pyrocms in my opinion the most well maintained and mature opensource and free cms for codeigniter

4853833
google-chrome	firefox
it looks exactly how i want it to and performs great in ie8 firefox google-chrome

4853835
inherited	properties
the call to the hasownproperty function is there to keep this code from iterating through properties present on obj that are actually inherited from the object prototype

4853850
vaadin	wicket
i would say wicket or vaadin

4853850
vaadin	wicket
wicket probably has more resources than vaadin

4853850
vaadin	wicket
this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin

4853858
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
now in my systems has jdk1.5 but weblogic has jdk1.6 as well myeclipse supporting 1.5 only

4853900
mp3	ogg
if you ask people to compare between mp3 aac m4a mp4 and ogg - they will give you different answers

4853908
children	parent
this expects parent to always be populated before its children

4853915
qmenubar	qwidget
i was only able to do this by adding my qmenubar and custom widget to a new qwidget and using that as the menubar

4853974
post	get
i would suggest to find if you can post the image data to facebook maybe base64 encoded and use the phonegap api to get the base64 encoded content of the foto and post this directly to facebook

4853999
pull	push
i just want things as loose as possible as i feel it gives much more reliable code when i use kind of a push pull approach

4854019
post	get
for my scenario i need to get the current user id to keep track who has edit the blog post which i save the user id with before_save filter

4854079
width	height
i ve looked into creating a custom panel either to replace the grid or to contain the scrollviewer but at no point during the measureoverride arrangeoverride calls do i ever get a call which can tell me about the final width height of the grid row column i care about eg row 0 column 0

4854084
hash	md5
you can choose silverlight if you want to break files into smaller parts and you can consider md5 hash given inbuilt in silverlight

4854098
profiling	debugging
this works fine for debugging but does not seem to work for profiling

4854101
nunit	mstest
we did all the above with horrible mstest but you could use any testing framework i recommend nunit

4854106
direct3d	directx
the directx sdk has a section on accurately profiling direct3d performance which while not directly related to your question can supply some hints as to what is and is not expensive and in some cases why

4854106
fflush	gets
but essentially to try and directly answer your questions the reason the calls are expensive isn t that there is necessarily a lot of data to transfer but rather that there is a large body of work beyond just shipping data across the bus that gets deferred until the command buffer is fflush

4854199
freemarker	velocity
however it also provides support for alternative view layers such as freemarker velocity and even xslt urgh if you don t want to use jsp

4854211
screens	hdpi
so if you having one version of a picture in the drawable folder and another in the drawable-hdpi folder then the app will use the hdpi version if the device has a hdpi screens

4854240
ienumerable	ienumerator
so i would either implement ienumerable interface in that class or at least return ienumerator or ienumerable which would make the returned collection read-only

4854240
hide	show
update as ja72 show this simple technique which just publishes enumerator of internal array doesn t physically hide the array as the resulting ienumerator can be cast back to int

4854243
udp	tcp
not sure but it might be using tcp udp port 445 like the net start stop command

4854276
cout	cin
so you remember that if you think cin as a keyboard and cout as a monitor what you type goes into the variable

4854331
direct3d	direct2d
i m trying to render some geometry using direct2d rendering to a direct3d msaa surface but for large textures 5000x2500 i get strange results

4854335
cout	cin
in the case of cin and cout and other stream types and operators move values to and from streams

4854337
post	get
the difference with other post is that you can set get multiple bits using a mask field

4854364
button	checkbox
each is a product when checking the checkbox if there are options available and or an acknowledge checkbox to be acknowledged before form submit then keep the button hidden and show a div with another checkbox in it when that checkbox if exists is checked then show button

4854364
hide	show
the show hide on each div is working properly existing code so i am trying to create a function to be called within that function for the onclick event

4854368
move	drag
i d love to be able to drag joe s name into a different position without moving the time itself joe smith move 11 00 does not move

4854417
width	height
the tableviewers tables extend beyond the width and height of the composite that contains them and i am not able to view table columns beyond the right edge or rows of the bottom table that extend below the bottom of the composite

4854437
ienumerable	ilist
you could expose that ilist as an ienumerable

4854480
post	get
the issue we are seeing is that when a user s session is timed out between bringing up a get form and hitting the save button that does a post they are sent to the login page but spring is saving the original post information in the session

4854480
post	get
this works fine but when the user happens to return to the page they had originally tried to post to the form get and post are the same urls spring tries to resubmit the post automatically which is not what we want

4854491
post	get
from this post get url of asp.net page in code-behind

4854513
wav	speex
i m currently using ffmpeg to convert flv speex to wav pcm_s16le successfully

4854537
hide	show
you can show hide using javascript jquery from oncomplete attribute on ajax request

4854554
children	parent
it should consist of lots of widgets parent children etc so it s hard to write need widgets by hands

4854610
instance-variables	class-variables
you ve declared a s members as static which means they are class-variables not instance-variables

4854641
multicastdelegate	delegation
one could simply use a multicastdelegate rather than a list of delegation but in some circumstances like object cleanup an exception thrown from one cleanup operation should probably not disrupt the operation of others

4854641
multicastdelegate	delegation
while one could assemble the collection of cleanup operations using a multicastdelegate and then use getinvocationlist to run each within a separate try-catch block it would be easier and more efficient to simply use a list of delegation from the get-go

4854749
folder	directory
i don t know what else to call them has an include folder the include folder contains the same files in every case just copied about 162 times for each page directory

apple s classes - uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller - automatically shift themselves down by 20 pixels when they re added to the screen

4854858
super	implements
now you can have several other classes free premium super that implements this interface

4854861
metaphone	soundex
to take it to the next level you could also throw soundex or metaphone functions in there and it will catch phonetic errors too

4854865
int	double
securitycheckresults is only class for returning results the same as int double or smth else

4854876
ant	maven
maven ant eclipse ajdt all provide a way to include jars in appropriate paths

4854894
daemons	systemd
i m writing a simple little file-syncing daemons in python to implement a synchronised file systemd between a primary and secondary machine

4854902
uiview	uiwindow
apple states that only one uiview should exist in the uiwindow at root level - if there s more than one a lot of behaviour is undefined

4854944
svg	vml
yes changing the viewbox could make it fit to whatever you wanted in all viewers that support svg but raphael itself doesn t support viewbox you d have to provide some vml fallback yourself

4854964
jar	war
my packaging is war so i assume this jar has to be put into the web-inf lib folder along with the other jars so it has to be there in the class path

4854964
maven	m2e
i am using eclipse m2e maven plugin and running this from within eclipse

4854984
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
no custom graphics used which when pressed push a new uiviewcontroller onto the uinavigationcontroller stack

4855011
getter	setter
both classes have an integer property with public getter and private setter and both classes have default constructors and a constructor allowing to initialize the integer property

4855112
touchesbegan	touchesended
i was able to get it working by creating a custom uiview subclass to hold each individual image and implementing touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent in that subclass

4855119
postgresql	mysql
there is a third party linq provider for postgresql as well as mysql and other databases here

4855148
int	double
at the point x there s a variable x of type double there s no hidden information about some int 42

4855151
asterisk	ivr
if you are referencing to interactive voice response then i suggest on looking into asterisk as the basis to your ivr

4855151
asterisk	ivr
take a look into this discussion for more information regarding to integration between drupal and asterisk or other ivr system

4855178
getter	setter
also i recommend the use of object.defineproperty for using getter and setter internally

4855198
hide	show
another option i had in mind was to actually load separate forms for each element and show hide them as needed while editing and then use ajax to save them

4855254
post	get
if not you ll need to figure out how to get the primary key value for the master table records post load data and link up with the eav records accordingly

4855262
maven	m2e
the m2e project provides nice eclipse integration for maven projects - it will create the eclipse setup from the maven config

4855298
mouse	trackpad
a web page however is typically viewed in a relatively large display by a single person who has a mouse trackpad or other way to indicate when they have finished reading whatever is displayed

4855324
free	malloc
note malloc allocates memory on the heap so it will not be automatically free

4855333
ubuntu	linux
the library uses a few dirty tricks so maybe it may not work on any linux platform as good as in ubuntu

pop-up	dialog
you cannot launch a pop-up dialog in

4855397
pop-up	dialog
you cannot launch a pop-up dialog in

4855501
inherited	properties
you can write directly as a string logger.write or you can create your own logentry class and inherited from logentry and then change the formatters in the config to include your new properties

4855510
children	parent
if you also put them in a dictionary keyed by employeeid you can retrieve the parent of each afterward to add to the children collection

4855541
post	get
read about difference between get and post

4855578
pull	push
remote add adds a remote repo that you can either push to or pull from

4855624
bsd	aix
winsock s analog in aix is the use of the bsd sockets api which is what winsock is based on

4855632
touchesbegan	touchesended
the other suggestion is to ditch touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent and switch over to using the methods inherited from uicontrol namely begintrackingwithtouch withevent and endtrackingwithtouch withevent

4855716
gridview	rowdatabound
there is the code for the gridview s rowdatabound event

4855763
expander	itemscontrol
unless you need selection you should go with the itemscontrol to achieve the expansion you can define such behaviour in the datatemplate of the itemscontrol you d just create a lightweight expander

4855812
int	chars
something like .987654d n will write the number 987654 the number of chars output so far to an address specified by the second argument where the first argument is an int

4855830
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
using fiddler i can see that no request is made to crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml

4855830
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i ve read that this error though it indicates a problem with crossdomain.xml clientaccesspolicy.xml can also be raised when the server issues an invalid certificate

4855830
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
the silverlight app does not even try to request crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml as confirmed by fiddler

4855847
width	height
also no matter what rectangular width and height or arc width and height i choose the 4 corners never look the same though the larger it gets the less pronounced it seems to be

4855894
put	get
get the source code and put breakpoints in the beanmanager implementation beanmanagerimpl perhaps

4855902
antialiasing	transparent
graphically speaking double-buffering can be a double-edged sword in some cases low-key graphics it can be beneficial to turn it off but if you have more advanced renderings gradients transparent bitmaps scaled bitmaps fancy fonts antialiasing lines etc. you can get better looks and speed with double-buffering as a slight lag can be better than interactive drawing with flickering

4855915
serializable	deserialization
if properties.settings doesn t work for you then you might just create your own class hierarchy of settings and use simple xml serializable deserialization to handle the file i o

4855925
put	get
however in practice we often think of functions as imperative ie you put in an input value and get out an output value same as with a procedure

4855967
min	max
arguments are value min max step_size

4856022
hide	show
one of the modals i have either hide or show options based on things you do which grows or shrinks the form

4856022
width	height
anyway long story short i have the code that handles resizing the iframe based on the current height width of the body on the inital load

4856054
ssl	https
also you must have an ssl certificate installed on your site to use encryption you can t just use https as the protocol and hope it will work

4856080
width	height
the itemscontrol is bound to a collection of objects each having left top width height properties

4856080
width	height
the source of the canvasitemscontrol is a collection of objects that have the properties left top width height brush etc

4856080
move	drag
now i need to drag drop move these objects around the canvas

4856097
width	height
secondly the images you re using are rather big uncompressed as they would exist in memory width x height x bytesperpixel

4856111
config	ini
apache shiro s ini config is great for many use cases but if you have the full power of an ioc framework like spring or guice it is usually better to configure all of shiro within the ioc mechanism directly

4856159
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller setup with 2 uinavigationcontroller

4856159
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
one uinavigationcontroller has one uiviewcontroller the other uinavigationcontroller has two uiviewcontroller

4856159
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you then navigate to the second uiviewcontroller and click the tab that is already selected it bring you to the root of the uinavigationcontroller this would be the first uiviewcontroller

4856173
versioning	upgrade
the real solution here is to make everything app and dlls use the same runtime or in other words upgrade to the recent visualstudio versioning

4856234
post	put
if you re only worried about the standard routes interfering like edit simply put your match statement after your resources post

4856264
width	height
if you do you will be able to take the advantage of html canvas property which is that if you change the width height of canvas with css the canvas will behave like an image so you could set every element to be 20 shorter

4856264
width	height
though you d have to run javascript on it as if you d like it to stay same width you d have to set the width to be exact same value before applying the shorter height

4856264
width	height
if you d omit this bit you d scale the canvas in both height and width

4856294
awt	swing
create a custom swing awt layout manager in java

4856308
opera	safari
it works in all desktop browsers from ie7 to ie9 ff3.5 safari 4 and opera

4856343
width	height
oddly the image.width in the debugger is referencing the correct width of the image so logically 150 x should give the decimal percentage 150 is of x then i can workout a new height based on that percentage height result - at least i think that s the math

4856369
msdeploy	webdeploy
if you use webdeploy msdeploy exe or api directly and then you can package more than one web site within iis etc

4856376
hide	show
the div show up and when i click on other li previously showed div hide and correct one form clicked li show up

4856376
hide	show
and that works fine but when i click on that div the function again hide it and show again and thats what i m trying to solve

4856393
int	double
the act of assigning the result to a double does not mean that the result was not obtained using int division

it can still implements httpsession and even extends from an implementation of httpsession

4856425
google-chrome	firefox
if i only use header on its own then nothing is output to the client user at least in firefox google-chrome ie has its own built in pages which are shown

4856431
userprincipal	directoryentry
grab your userprincipal or directoryentry from active directory

4856431
userprincipal	directoryentry
you can either fill that viewmodel class yourself or you can grab some help like automapper to make mapping from userprincipal directoryentry to your viewmodel easier

4856438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
display is correct in google-chrome and safari but in ie and firefox for some reason it enlarges the image

4856468
width	height
you create a data object with x y width height and a value for r otherwise it defaults to 0

4856478
opengl-es	glblendfunc
try reading documentation on opengl-es 1_0 glblendfunc

4856503
jdom	dom4j
this code sample uses dom4j but similar setfeature functionality exists in other java xml libraries such as jdom

4856596
google-chrome	safari
i think that it s related to this question safari and google-chrome doesn #39

4856596
google-chrome	safari
in safari try google-chrome it will not work

4856599
folder	directory
after a bit of scouting i found that i could run phpize on a single extension in the php source folder then compile a build of the specific module and install it in my php extension directory

4856611
mvp	presenter
controller is usually associated with mvc pattern presenter always with mvp

4856622

as marcog mentions in the comments you might want to redirect stderr as well you can redirect this to the same location as stdout with

4856707
google-chrome	firefox
it does not happen with google-chrome or firefox

4856741
gif	png
i just thought of another one your externalinterface call could have any object s bounds as parameters which you could then use to superimpose an empty transparent gif or png with the appropriate title via javascript

4856741
mouseover	mouseout
the drawback would be that you d have to have a back channel to forward mouse events and change the behavior of your flash controls to ensure your ui works correctly mouseover and mouseout would no longer work as expected once the image is on top of the flash player

4856748
hide	show
i have been looking into some options for creating a slide out bar for a mac application similar to the itunes ping sidebar has a button that show hide it with animation

4856770
valgrind	callgrind
if you are on linux you may want to look into callgrind a c c++ program analysis tool that is part of the valgrind suite which also contains tools that check for memory leaks and other memory errors which you should be using as well

4856771

4856785
disk	ram
modern systems have quite fast disk subsystems reasonably good i o schedulers and large enough ram capacities to allow for extensive data caching which makes it quite unlikely that a single writer reader combination would saturate the disk subsystem unless you are doing something unusual like recording several video streams at once

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when you re dealing with layers upon layers of uiviewcontroller and uinavigationcontroller you have to be very careful to dismiss them in the reverse order you presented them

4857846
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i drop multiple files folders into the browser google-chrome will filter out the folders and firefox will return 0 for .size so it s trivial to protect against those cases

4857849

4858639
int	chars
how can you implement the function tolower which is int tolower chars

4858675

i suppose this is one way that uses the existing implementation of toupper note that tolower and toupper are defined as eating int and i have done so accordingly

4858689
post	get
i m trying to parse a webpage to get post from a forum

4858696

rss	feed
below is the generated rss feed

4858882
width	height
rather than set the height and width set the coordinates and have the position fixed

4858893
spaces	delimiter
a better way of doing this would be to separate out the handling of database results from the view output logic and then you can sidestep the issue all together using implode to allow php to join each of your authors together into a single string split by your delimiter of a comma and a spaces

4858937
linefeed	delimiter
i know line feeds in foxpro are chr 10 + chr 13 but when creating an import record comma delimiter i need to imbed the linefeed into the field when i add the chr 10 + chr 13 into the .txt file it puts an actual linefeed into the import record rather than being embeded

4858953
hide	show
use it as the table s column model and then ask it to hide show the columns you want

4858958
vim	emacs
in vim it is easy to switch between windows intuitively with control-w + h j k l but in emacs i can only use control-x + o to switch to the other window which probably would require several iterations to finally get to the window i intend

lan	intranet
but there is no problem in our lan intranet test development environment

what i surmise from this is that i can put in the extra effort to manually compile each and every extension i want but i cannot get the extensions to compile in directly

4859248
profiling	benchmarking
but to get a general understanding about costs you have to use a profiling or a benchmarking

4859294

4859446
free	malloc
and allocation performance is not a trivial component of overall performance -- benchmarks show that many real-world c and c++ programs such as perl and ghostscript spend 20 to 30 percent of their total execution time in malloc and free -- far more than the allocation and garbage collection overhead of a healthy java application

inherited	properties
to further restrict it to only immediate properties of the object and not the ones inherited from its prototype

4859679
inherited	properties
note depending on from where you get the object you might want to check that the properties are members of the object itself not inherited from a prototype

4859718

4860380
int	chars
i managed to store some int and unsigned chars and read them without too much pain

4860462
int	boolean
the easy way is to use std bitset which allows you to use indexing to access individual bits boolean then get the resulting value as an int

4860475
junit	powermockito
i use powermockito 1.4.7 and junit 4.8.2

4860493

i never really set up twitter for my facebook account but when the official tool doesn t work properly i would suggest you to use the notes application on facebook to feed an rss feed to your wall

4860502
rss	feed
twitter gives every not locked twitter account an rss feed which contains it s tweet and one for the tweets the user favorites

4860549
boost	allocator
note i am intentionally not using smart pointers like boost shared_ptr because the c library handles all of the memory allocator deallocation etc and since i dont know when the lua garbage collector kick in all of the wrapper classes i expose to lua via tolua++ contain raw c style pointers as private members

4860563
gridview	rowdatabound
i think on particular button click it will not change you can only change by writing the required code in gridview rowdatabound event

4860575
folder	directory
i have set up my build configuration with the following artifact paths relative from checkout directory to the folder containing the website

4860601
int	chars
you don t have to overwrite int or chars arrays unless you really care that data store in them can be somehow used to obtain sensitive data like passwords from your program

4860607
width	height
img src width 400px height 303px align center alt

4860613
int	chars
there is no particular cleanup required for int or chars data

4860613
free	malloc	int	chars
int and chars data on the heap - from new or malloc - may be deallocated using delete or free but again the old content is just left in memory until some further new or malloc reuses that memory

4860655
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my application contains a uitabbarcontroller and a uinavigationcontroller

4860705
factors	matrix
the a and d elements in the transformation matrix represent the scaling factors so in your situation the size in user space units of the displayed image is 74.400131 36.000061 points the default user space units

4860711
moq	nmock
i ve used rhino.mocks moq nmock

4860810
std	ostream
because when you pass a to std ostream it will print the c-style ie char array string it points to

4860816
int	chars
this is probably because you have 32-bit int then an 8-bit chars then the compiler chooses to insert 3 more 8-bit chars so that the string object will be aligned at a 32-bit word boundary

4860845
int	chars
this is why an int followed by a chars will take 8 bytes in the structure so the string member is at offset 8

4860866
inherited	subclassing
in particular it only stops creation of a __dict__ if your class inherited from a base class that does not have a __dict__ such as object and even then it won t stop __dict__ being allocated in any subclassing unless they also define __slots__

4860895
int	double
you should parse it to double first and then cast it to int

4860914
int	double
you can use the double.parsedouble method to first cast it to double and afterwards cast the double to int by putting int in front of it

4860957
int	double
however since you re not interested in the decimal component you can safely drop it by just casting the double to an int

4860976
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you probably need to retain the objects you create for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

4861725
fileinputstream	filechannel
the next step for you is either to read the whole file in a byte array or to create a filechannel from a fileinputstream then mmap it and read from the resulting mmaped bytebuffer using .getfloat

4861733
free	malloc
when you manage memory you do malloc and free a lot of time

4861769
imperative	declarative
the 2 major programming paradigms are the declarative paradigm where the programmer writes down abstract relations thus telling the compiler what he wants and the imperative paradigm where the programmer writes down algorithms thus telling the computer how to get what he wants

4861769
imperative	declarative
an example for a declarative language would be prolog an example for an imperative language would be fortran and real programmer can write fortran programs in any language

4861769
imperative	declarative
as an example for code which is imperative and declarative at the same time consider this implementation of the fibonnaci-sequence in perl6

4861769
put	get
in practice you often use functions imperatively - you put in an input value to get out an output value

4861771
arp	udp
if my machine sent a udp broadcast message to network 0.0.0.0 24 in other words udp broadcast sent to 0.0.0.255 then my machine would forward the packet to the gateway machine which it can look up via arp

4862043
hide	show
you could work a jquery if statement and say if window.width was more than the width of your content show the scrollbar if not then hide it

4862080
inherited	subclassing
this way if the class is subclassing and the rectangleofcolor message is received by a subclassing the instance returned will be the same type as the subclassing for example the array method of nsarray is inherited by nsmutablearray

4862083
subnet	packets
it sounds as if your configuration application is listening for broadcast packets on all network interfaces and expecting to receive packets from foreign subnet

4862083
subnet	packets
that should not work - the os should only pass-on broadcast packets from the subnet each network interface is on not from all subnet on the same physical ethernet segment

4862241
exponent	modulo
i have the modulo and exponent values of a public key and need to encrypt an nsstring value password with these values to pass it as a parameter in an api call

jar	war
failed to create a new sax parser error is due to the availability of unwanted jar files in war and ear if there

4862412
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
and java.text.format is supposed to convert an arbitrary object to string but for some reason it throws an unchecked-exception illegalargumentexception if the object to be converted is somehow wrong type null so in practice you must remember to write a try-catch block whenever you use format

4862412
try-catch	exception-handling
if i was a language designer i would make all exception-handling checked but instead of a try-catch -block one could use a plain annotation to say i don t care about this exception-handling which essentially would convert that checked exception-handling into a runtime exception-handling

4862412
try-catch	exception-handling
this would give the benefits of checked exception-handling nothing goes unnoticed unless explicitly told so and the benefits of unchecked exception-handling no heavy try-catch blocks all around

4862413
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
unchecked-exception are used for programming errors such as nullpointerexception illegalargumentexception etc

4862815
doc	odf
additionally git can use plugins to support further file types such as merging office documents odf doc etc.

4862854
post	get
what you could try is to use a loophole in the http connect method instead of get or post send connect yourserver yourport http 1.0 - you should get a tcp connection to the requested host and port see this for a more complete reference

4862900

you could cheat and pre-calculate max values for a given range if that s a constraint offered by the implementation

4863175
gif	png
if you already have an image using a color palette gif or png and assuming the top left pixel is white anyway you could simply use

here are the things you need to look for as far as differences between railo and coldfusion

4863514
memcached	apc
look at options like apc or memcached or wincache if you re on a windows server

4863557
versioning	upgrade
there must be a better way to manage third-party code especially if i want to track versioning test upgrade or if two libraries share a subdirectory

4863629

4863746
hide	show
show how an example of an asynctask that uses those methods and which show hide a progress bar pg variable

4863750
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
so i m a fan of exceptions here although i d typically use a nullpointerexception when given a null argument and if dataconsumerlist is part of your state then i would personally use illegalstateexception to differentiate that situation

4863752
keydown	keyup
i can currently see which keys are pressed using javascript using a library that relies on keydown keyup events

4863757
spatialite	proj
now i m able to build a fully standalone static library of spatialite 2.3.1 that embeds the required geos and proj so that don t have to take car of them

google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari getallresponseheaders only returns simple response headers as defined in the spec

4863936
boost	stl
i know this is not an answer to your problem but if you are not limited to the stl you could try boost serialization or google protocol buffers

4863936
boost	stl
boost even has build-in support for de- serializing stl containers

4863968
superclass	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass
i am writing an abstract-class and i have a variable that should be defined by the subclassing in this case it is an int which is used in the superclass

4863968
superclass	subclassing
or to define an abstract method in the parent class such that all subclassing must implement it and return the value they want to be used then access the method in the superclass using the abstract method

4864004
hash	md5
you need to md5 sha hash both files and compare if both have the same sum

4864034
xslt	xquery
xquery or xslt xpath strikes to me as the simple solution but the nature of your application determines whether we need programming interface or not and also which option to choose

4864037
many-to-one	one-to-many
first of all the list of projects associated with a particular userid doesn t make sense since you have one-to-many many-to-one relation so that each user can be associated with no more than one project

4864047
getter	setter	accessor	properties
properties are logically equivalent with getter setter method pairs whatever you can do with a with a you can do with a getname setname pair and vice versa especially as c# has getter and setter accessor so we can play with the accessibility too

4864047
public	protected
but there are some folks that feel that public or protected properties are a bit like cheating from an oop perspective especially if all that the property does is just expose a backing field

4864047
getter	setter
when i use getter and setter method no such distiction is immediately obvious

4864056
filesystems	ntfs
on modern filesystems say ntfs you have

4864079
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
if the control s a combobox i register for both selectedindexchanged and textchanged and so on

4864088
std	ostream
to use std copy with ostream write you d need to write your own output iterator that knows how to correctly serialize the type

if you put your coordinates in clockwise order iirc you will get your rectangle

4864154
post	get
now how to get the profile_id and access_token you can use my app post panda or make your own script

4864181
multiplying	subtract
solution is take each digit that is 1 subtract one and multiplying by 9 for each digit that appears after it

4864181
multiplying	add
we can prove this easily there are f n numbers that are less than n then multiplying these by 10 and add in each of the digits 0 and 2-9 at the end 9 different digits

4864181
subtract	add
to get the number that do subtract this from n and add 1 if our number itself contains a 1

4864181
subtract	add
subtract 80 from 99 to give us 19 and do not add 1 as 99 does not contain a 1

4864210
pop-up	dialog
in that case it ll pop-up a dialog asking me if i d like to reload the changes or keep the old file as dirty unsaved

4864222
hash	salt
vbulletin doesn t salt and hash the password the same way as django

4864266
nunit	typemock	teamcity	ncover
basically i d like to use the nunit plugin for teamcity the program not necessarily the specific build step using it to run my unit tests with ncover for code coverage and since my unit tests uses typemock 6 i need that too working

4864266
teamcity	ncover
ncover is extra options to the nunit-launcher of teamcity so i hope this is as simple as just enabling that when i get that far

4864278
margin	height
the basic idea is to use a wrapper with height 100 and a negative margin to move it above the very bottom

4864294
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the output function loops through the data arrays using a for-loop and concatenating the rows to a variable

4864294
for-loop	loops
i was initially using a jquery each loops but switched to the for-loop which shaved off some ms

4864301
debian	linux
also you should perform a search on embedded debian linux sites forums because somebody might have already created exactly what you need 0 effort for you

4864302
udp	tcp
asyncsocket is a object-oriented wrapper for cfsocket and cfstream and supports tcp and udp

4864317
width	height
when making use of the viewbox you need to make sure to set stretch to uniform to respect the original height width ratio

4864385
google-chrome	safari
the first time we view it with google-chrome and safari the images are zoomed in and have scrollbars

4864477
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
my browser was caching clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml

4864477
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
the requests to clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml were not always showing up in fiddler

4864486
hash	salt
xmit m hash time rounded to -say- nearest ten minute marker + some random value salt to make k

4864486
post	get
again m attaches k not timeout to the get or post request to h

4864539
google-chrome	safari
the problem is unique to safari not webkit so google-chrome is fine

4864599
subtraction	addition
for example when doing finite field arithmetic under rijndael s finite field you can based on the knowledge that the characteristic polynomial is 2 with 8 terms assume that your integers are of size uint8_t and that addition subtraction are equivalent to xor operations

4864599
subtract	add
well basically if you add or subtract two elements of the polynomial they contain either zero or one

4864703
jboss	glassfish
jboss is comparable with glassfish and others

4864703
jboss	glassfish
so in principle jboss seam can run on glassfish as well

4864776
freebsd	linux
you may read through zfs code which is considered well written so that it is relatively easy to port to freebsd mac linux

4864828
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like its 4px higher in firefox and 5px higher in google-chrome according to firebug and its google-chrome equivalent

4864852
accessor	properties
accessor is my canonical method for centralizing an enumeration of the properties all are decimal

4864926
spaces	delimiter
example input the input could be any amount of words the delimiter is a spaces

4864942
post	get
obviously a way to simplify this would be to query all threads a user has posted a message in and then send a separate query for each one to get the most recently added post info

4864949
innodb	myisam
with innodb the size of the combined index would be roughly the size of col1 plus the size of col2 plus the size of the table s primary key or 4 bytes if using myisam

4864949
innodb	myisam
with innodb or myisam the combined index should be smaller than two separate indexes since with two separate indexes the primary key or 4 byte row pointer would be included twice once in each index

4864975
udp	tcp
if you don t need the sequence control and reliability of tcp you could consider to use udp to send short messages

4865003
width	height
i know a fairly easy way to detect the screen orientation is to compare the width to the height and see which is larger

4865029
ubuntu	linux
linux login ubuntu

4865031
packets	pcap
i am using the pcap pcap.net to get hold of network packets

4865053
tolua++	luabridge	luabind	tolua++	luabind	luabridge
i don t know tolua++ but both luabind and luabridge support what you need

4865065
width	height
the problem is only after the onload fires does the browser know the actual width and height of the image available through this.width this.height if not bonund to class scope

4865065
width	height
the onload here should be what injects the image into the container and sets width and height to host it

4865091
put	get
you shouldn t put anything in solutionnodes initially both mend and mstart will get added during the final loop that traverses the path

4865128
xna	slimdx
if that isn t fast enough you could create a xna slimdx directx control that renders your data updates on your computer s video hardware

4865150
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in both the viewdidappear and viewwillappear methods

4865157
accessor	properties
properties is used with heap allocated nsobjects like and etc because memory managed accessor are created for free

4865208
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in local jetty plugin + dev tomcat neither with firefox google-chrome

4865229
jar	war
the way to do it in non-osgi war is to copy the persistency jar into war

4865274
udp	tcp
but if i were you i would consider using udp instead of tcp

4865274
udp	tcp
on most embedded systems i ve worked with using tcp several different stacks udp is lighter-weight outperforms tcp in terms of code size throughput

4865274
udp	tcp
there are times when the benefits of tcp justify the overhead but from what you ve written i think you should consider a basic udp datagram set up

4865275
accessor	properties
the properties is not synthesized but using a simple accessor i can write

4865281
postgresql	mysql
we have oracle ms sql mysql and postgresql connectivity working from lokad.cqrs over the windows azure in various setups and configurations linux windows-hosted database servers

4865374
post	get
you can call a javascript method through the asp.net backend by but the only way your going to get the result is to post it back through ajax

4865385
gridview	repeater
i ve written some pages with asp.net repeater and gridview objects

4865385
gridview	repeater
when the user enters data into the dialog and clicks a button the data is submitted using ajax and the gridview repeater is updated without reloading the page or posting back

4865437
ssl	https
i m making a url request to a server that authenticates by ssl through https but when i get the answer always returns empty when i convert the input to string

4865443
teamcity	ncover
so long as you re using the teamcity gui running with ncover coverage should just be a simple matter of selecting to run with it.i ve never tried throwing typemock into the mix so i look forward to hearing how that goes

4865452
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using firebug in firefox but may also work in ie8 or google-chrome you can try

4865461
gridview	repeater
the gridview and the repeater are asp.net objects that the .net framework translates into html for you

4865502
google-chrome	firefox
i only have this issue in firefox and google-chrome

4865532

4865624
jxtable	jtable
one has a jtable and one has a jxtable

4865624
jxtable	jtable
this update seems to interfere with selection-by-mouse in the jxtable but not in the jtable if i click and drag downwards in the jxtable to select multiple rows the selection anchor disappears when the update happens

4865632
int	chars
if you want convert chars to int you can use this piece of code

4865643
int	chars
don t read int read chars so cin will pass any invalid chars

4865650
visualvm	jstat
i m trying query a remote jvm with jps using jstat in order to eventually monitor it using visualvm

4865663
width	height
my app is a very very simple app and just has didrotatefrominterfaceorientation method where i change the movie frame width and height to landscape and change the origin to match landscapemode

4865690
int	chars
i agree that a chars is just as handy since you can always cast to int to answer your question as to why this is happening when a cin input is exected as an int but a chars is entered the input is kept in the input stream for the duration of the loop which is why it seems to disappear.

4865721
vaadin	wicket
i would say vaadin would be easier over wicket as the default ui elements look really good

4865721
vaadin	wicket
i love both vaadin and wicket and my opinion is that they are the best 2 frameworks out there

4865735
rsa	aes
so the rsa algorithm is just used to exchange keys for faster synchronous encryption standards aes 3tes

4865755

some data structures store data packed two bytes per word while others store one byte per word in the c compiler both chars and int are signed 16-bit types

4865778
ubuntu	linux
linux either download it from the link above or in a terminal in ubuntu enter sudo apt-get install rinetd

4865788
getter	setter
i am looking for an application-wide method of catching exceptions thrown by databound property getter and setter but that s doable without as much difficulty

4865788
getter	setter
unfortunately this method only catches exceptions in property setter not getter

4865791
width	height
based on those values and the canvas s width and height set the canvas s horizontalscrollposition and verticalscrollposition accordingly

4865806
post	get
if my domain model has a property named isadmin and i have a create controller action to create users someone could alter my form and get it to post a isadmin true form value even if i did not expose such a text field in my view

4865807
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can easily use the webclient class or the httpwebrequest httpwebresponse to fetch the images at a particular url

4865825
int	chars
you can use the following formula to get the number of chars of the binary representation of an int n n 0

4865870
dropbox	evernote
some of them that come to mind are simplenote dropbox evernote arcgis and even twitter

4865898

put	get
i am using the module ole for perl and every value i get from my worksheet and print var then i get the expected value but when i put everything into a hash it prints

4866081
memcached	apc
apc is mainly an opcode cache system even with the apc_store whereas memcached is a distributed caching system which is a lot better and safer

4866104
getter	setter
because it is used as getter and setter for that object..in our case we need set the value for that array object

4866181
width	height
i am trying to have an swf fill the browser 100 in width and auto adjust for the height forcing the page to scroll if necessary

4866181
width	height
i would like for example a 600px x 1000px swf to fill the width and maintain the aspect ratio for the height

4866238

so to me anything to do with sorting and filtering the data should absolutely be done in the model as should the process of extracting albums from a list of songs

4868335
memset	malloc
it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour

openbsd	freebsd
i also found that freebsd has a pthread_np.h header that defines pthread_main_np so this should work on freebsd too 8.1 at least and openbsd 4.8 at least has pthread_main_np defined in pthread.h too

4868757
openbsd	freebsd
so basically you should be able to do it directly on mac os x freebsd and openbsd

4869233
equals	gethashcode	referenceequals	gethashcode
you changed pk which doesn t affect the outcome of equals because you have that referenceequals check in there but the result of your gethashcode does change

4869233
equals	gethashcode
taking the more conceptual approach i think you can look at it like this if you have overridden the equals and gethashcode behavior for your type then you ve taken ownership of the concept of what it means for one instance of this type to be equals to another

4869235

it s a pointer sized to the native word length ie 32-bit pointer on x86 64bit pointer on x64

4869578

next if you change it to children it would then be a local variable but you need an instance variable for the instance of the definition of the parent class so you need to use children

4869611
hash	md5
my script compares 2 source trees creates a map of possible changed files compares md5 hash and creates a diff-package

4869644

i already have the xml reader working but when i put the xml into my code it returns with no data which is what i told it to do if it can t get any data from the xml

4869682
mouseover	mouseout
presumably this is because it s triggering the mouseout event of the item box when details gets displayed but immediately triggering the mouseover event again when the details box is hidden

4869685
base	fractions
in that context it makes no sense to move from the base pointer up some fractions of the size of an object

4869720

when you use gacutil to install an assembly to the gac do you also need to register it with regasm

4869804
pull	push
i will say that in general if i have different views of the same data like in your case i will use commands to push out the data but if a view just gets a data update i will often have the view just pull the data from a proxy

4869815
maven	pom.xml
to get my project into eclipse i can choose file- import- maven and then i get all the maven projects imported and can build fine or i can choose file- import- git and make a new project that ignores the pom.xml and does not generate the project properly

ivar	subclassing	public	protected
i am hoping for some clarification on how private vs protected vs public works with respect to class members when programming in objective-c - i thought i knew the difference i ve added some comments to my parent class person with respect to the same but the fact that the compiler did not complain when i tried to access a private ivar member of a parent class via the subclassing now has me confused

4869935
getter	setter
or by using property synthesize the setter and getter methods have i essentially made that member protected and therefore accessible to the subclass

4869937
stdout	stderr
all programs including daemons are entitled to assume that stdin stdout and stderr are appropriately opened file streams

4869937
stdout	stderr
if the code was written to survive without standard output or standard error for example it opens a standard log channel or perhaps uses syslog 3 then it may be appropriate to close stdout and stderr

4869937
stdout	stderr
alternatively you can redirect both stdout and stderr to a log file - beware continuously growing log files

4870220
for-loop	arrays
the answer thus has to make use of the fact that we only return at most sqrt x items and the only other answer i have so far is doing a for-loop search for the minimum element in the arrays removing the minimum from the arrays stashing it in a new arrays say b and repeating the process on the now smaller modified version of a of length x-1 which gives us running time like so

4870220
for-loop	arrays
that counts the number of for-loop iteration of the min-search and gives us at most y or sqrt x iterations in the worst case scenario and there are at most x items in the arrays

4870230

4870381
int	chars
edit to understand the computing bit you ve got to understand that ascii chars printable the ones you store on strings don t correspond to their int counterparts

4870381
int	chars	multiplying	subtract
by multiplying the first chars by ten and adding the first chars you re summing the ascii values not the int ones so you ve got to subtract the bias

4870381
multiplying	subtract
subtract 0 the base number for ascii would work for one character ascii 2 - ascii 0 2 but you ve got to multiplying it by 11 for two characters

4870388
single-quotes	backslash
you should either use single-quotes to initialize the string or escape the dollar sign with a backslash like you did in the regex

4870401

4870611
directx	direct2d
i tried direct2d with windowsapicodepack to render video and the result is cpu usage is pretty low but the problem is that i have no way to render video smoothly since there s no accurate timer to update video at exact time like directx in c++

4870611

getter	setter
the difference is that if you declare property then you can implement using synthesize which auto-codes your getter setter for you

4871043
getter	setter
if you declare an instance variable and do not specify a corresponding property then you cannot use synthesize and must write your own getter setter

4871043
getter	setter
you can always override the auto-coded getter setter by specifying your own

4871047
implements	extends
i should add that this line is part of an app that uses rmi and part of a class which extends unicastremoteobject and implements a remoteinterface.i specify that because i am under the impression that a nullpointerexception can occur when you deal with synchronization even if nothing is realy null maybe when something is locked and i deal with synchronization in this app.the method that contains the line though is not synchronized and nowhere in my code i try to use the array as a monitor i only have some synchronized methods no smaller synchronized blocks so i nowhere choose a specific monitor explicitly

4871117
maven	pom.xml
if this does not work you could update your question with the full stacktrace specifying the exact line that maven fails to validate the pom.xml

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can put a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller but not the other way around

4871170
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you have a uitabbarcontroller the easiest thing to do is to assign different view controllers uiviewcontroller subclasses to each tab

4871407
int	chars
since those codes are really short and typically all the same length i would however recommend using a chars 3 or chars 5 - no point in using varchar for such a short string and also varchar as variable length fields do behave quite differently and not better in terms of performance that fixed-length fields like int or chars

superclass	subclassing
if so then i see no lsp violation - if the method superclass promises nothing then the subclassing can do what it likes and still be perfectly substitutable

4872117
superclass	subclassing
the fact that the subclassing is more selective only actually writes about what it writes is new functionality especially in light of the fact that the superclass promises nothing

4872126
pull	push
we have multiple clones of the same app at heroku but we want only one source at github in our dev local directory we do the push to origin github then when we have it the way we like it we cd to the prod local directory which goes to the same github repository and we only pull from github into this directory never push eg all pushes to github come from our dev directory the prod directory is just a staging area for the other heroku app.

this is what i got for ie7 google-chrome and mozilla firefox

4877215

from a physical standpoint in sql server an int key will take up more than twice as much space as a chars 2 or chars 3

4881834

the h hue range begins and ends with a shade of red so h 0 and h max 360â or 100 or 240 depending on the application are both red and relatively similar to each other but the euclidean hsl distance is close to maximum

4881890
put	get	post	get	post	put
the key to make such an api simple is to have your server provide a restful service and your entities holding the required attributes datecreated datelastmodified etc. so you can create requests easily done with asihttprequest be they get put post delete and add the appropriate http-headers for a conditional get if-modified-since

free	malloc
returning anything allocated with malloc is fine as long as whoever uses your function takes care of free ing it when they re done

4881937
int	chars
however googling lead me to determine that the return value of printf is an int of the number of chars s output not a chars of the chars themselves as i had hoped

4881940
free	malloc
you can certainly return an array allocated with malloc but you have to make sure the caller of the function eventually releases the array with free

4881940
free	malloc
if you don t free a malloc d array the memory remains in use until program exit

4882003
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing can be cast upwards to any superclass

4882003
superclass	subclassing
a superclass cannot be cast downwards to any subclassing this is unreasonable because subclassing might have capabilities a superclass does not

4882012
min	max
a min max width can be specified in the format picture string with the format min-max

4882027
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you could use nsdatecomponents and nscalendar

4882098
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if there is no direct method for that then since uitabbarcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller you can access its view size and get the difference of its tabbar frame size

4882124
implements	extends
in order for that assignment to be legal classa has to extends or implements interfaceb

4882183
printf	strncpy
this is what functions such as printf and strncpy do

4882257
folder	directory
but whenever i go to preferences- android and put the folder where my sdk is eclipse keeps complaining about the missing tools directory

4882269
subtract	add
its very convenient because as 32 bit integers you can add subtract angles 350 degrees plus 20 degrees ends up overflowing wrapping back around to 10 degrees

4882269
integer	unsigned
also you can decide to treat the 32 bit integer as signed -180 to 180 degrees and unsigned 0 to 360

4882271
atomic	interlocked
i am currently trying to achieve thread synchronization in c++ .net using only atomic operations using the system threading interlocked class in .net

octal	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal	hex	binary
hex decimal octal and binary are all bases of number systems but they count the same thing

4882583
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
we use binary octal and hex because binary is the language of computers remember a digital wire can either have current or not have current values 1 or 0

4882583
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
each single hex character describes four binary digits exactly while an octal character describes 3 binary digits

4882583
octal	hex
hex is used much more often than octal

4882583
hex	binary
just convert each character in the hex to the corresponding binary digit as above

4882589
awt	swing
the only problem is that we don t know what to use our very own engine with awt or if we could use swing to make it easier

4882632
inherited	properties
it s easy to break parts of the code into different files or inherited properties in child classes

4882642
awt	swing
while you could use the java awt and swing libraries to build a game you would probably have an easier time finding a game-specific library and building around that

4882685
vim	emacs
understand that i m comparing emacs and vi not vim

4882685
vim	emacs
i ve never learned the extensions that vim has added to vi and it s likely that many of them are features copied from emacs

4882685
vim	emacs
if so and if you re already proficient with vim emacs may not hold as many advantages for you

4882685
hash	md5
many software projects distribute a tarball of the application on a page that also includes an md5 hash of the tarball

4882685
hash	md5
so how do you compare the md5 hash on the distribution page with the md5 hash computed from the downloaded file

4882685
hash	md5
first copy the md5 hash from the webpage into a new emacs buffer

4882685
octal	hex	octal	decimal
type the two keystroke command ctrl-x and emacs will display the character its ascii value in octal decimal and hex the character offset from the beginning of the file and the character offset from the beginning of the line

4882716
put	get
you could put that line in bootstrap.php but you might get this error still config.php is loaded first

we are using groovy to test our restful api using a series of helper functions to build the xml put post gets and then a series of tests on the nodes of the xml to check that the data is manipulated correctly

4882865
google-chrome	firefox
we use poster for firefox google-chrome seems to be lacking a similar tool for hand testing single areas or simply to poll the api at times when we need to create further tests or check the status of things

4882873
datamapper	activerecord
it works quite nicely once you replace datamapper with activerecord

4882890

actionscript	mxml
now i m getting no errors or warnings but i cannot see the mxml objects in the intellisense when working in the included actionscript file

4882911

moreover all other inluded actionscript files can see objects in their mxml counterparts

4882937
int	chars
byte chars short or int return the value of the type

4882937
int	double
so in your case you have x int and y double if you follow this rules you ll find the solution

4882941
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
converting between binary octal and hex is pretty easy

4882941
octal	binary	octal	hex	hex	binary
these are easy because the radixes for binary octal and hex are all powers of 2

4882941
octal	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal	hex	binary
several other answers show how to convert from binary octal and hex to decimal

4882954
width	height
in this case all html input types would have height 100x and width 200px

4882991
put	get
can i get a method to parse a string eg apple fruit and put the elements in a two d array

4883049
width	height
this has nothing to do with asp.net you need to design your pages with width height with percentage and not pixel

4883056
children	parent
this is also very useful because sending a sigterm to the parent perl script propagates this signal to each of the children who then forward this signal onto qsub thus gracefully terminating all associated submitted jobs

4883056
stdout	stderr
the attempted submissions that produce this error fail to even generate the stdout and stderr files and

4883067
int	chars
you can t add a chars pointer and an int like that you can but it won t do what you expect

4883073
int	chars
further they are already short chars 2 chars 3 vs int

4883081
ostringstream	std
to get around this you can write into an std ostringstream

4883087
int	chars
in c c++ you cannot append an int to a chars array using the + operator because a chars array decays to a pointer

4883119
stdout	stderr
this will redirect the stderr output to the stdout

4883130
chunked	transfer-encoding
i would bet it is sending back transfer-encoding chunked which is ending up in your data

led	electronics
while a led 3d tv might be in electronics - tv - led - 3d

4883202
actionscript	mxml
as a workaround i made a copy of the mxml file and the included actionscript file

4883202
actionscript	mxml
i then deleted the local copies of the mxml and actionscript files and renamed the copy to the original

4883203
min	max	width	height
while developing you need to understand during the process what the screen resolutions you intend to support - basically the min and max height and width and check them during development not after you have it looking good at one resolution

4883305

touchesbegan	touchesended
then override all the touch handlers touchesbegan withevent touchesended withevent etc...

width	height
the solution was quite simple because images in frames have same height but different width i simply made a transparent border rectangle and put it over each frame

4883575
jobs	cron
the hosting provider however only allows cron jobs to be run every two minutes

4883584
post	get
what you want to do is use the stream table to get the status post for users

4883591
tabs	tabpanel
as far as i can tell extjs interprets this as do not open any of the tabs when showing the tabpanel the first time

4883666
put	get
when you generate a keyfile you ll get a .pub fileâ use that one but put the name in your gitosis.conf without the .pub

width	height
in air 1.5 and flash player 10 the maximum size for a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels in width or height and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16 777 215 pixels

4883674
width	height
so if a bitmapdata object is 8 191 pixels wide it can only be 2 048 pixels high. in flash player 9 and earlier and air 1.1 and earlier the limitation is 2 880 pixels in height and 2 880 in width

4883689
packets	multicast
i have same packets and multiple ip address clients and i can not use multicast

4883690
boost	stl
i have some objects that make heavy use of stl containers like maps vectors and also boost shared_ptr

4883714
udp	tcp
udp conversely would not provide much benefit over multicasting if your application will run over a lan you are in charge for configuration of that s the reason i specified tcp

4883764
public	protected
wrong actually the order in the layout of data members within the same access specific public protected or private is dictated by their order in the code however no order is specified for data members with different specifiers

4883781
svcutil.exe	basichttpbinding
however you can only use basichttpbinding but you can overcome that by using a ssl connection and also to generate a wsdl proxy for the wcf service you cannot use the desktop version svcutil.exe you ll have to use netcfsvcutil.exe

4883805
google-chrome	firefox
by the way i want to point to the fact that such program will only work in microsoft internet explorer don t mind to have something like this in mozilla firefox google-chrome opera...

4883869
gentoo	debian
seems like this guy has done it and provides a howto for debian and gentoo

4883885
waitpid	fork
i think you ll want to fork and exec and waitpid - set up and run your own process and wait for it to finish on your own

4883897
super	self
don t do that if super could just use type self as its first argument then it wouldn t have been written to take two arguments in the first place

4883917
width	height
validation of the picture s width and height should be performed before

you ll need to upgrade your hardware if you want to beta test the new versioning of ios

4883941
width	height
the width and the height of the image

4883943
ready	each
then when you are finally ready to transmit the data you could either iterate through this collection of name value pair connections and send them data as byte array one by one to each client or spawm off one thread per connected client and have it send the data concurrently

4883954
post	get
another post details the necessary steps probably for an older update but still it should get you started clickety

4883961
filesystems	fat
but for external storage like the sd-card android is using the fat filesystems to make the cards compatible with windows

4883961
filesystems	fat
it s a good thought but since the fat filesystems lack any access rights features everything stored on the sd-card is available to all apps

on ubuntu and debian that would be for example in a file called etc logrotate.d rails_example_com

to find the width and height of the picture you can use system.drawing.image

4884083
packets	multicast
the short answer is you use multicast packets in python

4884083
packets	multicast
multicast sits somewhere in between unicast packets going to one host and broadcast packets going to all hosts in that it allows host via applications running on them usually to register an interest in certain multicast groups

4884083
packets	multicast
multicast traffic can cross routers as well as switches with appropriate support and the idea is that a minimum spanning tree gets built for sending packets to all subscribed hosts

pull	push
it works fine except the particles will not push each other away only pull towards i debugged that sub going through it command by command and realised the value h would not change what ever it was set to during the first pass through the sub is what it kept the only way to change this value is to manually set it i.e h 1

getter	setter
so the main difference between properties and ivars is that properties dynamically creating the setter getter methods and you can override them

4884268
getter	setter
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

4884268
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

this website probably offers the simplest explanation to the actual difference of udp and tcp

4884309

for short answer tcp works kind of like registered letter when udp is kind of like ordinary letter - with the latter you never know whether the recipient got the packet you sent

4884311
log4js-node	log4javascript
not to be confused with log4js-node as it is an adaption of log4javascript to nodejs

if the war depends on the jar then the jar needs to be build and added to the local repository before the war is built not after as you have written in your question

4885270
jar	war
it has to be done in this order so that the jar file can be included in the war file.

4885270
jar	war
just create a parent-module with child modules for the jar and the war and declare that the war module depends on the jar module

4885278
jar	war
if your jar project and war project follow the same release cycle it would be a good idea to create a common parent pom and make the 2 projects modules of that parent

4885511
hash	salt
your proposal is to send the value hash salt + data to s

4885511

i read the following post using get currentmethod and i noticed that this method is slow

4885596

4885620
portrait	landscape
i m trying to force the portrait mode for my application because my application is absolutely not designed for the landscape mode

4885726
mouseover	mouseenter
try to bind to mouseover or mouseenter instead of hover

4885726
mouseleave	mouseenter

4885746
mouseover	mouseout
edit using mouseover and mouseout like felix said is the best way imho

4885761

4885919
int	boolean
the answer to your question is that as many others have pointed out you re using lowest as a boolean type instead of a number type such as int which would be in harmony with the rest of your program

4885919
int	boolean
for historical reasons mainly because of the c inheritance boolean values have been associated with int numbers for which 0 meant false and any other value meant true

4885919
int	boolean
that s why the boolean type is still compatible with int that s a way of saying this and when you assign it to a zero then it holds false

4885928
concave	convex
i m successfully drawing the convex polys which make up the following white concave shape

4885980
clang	llvm
llvm has been around for a while but â at least in my neck of the woods â it has only risen to prominence very recently possibly due to the fact that apple has been pushing heavily of late to replace gcc with clang in their own tool-chain

4885992
accessor	properties
imo you should primarily be using protected properties and provide accessor methods

4885992
public	protected
but don t just use protected visibility on all your properties it s okay for some to be public and private again it all comes down to responsibility

4885995
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout are wrong king of events for this case

4885995
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need something like mouseleave and mouseenter

apache	nginx
there are numerous complete guides to setting up nginx + apache via a quick google search but here is the gist for setting up nginx

4888945
apache	nginx
if you really want to serve your site from port 8081 you could potentially have nginx listen on port 8081 and have apache listen on a different port

4888945

this could be done with either tcp or udp depending on your reliability requirements

4889258
udp	tcp
instead of single multicast udp socket you would have a number of tcp sockets one per destination

4889342
multibyte	substr
i would just do a substr once it is url encoded but that might take off part of a encoded character space becomes 20 and if it was at the end it could get truncated to 2 which is invalid or that part of a multibyte character would get truncated ï gets encoded as cf 80 and it could get truncated as cf cf 8 all of which are wrong

i found that resizing the image to 1280px width 911px height works nicely for a browser window size of 1024x768 which is pretty much the minimum that anybody s going to be using these days

4890261
submit	submission
also how to submit the form such that the list of objects gets re-created on submission

i know there are otherways to send data get post etc. but a simple parameter on the querystring is most of the time sufficient for nonsensitive items

4890490
integer	unsigned
an obvious example in unsigned int s favor would be the integer division operation

4890490
integer	unsigned
in case of unsigned integer division this problem does not arise which is why generally integer division works much faster for unsigned types than for signed types

4890490
floating-point	integer	integer	unsigned
on the other hand when you are mixing integer arithmetics and fpu floating-point arithmetics signed integer types might work faster since the fpu instruction set contains immediate instruction for loading storing signed integer values but has no instructions for unsigned integer values

4890490
integer	unsigned
this code is noticeably larger because the fpu instruction set does not work with unsigned integer types so the extra adjustments are necessary after loading an unsigned value which is what that conditional fadd does

4890490
integer	unsigned
in my code 99 of integer types are unsigned

4890492
stdout	stderr
some servers when dealing with cgi scripts close their connection to the browser when the script closes stdout and stderr

put	get
the variable needs to be volatile so that subsequent reads of the variable within a method don t get optimized away in other words if you re checking this condition in a loop or multiple times within a given function then we put volatile there to ensure that the value is checked each time rather than being cached locally

4890929
udp	tcp
i ve been told on the processing forums that the best way to communicate with processing through puredata is to use tcp or udp messages

4891165
accessor	properties
just like a properties is an accessor for a field

4891165
accessor	properties

yeah the base class itself is not required but overriding equals and gethashcode is something you ll want to do on all your entities so the base class makes that a lot less repetetive

4891891
width	font-size
determine if the span s width is greater than the useable width of the input element and update the font-size accordingly

4891902
serializable	deserialization
you could add custom serializable handling with the iserializable interface which would allow you to step through the deserialization process in the debugger

4891932
folder	directory
upload your site in the root folder of your site or virtual directory and upload the content of compiledsite not the folder itself

4891949
hash	md5
this ominous string is just something very random hash maybe md5-hashing see md5 -function but it has no meaning and there would be no reason trying to decrypt it

button	checkbox
don t forget the checkbox and radio button -

4892058
post	put
in your example your intent is to put the message to the server at least that is how i understood it so most probably you want to use put requests and in this case the message text would be in the post request body

4892061
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari 3+ google-chrome 2+ firefox 2+ and

4892080
folder	directory
if you can remotely access the client computer s registry i highly doubt that you can put the batch file in a temp directory somewhere and place a reference to it in the runonce registry folder

4892086
pop-up	dialog
i believe that this will accomplish what you re looking for in that the dialog won t pop-up unless until the debugger stops in your code

4892115
versioning	upgrade
easier versioning upgrade if one cluster needs to move forward and the other needs to stay behind for legacy apps

4892175
button	checkbox
it was meant for checkbox and i needed it for radio button

4892229
equals	tostring
if x and y are equals their tostring s should be equals but an equals tostring does not necessarily mean that the objects are equals think of the equals hashcode relationship

4892243
folder	directory
i did notice that maven puts tomcat in my project target tomcat folder and there are some differences such as there is no lib directory

4892301
folder	directory
organised the folder and files but again it won t read the css file whether i put it in a subdirectory or in the same directory as the .info file

4892335
for-loop	arrays

put	get	post	get	post	put
that s sort of it for the server side message get post put and delete are all provided by django piston and the django orm layer

4892428
profiling	debugging
you could try the script debugging profiling in ie8 while running in ie7 compatibility mode

4892444
width	margin
i would like to make the margin property dependent on backgroundrectangle actualwidth similarly as i made it with the width property

4892455
google-chrome	firefox
edit summary it seems that my web app can be accessed by anyone only firefox or google-chrome and by me using my main computer

4892455
google-chrome	firefox
i published to this server only firefox or google-chrome

4892490
pull	push
the biggest speed benefits are gained when you want to push pull small amounts of data to the server for example when the state of a checkbox changes

4892490
post	get
this can be done with ajax in only a few bytes where traditionally you d perform a post redirect get form submission fetching the entire page again

4892547
put	get
indeed if i put the following in the oncreate method i get the same problem

4892555
macbook	isight
i am trying to capture a single frame from the apple isight camera built into a macbook pro using python version 2.7 or 2.6 and the pyobjc version 2.2

4892646
post	get
now when you submit the form in the post action you will get the list of selected values along with their id

4892651
getter	setter
as example it is butt-heart to create properties from getter and setter

4892657
folder	directory
rename your current image directory and then create a new one do a find-in-files search within vs for your image path content images multiselect all the used images and drag them into the new image folder

4892672
codeigniter	cakephp
the most famous php frameworks zend framework codeigniter symfony and cakephp were all version 1 for a long time and are all at the same time releasing their versions 2 now although beta alpha pre dev king of thing

margin	height
all of them use height 100 and a margin bottom for the central div the height of the footer or similar for the variable height content

4892685
factors	mean
i mean what are the factors governing this decision

4892754
slideup	slidedown
if you read the jquery documentation for slideup and slidedown they go like this

4892754
slideup	slidedown
ergo use slidedown to make stuff visible and not slideup

4892770
uiview	subviews
it works fine if both are subviews of a uiview

4892778
jobs	cron
i am enqueuing jobs in my rakefile s cron task as such

4892779
put	get
when i try to put the js on the actual .aspx pages that will be using it i get the same no definition error

4892791
cpython	ironpython
most packages do not install directly into ironpython forcing you to install into cpython then copying over the relevant modules

4892798
luabind	luabridge
rather implement it in c++ using luabridge or luabind where it is natural and powerful

4892800
google-chrome	firefox
i can t say for sure if either firefox or google-chrome is right but your code is ambiguous because window could refer to either the current frame or the target frame depending on where the javascript is executed

4892809
rvm	bundler
rails 2.3.8 + bundler rvm + ruby 1.8.7 cucumber 0.9.4

4892902
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
our team had almost completed our application layouts which were working perfectly in google-chrome firefox and safari

4892924
pull	push
developers from time to time would git pull others work from origin repo into some local branch and git push their own work to appropriate branches of origin repo

4893005
post	get
the request file program was on another port on the 8888 port which already is a different server which dont enables ajax dont know why to get the post data

4893006
multicastdelegate	delegation
i looked over the implementation of delegation and multicastdelegate in the .net 4 source code

4893034
getter	setter
make both the getter and setter private

4893034
getter	setter
use it s getter and setter to wrap the generated datetime as a time

4893045
min	max
the android docs do say when user-scalable is no that the min max scale values are ignored

4893061
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	centos	linux
i m trying to debug why a program which prints hello and then uses 404mb of virtual memory under linux with both openjdk and sun jvms on both centos 5 and ubuntu 10.04 server

4893123
gitolite	gitosis
but i will recommend not using gitosis and use gitolite instead

4893145
post	get
when i get an id it returns the user id but i want the post id

4893154
hide	show
iirc to fix this issue when dealing with proximity zones i used the mouse position to show hide the content the button

4893187
nsstring	nsobject
i need to convert nsobject to nsstring

4893204
hide	show
inside a nested div so that when a hyperlink is clicked it will show one element and hide the other like this snippet

4893238
quicksort	mergesort
here are some examples on how to achieve it multithreaded quicksort or mergesort

4893249
quicksort	mergesort
consider a mergesort over a quicksort i am biased towards mergesort - remember there are numerous different kinds of mergesorts including bottom-up

4893256
ordinals	difference
the following example illustrates the difference between ordinals and culture-sensitive comparisons using the indexof method

4893257
int	chars
operands that are int constants ï oating constants enumeration constants chars

4893263
int	boolean
the statement is an assignment so you re ultimately trying if 0 || 0 but the || operator expects boolean not int

4893318
inline	inlining
i know that vc++ will rarely inline with loops even if the inlining yields benefit

4893336
for-loop	loops
repeat-until is the only pascal statement i can think of that necessitates a far-removed second part - because it makes sense the condition for-loop exit to be textually where it will be checked - after loops body

4893343
apache	nginx
this is of no use if the web server for example apache or nginx is not configured to support the upload progress feature because you will probably see a 0 to 100 jump in the progress bar

4893353
google-chrome	firefox
oddly when i brought up firefox to see if it s related to chrome-only the problem went away both on firefox and on google-chrome

4893380
httphandler	httpcontext
...but when i only have an httpcontext available to me such as when i am in a httphandler

4893383
openssl	libcrypto
all the symbols youâ ve listed are exported by libcrypto which is part of openssl

4893402
inherited	properties
notice that there is no parent attribute in the tag but because the name attribute begins with the codefont style name which is a style that you have created this style inherited all style properties from that style

4893435
post	get
so if i m on a particular post inside my header.php i want to be able to get the current post id

4893443
unistd.h	string.h
neither strings.h note the plural name this is not string.h nor unistd.h are part of iso c

4893498
pull	push
then in your individual page layouts you can leverage all the columns push pull alpha omega goodies that make 960 so great

4893531
inherited	properties
you can use the testcomponent object s inherited properties parentapplication to get a reference to the application object

4893565
pop-up	dialog
but with an incorrect username password an authentication required dialog box pop-up in my browser and my flex app won t respond with its proper handler until i click cancel

4893639
put	get
these get put into the app storage directory of course

4893662
hide	show
i need to hide or show images for individual cells in a datagridviewimagecolumn

4893662
hide	show
but this is a bit inconvenient because the image show hide code is now in my cell formatting event

4893700
opera	google-chrome
it s a superset of the ecmascript specification and of current implementations like ie google-chrome and opera

4893718
prng	random
if time returns the same value each time your loop executes you seed the prng with the same value just before you use it each time so when you query it for random numbers it returns the same values

4893727
getter	setter
the main argument for using setter getter everywhere is that it means you can rename the field by just changing its name in 3 places its definition the getter setter methods and all should compile and be fine

4893766
hide	show
i scrapped that and opted for nssegmentedcontrol instead with manual show hide of objects

4893793
sorting	filtering
if your sorting and filtering were more complex you might for example want to use a map-reduce operation to create a collection that s display ready but for a simple date ordered set the existing indexes will work just fine

4893794
filesystems	hfs
after some googling i found out that about resource forks a feature apparently unique to apple s hfs filesystems

4893799
vim	emacs
where setup_vim and setup_emacs would be sub-functions defined later in my file and is a user defined variable ie vim or emacs

4893848
implements	extends
the way i ve implements payment systems like this is to have the base class as you mentioned but have the base class instantiate the required payment vendor which extends the base class

4893865
profiling	debugging
what i want to know is if there is a way for me to know measure profiling while debugging or not if the actual memory used by the application after the list was cleared and null-ed is about the same as before the list was created and populated

4893883
width	height
b i set the flex app s width and height in the application tag to the same as that in the div

4893909
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing that override those methods subclassing that may not even be aware that the superclass constructor is calls those methods must not assume that the subclassing constructor and superclass constructors have been fully executed

4893919
rss	feed
i ve got my rss feed in xml file which i can not edit

4893919
rss	feed
i built my own javascript rss feed reader but it s not working unless i will get rid of all empty tags and all html tags

4893941
filtering	grouping
the grouping by filtering things so that only the items with the right assigned employee are counted but there is a partial cross-product for some of the terms leading to the inflated counts

4893956
vim	textmate
i ve switched from textmate to vim for about a year ago so i ve been immersed in books screencasts and forums about vim and how people customize their .vimrc s

4894000
octal	decimal
for example octal is 8 decimal is 10

4894034
multiplying	division
multiplying that by 26 and you get 23 actually 22.99999416 on my calculator but since the initial division was only two steps we stop here - the very slight inaccuracy is due to the fact that the floating point numbers are being rounded

4894059
ivar	subclassing	uiview	subviews
i m working on creating a uiview subclassing which i m calling marqueelabel that animates a subviews uilabel ivar in a marquee fashion when the uilabel text is too long for the containing view

4894060
int	chars
all you have to do is take chars convert them into an array of int then do the calculation to turn that into a number

4894108
tax	shipping
functionality for prices tax rates multi currency package and shipping specials etc

4894122
opera	firefox
update edge opera and firefox implemented this already

4894148
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of the facebook c# sdk 5.0.1

4894162
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
before it s suggested using firefox safari google-chrome ie8 is not an available option.

4894163
kde	gnome
or try life without kde or gnome for a while

4894179
openrowset	openquery
i prefer openquery over openrowset given that openquery does not require the connection-string definition within the proc

4894183
nfa	dfa
nfa advantages over a dfa the representation uses less memory

4894220
automake	autotools
one option i m considering is using either automake or the whole autotools toolchain to build a makefile

4894238
pull	push
mercurial isn t designed to work on remote repositories except to clone push and pull

4894252
google-chrome	firefox
i really like the design in firefox and google-chrome though

4894257
gif	bmp
i have no idea about image formats such as bmp jpg gif so given any of those would it be possible to read the image to then map that pixel state

4894284
nfa	dfa
similarly many algorithms for generating lr k parsers can be more intuitively motivated by exploring how the handle recognition automaton works in terms of nfas rather in terms of dfas though most algorithms for generating these parsers go directly to the dfa rather than the nfa

4894287
prepare	execute
the first time the rule gets execute it starts the server keeps relevant information in static field s and does whatever is necessary to prepare the test

4894287
ant	maven
a third approach is to let your ant maven gradle whatever build set up tear down common resources before after running the tests

4894287
maven	cargo
the maven cargo plugin is a typical example for this approach

4894288
nfa	dfa
nfa representations are more compact but dfa s are easier to simulate

4894288
nfa	dfa
oftentimes there is an exponential size increase when an nfa is reduced to a dfa

4894291
udp	tcp
i just need to apply the hook to udp packets and not disturb tcp tcp is used for remote debugging

4894295
istream	getline
you can call istream getline -- will read into a character array

4894356
move	drag
the blue label is meant to move when you click and drag it

4894385
put	get
the build products get put in . stage

4894391
disk	ram
if i allocate more than 1gb of ram to the win7 machine in the vmware player settings it goes so slow and is continually swapping to disk

4894399
put	get
the build products get put in . stage

4894413
children	parent
in main why can i access the parent and each of its children

4894417
min	max
i believe you can try using gtk_window_set_geometry_hints function and specify max and min height for your window

4894417
width	height
in this case you would still allow width change whereas height will stay constant

4894427
post	get
i ve got a handler configured for a model and it s rigged for get and post

4894435
rss	feed
serializing objects is very useful when you have to cache things such as rss feed

4894469
width	height
with firefox i guess you ll have to resort to some oblique techniques such as storing the element s original width height in custom properties and using

4894469
width	height
then in the func callback check if the new width height differ from the ones you stored previously take the respective resize action and store them again for the next event callback

4894469
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i haven t been able to find a decent workaround for google-chrome safari and opera yet

4894488
google-chrome	safari
now it s not working on safari or google-chrome

4894488
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie 6 mozilla firefox google-chrome safari opera.

4894507
range	infinity
theoretically scores will range from infinitesimally close to zero down to negative infinity

4894516
jlabel	jlayeredpane
another way to do this is to add the jlabel to a jlayeredpane or to a jpanel held by a jlayeredpane and add a mouseadapter as the jlayeredpane s mouselistener and mousemotionlistener

4894516
jlabel	jlayeredpane
then when clicking on the label move it to the jlayeredpane s jlayeredpane.drag_layer so it moves on top of everything else then place the jlabel on whichever is the most appropriate level on mouse release

4894553
children	parent
this will have the effect that since a parent cannot be copied and since the parent contains its children the pointer to parent that the children have will never go invalid as long as the children are not destroyed since they are destroyed along with their parent

4894553
children	parent
note also that move-semantics and or deep-copying can make the parent copyable or at least movable while keeping the children consistent with their parent

4894553
children	parent
in main why can i access the parent and each of its children

4894559
implements	extends
junit 4.9 is cooking a better solution for this in the form of a builder but i think before then the cleanest although a bit difficult to implements way to address this is to make a custom runner implementation extends one of the existing ones

4894643
degrafa	flex
in flex 3 the easiest way to apply a gradient to an element is to use degrafa and its excellent cssskin class

4894656
children	parent
i just noticed that when i drag a parent is should drag all it s children as well which it currently doesn t

4894687
yesod	happstack
both happstack and yesod have been around a while

4894692
put	get
the only way to get rid of the exception is to put an xmlseealso decimalquantity.class on the position class itself

4894748
google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in firefox but in google-chrome the value of thiswidth is a nan

4894789
width	height
tip .show and .hide doesn t not reserve the width and height of the element.

4894818
portrait	landscape
i have created one game which uses images and my game is in portrait and landscape mode

4894835
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
out of the box you can load a few different image formats with delphi bmp jpg png gif i think these days too

4894914
client-side	server-side
when a asp.net site is published the actual solution is no longer available to the public and all you get is the html representation client-side rather than the source server-side

4894924
inherited	properties
so far i ve found that using inherited to combine shared properties works best

4894938
filtering	grouping
i can t recall the exact syntax but you should be able to annotate each grouping with the number of persons with position worker as well as the total number of persons then filtering it to only the grouping where those two counts are equal

4894945
typedef	struct
the problem is that when you re using typedef struct to introduce a new struct that doesn t require the struct keyword you cannot refer to the typedef -ed name inside the declaration of the struct

4894945
typedef	struct
also your typedef statement is currently invalid because you haven t given a name by which to call struct shareddata

4894953
disk	ram
one option is to get the randomly generated uuid but these are 16 bytes long and since i am using cassandra a nosql database which involves heavy denormalization i am concerned whether i would be wasting lot of disk space ram and other resources if the key could be generated in smaller sizes

4894972
width	height
update if really necessary use screen.width and screen.height to access the width and height of the screen

4894974
width	height
just check to see if the top left corner falls within the bounds of the rectangle and then compare the lengths of the width and height

4894982
x86	64bit
the applications typically are compiled c++ versions with multi-platform binaries for x86-linux amd64-linux win32 win64 and mac os universal binaries with ppc x86 and 64bit

4894983
listview	gridview
views recycling is performed by abslistview and their subclasses listview and gridview

4895037
uicontrol	uibutton
sounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibutton

4895116
post	get
next post said to use getsystemservice to get an object to call getcontext

4895153
matplotlib	scipy
i would hate to do all the work of switching to cx_freeze only to find that it cannot work with numpy matplotlib scipy etc

4895173
addition	multiplication
i have the methods that do both the multiplication and addition but i m just not able to get my head around them

4895200
mvp	presenter
asking confirmation is in pure mvp not a responsibility of the presenter

4895222
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome

4895228
width	height
i did that by getting the width and height of the screen using window.getwidth and window.getheight and tried calculating pixel vs text and displayed accordingly.

4895242
inherited	subclassing
a derivative might mean inherited from or subclassing but either way that terminology would be wrong

4895257
disk	ram
just remember it s a ram disk so it starts out empty every time you reboot

4895264
ienumerable	ilist
ilistsource has a method getlist which returns an ilist which implements ienumerable

4895293
children	parent
you will have to add the children to the parent using a loop but need to call save changes once something like as follows say the parent is order and child is called orderitem

width	height
avoid specifying explicit width and height for your elements and it should scale up to whatever screen resolution available

4897956

i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

4899793
hash	md5
if you re using them to work out whether two pieces of data are the same an md5 hash is pretty good though only if you are working with data that is not being created by malicious entities

4899834
pull	push
after that everything works like normal pull push

4899877
getter	setter
getter and setter accessors should really do not much more than get and set and each get should be consistent with the last corresponding set

4899884
put	get
de isn t dependant on the whole key partial dependency so you put it in another relation to get to second normal form

4899901
punctuation	words
and wrap each words like so preserving the whitespace and punctuation between each words

4899916
inherited	properties
i have an inherited form which has a bool properties that toggles some controls on and off and that should be visible in the designer

4899965
post	get
you can provide two urls one for get and one for post

4899965
post	get
the former is to get status of iis server and post is to reset iis

4900061
fseek	fread
you are using stdio fread fseek etc. which generally has a buffer of sorts

4900078
consistency	acid
sometimes provide eventual consistency instead of acid transactions

4900130
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
so i thought i just needed to do something like that in a for-loop that loops once for every element in the arrays and increments counter

4900160
ienumerable	ilist
you cannot read from an ienumerable in a parallel fashion but you can from an ilist using indexes

4900186
portrait	landscape
16 9-10 4 3 portrait 9-10 16 3 4 landscape square and other

4900191
put	get
you might even have to put it into a driver user mode should work fine in order to get access to the hardware

4900206
listview	gridview
try to use listview instead of gridview if that would be an option for you

4900229
getter	setter
for every table in db i have model class that has appropriate getter and setter and some mandatory methods

4900229
getter	setter
problem is that in runtime genericdao class doesn t know whitch model object it gets and what methods getter and setter exist in it so i need to call mandatory model class method that retrieves list of attributes as multiple string array

4900267
division	multiplication
if you want to keep your integers do the multiplication before the division

4900267
multiplying	division
multiplying by 100 before dividing get the integral part of your division percentage

4900344
folder	directory
in this case you may have to scan the directory structure and have your code make an educated guess as to the correct folder

4900371
hex	binary
it seems from the documentation that these are equivalent and that if you need a binary key you hex encode it and put x in front

4900386
nsstring	uifont
the nsstring uikit additons found here provides many methods for finding the size of a string given a particular uifont and line break mode remember the string uifont etc

4900386
width	height
in order to find out the desired size thus the width and height of the uitableviewcell at the time when heightforrowatindexpath is called

4900461
websphere	ibm
unfortunately ibm websphere is a large product family and making such configurations is product dependent

4900478
google-chrome	firefox
by the way i checked in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 8

4900552
objectdatasource	entitydatasource
it doesn t appear you are binding the datagrid to a control like objectdatasource entitydatasource which would automatically take care of the paging for you

4900553
unix	aix
when this program is run on aix unix 6.1 why is the output

4900577
google-chrome	safari
that should properly render the menu control in google-chrome safari

4900599
ienumerable	iqueryable
that takes an iqueryable and returns an ienumerable which behind the scenes forces the evaluation of the expression tree by the linq provider

4900649
google-chrome	firefox
then i d open up google-chrome developer tools or firebug in firefox and use the element inspector

4900656
google-chrome	firefox
as of july 2017 fillrect is 5-6ã faster on firefox v54 and google-chrome v59 win7x64

4900680
cells	tablecell
use this is in delegate heightforrowatindexpath as well as in cellforrowatindexpath to return the height for tablecell and to update the cells frame

4900699
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
i guess binging nstreecontroller with nsarraycontroller should help but i really don t know steps to bind - nsarraycontroller - nstreecontroller - nsoutlinecontroller

4900736
int	double
if you need to work with int long float and double primitives the most efficient way is to use the primitive themselves

4900746
hide	show
its case sensitive on linux anyway...not sure about other os otherwise thanks...been looking for this...cool way of show hide

4900756
folder	directory
i can copy all the files from multiple directory s but what i want to do is copy all of the directory s with the files inside them as they are where i am copying the from and not putting just the files in my target folder

4900769
folder	directory
i have a folder mounted on my linux box that points to a directory on my windows server where my html files are stored

4900773

post	get
if you use feed you get the latest 30days or 50 post if you use post you get the authors post

4900854
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s a fast statically typed compiled-language that develops like a dynamically typed interpreted-language but performs like native code

4900884
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
do not mix new and delete with malloc calloc realloc and free don t free any memory allocated with new don t delete any memory allocated with malloc

4900903
hide	show
currently i have many other elements working properly but still lack the knowledge needed to hide or show certain columns within the table and having it resize properly

4900919
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
additionally if you call malloc calloc realloc etc. you need to use free to deallocate the memory when done

4900924
pull	push
a list would probably be better for you - push to the front pull off the end

4900925
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
programs don t use malloc realloc free

4901014
daemons	systemd
a operating-system daemons has the feature to execute shell bin sh commands when a certain event occurs when a usb stick is pugged into the systemd

php is executed server-side whereas interaction with the mouse is carried out client-side

4901050
int	chars
main.cpp in function int main int chars

4901053
cos	sin
furthermore i doubt the c code gives the same result as the python code because it uses cos instead of sin

4901069
post	put
maybe you say the solution is to put post and category into the same file

4901115
inherited	properties
missing the namespace in the inherited properties if you are not using one than this does not apply

4901120
gridview	repeater
am fairly new to asp.net so not sure if i should be using a gridview datagrid repeater or what

4901143
gridview	repeater
you surely can use a repeater but if you identify the structure of the data as a grid meaning that you plan or may plan to add new columns in the future for example a gridview is probably the best

4901174
hide	show
what i need is a way to have different behavior on the same notifications types that in my are uikeyboardwill show hide notification

4901197
memcpy	memmove
this is often done to perform efficient bulk copy of data either to and from a file or with memcpy memmove

4901219
getter	setter
i also provided the setter and getter in uibasebean

4901224
inherited	subclassing
as joe mentioned in his comment normal private variables are typically just named with a single underscore the double underscore mangles it so inherited can work without name clashes in subclassing

4901288
mouseleave	mouseenter
uses hover which takes a function to execute on mouseenter and again on mouseleave

4901291
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to fix it in firefox 3.6 that s all i tested and tested it cross-browser to google-chrome 8.0.552.327 and ie 8 with the following css rule on my body element

4901306
put	get
in your the test environment file and i also know that you can put specific pieces of code in a block to get them silenced

4901318
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
following code works fine in firefox ie opera safari google-chrome but webkit-based browsers not always take focus into input

4901460
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
the jlayeredpane should always be the same size but the jpanel and the jscrollpane can change in size

4901460
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
i need the jscrollpane to be able to display the jlayedpane by clicking the arrows and what not if the jpanel and jscrollpane are not large enough to show the entire jlayeredpane

4901460
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
the problem is that with the code below the jlayeredpane always expands to fit the size of the jscrollpane and in the event that the jscrollpane is smaller than the jlayeredpane it does not provide the scrolling ability

4901471
chm	rtf
it can convert from chm to pdf as well as to from epub ebook lit mobi rtf fb2 etc

4901471
google-chrome	firefox
for windows you ll need to install a pdf printer or use a browser that can print to pdf google-chrome has built-in pdf support firefox has a pdf extension

4901476
packets	pcap
i have a small c program on routers a and c that sends a very small packets over udp to the opposite router and i use pcap to detect the times that the packets was sent and the times it arrived at the other end and calculate the average and deviation for a thousand of these tests

4901510
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
to solve your problem you could add the jlayeredpane to a jpanel and then add this jpanel as the view of the jscrollpane after having set the correct insets of the layered pane so that it stays in middle as you want

4901545
switching	screens
it s conceivable that the super user would want to return to the impersonation screens to switching context and impersonate another user

4901578

when i open dialog and click on some checkbox and than i click cancel button

4901881
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
seems to work fine for me in google-chrome firefox and opera sorry on a mac so no ie

4901900
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you should set the image within viewdidload method of the relevant uiviewcontroller as the view won t exist during the init phase and will have been displayed by the time viewdidappear is called

4901905
post	get
i saw some post here that is javascript related but i dont want to mess with it until a get a good guidance to find the issue

versioning	upgrade
last week i had released a versioning of a wordpress plugin that works if the user was doing a fresh install however if they already had the plugin and upgrade it using the wordpress upgrade automatically feature problems occurred and some of the database elements were erased

4902143
int	chars
you re passing in an nsstring which is getting reinterpreted as an int chars

4902143
int	chars
since the string can be stored at a different address in memory each time you run you get that address as an int which is why you get a different chinese chars every time you run your code

4902143
int	chars
just pass in the chars as an int

4902232
stdout	fflush
try inserting a fflush stdout right after your printf a

pandas	pytables
other tools you might look at are pytables and the related package carray larry datarray pandas and tabular

4902251
mouseup	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown
i ended up simulating this behavior by attaching event handlers to mouseup mousedown and mouseover events

4902251
mouseup	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown
i use mouseup and mousedown to control whether it s selecting or not and the actual selection happens in mouseover

4902253
folder	directory
the folder is actually directory background you have to add the empty string value of noworkingdirectory into it and the 1 in the command becomes a v

4902275
directx	gdi
i read somewhere that an hwnd used for directx rendering like wpf can t also use gdi

4902279
lessphp	less.js
you can also use lessphp or less.js

4902318
hash	md5
so i d combine available ids into a long enough bit string and feed it to md5 or sha1 and used enough digits from the middle as the secret hash

4902331

google-chrome has auto-reload and firefox has reloadevery

4902363
jqxhr	deferred
i haven t tested this exhaustively but i built a jquery 1.5 vsdoc that seems to work pretty well other than handling the new jqxhr and deferred return types

4902369
inherited	subclassing
short answer instance variables don t get inherited by subclassing

4902369
inherited	subclassing
it allows for the sort of thing you re trying to do defining an attribute on a parent class that can get inherited and overidden in its subclassing

4902430
next	except
ok here is my updated code which works now except the fading doesnt work the image just flips to the next one and doesn t fade smoothly anymore

4902437
width	height
this gives you the vector x_min y_min width height

4902478
hash	md5
my first idea is to add a hash field to the table probably md5 pull the hash list at the beginning of each run check for duplicates before inserting into the db

4902494
xna	spritebatch
i m using xna to visualize some data and i m trying to use billboards for data and spritebatch for hud text drawing

4902510
put	get
however beware that if you put a strong-named assembly in the bin folder and an assembly with the same strong name exists in the gac then the assembly in the gac will get loaded

4902526
formview	detailsview
i know i can use a detailsview to get a table rendered out but i end up modifying the form so much that i prefer to use the formview

4902555
post	get
i have read all the post and seen how to create a partial class and explicitly set timeout values and i have done exactly that but i still get timed out after one minute

4902579
put	get
edit i have just discovered that if i remove the custom style that i put on the repeatbutton i get the default hover effect

4902588
width	height
the function is intended for wordpress so takes the post- id argument the custom field name width and height of the intended target

4902591
memcpy	strcpy
sample memcpy c implementation as you can see it is quite similar to strcpy

4902630
free	malloc
you can free anything you have created with malloc anywhere in the program

4902630
free	malloc
memory allocated with malloc comes from the heap section of memory and will persist throughout the lifetime of a program unless released with free

4902642
free	malloc
it is not necessary to call malloc and free in the same function but i have some remarks on your code

4902715
int	boolean
compiles under c++ but is always false true is int constant 0x74727565 and boolean equals 0 false or 1 true

4902779

however the fieldset s field label does not display even though it is inside a formpanel

4902794
ready	each
when some work is ready to submit to the main repository we have a directory on a shared drive for each project

4902794
pull	push
we then do a git push to that repo and either a git sync or git pull to update an individual dev machine from the one true source

4902813
submit	submission
i m using google forms a google doc spreadsheet with an automatically generated form that the user can fill in to submit their details and would like to track the submission of the form as a virtual pageview in google analytics so that i can measure conversions

4902821
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade your workstations to 2010 then the runtime libraries are likely still there from a previous versioning note that multiple versioning of vs run concurrently on the same machine just fine

4902837
disk	ram
this looks good you have 1300mb cached data + indexes which means your queries are hitting ram not disk

4902901
int	chars
i would like chars short and int types to be 1 2 and 4 bytes width

4902920
pull	push
all devs pull from and push to central repo as you are doing now

4903016
opencv	emgucv
i have an emgucv opencv wrapper program that subtracts the background from

4903043
mouse	keyboard
no reactions on keyboard no mouse cursor seen or itâ s seen but is not responsibe to mouse movements â this i do not know

4903064
polymorphism	specialization
due to the nature of polymorphism and specialization upper bounds are far more useful than lower bounds as described by the faq access to non-static members and type erasure

4903077
filtering	grouping
current is added to the items that are grouping in your current selector shown is added to current items that are not filtering out

4903134
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
for exemple when you push a viewcontroller on a uinavigationviewcontroller it will cause the viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the techniques described by tom and michael work great in ie firefox and opera and almost work in google-chrome and safari

4903175
google-chrome	safari
the problem is in google-chrome and safari no cssrules property is created for the style sheet

4903179
stdout	stderr
this will set stdout stderr encoding to utf-8 meaning you can print all unicode characters

4903183
rsa	dsa
note that for this price you get quite extensive functionality that covers pkcs#1 and pkcs#7 signing and encryption using rsa dsa signing only and elliptic curves as well as symmetric encryption extensive certificate support and much more

4903198
google-chrome	firefox
in that case i want to index a page which will be prompting the user to download either firefox or google-chrome in order to view the site

4903274
postgresql	mysql
it doesn t take too much effort to get up and running with a local mysql or postgresql server and you ll avoid some nasty surprises by doing all of your development and testing on the same backend you ll be using once you push to production

4903290
ubuntu	linux
i have linux ubuntu 10.10 and when i run the below in a terminal

4903323
mouseup	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown
here is a snippet from a site that has a few buttons that have mouseover mouseup mousedown and hover states

4903395
xslt	xquery
manipulation such as xslt xquery and

4903400
tunnel	traceroute	icmp	udp
ping and traceroute make use of lower layer network protocols icmp and or udp in particular which are layer 4 protocols and will not work over an http layer 7 tunnel

4903400
tunnel	packets
in any case even if you could convince the http proxy to open a raw tcp session for you which is how some http tunnel works you would not receive the necessary packets to confirm that the host is reachable

4903400
traceroute	packets
icmp echo reply in the case of ping or the time-to-live expired icmp packets in the case of traceroute

4903411
postgresql	mysql
explicit support for popular apis such as linq-to-sql entity framework and odata and databases such as sql azure sqlite mysql oracle and postgresql

4903469
width	height
indeed inner div will have top left of outer div as root coordinates the problem is laying down in how divs block elements are rendered when no width height attributes are set check this below it will answer your question

4903469
width	height
now the browser renders div#outer at top left corner of the browser s window with the width of 100px auto calculates the height based on the font used to display the string outer

4903469
width	height
if you have more content in your div#inner then the height width of your div#outer the inner one will overlap and go out the boundaries of div#outer

4903477
ireport	subreports
ireport designer allows you to create sophisticated layouts containing charts images subreports crosstabs and much more

4903541
webclient	httpwebrequest	post	get
due to the async nature of http access via webclient or httpwebrequest in silverlight 4 when i want to do multiple http get post serially i find myself writing code that looks like this

4903544
mousemove	mousedown
if this works out then you just need to find the appropriate event from the scroller or canvas that tells you when scrolling is occuring at worst you could capture mousedown mark a flag then capture mousemove and if the flag is set then run the code to invalidate re-validate

4903560
put	get	draggable	droppable
what i want to do is to put a draggable object and a droppable image in a panel and drag the draggable object on the image and get the position of where it was dropped

4903560
draggable	droppable
newly-updated js fiddle demo featuring revert invalid so dropping the draggable div anywhere but the droppable div will cause the draggable to animate back to its starting position

4903560
width	height
edited to add in the height width requirement and also to tidy up a few things and improve the css

4903561
google-chrome	firefox
it only works in google-chrome and firefox

4903561
opera	safari
i haven t tested in safari opera yet

4903564
sikuli	eggplant
we are currently in the process of porting a ui automation dsl domain specific language we built for eggplant to sikuli

4903571
post	get
ok after going over literally hundreds of these post i finally found a quick and easy way to get a valid page with a like button or any other facebook widget on it

4903583
width	height
the box model is such that the height and width pertain to the content area of the element

4903583
width	margin
this means the elements actual width is defined as width + padding + border + margin

4903583
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like just about everyone ie8 google-chrome firefox supports that which is good

4903591
children	parent
it is probably better to kill the parent before the children

4903591
children	parent
otherwise the parent may likely spawn new children again before he is killed himself

4903639
post	get
ok after going over literally hundreds of these post i finally found a quick and easy way to get a valid page with a like button or any other facebook widget on it

4903642
treemap	treeset
note a priorityqueue is not a list if you didn t care what type of collection it was the simplest would be to use a treeset which is just like a treemap but is a collection

4903642
arraylist	treeset
i suggest you write a list wrapper for a arraylist linkedlist priorityqueue treeset or one of the other sorted collections and implement the methods which will actually be used

4903645
put	get
i read that one of the methods to get around this was to put my listboxes into an updatepanel which i did and i am getting further

4903663
opera	firefox
i ve tested in firefox 3.6 chromium 8 opera 11 ubuntu 10.10

4903683
comparator	comparable
but sorting a list can have more complications from the side effects of duplicates and other constraints like making every object comparable or as i show in my code having to have a comparator that can do the work instead

4903693
range	minimum
second merge a1 and a2 starting the front of a1 write the minimum of the two elements being compared to the current index in a1 where the current index starts at 0 and range up to a1.length + a2.length - 1

4903707
for-loop	loops
just loops using a for-loop through them and check for the one whose editing property is set to yes

4903733
width	height
width and height is width and height border and padding is something else - to me it does t get anymore logical than that

4903733
width	height
width and height is width and a height but sometimes when you choose to set them to 100 they are also border and padding - now that would make no sense to me

4903783
post	get
i have been able to write code that performs get and post both of which do not have a request body

4903846
google-chrome	firefox
however in firefox and google-chrome when in the admin the return link redirects to the custom 404 page i have for the web app

4903846
google-chrome	firefox
again this works without a problem in ie but in firefox and google-chrome on page load the session variable displays the 404 page link and after setting it displays the correct link

4903846
google-chrome	firefox
i added the faviocon file and the link in the head of the site.master file and google-chrome and firefox now work fine

4903896

4904010
securitymanager	classloader
all jvms begin with a boot classloader responsible for loading the user s initial class along with some of the built-in types like class and securitymanager but users can provide their own classloader to find classes from other sources

vb6	vba
however as one who migrated from vb6 vba to the endless and wonderful world of true inheritance available in .net i can say that discouraging the newcomer from seeing it as an end-all solution is not necessarily a bad thing

post	get
if you need to do this via a post request versus get write the parameters in the body

post	get
perhaps with some additional browser info we can figure out what is causing the problem but for now it seems jquery does not want to guarantee functionality except on get and post

4909198
squash	merge
if that s all you want then maybe what you really want to do is squash all your merge commits down to only one of their parents so they look like a single commit instead of a merge

the equals method should be overridden i kind of know how to write a tostring method

4909281

however it also resets the y coordinate so we go ahead and set the frame again to configure the x and y coordinatesâ in this example 10.0f for both x and y â leaving the width alone and keeping the height set to whatever -sizetofit calculated

4909290
pull	push
developers can still push pull from one another but shared gets a little more oversight

4909296

profiling	instrumentation
our counting profiling require only enough space for track counts for each basic block stored in an array but some additional code space as instrumentation

4910205
int	chars
when you typecast from an int to a chars you are cutting down the number of bytes used from 4 to 1

4910215
int	chars
c will take the least-significant byte when doing a narrowing conversion so if you have the int value 0xcafebabe and you convert it to a chars you ll get the value 0xbe

4910215
int	chars
of course there s no actual guarantee that an int is four bytes or that a chars is one but i m pretty sure that the logic for doing the truncation will always be the same and will just drop the higher-order bits that don t fit into the chars

4910224
width	height
depending on the orientation of the image i set either the width or height to 75 and the other axis to auto

4910440
dbml	edmx
my thoughts you re embedding sql in code in a string as opposed to using linq which is at least syntax-checked which helps provided you keep your dbml or edmx mapping file synched with your database structure

4910465
post	get
then load the values from the fields in the submit function and then use .ajax to submit the post request and define a success call function to do a get ajax request

4910719
getter	setter
edit you may additionally be wondering why people would create a private member variable and then expose a public getter and setter to manipulate that variable

4910719
getter	setter
if instead there are public getter setter methods you can alter the private variable as needed and do whatever conversion or logic is necessary in the methods essentially keeping the change transparent

4910719
getter	setter
the habit of making variables private and wrapping them in public getter setter when necessary.

4910719
getter	setter
but on the comparatively rare occasions where it happens it ll be a lot easier with the getter setter in place

4910719
getter	setter
basically it s a design that adds essentially very little up-front code a one-time creation of a getter setter as opposed to on-going maintenance of member variable access to allow you the freedom to make changes to the class without breaking the binary compatibility of the object and breaking its contract.

4910719
getter	setter
it s definitely not a good habit to always write getter setter for all private members

4910719
getter	setter
the idea is to use getter setter for members which logically should be public

4910719
getter	setter
for example if the class defines a piece of text in a display and the members being modified by the getter setter are the font face size weight etc

4910745

4911507
int	double
programs that align their data on natural boundaries and adjust structures and other items in int multiples of these sizes can see as much as double the performance without any other effort

4911507
int	chars
similarly using an int instead of a chars for a variable even if it is only going to count to 10 can be faster

4911517
rel	alt
q3 html attributes href rel alt id name title etc. each have a purpose

4911550
hide	show
i would like to hide a div when a button is clicked and show it when a link is clicked but what is happening is it simply blinks whether showing it or hiding it

4911550
hide	show
i m calling a js function when clicking a link to show the div and calling a js function when submitting the form in the div to hide the div again

4911550
hide	show
-i ve also tried putting the hide show functions directly following the relevant div in the html code but no change

4911550
hide	show
js function to hide note this never gets used unless i can get the div to show up and stay in the first place - updated

4911550
hide	show
html that initially show the div does the same flashy-thing as when trying to hide the div if it is already visible on page load

4911557
background-image	background-color
while background-color and background-image exist on separate layers within an object -- meaning they can co-exist -- css gradients seem to co-opt the background-image layer

4911576
pull	push
then you ll be able to push pull to and when you clone it the clone update will automatically attach and clone down the separate subrepos

4911623
margin	background-color
this is favourable because you can change these sizes later in your stylesheet or add other parameters like background-color or margin to transition

4911630
sorting	grouping
remove the grouping by from your query and update the sorting to

4911639
google-chrome	firefox
that always works for me in firefox and google-chrome

4911743
next	except
the next way i would want to loop through that is through the same exact values except in reverse order basically inside out instead of outside in and actually thinking about this now i could just loop through the first method backwards

4911746
jobs	cron
i looked at cron jobs but my understanding is that php can not invoke a cron job directly

4911748
getter	setter
now in the above code i wanna know when we can use the getter setter methods of btn variable without declaring it as property then what is the need to declare it as property and which is the better way to set the value of name

4911758
lisp	scheme
app inventor doesn t give you access to the source to them the visual blocks are the source and even if they wanted to give you access to the source it would just look like partially compiled scheme lisp anyway

4911788
folder	directory
i have a directory table folder table and documents table

4911788
folder	directory
directory have many folder folder have many documents

4911788
folder	directory
on a web page i have a select where a user can choose a directory which has many folder

4911788
folder	directory
this query is for an ajax call that loads a second select with the list of all folder belonging to the directory getting the id s and names to load the folder select

4911788
folder	directory
so this query will be made against one directory to get a list of folder id s and folder names for that directory

4911797
getter	setter
you declare a variable as a property in order to auto-generate getter and setter methods

4911797
getter	setter
then the getter and setter are generated with the synthesize directive

4911833
inject	interceptor
you could have the interceptor read all the key value pairs from your database and inject them into the value stack

4911873
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you could try setting breakpoints on the constructors of fileinputstream and or fileoutputstream with conditions to check whether the filename provided matches your target filename check the parameter on the constructors that take a filename check the file.getname on the constructors that take a file

4911889
width	height
how can i get reference to the parent container in itemtemplate and then modify it s height and width

4911890
post	get
to get the custom fields associated to a post you can query it this way

4911899
width	height
hidden means to never create scroll bars whatever is outside my width and height is completely invisible

4911903
ivar	subclassing
if you declare the ivar as private and provide a property for the subclassing to use then the subclassing is forced to use the property in their implementation although there are ways they could cheat rather than giving them direct access to the ivar

4911904
bindingsource	dataview
if you re using bindingsource then simply set the datasource of the bindingsource to your dataview dv in this case

4911907

4912180
uilabel	cagradientlayer
i understand that with uilabel we can get this kind of gradient using cagradientlayer

4912199
getter	setter	accessor	properties
properties are entities that behave like fields but are internally handled by getter and setter accessor functions

4912199
getter	setter
in the old syntax we had to specify the getter and setter methods directly in our code to implement properties - wasn t all that well received as you might guess

4912218
entity-relationship	diagram
here is a link for the entity-relationship diagram sqlzoo.net a1.htm

4912231
nsxmlparser	nsmutablestring
i have verified that the url parameter is valid with appropriate content created as a nsmutablestring built via an nsxmlparser then examined in the initwithbaseurl method in the debugger but after assigning the result of the copy operation to baseurl the baseurl variable is out of scope and remains invalid

4912266

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i got this php uploading script which is working fine on mozilla google-chrome opera safari

4912353
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can verify that sending copy to an nsmutablestring does produce another object while sending copy to an immutable nsstring is equivalent to retain just because wasting memory on exact copies of immutable objects is inefficient

4912369
submit	submission
basically this interface allows a program to have producers which create and submit tasks and even examine the results of those submission without knowing about any other consumers of the results of those tasks

4912404
direct3d	bitblt	direct3d	gdi	bitblt	gdi

x86	64bit
the x86 family of cpus contains 16- 32- and 64bit processors from several manufacturers with backward-compatible instruction sets going back to the intel 8086 introduced in 1978

4913043
x86	64bit
questions like how to speed up this code with vectors or any other tricks are fine for x86 even if the intention is to compile for 64bit

4913043

this well-commented answer uses 16-bit ms-dos system calls to read the string but the actual loop over the string works the same for 32 or 64bit code

4913044
x86	64bit	ia-32	x86	16-bit	64bit
the x86 family includes the 32-bit ia-32 and 64bit x86-64 architectures as well as legacy 16-bit architectures

nunit	mspec
you can describe both categories with any framework but keep in mind that code-only approaches nunit mspec etc. require a business analyst to be capable of writing c#

4913127
google-chrome	firefox
works as expected in firefox and google-chrome but ie just processes the submit action normally without any ajax request

4913168

i m looking for a simple algorithm that given a rectangle with width w and height h splits the rectangle into n more or less equal sized and shape rectangles and calculates the center of these rectangles

4913727
width	height
get the textviews paint with textview.getpaint and then calculate the width and height from

4913740
onresume	onpause
also i have removed basic onpause onresume functions so that you guys can understand the code easily

4913744
width	height
a simple algorithm is to split vertically into n equal sized strips of height h and width w n

4913744
width	height
if your initial rectangle has width 60 and height 20 then using the factor pair 5 2 will give ten rectangles of size 60 5 20 2 12 10 which is close to square

you might also want to try udp instead of tcp no timeouts possible

4913835
inherited	subclassing
validate uniqueness amongst multiple subclassing with single table inherited

4913885
public	protected
on the other hand protected fields and of course the parameters of public methods form an api that becomes much more flexible by using interfaces because that allows subclasses clients to choose which implementation class they want to use even classes they supply themselves and which didn t even exist when the api was created

4913891
jobs	cron
some of this new functionality requires cron jobs to be run periodically but i m hitting a problem

4913893
put	get
what i would like is a selector that will get everything inside of the body tag without having to put a div around all that content

4913913
width	height
you can t have largest height and width you need to choose another criteria

4913913

joptionpane	jdialog
first off usually an application has one jframe and then if it needs to show another window does so as a modal or non-modal dialog such as can be obtained with a jdialog or joptionpane

4914063
japplet	jdialog
this way if i want to display the gui as a stand alone app a dialog or an applet i can pop it into the contentpane of a jframe or jdialog or japplet respectively or if as an inner panel of a more complex gui then insert it there or in an application with a swapping view then as a card in a cardlayout as noted above

4914065
post	get
it seems like there is a bit of confusion between wcf which is the name given to microsofts overall abstraction for network programming and a specific protocol http that defines verbs like post and get that wcf will be using to communicate

4914169
xml-rpc	json-rpc
i have just started looking and reading up on xml-rpc json-rpc and soap

ddms	adb
in any case you should run the app in the emulator or on a connected phone cause the crash and then log into the device log with ddms or adb logcat

4914254
button	checkbox
the problem i m having is when i have a list of checkbox or radio button in my container

4914254
button	checkbox
to have labels beside radio button or checkbox clickable they must be contained in a label

4914324
floor	sqrt
start with floor sqrt given and decrement until you find something whose square is a divisor

4914405
inherited	properties
to reflect all properties you set on an object use reflectionobject which inherited from reflectionclass and works on runtime instances

4914421

you can t change the cron jobs to run on a different version then the default

4914496
unsigned	short
buffer is a pointer to a pointer to an unsigned short

4914496
unsigned	short
if you dereference buffer you get a pointer to an unsigned short which can be treated as an array of unsigned short s

4914505
button	checkbox
i also have a button that when pressed needs to check if any of the checkbox have been checked but i m not sure how to get this done

4914521
onresume	onpause
the documentation says i need to call onpause onresume but it works fine without it so i am wondering

4914528
addition	modulo
this direction you rotate modulo addition in way that it points to move that you have to make

4914536
superclass	subclassing
it depends on whether you want your subclassing code to execute before or after the superclass code for that method

4914536
superclass	subclassing
i would say it s more common to do your own custom code after the call to super so that your subclassing code follows the superclass code

4914545
client-side	server-side
less runs on both the client-side ie 6+ webkit firefox and server-side with node.js

4914623
int	double
in the function call because x has no visible prototype yet s will be promoted to int and f will be promoted to double

4914683
int	double
first of all without a prototype the arguments to a function always undergo default promotions before being passed as parameters so for example all the smaller int types get promoted to int and float gets promoted to double

4914708
opera	firefox
the problem is that i can t use any event on the iframe in firefox and opera ie untested for example i would like to track the onkeyup event

4914734
free	malloc
just an idea you could also implement a memory allocator and track all calls to malloc and free

4914748
cpu	processors
i can see in activity monitor that a ruby processors comes up and just spins chewing up cpu as it goes

ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby stand out as obvious candidates since they are .net languages

4914837
post	get
it depends on what post or possibly get data your server is receiving from the form

4914856
width	height
you can create thumbnails for retrieved images just by creating an img element and settings its width and height to something smaller

4914856
width	height
there i ve assumed it s apprpropriate to force the image to be a certain width and height frequently with thumbnails it s useful if they re all the same size although the above will mess with aspect ratios

4914874
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient uses httpwebrequest under the covers

4914909
onresume	onpause
so calling glsurfaceview s onpause and onresume is definitely required

4914955
superclass	subclassing
why does initializing subclassing require calling the superclass #39

4914959
getter	setter	inherited	properties
however i think that the use of protected member variables should be made conciously because you not only plan to inherited but also because there is a solid reason derived classed shouldn t use the properties setter getter defined on the base class

4914959
getter	setter
when we define a getter setter on our base for a member variable we are essentially saying that this is how i want this variable to be referenced used

4914959
getter	setter
while there are design-driven exceptions in which one might need to alter the behavior created in the base class getter setter methods it seems to me that this would be a decision made after careful consideration of alternatives

4914959
getter	setter
for example when i find myself needing to access a member field from a derived class directly instead of through the getter setter i start thinking maybe that particular property should be defined as abstract or even moved to the derived class

4914959
getter	setter
of course in many cases it doesn t matter because we are not implementing anything within the getter setter beyond access to the variable

4914959
getter	setter
but again if this is the case the derived class can just as easily access through the getter setter

4914959
getter	setter
if the behgavior of the getter setter for a member field on the base class is changed in some way and a derived class references the protected field directly there is the potential for trouble

4914966
profiling	debugging
no debugging or profiling facilities

post	get
the recommended solutions to mitigating json hijacking involve non-rest-full json post to get data

4914994
post	get
this blog describes a csrf issue regarding json hijacking and recommends using json post to get data

4914994
post	get
since using a http post to get data isn t very rest-full i d looking for a more restfull solution that enables rest actions per session or per page

4914994
post	get
i agree that it isn t restfull to get data using the recommended post workaround

4915003
rubygems	bundler
the cause of your problem is that under rails 3 rubygems are managed by a tool called bundler which manages all the dependencies between your gems and ensures that your application is always started with the right versions of the right gems even when you move it between servers

4915004
super	self
then you check if self is correct it may happen that super returned nil for any reason your w h parameters are incorrect

4915004
width	height
what you shouldn t do is to reassign height and width as this is already done by the shape initializer

4915022
post	get
despite the fact that the chat window makes ajax calls to the server every few seconds and always get at least one piece of data back also sends data to the server via ajax whenever the logged-in user post a message they are timed out after 20 minutes as if nothing was happening

i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

4915074
mkmapview	mkannotationview
your best bet might be to draw the circle yourself either using another uiview on top of the mkmapview or using a mkannotationview within the map view

4915079
fast-forward	merge
but even if b..a has something you might still be able to merge without conflicts so the above shows two things that there will be a fast-forward and thus you won t get a conflict

4915125
addition	multiplication
also note that you do not want you want if you insist on using parentheses though think it s pretty silly given that the relative precedence of multiplication and addition is quite well known

4915149
for-loop	loops
i know how to set up a for-loop in a function but i can t quite figure out how to break up a loops where it would stop and start

4915154
getter	setter
it d be nice if c# had a little syntax construct that implemented view model getter and setter automatically. but once you have that it s obvious how to modify it to inject logic

4915159
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox google-chrome etc

4915159
post	get
normally i would just laugh and post the old get a new browser link but unfortunately i do not have the luxury on this one

4915176
jmenubar	jmenuitem
the jframe itself has jmenubar where in the menu structure there is a new game option among other not yet implemented jmenuitem that will create a new canvas object and replaces the old one and validates using the validate methods repaints the jscrollpane

4915185
queue	fifo
think of it like a fifo queue

4915194
awt	swing
your problem may be due to your mixing awt and swing heavy weight and light weight components in the same program and this is something that shouldn t be done unless you have definite need of this and know what you re doing

4915194
post	get
if you create and post this type of code you ll likely get a decent and complete solution quickly

4915200
cos	sin
basically i set the normal to 0 0 + - 1 when setting the top base and then side normals are cos toradian beta sin toradian beta 0

4915227

mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
try unbinding mouseenter mouseleave mouseover and mouseout

4915343
mouseleave	mouseenter
unbinding just mouseenter and mouseleave is sufficient

4915343
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
since not all browsers support these two events natively if i recall correctly only ie does mouseenter maps to mouseover and mouseleave maps to mouseout with some additional logic in each case to emulate the events

4915349
maven	pom.xml
however maven downloads these dependencies when i add the repository names to my pom.xml

4915377

your canvas is missing width and height properties

4915435
post	get
annotations are used to differentiate between get methods and post methods

4915435
post	get
note that this method is annotated as requestmethod.get which means it s invoked for get requests but not post requests

4915457
free	malloc
the rule is simple each individual malloc must correspond to a single individual free

4915471
inherited	properties
also if you don t have any log level specified for org.apache.http in your log4j properties file then it will inherited the log4j.rootlogger level

i need to create an rss feed for our information system which is written in php

4915504
rss	feed
i had no problems with the rss 2.0 specification nor with the creation of rss feed generator

4915525
apache	nginx
the apache version allows customizing the symlink resolving behavior for backward compatibility reasons while the nginx version only supports one type of behavior

4915538
folder	directory
the problem i m running into that i can t think of a good way to solve is when there are two folder in the same directory the path gets built wrong the second time

4915657

4915704
min	max
i ve played with all the options for ties.method option average max min random none of which are designed to provide the desired result

4915733
bluepill	runit
you can run chef-client as a daemon -d option as used in init scripts or under a service management tool like upstart runit daemontools or bluepill

4915733
daemons	launchd
you can certainly also launchd it from cron - just make sure to not run daemons mode there

4915784
postgresql	mysql
use what you can but if you need free and high quality databases use postgresql or mysql

4915787
strlen	substr
you don t need to use a strlen call since as noted in the substr docs

4915846
width	margin
just float your li elements left with a fixed width give your ul margin 0 auto to center and it should display fine

4915854
put	get
if yes is there any sample code so i can easily just put my data and get my chart

4915872
width	height
if you really do want to manipulate the width and height of the border in the template then use some binding to an intermediatory object i ll call it sizer held as a static resource -

4915872
width	height
now you simply have to create a sizer class that has the properties factor width height

4915872
width	height
when factor is changed you change the width and height properties and let the bindings handle update all the existing borders

4915885
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome in either mode you have to set the property on the body to make the page scroll while it is ignored if you set it on the html

4915885
google-chrome	safari
since the page is in standards mode they have to set it on both the html and body or it won t work in safari google-chrome

one of these libraries is jshashtable but when i try to create a new hashtable object in main.js google-chrome and firefox throw a referenceerror complaining that the variable does not exist

4915951
postgresql	mysql
i m attempting a transition from mysql to what seems to be the stricter and less rails-friendly postgresql

4915952
folder	directory
you could just place the zip file in the magento root directory and run unzip from the command line that doesn t do the silly obliterate the current folder contents that the gui does

4916041
postgresql	mysql
postgresql will probably be harder to install than mysql on xampp but i believe that you can get a lot out of doing so

4916041
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

4916074
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
you have to subclass it the uiimageview and override one of touchesbegan touchesmoved or touchesended methods according to what you want to do

4916104
realloc	malloc
you might want to consider using malloc and realloc

4916113

i prefer using powermockito with mockito but if this is not possible i have no problem with using easymock instead

4916226
bibtex	latex
use bibtex along with a .bst file which spits out html rather than latex

4916281
tinyint	boolean
it doesn t make sense to index tinyint columns if they are used as boolean because this index won t be selective enough

4916287
union-find	tree
so far i ve only been able to implement the minheap and sets for union-find i am still unsure of the purpose of union-find and a sorting algorithm for the purpose of creating a spanning tree

4916320

converts records to object instances or dictionary or namedtuple if you prefer

4916396
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays indexes

4916400
union	distinct
in particular its two operations - union and find - correspond to the act of connecting together two distinct groups of nodes that were previously not connected as would be the case if you added an edge that connected two trees contained in different parts of the spanning forest

4916412
post	get
what jfoucher s code does is get the post values and if they aren t both set then it will create another rule

4916421
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux

4916426
coff	omf
test.obj warning lnk4033 converting object format from omf to coff

4916459

since i m essentially doing the same thing twice i made a method to multiplying a base number incrementally and add the sum of all the answers togethor

4916856
for-loop	loops
using for-loop is much simpler if you use condition as limit for breaking loops

4916856
division	modulo
most programming languages have have operator modulo division

4916899
photoshop	paint.net
also paint.net or photoshop can t open .ico files

4916926
for-loop	loops
second isum is declared within your for-loop which means it will keep being re-initialized to 0 every time loops executes

4916937
for-loop	loops
before matlab version 2008a or a version near that release for loops took a major hit in any matlab code because the interpreter a layer between the very readable script and a lower level implementation of the code would have to re-interpret the code each time through the for-loop

4916949
hide	show
hi i just want to be able to toggle to hide show a div respectively with a class

4916956
post	get
in this post i showed one way to create them at the same time that your database is get created by code first via sqlcommand method in a custom initializer class but it s not really different from manually creating it yourself

4916982
mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown event would define one corner and the mouseup the second

4916983
width	height
no matter what i set in this line i ve tried explicitly setting the zoom setting the width height in pixels etc. the device completely ignores it and renders the website very small and anchored to the upper left-hand corner of the screen

i have a problem with jquery fadein or fadeout method

4916992
fadein	fadeout
the fadein or fadeout method causes a scroll to the article position

4917047
richtextbox	textblock

4917123
accessor	properties
in this case the assignment to the .hey properties a retain is implict in the accessor method

4917124
folder	dir
rails will auto load stuff in models dir however for the lib folder you gotta tell to do so by checking config application.rb and adding this

4917128
keydown	keyup
i should probably mention that this is not the best workaround because if you have some other keydown or keyup listener it will remove them as well although ive showed you where the problem is it s not that hard to make this fix more solid from here

4917162
google-chrome	firefox
the good news first you won t need much more than javascript if you just want to access bookmarks and send them to a server neither on firefox nor on google-chrome

4917180
automake	autotools

4917255
width	height
note i attempt using swfobject.embedswf path divid width height to load other videos which doesn t work

4917256
pop-up	dialog
i wonder if i might disable the keychain dialog that pop-up whenever my application wants to access the keychaindata

4917259
folder	directory
with the help of some basic command line applications it creates subfolders in your documents folder mkdir -p it will not overwrite existing directory

4917278
width	height
set it s height the same as resulting div but keep width auto

4917287
int	chars
indexes work better with int than chars varchar go with a dedicated int primary key column

4917300
division	modulo
note that gcc at least is able to compile this to x86 code which does not use any division operations since the modulo is a constant

4917345
post	get
i need to be able to access post and get data

4917361
agile	sprint
what i ve been told from people who ve been using scrum for a while ie this is opinion is that doing uml diagrams can be a bit time consuming because as your development methodology is agile your requirements could very easily radically change after the first sprint s show-and-tell which means you could be doing fairly big redesigns

4917362
struts	xwork
i don t know of an easy plug-and-play solution for this so you will probably have to implement it yourself -- plan on spending quite a bit of time just coming to grips with how the localization features of struts 2 and xwork are implemented

4917388
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception unchecked-exception

4917388
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception

the custom control has a mousedown and mouseup event which passes a message up from the control to the parent.parent custom control - day panel - calendar form and calls public methods startdragging and stopdragging respectively

4917392
mouseup	mousedown
i can see it being added and removed on mousedown and mouseup but it is being added at 0 0 under the panels and day labels

4917392
mouseup	mouseenter
if i remove the mouseup code the control does drag with the mouse however as soon as the mouseenter the panels which the control is sadly underneath the drag action stops

post	put
the post is generated as a static html and put somewhere in public_html

4917404
erlang	ocaml
examples of large projects developed with functional languages include xen ocaml ericsson s infrastructure erlang and twitter scala - though i m cheating a little bit here since scala also fully integrates the object-oriented paradigm

4917459
put	get
since no sane jquery plugin makes any assumptions about the server-side technologies you will just have to get the jquery plugin to overwrite the div in which you put the output of your php twitter feed library

4917467
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
to be clear i am not using ubuntu but linux mint 9 which is based on ubuntu 10.04

4917474
width	height
i ve tried all sorts of combinations of translate and even skipping scale altogether and using a width and height in shape

4917537
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
control which handled mousedown event captures mouse input and receives all following mousemove events until it releases mouse input on mouseup event that s why calendar_mousemove is not called

4917537
mousemove	mousedown
handle mousemove event for the same control which generated mousedown event

4917566
ubuntu	mint
i have the most recent mint which i assume is 9 based on ubuntu 10 i think it said

uiview	subviews
and this is the drawincontext forrect method of the container uiview where the subviews are drawn

4917710
free	malloc
you only need to free memory that you have previously allocated using malloc

4917710
free	malloc
in this case none of your functions call malloc and hence they don t need to free anything

4917722
strcpy	malloc	strlen	strcpy
you need to malloc a buffer of size strlen command + 1 to strcpy from command into

4917802
isotope	masonry
in its stead you can use isotope - which does filtering a lot easier than masonry

value inlining - as far as i know yes - they will be inline in all of those scenarios

4917867
submit	submission
i am submission a delete request through an anchor tag link and using remote true to submit it via js to use jquery

4917876
free	malloc
nothing is created or destroyed so malloc and free are not involved

4917880
jobs	cron
both of the above scripts are run as cron jobs once per day

4917888
serializable	deserialization
this is probably something that makes kryo very efficient for serializable and deserialization

4917899
mouse	keyboard
it seems to be done for accessibility reasons so that a keyboard can be used to fill out and send a form without using a mouse

4917962

4918120
libpng	libz
note that libpng is linked with libz

4918120
libpng	libz
if it wasn t anybody who ever links against libpng would also need to link against libz

4918120
libpng	libz
as it is you can link against libpng without even knowing that libz is involved

4918158

4918339
versioning	upgrade
first upgrade xcode and the ios sdk to a recent versioning 4.2 in my case

4918464

if you look at servicerecord.getconnectionurl int boolean you see that you can require that your device be the master by passing true or you can allow master or slave mode by passing false

4918520
folder	directory
but glob doesn t work recursively as far as i know so if your logs are in folder inside of that directory you d be better off looking at what ignacio vazquez-abrams posted

what i have done instead is used the already supported text-shadow property supported in google-chrome firefox opera and ie 9 i believe

4919262

4920978
getter	setter
only provide getter setter if it is actually needed don t just do it automatically

4921016
rss	feed
i know that you can start reading the rss feed of a facebook page itself now perhaps just a little parsing is all you need

4921032
getter	setter
another reason you sometimes want to use getter and setter is the use of libraries

4921064

4921982
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all major browsers have a debugger built-in ie google-chrome safari or available as a add-on firebug for firefox

4922003
int	boolean
int rather than boolean

4922021
accessor	properties
the self.location means you are accessing a properties via a generated properties accessor

4922041
udp	tcp
if you have a custom layer on top of udp then the performance of this will also need to be taken into account when comparing against tcp - so i don t think anyone on so will be able to give you a definitive answer

4922056
put	get
i ve seen a couple of macros that get put on the page that needs to use https and essentially just check the protocol used and do a response.redirect with the correct protocol if necessary

4922103
min	max
this is the function i used to replace some user defined functions which selected the min max dates from a list of upto ten dates

4922158
qgraphicsitem	qobject
mason chang that makes sense but if the emits of signals that happen when using qgraphicsobject is what makes qgraphicsobjects slower than qgraphicsitems then you can avoid this by inheriting from qobject and qgraphicsitem instead of using qgraphicsobject

4922184
inherited	properties
basically this is a kind of special case where some properties inherited data context of the owner object

4922184
inherited	properties
thus for example the inherited context always works on properties of type freezable another interesting article about freezables

4922191

4922432
folder	directory
so then i find the .tex file assign4.tex in the r directory and copy it over to the folder in my documents documents where the .rnw file is sitting to keep everything in one place

4922476
post	get
your issue is that jquery does not support making delete calls via ajax so it is doing a get or a post which is not found on the controller because you are restricting to delete

4922476
post	get
request to make post or get

4922531

4922583
switching	airplane
essentially we are sat in the office switching airplane mode on and off to simulate entering exiting signal then adjusting our app to fix any issues this may arise

4922590
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing
but yes in a simple superclass subclassing relationship i would use getter setter instead of making the field protected

4922618
for-loop	loops
i used a for-loop as this guarantees the order of the iteration what a foreach loops wouldn t do

4922623
implements	extends
i followed the method of extends the user class for implements custom users in my application

4922640
inherited	properties
as you said that other ui controllers work with 0.5 alpha there should be no difference with uislider since they inherited alpha properties from uiview class and there is reference to the opaque properties you should always set the value of this properties to no if the view is fully or partially transparent

4922645
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
references - basically exactly the same as safari link for ie firefox + opera

4922655

4922801
qgraphicsitem	qobject
there are two options that i know of use qgraphicsobject or inherit from qobject and qgraphicsitem

4922801
qgraphicsitem	qobject
inheriting from qobject and qgraphicsitem

4922801
qgraphicsitem	qobject
when constructing a class that inherits from qobject and qgraphicsitem it seems that you get the most interesting feature of qgraphicsobject minus the performance hit you are able to define slots and emit signals in your class but you don t inherit the default implementation of qgraphicsobject that would constantly emit signals on changes you might not be interested in

4922828
daemon	cron
i can see that the cron daemon is running this task in the cron log but the database table it s supposed to pull records into doesn t change

i have a div with id as mq i have to get the values of textbox and textarea within this div id mq using jquery foreach

4922985
multiplying	add
this structure defines complex numbers allows to multiplying via add them via operator+ and get their module via magnitude2

4923022
equals	gethashcode
2 if you override gethashcode in .net you should also override the equals method

4923066
multiplying	add
the class contains two variables r and i a constructor that takes two float args an operator to multiplying an operator to add and a function to calculate the magnitude

4923072
google-chrome	firefox
when i load the page it looks fine in google-chrome ie but in firefox it s ignoring the styling completely

4923080

fwiw regarding apache 2.2 virtualhosting and mod_mime tested on debian linux and os x leopard and snow leopard

4923109
google-chrome	safari
tested against google-chrome unstable trunk and safari webkit nightly which eliminates the mime octet-stream warnings for both the ttf and otf font types

4923127
typedef	struct
to avoid the redundant struct in variable declarations use of the aforementioned typedef is required and allows you to use only the a instance

4923141
getter	setter
you must be aware however that only properties that have public getter and setter are serialized

4923159
keydown	keyup
binding the event didnt work...tried with keypress keydown keyup

4923280
implements	extends
you need to create the schema first no matter how big or complicated it gets then implements zend_acl by extends the class override allow and deny methods and put your crud for the permission schema in them and then pass the call to parent allow and parent deny respectively

4923335
istream	getline
you can easily read lines using std getline if you want to save the contents of each line or std istream ignore if you want to discard the contents of the lines you read until you find the desired line

4923350

regasm	gacutil
unfortunately even on my own development machine after building the library and registering regasm and caching the assembly gacutil i can t make a call through classic asp to instantiate the object receiving instead an activex component can t create object error

4923362
hash	md5
since the download must be validated against an md5 hash there seems to be no way for me to use the network inputstream after a resume to get the correct hash since java.security.messagedigest doesn t seem to have method that basically says start upating the current md5 hash from this partial md5 hash that i have from the previous download

4923362
hash	md5
computing the md5 hash from the downloaded file would be prohibitvely expensive performance wise

4927317
implements	extends
list extends collection and it can t implements anything because it s an interface.

4927320
serializable	deserialization
you ll have to add the serializable and or deserialization providers if you re using custom types but you can do the delegation of the majority of the work to the standard providers. i d still like to caution that you should still ensure that the resource indicated by the path should be the same in both cases

4927322
implements	extends
if list implements extends serializable then you have implied the contract that all implementation classes subclasses of list are also serializable which is not always true

4927350
children	parent
it seems like a tph type of problem but all of the reading i ve done indicates that you start with fields in the parent entity and migrate fields over to the inherited children

4927540
serializable	deserialization
think about multithreading reflection serializable deserialization

jar	manifest.mf
from technical point of view bundles are jar files which have a bit extended meta-inf manifest.mf file

4927578
touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchescancelled	touchesended
you can get a touchescancelled call after a touchesbegan and without a matching touchesended event

4927654
jar	war
and when i warble in the top level directory it doesn t generates a jar file as expected but instead a generates a war file

4927662
touchesbegan	touchesended
rather than looking at the number of touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent calls you should look at the nsset of uitouch objects passed to those methods

4927667
put	get
another option is taffy add one cfc per uri template and define a method for each http method you want to support get put delete etc

4927696

just want to double check that the default implicitly defined by compiler copy constructor for c++ classes performs the copy constructor on each member variable as well using the old value to get the copied value for each member and for atomic objects just uses a bit copy int and floats

4927749
gmail	hotmail
the problem exists in gmail and hotmail

4927763
hash	md5
md5 is a 128 bit cryptographic hash function so different messages should be distributed pretty well over the 128-bit space

4927793
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream and objectoutputstream do not care at all about your types when invoking they simply look at the object at hand and its class

4927805
vb6	vba
something to keep in mind is that vb6 hit end of life in 2008 and vba is still included for office 2010 but it is being encouraged that developers use vsta instead

4927809
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and safari have different format support on their video tag .ogg for firefox mp4 based for safari

4927809
firefox	safari
meanwhile firefox supports the .ogg format without further plugins apple safari needs the quicktime plug-in for playing mp4 video in the tag video

4927846
post	get
and that you are post ing the form and not using get

4927977

4928128
button	checkbox
there s a form with three checkbox and a button

4928143
public	protected
your login page has to be public so that people can access it but you css script is probably in a protected folder or has permissions set to hide it

4928160
int	chars
the c++ compiler knows to emit 8-bit instructions for chars and 32-bit instructions for int

4928185
folder	directory
you need to adjust the paths in that file to point to the cake core files folder based on your hosting providers directory path

4928233
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome do not

4928265
addition	multiplication

4928309
jstl	taglib
further your pom also specifies apache s jstl 1.1 implementation via taglib standard

4928309
jstl	taglib
jstl core taglib documentation for the right taglib uris

4928324
ienumerable	ienumerator
but it could be that in some situations it returns the same ienumerator instance that s already been partially or fully enumerated so it all really just depends on the specific intended usage of that particular ienumerable

4928337
ienumerable	ienumerator
most implementations of ienumerable return a fresh ienumerator which starts at the beginning of the list

4928345
put	get
when i put this in js i get the error invalid group

4928426

i need to encode an int i into buffer chars s of size n

4928480
put	get
on my dev box running visual studio 2010 it works like a charm but when i put it on the production box all i get is the generic http 500 error saying the page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.

4928486
division	subtract
it seems that simply adding up to the numerator while giving both the division and the mod is way too impractical so i came up with another way to divide using bit shifting subtract and 2 look up tables

4928486
octal	binary
example multiples of 5 in binary - block size 3 octal

4928490
apache	nginx
however i see that it says in production.rb that apache or nginx should already be serving static assets

you can use css to handle the height width and handle any overflow

4928505
google-chrome	firefox
looks the same in firefox and fixes it in google-chrome

4928509
int	chars
for example if the radix is 2 binary you need to supply a buffer with a minimal length of 8 sizeof int + 1 chars one chars for each bit plus one for the string terminator

4928513
cpu	processors
in many processors architectures the cpu fetches 32 bits from memory and internally ignores the unused bits keeping the lowest 8 bits

4928513
int	chars
knowing that a processor s int can hold 4 bytes and that it fetches 4 bytes at a time many programmers like to pack 4 chars into an int to improve performance

4928513
int	chars
this performance improvement may be wasted by the execution time required to pack and unpack the chars from the int

4928513
int	chars
in summary i highly suggest you forget about how many bytes make up an int and any relationship to a quantity of chars or bytes

4928518
vim	emacs
however learning an editor like vim or emacs has other benefits like being able to be completely cross-platform

4928518
vim	emacs
while using an ide might assist in you learning a language because you get syntax completion documentation etc learning an editor can lead to the kind of power usage that one using an ide can only dream of but it will take a while to get to that point on something like vim or emacs

4928523
rss	feed
for example i am testing the jquery above to get a rss feed

longlistselector	listpicker
the page that contains the listpicker control also contains a longlistselector

i m guessing this means something in my usr local area relating to my ruby and rails initial installs is mainatining this info my apps are setup in my documents folder in my home dir

4928696
google-chrome	safari
at the very least you should report this as a bug to webkit google-chrome and safari here

4928735
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in safari and google-chrome but in firefox the info that fades in anchor tag with class of .tooltip shows up in the wrong place

4928738
folder	directory
title pretty much says it i m looking to add a line to a script i m working on that would copy a random file from a directory say desktop old and paste it into another folder say desktop new

4928774
rational-numbers	integer
if you know what a rational-numbers is namely one integer divided by another then it s not difficult to figure out that notation

4928774
rational-numbers	fractions
i have never seen it before but from the properties of rational-numbers fractions it s clear that the square brackets indexing is for a representation as a vector of two integers

4928885
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
problem verified in google-chrome firefox and opera

4928917

4929004
rss	feed
i ve got a php-managed site that is pulling content from a posterous blog via an rss feed

4929019
min	max	range	max	range	min
once we have our anonymous one dimensional function my_func if you don t want to use an optimization method to solve the equation but happen to know a range range_ min range_ max in which my_func 0 then the following algorithm will find the zero of the function for you provided you re working with a continuous function

4929033
min	max
if you know the min and max then any particular value x should be considered to fall into the array at index

4929048
google-chrome	safari
the app behaved correctly in google-chrome and safari both for windows

4929054
hide	show
i need to display a table of 40-50 columns and 100.000 rows and hopefully let the user filter the data based on certain data items i.e only show rows that have a certain value in a certain column show only data that was recorded on monday and hide all other weekdays

4929061
min	max	range	max	range	min
so when the user gives you the min max and number of bins you can compute the size and therefore the range of each bin

4929092
width	height
to answer the question of how to place the header image the best way would be to define a div with a specified height a 550px tall header seems awfully large to me but hey its your site and width probably set to 100 and use the background-image css property to place the image there

4929102
csv	tsv
if that sentence didnt make a whole bunch of sense i would recommend skimming over the django tutorial ...actually you probably should do that anyway python has methods to turn datatypes such as dictionaries csv s in your case i guess a tsv lol to this format

4929122
width	height
the background of this div is a css gradient and has a height of 100 if the gradient is applied to to the actual body of the page it doesn t actually extend the whole width of the page

4929609
folder	directory
basically it gets the total size of all file in a specified directory combined but it doesn t include folder

4929609
folder	directory
each folder contains various files so i need the script to look at the uploads directory and give me the size of all files and folder combined

4929613
subtract	add
instead of subtract 1 then taking modulo 20 you can add 19 which is the same thing but keeps the number positive or you can use the ternary operator

4929659
dumpsys	adb
i normally run adb shell dumpsys activity against the emulator or device that dumps a whole bunch of info including the activity stack

4929659
post	get

4929667
flask	django	bottle	flask

4929699
nsnull	nsstring
at the point that you have deserialized that json string everything you re dealing with will be instances of nsstring nsnumber nsarray and nsdictionary and depending on the library nsnull to represent null values

4929755

4930186
cout	cin
the header contains the definition of the iostream type along with the famous cout cerr cin and clog types but not other types that are iostreams for example file streams

4930186
ostream	istream
consequently it s possible to without actually getting a full class definition for either istream or ostream

4930231
ostream	istream
iostream explicitly includes istream and ostream c++0x requires this and the gnu libstdc++ version does this so ostream is technically unnecessary

4930231
cout	cin
iostream declares the standard i o facilities cin cout ...

4930236
outputstream	inputstream
i would suggest implementing some filenameaware interface for this as i o streams are usually referenced with the inputstream outputstream abstract classes to avoid coupling your application with specific implementations

4930240
tinyint	boolean
i want to query the table below as to return the titles of the column where the intersection of sessionid and roomx is 0.the type of the room is tinyint - which in mysql represents boolean

then you have to set the data context and data binding to an instance of this property bag from code

4930515
wymeditor	fckeditor
i ve tried wymeditor and fckeditor and it happens under both

min	max	range	max	range	min
min and max validate the range but

4930641
inherited	properties
however if i change the method to use properties notation rather than ivar notation it will recognise the inherited properties albeit not let me write to it on account of it being read-only

4930676
equals	gethashcode
your equals and gethashcode methods are taking completely different approaches

4930677
equals	gethashcode
i suspect it is in part because your gethashcode doesn t agree with equals

4930726
post	get
looking over this blog post the solution seems to be to store the elements you get from mytable into an array as opposed to working with the ienumerable result directly

4930772
ubuntu	debian
since you don t have all locales installed i guess you are using debian or ubuntu

4930776

4930904
post	get
the purpose of the post is different but i believe what you ll learn there will help you get a better grasp of how iis and worker process work and how they interact with your asp.net application

4930924
prng	random
well rand certainly gives you pseudo-random numbers although the prng implementation might not return random values evenly distributed along the bits of the returned value in many implementations the higher bits are changing more often than the lower bits which is why your code is a poor choice for selecting a random value between 0 and 255

4930940
put	get
so it turns out that whenever i put any code in the vertex shader or frag shader other than gl_color ... the solid color i get disappears.

4930945
google-chrome	safari
by safari or google-chrome you can use getmatchedcssrules

4931039
width	height
im presuming that you are needing a round image width height to get this to be working nicely as in the demo flash doesnt tend to like rendering .5px gaps etc

4931045
getter	setter
you will need to create the actual getter and setter

4931082

you could try the mouseenter and mouseleave events in there too

4938276
post	get
i always thought that using get is not a good idea and that it s better to use post

4938276
post	get
the only problem i m seeing with post and which i m guessing is why a site like twitter went with get is that the request can t be made directly from the browser

4938276
post	get
a reading the metadata of the file and returning it should that be get or post or

4938276

4938290
getter	setter
when using jsdt to edit a javascript source file using this syntax for getter and setter like so

4938311

but since you tagged this question with mysql i ll mention a mysql-specific tip when your query implicitly generates a temporary table for instance while sorting or grouping by varchar fields are converted to char to gain the advantage of working with fixed-width rows

4938331
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
it generates a storage class with getter setter serializable and deserialization routines for every message in the protocol description

4938358
post	get
the only meaningful difference on the server side is that get requests are usually logged completely with parameters while the data of post requests are usually not logged but this is not a rule for custom servers which can log or not log anything

4938358
post	get
moreover in many cases you can use get or post and the server will handle both cases correctly and transparently

4938358
post	get
i can also think of get requests to be easier to handle and less resource- consuming but this depends on how the code is written cause in get request everything is passed in header and crlfcrlf is a request separator with post it s necessary to perform additional parsing of the body

4938396
lan	localhost
i working on a php socket daemon which works via localhost but when i try to connect from outside the lan or another pc it doesn t work

4938414
post	get
i always thought that using get is not a good idea and that it s better to use post

4938414
post	get
use get for reading information post for writing information

4938414
post	get
get requests shouldn t modify server-side state while post requests can safely do so

4938414
post	get
in general use get for reads and post for writes

4938414
post	get
get requests are no less insecure than post requests

4938414
post	get
the only problem i m seeing with post and which i m guessing is why a site like twitter went with get is that the request can t be made directly from the browser

4938414
post	get
your browser can generate post requests just as easily as get requests it s simply harder to submit post requests via the address bar

4938421
post	put
the workaround is to use other verbs like post or put for transmitting large amounts of data

4938456
listener	eventhandler

4938516
post	get
and yes get string do have a max length but so does post albeit much larger and dependent on your server settings

4938565
google-chrome	firefox
what you re seeing is the difference in how firefox and google-chrome treat border-collapse

4938565
google-chrome	firefox
in essence when it sees border-collapse firefox revises the properties of each cell in order to remove borders - whereas google-chrome keeps the values and just overlaps each border

4938571
width	height
for one thing it sticks padding and line-height in the middle of width and height or left and top

4939016
x86	64bit
in this case you chose x86 32 bit which means you also need to install 32-bit odac and make sure that you aren t referencing the 64bit oracle dlls by mistake

note further that the height and width are the logical canvas dimensions used for drawing and are different from the style.height and style.width css attributes

4939068
clang	icc
you could also try to drag some common expressions out of the inner loop but decent compilers e.g gcc icc or clang should do this quite well all by themselves

4939085

copy problematic folder into some backup directory and remove it from your svn working directory

4939085
folder	directory
remember to delete all .svn hidden directory from the copied folder

google-chrome	firefox
80 calls of the interval takes around 1600ms in firefox but it takes around 1670ms in google-chrome

4940035
google-chrome	firefox
the code inside the interval takes between 0-1 seconds in google-chrome and 0-2 seconds in firefox so queueing shouldn t be a problem

4940038
google-chrome	firefox
selenium will take control of your browser firefox google-chrome ie and will allow you to get pieces of data using css xpath selectors

updatepanel	onclientclick
combining the use of onclientclick with javascript s confirm as suggested by pilgerstorfer franz with an updatepanel for the ajax request you mentioned.

4940314

there are no x86 instructions that can move 24 bits in one operation but there are single instruction moves for 8 16 32 and 64bit data

4940333
int	chars
since you requested an int value from the stream it only reads the numerical chars from the stream it reads 1 and 0 but it stops at n

4940402
x86	64bit
on 32 bit env this is fine but when moving to 64bit these references fail as they should be pointing to c program files x86 - every time the solution is checked in and reopened in another environment the references need to be updated

put	get
here s what i have but it is posting as a get versus a put

4940493
hash	md5
you could create an md5 hash that resembles the original url and save both in the database

4940494
put	get
prohibiting the read-only fields in the put is a bad idea because it will require the clients to strip away fields they received from you in the get

4940494
put	get
taking data received from your get modifying one field of interest and sending it back to you with a put should be a brain-dead simple round-trip for the client

4940495
slideup	slidedown
use slidedown docs and slideup docs instead so the direction is explicitly tied to the event type

gif	png
i hope its not as bad as having to download the web page s html and looking for gif and png links

4940629

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
on firefox work great so as on opera but on google-chrome i don t get any response and no errors

4940912
button	checkbox
or is there just one native style or appearance for all android checkbox button edittexts etc

4940915

4941083
postgresql	mysql
our dev db was mysql and apparently heroku has postgresql and it keeps complaining about as file_count for some reason

4941098
setinterval	settimeout
it pauses any video defers network request stops updating the ui and pauses all setinterval settimeout operations

4941200
pop-up	dialog
as an experiment try this bookmarklet it clears autocompletes and pop-up this dialog typical

4941231
portrait	landscape
i am looking for specific information such as mediabox rotate and landscape portrait mode

4941316
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome

4941338
portrait	landscape
but when i load that in the portrait mode and then into landscape there are no issue

4941400
versioning	upgrade
they can change arbitrarily between versioning so they can cause problems when you try to upgrade jdk versioning

4941406
serializable	deserialization
i ve got an issue when implementing deepclone by serializable deserialization way

4941422
disk	ram
mincore returns a vector that indicates whether pages of the calling process s virtual memory are resident in core ram and so will not cause a disk access page fault if referenced

these constants are generally representative of the width of the screen and then a small height about 65 pixels

4941575

i browse it using google-chrome firefox and ie

4941575
google-chrome	firefox
but google-chrome and firefox do more slowly

4941608
uiview	subviews
is it possible to place a cgpoint inside of a uiview as a subviews so that when i rotate my uiview the cgpoint rotates with it

4941657
post	get
if this becomes big enough send it as a post and add a method get argument so that fb will treat it as a get for purposes of the graph api

4941707

the same issue is in play 013 in octal is 11 in decimal and 11 + 5 16

4941708

cgpoint like cgsize or cgrect are c structures and are not supposed to be drawable

4941743
post	get
i have only written one api multiple versions and making it support both get and post for all variables has come in handy both when implementing the client and debugging

4941838
folder	directory
i ve created one virtual directory logs which is internally pointing to my shared drive folder which is access by a limited number of users

4941850
free	malloc
however operator new and operator delete can be used outside of these contexts in place of c s malloc and free for example

4941862
hash	salt
hash with salt passwords are a 1 one function so there is effectively no possible way of determining what the password was which means the user supplying the password has less to worry about

4941865
hash	md5
reversing an md5 hash

4941905
width	height
you can adjust the width of a picker but not height

4941914
width	height
which contains the value of one row input elements like height width length etc

4941914
width	height
this will check height only if width is null or height is not null

4941917
hash	md5
if you use a standard hash technique the user who has access to your database could put in the standard md5 for password for example

4941917
hash	salt
you can solve this issue with a salt hash which takes the input string and a salt string value to create a unique hash that can not easily be replicated

4941917
hash	salt
you now have a salt hash

4942072
prepare	execute
note that i have replaced the call to query with a couple of lines that call prepare then execute

4942072
prepare	execute
you can then easily insert the following lines in between the prepare and execute calls to handle passing parameterized queries

4942079
postgresql	mysql
i suspect there is some type of clever design perhaps built around a specialized database very different form mysql postgresql etc

4942089
switching	screens	hide	show
your best bet would probably be to store the last position recorded by the app in nsuserdefaults then wait for the precision to be where you want it to be before switching to live data or else hide the mkmapview until the precision is where you want it to be then display it at that point you could show a loading screens in the interim

4942108
width	height
so if it all possible you should try and make the width and height of your resized images a multiple of 16

4942121
implements	extends
i start looking at implements explicit ftp by extends the current twisted ftp

4942157
scheme	racket
provides an overview of and semantics for the approach to macros in racket plt scheme

4942296
gdal	ogr
the january 2011 gdal ogr 1.8.0

4942318
put	get
you might need to use concurrenthashmap for outer hashmap and innerhashmap for synchronized get and put operations at bucket level

4942329
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
instead wrap your fileinputstream in a inputstreamreader ideally providing an encoding and a bufferedreader as documented by the javadoc of datainputstream.readline

google-chrome	firefox
its works fine in mozilla firefox and ie8 but in google-chrome its shows the hand cursor and also the normal mouse pointer here is my code

for-loop	loops
since you re getting a new .iterator each time around the for-loop you re lucky there isn t an infinite loops here

4942470
getter	setter
but to make it work inside your controller you will have to create a dummy object that has a getter and setter for all fields

button	checkbox
what i want i want that when i click the button all the checkbox in listview get checked unchecked

4942558
octal	binary
for the first step i would advise to read to a file and then use od to get an octal there s no binary as far as i can see representation because standard awk doesn t cope with nuls i think gawk too

4942608
lapack	gsl
and now my think about your requirements there is a reason why everyone mathematica matlab maple scipy gsl r ... uses atlas lapack umfpack pardiso cholmod etc

4942638
factors	mean
i mean that some caching or other factors would increase overall performance if the machine hosting everything has enough resources

4942659

visualvm is a free one but if you want mroe detail as to the timings and behaviour of jdbc queries i suggest you look at yourkit which can anlyse the queries in more depth

4942772
versioning	upgrade
the benefit is for people who are still using the old versioning and for some reason does not want to or cannot upgrade to a newer versioning

4942775
vim	emacs
i have only started to use emacs but my succession was like that - our local editor home-msu-made then i have used vi vim for several years or sometimes far editor and finally 3 years ago i ve switched to emacs

4942775
vim	emacs
i must admit that i have not tried the modern capabilities of vim i ve heard that in functionality employed by a programmer vim and emacs are very close

4942775
vim	emacs
probably there will be someone who has changed from vim to emacs or vice versa - their opinion about pros and contras will be more mature than mine

4942793
vim	emacs
there are a lot of emacs vs vim debates

4942815
profiling	benchmarking
this benchmarking is essentially good only for testing a single or very few methods and in their specific uses not a general profiling

visualvm and yourkit are both fine profilers i ve used them before and found them very helpfull

4943076
gtk	motif
for instance while all other stock lookandfeels metal windows classic windows cde motif gtk have defined the key text as a bright background for texts and texttext as the corresponding foreground color text in nimbus is actually a black foreground color and a standard text background color does not seem to exist

4943106
width	height
you can mess with the imagebutton s scaletype properties to fitxy for example or cropcenter and by setting a fixed size to layoutpreferences height and width you ll be all set

4943133
hash	hmac
also standard hmac use has not been compromised but again longer hash are in principle more secure in that scenario

4943144
post	get
make sure you use a post request as the text may be too long to be sent by get that is appended to the url in a query string

4943144
put	get
in order to put the contents of a textarea into a session you first have to get it to the server so it s not a solution to the problem of getting the text to the server

4943179
jobs	cron
cron jobs do not run under your user and environment

4943251
htmlcleaner	jsoup

width	height
where the second and third parameters to createscaledbitmap are the width and height respectively

4943341
maven	cargo
as the other answers stated maven s tomcat and cargo plugins allow you to start and stop tomcat from maven - typically to run some integration tests

4943395
ninject	spring.net
or what would be the best architecture to choose among mvvm + nhibernate prism + ioc spring.net unity ninject

4943439
post	get
so xhr does a post and then does a get with some of the posted data being encoded back by the server as get params

4943484
int	chars
a company s internal c++ coding standards document states that even for basic data types like int chars etc

4943491
persistent	transient
then you can put your transient objects into this context and they won t be persistent

4943495
width	height
the problem is the width and the height of the image are coming out as 0 0 because the ajax is called before the image has a chance to load.

override onkeydown onkeyup and any other you might need

4943539

the jdk includes useful tools like jhat and visualvm that allow you to inspect the objects in memory and the references between them

4943610

the asp.net mvc antiforgerytoken won t work through http get because it relies on cookies which rely on http post it uses the double submit cookies technique described in the owasp xsrf prevention cheat sheet

4943625
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade all my gems to the latest versioning including rails 3.0.4 which however looks like not quite related to this problem

4943671
folder	directory
as far as i can tell the problem is that the directory .svn under programfiles stores information that the folder data shall be deleted an if i read this folder it crashes

4943714
google-chrome	safari
iexploreproxy google-chrome and safari will only open the respective browsers and display test case names on the browser

4943774
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 8+ and firefox 4+ know what to do but i don t know about any others

4943816
getter	setter
best practices would suggest to define getter setter for fields which must be accessed from the outside

4943816
getter	setter
the doubt comes from the fact that eclipse seems comfortable with converting each in the class code to setfield field for fields which have getter setter even if i reading writing happens from inside the class code therefore i wouldn t need to use the class interface

4943816
getter	setter
common sense would suggest that using getter setter is similar to using c# properties but here i am specifically questioning about c# s automatic properties which only involve basic access without any processing

4943818
hash	md5
in python if you want to compute some hash md5 sha1 there is hashlib module

4943858
getter	setter
getter setter encapsulates the things

4943858
getter	setter
so its better to use getter setter

4943858
getter	setter
for default value initilization you can use constructor. but if there is some processing while setting getting use getter setter

4943858
getter	setter
from outside class use getter setter

4943884
getter	setter
as i ve been taught using getter and setter inside the constructor is unnecessary and only creates extra method calls to slow down your program

4943893
button	checkbox
the alternatives to radio button are checkbox and drop down boxes

4943908
button	checkbox
i am using the jquery ui button element with a checkbox

screens	mdpi
in the screens support article i noticed a rather small sentence all applications written for android 1.5 or earlier are by definition designed for the baseline hvga screens used on the t-mobile g1 and similar devices which is size normal and density mdpi

4944412
range	min
it seems that since i did not mention a value for min sdk version my device treats the app as compatible to old versions and ignores the whole screen range support

it then defaults to medium screens and mdpi resources

this is a comment on thomas answer i don t have enough xp to comment yet the mousedown and mouseup workaround works nicely

4944814
mouseout	mousedown
just a note that if you make any changes in prepare_pdf that need undoing in save_pdf then its a good idea to call that code on the mouseout event as well since there might be a case that the user mousedown s on the button but then moves the mouse away from the button

it simply inherited from the form class so that it gets all of the base functionality for free. a public properties is sort of like a global variable in that it allows other classes to access that value from outside but it s the preferred way of doing things in object-oriented languages

4946239

clang	llvm
clang llvm produced this

4946584
clang	llvm
i was hoping to get the compiler to at a minimum use the ldr rd rs #4 instruction which favors pointers and hoped the compiler would see that it could destroy the array address thus treating it like a pointer rather than an offset into an array and use the above instruction which is basically what clang llvm did

4946584
free	malloc
for me it readability comes into play and i feel arrays are easier to read and follow and second do i need to preserve that pointer to free a malloc or to go through that memory again etc

infact text inside text views has some internal margin that i took into account using the inset structure so the required text view height will be higher than the calculated string height

4947753
opera	firefox
i have been fooling around with rapidshare to understand whats going on i realized even they use javascript file size checking p now that works great with firefox and the others like i said even ie as it has a fall back activex method but opera is the victim p they cant give a fancy javascript error in that case

4947756

i have a menu item that i want to show hide only if the user has certain roles

what i am trying to figure out is how to get started with prism + mef while maintaining the mvvm pattern

4947790
mef	prism
when i go into the prism quickstarts it has a prism + mef but the comments in the project specifically state that the quickstart example does not implement mvvm

4947790
mef	prism
every example online is either prism prism + mvvm prism + unity silverlight examples prism + mef etc

4947790
mef	prism
but i can not find any wpf prism + mef + mvvm examples or information

4947790
mef	prism
any help would be great especially resources that deal directly with this situation as apposed to something similar prism + unity and without mef

rss	feed
instead of parsing google news html it probably would be easier to parse its rss feed instead if there is one

in addition to toscho s answer i ve noticed some webkit inconsistencies between google-chrome 9-10 and safari 5 with the css properties supported that are worth noting

4947953
width	height
your button most likely has a height and width of zero and resides at position 0 0

4947963
int	chars
but if you replace chars with int then yes there would be difference because in that case malloc would allocate memory of size currentbytelength while new would allocate memory of size

4947974
button	checkbox
when the user clicks the dialog generate button i want jquery to tell me the names of all of the checkbox that are checked the name element of them so i can use those names to populate the div printing

4947986
int	chars
i mean both allocate data on the heap and when dealing with primitive types such as chars or int it s about the same

4947986
free	malloc
nothing prevents you from using malloc but don t mix those up do not call delete on memory allocated with malloc or free on memory allocated with new

4947995
free	malloc
they require different methods of freeing the memory malloc free vs

4948007
free	malloc
the most obvious difference is that memory that is malloc ed must be free ed while memory that is new ed must be delete d

4948011
free	malloc
if there s no constructor destructor you can call new malloc delete free interchangably and even with mixing

4948011
free	malloc
new and delete create the memory for a new object calling the constructor destructor if available while malloc and free just allocate the memory without calling constructor destructor

4948017
free	malloc
if the memory block is allocated with malloc you have to free it by calling free

4948087
post	get
which i hope is a completely different new instance of the form i get the error in the title of this post

4948109
opencv	emgucv
see documentation for initlineiterator sorry the link is to the python version of opencv i ve never heard of emgucv

put	get
well the easiest solution is to get a time machine go back in time to when the project was planned and tell the architect that you never put application logic into managed beans

4948125
rss	feed
here s what i ve got - i m writing an app that among other things reads an rss feed to get episodes of a certain podcast then displays each episode s title and description with a listen and watch button

4948136
for-loop	arrays
we made the 10 by 10 arrays using a nested for-loop and we have no issue creating the buttons

4948142
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome and maybe other browsers except internet explorer if first i m selecting a date with that pop-up calendar and than change it manually and then let the focus on the date field and going to save the document actually is a form with multiple fields the date changed manually it is lost the date choosed from calendar it is saved

4948142

the problem is reproducing in browsers like firefox google-chrome when

4948243

pull	push
well you can push and pull via git to the server you could potentially set up

4948264
pull	push
from to there i push and pull changes via ssh

4948265
int	double
or if you want to know seconds and not milliseconds you can truncate that double to int

4948267
pull	push
you could make the repository on any of your computers probably the desktop one and push pull to it from both laptop and itself

4948270
portrait	landscape
the way to recreate the error is to keep on rotating the device around 20-25 times so that app keeps on switching from portrait to landscape mode

4948270
portrait	landscape
if i switch between portrait and landscape mode pretty fast .

4948327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

hide	show
you can use the callback parameter in the show and hide methods like this

4948393
hash	md5
it can be anything from a simple crc32 to a full blown cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha1 2 256 512

4948393
hash	md5
real hash functions do a lot more than 1 operation md5 does about 15 operations on 4 state variables

4948393
hash	md5
so instead take the hash of the file and store that md5 would store 16 bytes instead of 3mb

hash	hmac
for example if you re using hmac you sign a piece of data by taking a hash of the data concatenated with a known but not transmitted value a secret value

4948393
hash	hmac
so you send the plain-text and the hmac hash

4948393
hash	hmac
then the receiver simply hash the submitted data with the known value and checks to see if it matches the transmitted hmac

4948393
hash	salt
adding a salt helps matters since it adds a bit of unknown data to the hash

4948393
salt	md5
so instead of finding anything that matches md5 foo they need to find something that when added to the known salt produces md5 foo.salt which is very much harder to do

4948393
hash	salt
hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.

4948393
hash	salt
instead by re-appending the salt and password each time you re re-introducing data back into the hash function

4948411
int	double
1000000 rows of two int a double and an fk is a going to be pretty darn efficient

getter	setter
i m just curious to see how these practices fit in with the various ways of providing setter and getter in c#

4948845
getter	setter
you will get a backinng variable with separate getter and setter methods

4948846
getter	setter
note that i d call this a public property as both the getter and setter are public

4948850
getter	setter
use the auto property if all you need is a simple wrapper around an instance variable use the full version when you need to add logic in the getter and or setter

4948917
children	parent
in qt a parent will delete its children with delete

4948932
put	get	post	get	post	put
i ve created a restful api that supports get post put delete requests

4948932

if it s a jsonp requests it has a callback parameter in the querystring i force every api method to be executed by a get request even if it should be called by other methods like post or delete

4948958
filewriter	bufferedwriter
see jtable tablemodel filewriter bufferedwriter in the api docs

4948969

you should then verify the file type rename the file to something other than it s original file name and append the appropriate extension gif jpg bmp png

4949002
width	height
even if you are going to set the width and height in code you need to add these parameters to your xml-file for each imagebutton

4949003
children	parent
with regard to question 1 i have all my nodes implement all methods but the leaf entities return nil for the children getter method for example and the root returns nil for parent

4949042
getter	setter
also note that automatic properties require both getter and setter public or private

4949069

4950449
unsigned	short
i have the following problem i have to read from an inputstream a sequence of data but due its own arrangement i need to read the first 4 bytes as an unsigned short 16 bits so in this way i will read two blocks of two bytes because the meaning of those bytes are numbers but after that i need to read as an unsigned byte because the meaning of all the remaining data is ascii

4950460
ant	maven
some sort of build packaging tool ant maven etc

super	extends
i think it will be appropriate that stylesheetb extends stylesheeta so with one stylesheet parameter constructor of b can also construct its super class a

4950661
put	get
you can use the .get to fetch the code via ajax then get at the number in the return code and put into a div

4950677
getter	setter
in general i feel that a better way of doing this would be by using getter and setter and data binding or flex s invalidation methods which is described in that first link

4950714
post	get
in any mvc form post is sending to controller in action property in form and controller as the name is decribed controls what will happend in your case should ask database for verification via model get response decide what to do and use view to display results.

a low-tech way to get more information is to put basic timing logging into every rpc to see how long they take

4950869
getter	setter
a thoughts on the getter and setter issue

4950869
getter	setter
if you were just extending the class with a full parameter list you would have getter and setter for n101...n200 in b and n1...n100 in a

4950908
hash	md5
never use md5 its extremely broken sha1 is on the nist list of approved message digest functions but its kind of broken however the sha2 family is better sha256 is a great choice but you ll need to find the source code online for it because php doesn t have a secure hash function

4950941

int	double
most implementations i ve read about seem to involve creating a structure that pieces together a value int or double with a unit

4950970
int	double
this means saying goodbye to using ordinary double and int every variable is now defined as a unit or length or meters etc

4951009

solution is to assign these selects a special class and use their class to show and hide

4951304
hide	show
this will ignoring the state of the default hidden ones toggle the visibility of all the others swapping their show hide states

4951307
stdout	stderr
in the general case you need to specify subprocess.pipe for the subprocess stdout and stderr

4951307
stdout	stderr
then create two separate threads which read the subprocess stdout and stderr to wherever you like

4951321
hide	show
now when you want to toggle hide or show them you can do the selection using the class defaulthidden in this example

you can convert these command line arguments from string to integer using atoi or strtod

4951965
strtol	atoi
if you want error-checking use strtol instead of atoi

4951983
floating-point	integer
that avoids recalculating the function every pass through the loop and integer comparison may be faster than floating-point comparisons

4951997
for-loop	arrays
if someone can show me how to generate random words then i should easily be able to just use a for-loop to insert the words into the arrays

4952001
folder	directory
i think it may have something to do with the fact that the after directory in vimfiles doesn t seem to be getting read once i move the plugin folder to the dropbox after snipmate.vim only shows up in scriptnames when i have vimfiles as the plugin folder

4952378
wadl	wsdl
by the way wadl is rest s version of wsdl if you don t know what that means

4952433
int	double
shared function inside the library will be called with either int or double parameter

4952433
int	double
at one point in the function there is a call to a private function that does something with the parameter depending on whether it is an int or double

4952433
int	double
i therefore instantiate two templates one for int and one for double

4952434
udp	tcp
ipsec its an internet layer protocol which means anything that runs above the ip layer such as tcp or udp for example or any other newer protocol will be encrypted by ipsec

4952434
udp	tcp
basically it operates on the application layer which means it is a protocol that runs on top of tcp udp etc.

4952435
textview	simplecursoradapter
it seems i probably need to extend simplecursoradapter so if is_set_to_record is true then i set the background colour of all three textview to a different colour

4952449
consistency	acid
have a look at the acid model - atomicity consistency isolation durability

4952456

4952611
folder	directory
make sure you select copy to output directory in the properties window for the files in the folder you added to the project that will make sure they are copied to the bin directory when you compile your application

4952614
cvs	svn
git is not the same as svn or cvs since it is fully distributed so there are not really

pull	push
i would also suggest signing up for a free github.com account install git on one machine and play around fork others projects pull them down push them up etc.

4952616
width	height
i have an attribute called dimensions which i want to set based on my width height and depth attributes

4952616
width	height
for example i want to do and have it save to dimensions as width 4 height 0 depth 0

4952623
width	height
alex helped me find out how to change the height width via the contact.js however its not doing anything

4952625
width	height
when a dom element is rotated using the css3 transform properties or the equivalent browser specific routines the object is rotated to a given angle but the computed width and height are left untouched

4952625
width	height
routines that calculate the position of elements in the dom tend to rely solely on the position of the element left top and the size of the element width height as all elements are rectangles this is fine the rectangular bounding box is identical to the object itself

4952625
width	height
when the item is rotated this ceases to be true so routines no longer work correctly as the width and height of the bounding box are potentially different to the object itself

4952625
width	height
the bounding box width and height is simple enough to calculate mathematically there was a question some time ago on this topic with an answer given by casablanca stating the mathematics to calculate the new widths and height

4952633
rubygems	bundler
you could put your gem in vendor facebook and use bundler as simone carletti suggested but instead of pulling your gem from rubygems you could use the path option to tell bundler where to load your gem from

folder	directory
folder created using the solution explorer are not copied to the output directory where the executable lives by default unless an item that has been added to the project in that directory has the copy to output directory value set to something other than do not copy so if all you did was create an empty directory using the solution explorer then its likely the directory does not exist in the output path

4952690
put	get	post	get	post	put
rest encourages the use of not just get and post but even other http verbs such as put and delete

4952847
requestfactory	gwt
in gwt 2.1.1 the id and version properties may be of any type that requestfactory knows how to transport

4952871
int	boolean
you might be able to remove the need to do something like this by qualifying what path you want outside of your function and then call a specific function to get a boolean or a specific function to get an int depending on the qualification

4952874
int	boolean
you can write a response object that encapsulates a boolean and an int together and set the values according to your whim

4952885
int	boolean
have it either return the boolean or int wrapper objects

4952919
google-chrome	firefox
browser specific code is fine considering we can talk the users on the intranet into using ie firefox or google-chrome if they want the styles

as for other possible meanings there are a few keywords you omitted such as protocol dynamic private protected public selector and encode

4952958
cos	sin
if you re after a plain parametrization using sin and cos it s way easier

4952994
gridview	rowdatabound
i m not sure what you are trying to concatenate without a code example however i would perform the concatenation before binding the gridview and store it in a private member on the class so that you can access it later in the rowdatabound event

4952995
put	get
i thought i could just put that query in its own method and use a parameter to specify the orderby but i cannot get it to work

4953019
getter	setter
a couple of other options are to setup singleton classes that hold your shared values and that every activity can refer to or as a last resort you can extend the application class and create getter and setter to make values available across your application

4953029
post	put
the reason is that rails makes all form methods post but passes it s own _method parameter that is a put post or delete request

4953061
stdout	stderr
probably the reason it doesn t work is that lighttpd is a daemon and daemons close their stdin stdout stderr file descriptors

4953080
vsto	add-in
we have a vsto add-in written in vb.net 3.5 and running in ms word 2010

vsto	add-in
in this vsto add-in we set a number of sharepoint 2010 meta properties that are returned from the documents contenttypeproperties collection

4953090
getter	setter
the only exception i can imagine is specific to .net and that s automatically implemented properties where there s no point in testing that the getter and setter work correctly because even if they didn t there d be nothing you could do about it

4953097
for-loop	arrays
what i would like to be able to do is to store in memory the arrays for each atom say atom_k and then call these different variables to perform further operations outside the for-loop

4953150
width	height
image width 1018 and height 916

4953166
getter	setter
most of us don t test-drive simple getter and setter specifically as part of the tdd process

4953166
getter	setter
but we re not creating that field which needs the getter and setter until we have a need for it - where need is defined as a failing test

4953166
getter	setter
so the getter setter will be tested as a matter of course because they re created as needed by methods we are test driving

4953179
width	height
this class is added to the textarea when using editorfor so you can specify the width and height in that class to get your desired dimensions

4953219
youtube	vimeo
i m trying to allow users to embed youtube or vimeo videos in posts for a rails3 app we re working on and both use iframes now

4953219
youtube	vimeo
the sanitize helper seems like it only allows you to whitelist tags on a global basis - further youtube has a consistent class for their iframes but vimeo does not

4953242
datarow	dataadapter
i m fairly new to asp.net and am working through a tutorial that demonstrates the use of dataadapter datatable and datarow classes

7 i m not surprised that prefuse and jung s rendering of the fruchtermanreingoldlayout are different - there are a few factors that might affect this one of them the starting node where each implementation start the calculation so i wouldn t worry much about this issue

4953408

apache	nginx
normally you would do it the other away around have nginx proxy anything that s not a static file to a backend apache

4954156
apache	nginx
having apache look at all the incoming requests would defeat the purpose since you use nginx to avoid the inefficiencies of apache when handling numerous requests

4954253
mouse	keyboard
for some strange reason the focusmanager.isfocusscope true assignment causes keyboard focus to fail to be set when checking a checkbox via a mouse click and for focus to jump out of the itemscontrol when a check box is checked using the space bar on the keyboard

4956059
jar	war
i have 2 projects which results war and jar

4956059

uitableview	uisearchbar
the right side s uisearchbar is on the another uiview it is not a part of uitableview

4956147
uitableview	uisearchbar
so you can add a child view to put the uisearchbar and another child view is for the uitableview

4956171
folder	directory
set the output directory of all dlls to a folder like

4956185
uitableview	uisearchbar
i would experiment with having the uitableview and the uisearchbar as peers within another view

4956189

the nsoperation does a performselectoronmainthread to the data manager singleton when the download is complete the data manager stores the new data and posts a nsnotification that it has new data available

4956340

hash	md5
hash md5

4956564
hide	show
so to show on mouse over and hide on mouse out your function should look like this

4956620
fadein	fadeout
or it should fadeout and then fadein back

4956620
fadein	fadeout
well your code as of now is correct and andy what you have specified is the other way which is again correct but if you need is just a fadeout fadein effect then use

4956620
fadein	fadeout
flip the fadein fadeout if you want it the other way

4956655
jsf	seam	primefaces	richfaces
however what you can do is use java ee 6 with jsf 2 and richfaces 4 or primefaces which i would prefer and then only use the remoting module of seam which should be pretty stable enough

4956664
mousemove	mousedown
bind the events mousemove mousedown to the canvas

4956681
width	height
when user selects a file i need to get the image width and height with js jquery on the client side before upload

4956706
changeset	cherry-pick
the last question is how can you cherry-pick changeset when merging

as soon as the upgrade comes out wait x amount of time then incorporate the new versioning regardless of what else is going on in the project or whether we need any new features or fixes

4957397
versioning	upgrade
wait till a natural slow point in development whatever that is then upgrade everything to the latest versioning

4957425
fadein	fadeout
the fadein and fadeout second parameter takes a reference to the function and will not execute it directly so what you can do is to create an anonymous function and then call the function inside that

4957475
google-chrome	firefox

if selecting from single table the same query takes 0.3s using iqueryable instead of ienumerable

4958021
pop-up	dialog
to add or edit each individual book a dialog pop-up containing a form with several input fields title author genre etc

4958021
ready	each
rather than iterate over and resetting each of these fields after each book is saved back to the master list and the dialog is closed in order to get the form ready for the next book i m thinking it d be easier merely to use a clone of the form each time and then merely throw out the clone after each save

4958046

4959696
stdout	stderr
the threads which read stdout and stderr will not process the output the moment it is written by the child process

4959696
stdout	stderr
even if the data for stderr arrives a few milliseconds before stdout if the stdout thread has the cpu right now it will get its data first

4959696
stdout	stderr
that would redirect stderr to stdout

4959696
stdout	stderr
in the parent process you could then just read stdout and ignore stderr

lxml	beautifulsoup
it s worth noting as jonathan vanasco does in the comments that beautifulsoup4 now supports using lxml as the internal parser so you can use the advanced features and interface of beautifulsoup without most of the performance hit if you wish although i still reach straight for lxml myself -- perhaps it s just force of habit

joptionpane	jdialog
you shoudl check jdialog to create your custom message dialogs or you can use standard message dialogs in joptionpane

4969055
put	get
put your test in another class and you ll get what you expect

4969066
put	get
e.g. in sbt you can simply put all the jars you need under the lib folder to get them automatically added to the classpath

4969082
google-chrome	firefox
for some strange reason the list items appear with a margin around them in both firefox and google-chrome

4969085
min	max
if that is a correct understanding then you would need to pass two parameters min and max or perhaps wrap them up in a record

4969102
width	height
file_get_contents does not return the width nor the height of an image resource

4969124
folder	directory
the best recommendation i can give you is to entirely ignore the etc directory and use some mapping table from windows timezone names to unix timezone folder files

4969124
folder	directory
the same is true for the folder files in the timezone database but not for the files in the etc directory - they give a simple static offset to gmt

4969178
width	height
you can also do things like height + width 2

4969194
coalesce	isnull
you can use both isnull a b or coalesce a b c ... functions where isnull returns the value of b if a is null and coalesce returns the first non-null argument

4969194
coalesce	isnull
an important difference is that isnull forces the casting or convert of b to the type of a while coalesce s return type is the same of the returned argument letting the engine to try any conversion only after the evaluation of the function

4969194
coalesce	isnull
if the column a is of int data type writing isnull a 1 is ok but isnull a hello causes a conversion error while writing coalesce a hello is allowed and an error will be raised only if a is null and you try for example to insert the returned value hello to an int column but doing auotmatic conversion of a s value if not null when inserting in a varchar column

4969213
width	height
as i found out the width and height read from previewsize were wrong...

4969213
width	height
i stored the width and height and used it to transform picture

4969215
subclass	abstract-class
since nsoperation is an abstract-class there is no way to use nsoperation without using a subclass of nsoperation

4969215
nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation	nsoperation	nsblockoperation	nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
if you don t want to subclass yourself you can use one of the nsoperation subclasses ie nsinvocationoperation or nsblockoperation

4969223
post	get
if my assumption is wrong then post your code here related annotations so you can get better answers

4969226
post	get
i have seen a few post on this but i can t seem to get them to work i also can t seem to add comments to them i m sure thats me being a noob

4969259
free	malloc
however the need to explicitly provide the root set will make this all pointless - it ll be malloc and free all over again except that for a certain ill-defined set of objects you can skip it

4969273
queue	fifo
i am trying to find or write a java class that represents a fixed-size non-blocking auto-discarding fifo queue

4969313
jar	war
i need to have a jar dependency in the maven generated war s web-inf lib folder as x-1.0.final.jar instead of x-1.0.jar which is the name it has in the repository

4969338
filesystems	ntfs
first of all most windows installs come with file access times disabled for performance reasons so before wrapping your head around it here is what you need to do in order to activate last access times on ntfs filesystems modify the key value name ntfsdisablelastaccessupdate to dword 0 value data if it is set to 1 of course

4969400
antivirus	mcafee
edited - in addition to above we have mcafee antivirus installed on our servers

here is my nginx and apache conf

4969539
udp	tcp
a socket can refer to tcp connection a udp packet endpoint an x.25 connection or .

4969557

4969570
ecdsa	aes
the reason that i ask is that right now my application uses ecdh fine to establish an aes secret key but now i want to use the same ec key to sign each message using ecdsa

4969591
hide	show
what i want to do is check if the user clicks anywhere else onscreen whilst the account menu is show but not within the account menu itself and if so then hide the menu

4969666
prepare	execute
in the comments eumiro suggests don t try . the reason this might not result in the expected outcome is that the file receiving the redirect is prepare before the command to the left of the is execute

4969671
filtering	grouping
enumerate the grouping in the groups2ou get the grouping members and use the distinguishedname to filtering the ones in the users1ou

4969677
put	get
note you will need to get your own developer key and put it in the key parameter

4969687
post	get
i have written a simple rest service in wcf in which i have created 2 method using same uri template but with different method post and get

4969687

i am generating test code coverage using lcov a graphical gcov tool extension

4969838
post	get
gets should return content so the post should issue a redirect to get another page

4969849
min	max
if you think you are going to want to perform a number of math related functions on your structure specifically statistics functions like mean max min ect. then you could use descriptivestatistics from apache commons math you can set your window size and it will automatically maintain your elements

4969851
hide	show
and if you do that you can show and hide without changing the class

4969858
pull	push
i can push revison to the repository but can t pull from it

4969881
int	double
when you have a struct that contains an object anything that isn t a primitive like int or double and you copy an instance of the struct the object inside isn t deep copied because it is simply a reference pointer to a memory location containing the actual class

4969906
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
unfortunately google-chrome safari and opera donâ t play nice with this

i ve checkout out those folder all empty to my working directory let s say at home myname workspace myproject

4970007
folder	directory
probably somewhat backwards i ve now set up a project directory tree under another folder home myname myproject which includes

4970007
folder	directory
i want to now add the myproject s dev biz docs and assets folder to my repository and check them out to my working directory at home myname workspace myproject

4970015
inline	inlining
first i thought that by not inlining i am incurring some overhead since jvm will have to find determine whether or not to inline this method or even fail to do so

4970026
cos	sqrt
there s differing opinions regarding using cos sqrt or built in distance functions which is best and or what s the best method of doing

4970072
heapsort	in-place
note that we have to use a in-place sorting algorithm such as heapsort so that this whole stuff works completely in-place

4970115
disk	ram
every time that number blips for your process your program blocks waiting for the operating system paging in data from the disk into ram

4970137
put	get
you can use it to get information out of ga but you can t use it to put information into it

4970138
children	parent
now my problem is that i want to use a tree to keep track of the candidates as parent and children of a tree

4970153
ant	maven
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

4970153
ant	maven
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

4970197
folder	directory
you should delete .svn folder which contains repo info after you copy a directory to another place

4970202
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code seems to work perfectly in firefox opera google-chrome and safari but obviously doesn t work in internet explorer at least version 8.0 it complains that property or method not supported by the object at line

4970207
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
having not got this working in google-chrome and safari i tested this on a new version 3.6 of firefox which i should have done in the first place and it worked as expected despite the fact that in the documentation event.progress id described as

4970216
post	get
the post request executes correctly but i get another main webpage

0 y table view width header view height

4970339
implements	extends
i then extends the partial class to implements idataerrorinfo

4970353
puts	gets
again gets works but puts don t.

4970373

disk	ram
simply put virtual memory is a combination of ram and disk space that running processes can use

4970555
disk	ram
swap space is the portion of virtual memory that is on the hard disk used when ram is full

4970559
width	height
however if i introduce a decimal such as using 320.01 for the width value or 480.01 for the height value

4970559
width	height
it seems that if i use a size with an exact width 320.0 height 480.0

4970563
objectdatasource	formview
i have an asp.net page with a formview data-bound to an objectdatasource that uses dynamically generated templates to render the ui based on layout information from the application s database

4970576
gridview	sqldatasource
- i ve added a gridview to see my content and configured it to my sqldatasource here i ve added the edit delete options

4970580
subtraction	addition
the project is simply an addition or subtraction of the image

4970602
coff	omf
i m also aware of the objconv tool which converts coff to omf though this doesn t seem to work in practice for reasons i don t fully understand

4970603
dictionary	map
my question is how can i map this with nhibernate i was thinking i can treat the dictionary as a hasmany since i can recreate a bar from a string however it feels a bit crude and i wonder if there is a better way

4970614
swing	windowbuilder
i have very limited swing-experience and perhaps i d be better off studying the swing api instead of looking for windowbuilder documentation

4970643
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can just use httpwebrequest or webclient to make web requests like you would have with curl in your php client.

4970669
prepare	execute
with such a quick time it sounds like find didn t do anything but prepare an object no communication with the database and it s only upon using the cursor the actual query was execute and results were read

4970684
invokerequired	begininvoke
in this situation use of your control s invokerequired property lets you handle cross-threading calls using invoke or begininvoke gracefully

4970697
post	get
if you want to send informations and get it back modify your html form to post data at the dispatcher like this

4970806
hash	salt
run the password with the salt value through that and store the resulting hash data

4970806
hash	salt
if the attacker can get that information then they can login as that user because they take that value and hash it with the new salt value to authenticate

4970823
int	chars
non pointer int chars float etc.. will

4970847

cloudant	couchdb
cloudant is based on the apache-backed couchdb project and the open source bigcouch project. source

4970901
couchbase	couchdb
as of june 2015 gives 404 not found since at least march 2013 couchone on twitter had last tweets in may 2011 and says that couchone is now couchbase inc. - but please note that contrary to some marketing material the couchbase server is not a continuation of couchdb - it has a different code base licensing philosophy features data and protocols

4970901
membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb	couchbase	couchdb
for more info on this and an explanation of differences between things like couchdb couchio couchone couchbase couchbase server couchbase mobile couchbase lite couchapps bigcouch touchbase membase memcached memcachedb etc.- see the answer that i wrote to difference between couchdb and couchbase in march 2013

4970901
membase	couchbase
few days ago couchone announced a merge with membase to form a new company called couchbase

4970901
cloudant	couchbase
all in all cloudant seems to be more mature right now and we have to see how the couchbase develops

4970917
postgresql	mysql
i do not believe that mysql or postgresql support parallel queries though

4970959
put	get
what i can t seem to figure out is how to put all these tools together to get a successful expression for the type iâ need

4970960
hash	md5
or add another cookie set only once never expire having a likely-unique value md5 hash

4970982
client-side	server-side
i suppose you could in theory link to your server-side repository interface files from the silverlight client using the wcf service as the actual data source for your client-side implementation of irepository

4970993
comparator	comparable
the bean comparator link has a simple example of implementing comparable creating a custom comparator or using the beancomparator so you don t need to write any custom code

4971025
getter	setter
i will just make all the instance variables in this class public although you should probably rather have them private with the usual getter and setter methods note that i am also omitting package and import statements

4971049
oncreate	onnewintent
then in your activity oncreate you have to make a getintent and check if it has the result also you need to implement onnewintent callback so you are notified if your activity is currently running an receives the intent with the data you have to call getintent also in this callback

4971086
innodb	myisam
if it proceeds then either you re not on innodb maybe it s disabled and mysql s silently transforming to myisam the key checks are turned off check that server variable or something s really screwy with your server

4971127
cvs	svn
that work needs to be finished to be committed is left-over cvs svn thinking

4971128
implements	extends
extends it implements the getobjecttype and docreateinstance methods and you re up and running with autowiring

4971135
button	checkbox
the click method is intended to be used with input elements of type button checkbox radio reset or submit

4971169
jmeter	soapui
soapui or jmeter see

4971177
nunit	mstest
from a unit testing perspective you are better off encapsulating your functionality in a separate library project that you can then test using the standard unit test frameworks nunit mstest

4971232
ceil	floor	ceil	math.h	floor	math.h
i think you need double ceil double x to get the smallest value or double floor double x to get the largest value both included in math.h

4971309
disk	ram
you could also consider a ram disk ram drive if you really want performance and want to have it stored on a filesystem

4971337
pull	push
any command you ve previously used in mercurial commit push pull summary id etc

4971356
gtk	clutter
camerabin is being used by libcheese that is even higher level and depends on clutter but not gtk and allows you to plug effects with cheese_camera_set_effect

4971358
decimal	roundup
for roundup if digit 3 is 5 or more try adding 0.01 to the value then truncate with the result in a variable that has only 2 decimal places defined if possible

4971403
modula-2	oberon
modula-2 oberon ocaml common lisp

4971438
codeigniter	pyrocms
pyrocms - basically the defacto standard for free beer and speach cms for codeigniter

4971444
onmousemove	onmouseover
back when the app was written the developers used onmousemove to display the info instead of onmouseover

4971480
selecteditem	selectedindex
in the end setting selectedindex is far more reliable than setting selecteditem as the items in a datagrid usually change

4971512
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i don t know if this has something to do with it but if you read the documentation for the initwithstring method it returns an instance of a subclass of nsstring which may or may not be an instance of nsmutablestring

4971512
nsmutablestring	nsstring
doesn t do what anyone wants when you synthesize the accessors as the setter invokes -copy and gets an nsstring which is not an nsmutablestring as a result

4971549
google-chrome	firefox
we tested it out and the gradient is now working with or without a theme in ie7 8 firefox and google-chrome

4971566
maven	pom.xml
i have added the maven groovy plugin to the pom.xml such that i can build test the java and groovy sources on the command-line using maven

4971601
comparator	comparable
now i understand that i should implement the comparable interface in my object and override the comparator method

4971623
post	get
submit your form to servlet using get or post then in servlet class implement doget or dopost accordingly

4971646
width	height
use css to give the #content div a set height and optionally a width and set the css property overflow auto on that div as well

4971650
hbase	hypertable
lucene is very different from bigtable clones like hbase or hypertable

4971675
zsh	subshell
if your zsh is recent enough to have anonymous functions you can replace the subshell with

4971742
rss	feed
if the website has an rss feed and the article is recent enough to be included in it you could extract metadata about the article from it

4971768
groupbox	panel
i ve tried creating a custom panel that inherits panel and a groupbox but these didn t work any differently

4971768
inherited	properties
in the inherited form from above the designer s location properties for the refreshbutton and savebutton are 371 7 and 452 7 even though the containing panel is only 445 pixels wide

4971812
getter	setter
i ve overriden get x set x get y set y and move methods in order to solve it but the only thing i got was the fact that position changes without calling coords setter or move but at the moment it s changed a getter is called and returns new negative value

4971838
outputstream	inputstream
if the images are however to be retrieved from an external resource as for example a database then you need to create a servlet which obtains an inputstream of the image from the external resource based on the parameters pathinfo provided by the http request and writes it to the outputstream of the http response along a set of correct response headers content type length etc

4971872
subtraction	addition
in your case addition and subtraction there are built-in operations in pycuda that you can use to your advantage

4971875
post	get
pd remember use the same name in post to get the data _post xyzname

4971895
width	height
and possibly set height and width of the new nerdtree window so it doesn t keep moving with new files

4971912
mouse	keyboard
i am able to scroll it with mouse events but no luck with the keyboard so far

4971931
subtraction	addition
that being said i m afraid that i m not aware of any vcs that tracks movement of code between files just addition to the target and subtraction from the source

4971947
post	get
one of them is called to handle get operations and another is used to handle post operations

4971965
jar	war
the rough equivalent to war or jar would be phar

4971979
filtering	grouping
first i create a grouping observable filtering messages by their unique id and then i am trying to cache all messages in each grouping until i have collected them all then i sort them and put them together

4971983
jar	war
take a look at phar as a php alternative to jar war

4972012
daemons	systemd
if the xml file will be placed in a systemd defined folder a windows service or linux daemons could be built to watch permanently on real time that path to transfer the updated data

4972016
folder	directory
i would like parent directory of projects to include an hgrc file that a repo in that folder inherits from

4972043
punctuation	words
personally given this setup i d work with the innertext property of htmlnode to find the words probably with regex so i can exclude for punctuation and not simply rely on spaces and then use the innerhtml property to make the changes using iterative calls to regex.replace because the regex.replace has a method that allows you to specify both start position and number of times to replace

4972093
put	get
this is probably pretty simple but i m trying to take the value from an element in xml and put it in my datagridtextcolumn formatted to 3 decimal places but i can t get it to work...it just leaves it unformatted at like 20

4972132
iboutlet	ibaction
you will set up variables and methods for button clicks and etc to handle each component from ib a textfield or button is an iboutlet while an action like clicking on a button is an ibaction as far as best design i believe you should have a delegate for each view that does all the above but i generally just use the viewcontroller as the delegate and implement it there for relatively simple views

4972172
put	get
if you want to get clever you can also use ctrl-r to pull things onto the search box put the cursor on a word press then press and hold ctrl and press r then w and it will pull the word under the cursor onto the search line similar to pressing but editable and without the word boundaries

4972178
ilist	icollection
note that does not extend ilist and does not extend icollection

4972178
ilist	icollection
whereas any generic iterator can be seen as a nongeneric iterator due to the potentially boxing conversion of any value to object ilist and icollection allow values to be added to the collection

4972178
ienumerable	ienumerator
with ienumerable we had to effectively cast often implicitly in a foreach statement each element that was returned from the sequence because the current property of ienumerator is just of type object

4972200
entity-relationship	diagram
aqua data studio offers an entity-relationship diagram generator and entity-relationship modeler but it s pricey now

4972244
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
like i need to support both case-sensitive and case-insensitive search

4972248
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
the wp password is stored as a salt md5 hash which can t possibly match the sha1 you are being sent

4972258
children	parent
this single xpath expression selects all tr children of the table parent whose position is not one of the last two

4972330
apache	nginx
in a webserver like apache or nginx this is taken care of for you and usually defaults to index.html index.htm if either exists it will get served when going to a directory with no actual filename on the end

4972330
apache	nginx
when everyone says this is built into passenger i think they really mean that it s built into apache nginx

4972330
apache	nginx
apache nginx will check if the static file exists and serve it if it does the request will never get to rack which is awesome for performance

4972331
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you want to initialize the button to be disable you may put this code in the viewdidload viewwillappear depending on the context of your application

4972339
youtube	vimeo
i believe the regex expression is retring more then it should and i would like to retrive only the urls that it finds not every reference of vimeo or youtube

4972350
apache	nginx
this is better for performance as you don t have to go through the sinatra rack stack just to serve static text which is what apache nginx are awesome at doing

4972377
imperative	declarative
we can state that hive is declarative and sit on higher level of abstraction then imperative pig

4972460
next	replacewith
other than setting attributes css. replacewith inserts the value before the next elements

4972464
super	extends
and let all the projects extends from the super pom

4972464
super	extends
so every other project pom will have a parent section to extends from the super pom like this

4972492
children	parent
the first half of the union query should represent the parent and the second should return the children

4972537
versioning	upgrade
it needs only two units works for delphi 6 up to xe and is already unicode ready so using this unit you could upgrade safely to a newer delphi versioning when you want to

4972540
google-chrome	firefox
just keep in mind that gpu support for canvas at the moment works only on windows - so you d have to take all the osx running machines out of equation and only in ie9 google-chrome 11 and firefox 4 - all of them either rc betas or dev builds

4972554
submit	submission
for instance rather than submission the full path c users ericlaw documents secret image.png internet explorer 8 will now submit only the filename image.png

4972563
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have a restful controller that has your standard rest http verbs get post put delete

4972563
post	get
the problem i am having is that although my controllers are decorated to accept these verbs when i execute my rest action it can only hit my get and post methods

in the visual c++ standard library implementation std string can be used when you include but the overload that allows insertion of an std string into an std ostream is only included if you include the actual header

4975451
integer	unsigned
edit as has been noted in the other answers the standard actually guarantees that the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

4975451
integer	unsigned
and if you interpret this as an unsigned 32-bit integer as your computer will do if you cast it you ll end up with 4294967234 -

4975462

when the error message indicates that ttf_font is actually a typedef not a struct

4977633
typedef	struct

4980721
cvs	svn
but the reality is that dvcses are an even bigger step forward over svn than svn was over cvs

4980721
bazaar	git
essentially the same model would be followed - with variations - if you used git mercurial or bazaar

4980732
versioning	upgrade
it s best to wait a little when new gem versioning are released before you upgrade

4980740
nswindow	nsstatusitem
the nscollectionview in question is inside an nswindow that s being shown when an nsstatusitem is clicked like coversutra tictoc what have you

4980766
lisp	smalltalk
i do not need to know the keywords per se but how many keywords languages like c c++ c# perl python php smalltalk lisp and ruby have

4980780
ubuntu	debian
looks like you use the debian ubuntu ruby

4980780
ubuntu	debian
1.8.7 is available and usable in debian ubuntu install the ruby-full meta package via apt

4980786
put	get
i ve used jquery to get the xml and put the submenu s into an array

4980831
flask	django
personally i like django but your mileage may vary i would say though that whatever you do with python and the web will require some sort of framework even if it s one of the absolute minimal ones like flask which basically do just the routing part

4980844
getter	setter
you can also use public properties without concerning yourself if they are private fields with getter and setter java properties c# or generated object methods using metaprogramming ruby

4980872
ant	maven
because ant gradle and maven are unit-testable too

4980896
addition	multiplication
you only need to perform the comparison and then one addition - instead of two additions and two multiplication after the conversion from bool to byte

4980911
listview	gridview
i want to add an option for the user to select between 2 views the current listview and a gridview

4980911
listview	gridview
before i ask the actual question note that my question is not how to add a gridview - it s already added and works great when commenting out all listview lines

4980911
listview	gridview
right now i extend listactivity to get getlistview which causes the gridview to force close as the activity looks for a listview with the id list

4980958
getter	setter
the detail property should not be instantiated within the constructor nor through the getter setter via a backing member

4980997
post	get
you get the 1 via post i don t see where s the problem with inserting that into the database

4981025
uiview	subviews
i have a magnifying glass as a uiimageview subviews of a uiview

4981036
hide	show
the code below alow to render properly map after hide show

4981070
width	height
then in properties you can select add the pixels 200px on width height

4981088
post	get
if you go for javascript i m assuming it would run in a browser and therefore to communicate with anything else it would make http requests post or get urls so the client server arrangement is unavoidable

4981102
for-loop	loops
notice that in this loops you only change the value of child in the nested for-loop but never elsewhere

4981151
uiview	subviews
then as the uiview is moved by the user dragging touching the subviews is moved in relation to that to create a magnify effect

4981168
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
to add a table view you would create a uitableviewcontroller or a generic uiviewcontroller with a uitableview embedded in it this depends on your needs and put it in your uitabbarcontroller viewcontrollers property

4981174
virtualenv	setuptools
so pip and virtualenv sound wonderful compared to setuptools

4981197
for-loop	arrays
i wanted to declare a 2d arrays and assign values to it without running a for-loop

4981211
width	height
you should probably wrap it in a class that would also contain width and height

4981236
children	parent
i m trying to write some code which uses pipes to communicate between a parent process and it s children

4981245
textmate	textwrangler
that forces me to open subject file in some editor like textmate or textwrangler because these two handle large files much better than eclipse

4981264
filtering	grouping
you may find it easier to work with just an observablecollection of objects and use this with listviewcollection class which allows you to navigate and display the source collection based on sort filtering and grouping queries all without having to manipulate the underlying source collection itself

4981302
put	get
which changes get put in

4981309
put	get	post	get	post	put
when you put the username passwort into an html form sent via get or post you have to implement all the login logout logic yourself which might be an advantage

4981327
put	get
the changes made first get put in

4981355
listview	gridview
for tables use the gridview control for list of options use dropdownlist and for other things use layout use the listview control you can use it for tables too

4981367
put	get
i want to get the home wallpaper set and put it as my background for my activity

4981384
onfocus	onblur
you can place onfocus onblur events on the window

4981394
versioning	upgrade
he might have to live with the limitation that brings or upgrade to a newer versioning of sql server

4981461
ffmpeg	libvpx
by using ffmpeg you can get that by ffmpeg -i video.avi which returns stream #0.0 video libvpx yuv420p 512x288 par 1 1 dar 16 9 25 fps 25 tbr 1k tbn 25 tbc and you can see the fps there

4981490
accessor	properties
because the object returned from the get accessor is autoreleased in the current scope it remains valid if the properties value is changed

4981490
getter	setter
the performance of technique 2 is significantly better than technique 1 in situations where the getter is called much more often than the setter

4981490
getter	setter
the approach used by technique 3 is good for frequently called getter and setter methods

4981529
tunnel	vpn
assuming you are using a real vpn and not just a browser based proxy solution then the vpn should encrypt and tunnel all of your network traffic this includes anything coming out of any port on your computer not just http traffic

4981529
tunnel	vpn
there are some vpns which allow for split traffic split tunnel traffic to certain domains gets tunneled through the vpn and others goes in the clear but this is the rarity most vpns will tunnel all of your traffic which seems to be what you are looking for

4981540
listadapter	listactivity
first the listactivity and second the custom listadapter

4981544
google-chrome	firefox
working in google-chrome and firefox

4981544
google-chrome	firefox
to get your code to work in google-chrome and firefox you ll have to create a regexp object since your strings aren t hardcoded with the appropriate flags

4981595
curb	libcurl
curb is good too because it uses the libcurl library but the interface isn t as intuitive to me

4981595
safariwatir	firewatir
there are flavors for the different browsers on different oses such as firewatir safariwatir and operawatir so you ll have to figure out what works for you

4981595
postgresql	mysql
sqlite3 mysql and postgresql are all excellent choices depending on how big you think your database needs will be

4981598
translation	localization
i m writing an applescript to parse an ios localization file en.lproj localizable.strings translation the values and output the translation fr.lproj localizable.strings to disk in utf-16 unicode encoding

4981605
folder	directory
after reading ritesh s clue i moved test-spring-config.xml into the src test resources directory and now i see a file in the target test-classes folder but i got a new error

4981620
nsoperation	nsrunloop
nsoperation nsrunloop etc. but so far i canâ t quite piece it all together

4981622
subtract	add
so what i did was have the left right functions add subtract small amounts onto an angle variable that is used to draw the character s rotation

4981622
subtract	add
then the forward backward functions add subtract small amounts to the x and z axes variables

4981622
cos	sin
i thought this would work because when the player is going straight forward the heading is 0 and so cos 0 1 and sin 0 0 which means they move nowhere on the x but forwards the full 0.005 amount on the z

4981638
innodb	myisam
these are supported by innodb backends but not myisam tables but it supports a concept called atomic operations

4981690
postgresql	mysql
you can do atomic increments in postgresql or mysql for something like hit_count

4981696
width	height
the width and height of the whole red rectangle is dynamic based on width and height of parent control

4981696
width	height
but i need to place two small rectangles static width and height in top left and top right corner as shown on image

4981745
folder	directory
now with a folder for each day i m already at 365 directory and possibly many more within those

4981752
button	checkbox
all i can find in the default listview is simple checkbox and other listviews without button

4981781
hash	salt
and ask on so you ll want to salt passwords with their own individual salt so that the same password won t result in the same hash

4981783
hash	salt
you might want to add a salt to the password you re going to hash

4981786
scrypt	pbkdf2
key strengthening bcrypt scrypt pbkdf2

4981797
folder	directory
i committed it like this because i had every intention of fixing the problems with a new project named the same thing and only transferring over the good code and resources all in nice neat folder and directory

4981806
realloc	malloc
you can allocate an array of arbitrary length with malloc it s like new in java and make it grow or shrink with realloc

4981838
hide	show
next up you can use css to show hide or do what ever you want on you divs

4981844
titlebar	window
caption is the text shown in the titlebar of the window title is the header and text is the body matter of the dialog

4981853
int	chars
each graph has a graph has a collection of all of the nodes in the systems and each node is a template which holds the node value of type t i have tested it with int and chars and a list of the edges edges are the connections to the other nodes and has a weighting and pointer the other node

4981875
google-chrome	firefox
any answer that is true for v8 google-chrome s js engine may not be true for spidermonkey firefox s or jscript ie etc.

4981915
google-chrome	safari
if i use if .browser.webkit this will detect both safari and google-chrome and will apply styles to both browsers

4981915
google-chrome	safari
when i use alert to see the version of google-chrome and safari on my machine i get

4981915
google-chrome	safari
534.13 for google-chrome and 3.2.3 for safari

4981915
google-chrome	safari
here both google-chrome and safari and taking #555 color first and then #ccc

4981915
google-chrome	safari
how do i differentiate between google-chrome and safari so that i can style them differently

4981916
switching	screens
although you can keep it under the lock screens you will not be able to switching to other processes only to a very limited extent and under specific conditions

4981932
google-chrome	safari
both safari and google-chrome have a problem with this

4981946
nswindow	nsmenuitem
i have an application with an nsmenuitem that launches a separate window and i was wondering if it would also be possible to add a hot-key combination so that it would be possible to also invoke the nswindow via that as well

4981954
post	put
seriously put together the minimal complete code sample that generates the error and post that

4981957
google-chrome	firefox
i have manage to make it auto play on firefox but it does not work on google-chrome also that on iphone and ipad i can still see the default player ui

4981987
subclass	accessor
i want to be able to over-ride the accessor to return a where b is subclass of a

4982001
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you could get the desired effect by binding the width and height of whatever panel you use to the actualwidth and actualheight of the border

4982019
nswindow	nsstatusitem
i have an application that upon activation is backgrounded and has an nsstatusitem icon which can be clicked to either close the application or open an nswindow

4982019
nswindow	nsstatusitem
currently i can click the icon and then press command+option+t and the nswindow will activate but what i can t do is press the key combo without first clicking the nsstatusitem

4982066
h.264	webm
the latest versions of chrome do not support h.264 video so your issue in that case may be lack of an ogg webm fallback

4982107
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however if you ever decide to open up to mobile devices iphone ipad android webos blackberry 6 html5-compatible web browsers safari google-chrome firefox opera ie9 or pretty much anything newer than 5 years ago h.264 is definitely the way to go

4982114
width	font-size	width	height
with different sizes width font-size you should be able to choose the appropriate padding by calculating height - fontsize 2 perhaps give or take a pixel or two for perfection

4982123
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4982166
hide	show
then show everything whose lang matches the language and hide everything whose lang doesn t match

4982166
hide	show
if you keep the show hide logic in a separate function that takes a language argument then it would be pretty easy to provide a language selection widget of some sort too

4982178
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my application is intended to only work with more modern browsers such as ie7+ firefox google-chrome safari and newer opera however it still works somewhat in ie6

4982178
google-chrome	safari
is there a specific list of features that i should test for to determine if the user is browsing with a fairly compliant html5 browser google-chrome safari ie9 etc.

4982190
width	height
i set the height width of these two bars with classes left and right with jquery

4982190
width	height
again the height width and right properties are all animated with jquery

4982246
vim	textmate
i am trying vim coming from textmate

4982271
git-rebase	amend
git-rebase amend seems inefficient when you have the power of filter-branch at your fingertips

4982290
width	height
also you can use width and height to retrieve the dimensions of the element

4982309
comparator	comparable
you need to implement the comparator method in your item class and declare it to implement the comparable interface

4982314
comparator	comparable
but since you want to sort by two different things implementing comparable won t get you very far it s better to use a comparator

4982332
content-disposition	content-type
update ok if using your own bandwidth is not an issue then all you need to be doing is outputting the files binary content to the browser and setting the relevant http headers ie content-type and content-disposition

4982398
put	get
the problem i m having though is that the photos user route is either interpreted as the show method or if i put those custom routes before the resources then routes like new get interpreted as the user method

4982438
instances	transient
with gorm you have to save and attach in a bottom up fashion or when grails goes to flush the connection for the next instances you will get the transient instances exception

4982438
instances	transient
the instances is transient because its just an in-memory reference

4982443
hide	show
within the detailsview i have a number of asp panels that i d like to show hide depending on what s happening in that person s visit

4982480
width	height
i was expecting that when i set the padding-top property it would take the padding as a percentage of the height of the parent container which is base in our case but the above value of 50 percent is calculated as a percentage of the width

4982486
free	malloc
actually i can t find anything obviously wrong with your memory or file handling in the code above the crash on free might just be a symptom of something in your code writing into malloc s personal space.

4982540
post	get
all the requests get and post are successfully able to route to tomcat server except the file upload multipart post form submissions

4982617
width	height
i am trying to create a class where the width and height of a 2 dimensional array can be dynamically created at the point of initialisation with init parameters

4982650
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have an absolutely positioned div on which i am trying to trigger mouseenter and mouseleave events

4982650
background-color	transparency
in ie8 7 with the background-color of the div left unspecified so that it defaults to transparency the mouseenter leave events are not firing when the cursor crosses the div s boundary only somewhere in the middle of the div and when the cursor is over any text within the div

4982702
gmail	hotmail
until i ve implemented a separate compose widget i m planning to special case the mailto links for users with gmail yahoo hotmail etc

4982719
ftell	fread
if ftell returns -1 then malloc would allocate a buffer for 0 bytes but the fread would attempt to read up to 4 gb of data which might overflow the space

4982719
ftell	fread
otoh if ftell fails it is likely that fread will fail too

4982721
uiview	subviews
basically the process is the same you create a uiview add the buttons images as subviews and then return it on the method

4982730
getter	setter
you might want to use a property with retain and then synthesis the getter and setter methods

4982741
width	height
your first linearlayout says fill_parent for both height and width so it will take up all the room

4982785
internationalization	localization
depending on what technology you re using this concept is known as string externalizing string resourcing string internationalization localization etc

4982793
children	parent
then you just create your children views and add them to the parent view with addsubview

4982793
children	parent
keep in mind that all your views are kept in memory until you remove them from the parent view using the children view s removefromsuperview method

4982817
for-loop	loops
you need to add a while loops or for-loop as in

4982850
box-sizing	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box

4982851
calloc	malloc
it frees only the memory allocated in the corresponding call to malloc calloc

4982851
valgrind	memcheck
i should add that a good way to know if you are leaking memory or not is to test your program with the valgrind memcheck tool

4982855
portrait	landscape
the orientation change is handled by my application but when it is switched back to portrait the application remains in the landscape view

4982900
width	height
i found out that many of writers suggest to use value for div s width or height

4982905
fgets	fread
better yet use fgets instead of fread

4982949
put	get
you can put your line of code in a method and have that get called by an nstimer

4982963
portrait	landscape
but once i start changing the orientation it shows the image in correct position in both landscape and portrait modes

4982969
int	boolean
these are returning compile errors like expected value found int and incomparable types java.lang.object and boolean

4982988
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter and mouseleave are not registering until the cursor hits something visible

4983016
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
use the mouseenter mouseleave events instead the mouseover and mouseout fire multiple times

4983080
width	height
you specify whether or not the borders should remain where they are relative to its parent and whether the width and height are stretchable if needed

4983081
equals	tostring	tostring	getter
add the usual infrastructure tostring hashcode equals getter

4983095
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream

4983101
hide	show
cell1 cell2 et-al are my blocks that i need to show hide onclick of a elements

4983101
hide	show
btw this code always hide all the cell blocks and show cell6 which does not exist in my code

4983101
hide	show
so how do i iterate over an array and show hide my cells

4983162
int	double
you cast the double to an int which is always 0

4983174
toolchain	newlib	glibc	newlib	bare-metal	uclibc
for instance if you have a toolchain for arm glibc-based systems it will work to compile programs for standard arm linux systems that use glibc but won t work on arm uclinux systems that use uclibc or on arm bare-metal systems using newlib

4983187
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox work fine but ie7 when using ie7 the server will response the first update i have since i clear ie7 cache

4983192
post	get
apparently original developer had never heard of sql-injection because he s using post and get variables directly in his sql statements

4983210
move	drag
through it you can let the user drag an object on the screen access where it is when it s stopped being move and so on

4983220
post	get
however if what you say is true it s quite likely that the original developer didn t know much about magic_quotes so it s likely he messed up if he ever stored the get post cookie values anywhere else except sql statements

4983234
hide	show
it will hide them so when entering a group mailbox folder it will only show you mail that are unread or ticked

4983244
int	double
now you will have those value in int double

4983270
client-side	server-side
you re confusing client-side and server-side events

4983320
put	get	post	get	post	put
rest on the other hand thinks in resources - you have a customer resource and issuing an http get on that resource uri retrieves the customer a put would insert a new customer post would update an existing customer and delete all http verbs will delete your customer

4983335
google-chrome	firefox
frankly the page is neither fast in ie nor firefox nor google-chrome

4983335
google-chrome	firefox
but its relatively faster in firefox and google-chrome much than ie

4983335
google-chrome	firefox
i suppose it has something to do with the different mechanisms of firefox google-chrome and ie use handling contents

4983338
uiview	subviews
i have added a uiview in ib targetview and have added 4 labels as subviews to this

4983338
hide	show
i want to show hide this container view to actually show hide the 4 labels inside it

4983369
getter	setter
you could look into custom getter setter __definesetter__ functions for firefox and create a setter for the location property of window

4983406
onresume	onpause
for dynamically registering unregistering of broadcastreceiver s you have to remember the instance of your receiver in onpause to register it again during onresume

4983422
stateless	stateful
should you ever need jpa s extended persistence context then the stateful session bean is practically made for that otherwise the stateless session bean would be used for daos

4983430
aggregate-functions	sum
the having operator is to be applied to aggregate-functions - if you want to pick those rows where a sum exceeds a certain value or something

4983441
width	height
the height and width properties and if i remember in wpf there is a value that does it by percentage

4983443
post	get
the problem with redirecting using get and not post is similar

4983500
rss	feed
it gets rss feed from gmail and then shows them in a simple table

4983521
portrait	landscape
also you can choose different images for portrait and landscape interface orientations if your app supports multiple interface orientations

4983563
portrait	landscape
you can change the image for both portrait and landscape orientations by supplying different images for different orientations by checking the frame size of that uinavigation bar instance

4983588
portrait	landscape
you can also use different sized images for portrait and landscape orientations if you d like to

4983593
post	get
if you get an exception for +entityforname you should post the code around +entityforname

4983612
getter	setter
read about getter and setter

4983646
implements	extends
i have two classes - task which implements comparable and deadlinedtask where deadlinedtask extends task

4983661
portrait	landscape
this code also supports both portrait and landscape orientations

4983662
width	height
for me it s easier to consider your verticies as width x height y and depth z

4983671
uiview	calayer
as far as i know uiview s are pretty lightweight wrappers around calayer so the performance loss shouldn t be too big

4983671
uiview	calayer
but i think a sprite would simply be better represented by an instance of calayer rather than uiview

4983693
cydia	tweak
- weeks ago i installed a cydia tweak to setup a frecnh keyboard tweak i uninstalled after it started to crash thinking it was because of it but apparently it wasn t

4983696
equals	compareto
the normal way to handle equals and compareto is to return false for equals or throw classcastexception for compareto if the arguments actual type doesn t match the actual type of this

4983696
equals	compareto
if you try to implement equals or compareto for subtypes you can easily create semantic anomalies such as

4983702
comparator	comparable
per class only one comparator method can be used to implement the comparable interface

4983710
comparator	comparable
i would thus completely avoid to implement comparable in the task class and use a dedicated comparator when sorting a collection of tasks

4983721
inherited	properties
because all these inherited their properties and methods from domnode it is essential to familiarize yourself with the domnode class

4983748
opencv	emgucv
emgucv .net wrapper for opencv has all the features i want but i m unable to use it on windows phone development as it encounters a runtime conflict

4983806
post	get
you have to get a pointer to the other thread to post a message to it

4983819
qlist	qmap
i want to know how qvariant can internally stores int qmap qlist .

4983831
division	addition
thus saving a division addition operation every time you loop

4983833
children	parent
i need to store a large amount of nodes with many-to-many relationship to eachother through parent children

4983833
children	parent
is there any way i can do it and only load the parent or children one step away

4983879
google-chrome	firefox
in css 3 there is the nth-child pseudo-class but it is fully supported only by firefox 3.5 and google-chrome

4983910
hide	show
i want to hide bar and only want to show thumb

4983915
hash	salt
the code tries to hash a password with sha512 and uses just time as the salt

4983926
screens	hdpi
i want to resize those images for hdpi and ldpi screens

4983926
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	width	height	mdpi	hdpi
i have heard that we multiply the height and width of the mdpi image by 1.5 to convert it to a hdpi screens

4983927
getter	setter
i assume that this syntax aucomatically creates getter setter methods

4983928
hash	salt
anyway every value you use to salt your password hash should be stored some way so you can recalculate the hash

4983928
hash	salt
a user name + a time stamp should be a salt which is uniquq enough so there is no way there is some rainbow table on the net which contains precalculated hash with passwords which are salt this way

4983937
getter	setter
mozilla has a tool which generates c++ code for this with usual getter and setter methods

4983945
opencv	emgucv
emgucv is just a wrapper and uses the unmanaged opencv

4983954
mdpi	hdpi
from the android developer 0.75 for ldpi 1.0 for mdpi and 1.5 for hdpi

hash	salt
in any case far more important than a perfect salt is using a good hash function and sha512 is one of the best we have available right now

4983963
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc

4983987
hash	salt
salt is use to prevent rainbow attacks by breaking the match between the password and precomputed hash

4983996
hash	salt
salt should not be random or you would not be able to regenerate the same hash for a given input - see 3

4983996
hash	salt
the below is specific to blowfish sha-256 and sha-512 which all return the salt within the hash

4984018
ant	maven
the jaxb2 basics plugins documentation includes instructions for using the plugin with ant and maven

4984018
equals	tostring
the jaxb2 basics plugins provides a number of other utilities which you might also find useful such as autogeneration of equals hashcode and tostring methods

4984024
ant	maven
the jaxb2 basics plugins documentation includes instructions for using the plugin with ant and maven

4984024
equals	tostring
the jaxb2 basics plugins provides a number of other utilities which you might also find useful such as autogeneration of equals hashcode and tostring methods

4984037
folder	directory
if you are using visual studio you should go to tools- options- projects and solutions- c++ directory and select from dropdown list option include files and add a path to openssl include folder

4984044
hash	salt
a salt is a random set of bytes of a fixed length that is added to the input of a hash algorithm

4984044
hash	salt
adding a random salt to a hash ensures that the same password will produce many different hash

4984044
hash	salt
the salt is usually stored in the database together with the result of the hash function

4984044
hash	salt
this is only true if the salt is stored separate from the hash

4984044
hash	salt
8 character case-sensitive alpha-numeric passwords with 16 bit salt hash to a 128 bit value would take up just under 200 exabytes without rainbow reduction

4984044
hash	salt
a salt is not a secret key instead a salt works by making the hash function specific to each instance

4984044
hash	salt
with salt hash there is not one hash function but one for every possible salt value

4984044
hash	salt
a secret salt is not a salt it is called a key and it means that you are no longer computing a hash but a message authentication code mac

4984044
hash	salt
this ensures that an attacker has to attack every salt hash separately

4984044
hash	salt
the point of the salt is to be distinct for each hash password

4984044
prng	random
using a random salt obtained from a cryptographically secure unpredictable prng may be some kind of overkill but at least it provably protects you against all those hazards

4984044
hash	salt
store the salt along with the hash password

4984044
hash	salt
stackoverflow.com non-random salt for password hash

4984044
crypt	salt
usenix.org unix crypt used salt since 1976

4984101
hide	show
another option is now to use jquery to create dom node on the fly but instead create the html statically and use css and js to show hide the x mark when users mouse over it

4984138
children	parent
think of creating a formula on the children object where you access the data from the parent

4984159

4984396
folder	directory
i hope this makes sense but basically i want to have my working copy and then pull in files from another repo that have files and folder in the same directory as my working copy already has files and folder

4984409
crypt	salt
salt for a crypt algorithm is only a small part of the security problem

4984409
hash	salt
note that algorithms like sha-512 and blowfish can return the salt as part of their hash

4984409
hash	salt
be careful with these as if you store the complete hash you give away the algorithm which means there s two less thing for the hackers to figure out the salt also gives away the algorithm

4984428
stdout	stderr
when outf errf is either none or a file descriptor different files for stdout stderr

4984493
portrait	landscape
i have a application with a webview most of the time it stays portrait mode but but certain time i want to force to landscape mode for example for image display

4984499

after stepping through the program a bit it seems that the parent linearlayout has removed the view from its children but the textview itself still thinks that it has a parent

4984517
folder	directory
i just select the folder in my eclipse right click team and select update to head.buty this leaves dirty copy of some directory and files

4984527
folder	directory
on an index page i have the form to select multiple contacts for the purpose of making a copy of those contacts to a different directory folder

4984527
folder	directory
when the form is submitted the following params exist which are all the contact id s and the directory and folder foreign keys

4984550
google-chrome	firefox
works for google-chrome but not for ie and firefox doesn t work meaning the redirection doesn t occur and the browser reloads the same page

4984680
margin	height
trying to draw it even higher will force you to set the line height smaller than the font size or set a negative margin

4984691
getattr	setattr
setattr and getattr already exist

4984763
memcached	apc
whether that s memcached apc hard-drive mongodb etc

4984786
folder	directory
the above example would work assuming you copied the text of text csv_pp source into a file named csv_pp.pm in a folder called text created in the same directory as your script

4984821
width	height
i guess you should compare locationonjoystick.x with the width of your joystickarea.frame.size and the same with y and height

4984861
capistrano	bundler
if you deploy the project with capistrano you can use the default bundler recipe by including the recipe at the top of your deploy.rb file

4984879
jscrollpane	jviewport
when you create a jscrollpane around a component the scrollpane actually adds the component into an internal jviewport

4984891
uiview	calayer
if you don t want to subclass calayer you can also assign it a delegate which must not be a uiview and implement drawlayer incontext

4984923
width	height
well you can do this by allocating n rows of k elements where n is the height of the image - and k - it s width

4984995
firefox	safari
safari and firefox on both windows and mac don t have a problem with this either

4985008
tunnel	vpn
however you want to synchronize the databases replication a php script etc. the best way to secure it would be to either use an ipsec vpn or ssh tunnel to encrypt all the communication between the two servers

4985009
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
simply have the alarmmanager alarm use a pendingintent that either sends a custom action to your appwidgetprovider that you process in onreceive or calls startservice on the intentservice you are using for the real smarts behind your app widget

4985032
inherited	properties
2- if i pass inherited like i received complete intellisense for ipagedlist properties but for viewmodels numberofproducts productbrowse categorymodel i only receive their names but not ther properties like productbrowse.productid as an example

4985054
alarmmanager	wakelock
the broadcastreceiver requirement is due to the way alarmmanager handles its own wakelock

4985070
inherited	properties
1 create your myimagebutton class which should inherited regular button and include two dependency properties - normalimage and disabledimage

a potential disadvantage is that these modules are specific to your java ee implementation jboss glassfish etc

4985221
division	multiplication
without using multiplication or division operators

4985221
subtract	add
you can use only add subtract operators

4985266

you can host your application either on apache with mod_mono or through fastcgi on web servers like nginx or lighttpd

4985270
ubuntu	linux
i want to retrieve motherboard id from a c++ program on linux ubuntu without root privileges

4985276
stdio	gets
it remaps stdio to each new process so each session gets its respective data

4985276
system.in	system.out
however i am stuck when it comes to finding out how to remap system.in system.out and system.err to the child threads on creation

4985306
getter	setter
to map a group of radiobuttons to a single enum property and its corresponding getter setter you d have to implement your own editor wrapping the radiobutton group and returning a value of type e

4985313
profiling	debugging
many books have been written about debugging as it involves numerous aspects including interactive debugging control flow integration testing log files monitoring application system memory dumps profiling statistical process control and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes

4985316
outputstream	inputstream
instead have an inputstream and two outputstream s passed in to your object s constructor

4985337
ssl	https
https http | tls ssl | tcp | lower-layer-protocols

4985338
ssl	https
hypertext transfer protocol secure https is a combination of the hypertext transfer protocol with the ssl tls protocol to provide encrypted communication and secure identification of a network web server

4985356
client-side	server-side
so if someone were going to start a web project without using a popular server-side web framework like rails and a popular client-side framework like jquery i d think that they were either crazy ignorant or very niche

4985428
post	get
right now it only outputs some simple xml but i would like it to be able to process and respond to post requests to get thinks like incoming caller id

4985432
gtkmm	glibmm
i try to implement a gtype interface in c++ using glibmm part of gtkmm

4985446
addition	multiplication
you can implement multiplication using only bit shifts a few bit comparisons and addition

4985446
subtract	add
if you want to produce normal ieee floating point numbers a few parts get a bit ugly though -- for example the scale factor is stored as a bias number instead of any of the usual 1 s complement 2 s complement etc. so working with it is clumsy basically each operation you subtract off the bias do the operation check for overflow and assuming it hasn t overflowed add the bias back on again

4985446
verilog	vhdl
for quite a few computer architecture classes it s interesting to reduce a problem to primitive operations you can express directly in hardware bit shifts bitwise- and - or and - not etc. the implementation shown above fits that reasonably well if you want to get technical an adder takes a few gates but vhdl verilog etc. but it s included in things like vhdl and verilog anyway

4985451
ubuntu	linux
i want to retrieve scsi hard drive serial on linux ubuntu from a c++ program without root priveleges

4985462

getter	setter
i use spring roo to generate getter setter

4985502
post	get
- changed the get into post in the php file

4985509
post	get
you can get argument passing including support for post file upload but not not much else you choose whatever template if any you want to use whatever db .

4985523
inherited	properties
mixins are related to inherited in that an object receives properties or methods from another object but are typically not limited in number

4985601
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
this means you can t redirect the child process stdio but you can explicitly write something into its stdin and read from its stdout and stderr using the corresponding process methods or to be precise the corresponding methods of input output streams returned by the getinputstream getoutputstream geterrorstream methods of the process class

4985601
outputstream	inputstream
you can use some sort of imitation of ipc with threads using custom inputstream outputstream implementations or you may wish to have a look at the pipedinputstream pipedoutputstream pair

4985601
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
these can actually be used to set up something like an ipc pipe probably with conjunction with bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream to avoid excessive blocking

4985611
freebsd	linux	openbsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	stdout	stderr
on linux openbsd freebsd and similar os s you can usually just call binmode on the stdout and stderr file handles

4985643
pop-up	dialog
but no alert dialog pop-up when i click on the hyperlink

4985671
getter	setter
m create getter setter methods like

4985709
paypal	recurly
the cheapest best option in my opinion is run your site with recurly and use intuit merchant service instead of paypal

4985731
clang	icc
for compiling i use gcc mingw and native clang icc and for targets i have gnu linux bsd darwin windows

4985768
opera	google-chrome
not sure about opera but in google-chrome you can have as many pages as you like but single background page which shouldn t limit anything

4985797
mvp	presenter
backbone.js is a javascript framework with a restful json interface and is based on the modelâ viewâ presenter mvp application design paradigm

4985810
versioning	upgrade
if you have the old installer presumably you can browse to it to get information about what versioning you wish to be able to upgrade from

4985810
versioning	upgrade
i then adjusted the properties of that entry to specify a minimum and maximum versioning for the upgrade and everything worked as expected

4985829
hide	show
i do want to hide show about-paragraph located in the header just under navigation bar and i can not see what i am doing wrong

4986014
post	get
therefore you cannot implicitly get post parameters by writing

4986026
draggable	droppable
you can use the draggable and droppable functions for the front end and when your users are done you ll need to post the coordinates of their elements text and which pictures they re using etc

4986031
public	protected
the only access modifiers are private internal protected protected internal and public and none fit the bill

4986041
listview	gridview
ideally i would want to be use within gridview dataviews and listview but can t find examples which exactly provide steps to follow

4986052
int	double
my ini file mostly contains simple types strings int double etc. but i do have some values that represent an array

4986053
getter	setter
what happens is that both selectonemenus getter are called then both their setter and then again both their getter

4986070
subclass	abstract-class
c++ create abstract-class with abstract method and override the method in a subclass has good answers to this problem

4986143
accessor	properties
if you don t need to do any operations in the accessor use a auto-implemented properties

4986150
move	drag
i think it would be simpler to put one transparent div covering everything and then handling the drag of the video yourself using the mousedown move up handlers in the transparent div instead of doing all this trickery for the buttons

4986152
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the website i m working on renders fine in safari but not in google-chrome or firefox

4986157
post	get
you can send both post and get requests with the following parameters

4986157
rss	feed
feedlink the url of the rss feed

4986172
button	checkbox
i have a form with checkbox and radio button

4986172
button	checkbox
i ve been trying several scripts trying to find a way to provide a select all select none functionality for the checkbox where the radio button are not affected

4986172
button	checkbox
even scripts where you specifically include the id of the checkbox will still cause the radio button to toggle

4986172
button	checkbox
even though the function takes the id of the checkbox it will affect the radio button in the form the last radio button will end up being selected

4986203
ubuntu	linux
this is c code running on a linux ubuntu machine

4986207
post	get
you can send both post and get requests with the following parameters

4986207
rss	feed
feedlink the url of the rss feed response json or xml as the response format

4986219
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have this feature so you can check in there as well

4986220
int	chars
there is no guarantee of the size of any of the built-in types like int chars and the like

4986232
integer	unsigned
edit it s unfortunate that earlz deleted his answer because his idea was actually better than he thought if a c99 implementation has a 16-bit unsigned integer type it s required to provide uint16_t as a typedef for that type

4986237
mouseleave	mouseenter
this was achieved by adding event handlers to the menustrips mouseenter and mouseleave events to display and remove the text

4986237
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem i am having is that i am now using a mainmenu control instead of a menustrip and since it doesn t derive from control it doesn t have mouseenter and mouseleave events

4986239
unsigned	short
therefore the size of a short or unsigned short may be larger than what i just posted above

4986250
post	get
you can send both post and get requests with the following parameters

4986250
rss	feed
feedlink the url of the rss feed response json or xml as the response format

4986300
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
my class implements serializable and i use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream to send and receive this object

4986320
width	height
portrait images should be scaled to height 100px and the width should be filled with a color

4986343
disk	ram
when computer starts create a ram disk and mount it to .vim then copy all plugins there

4986345
getter	setter
i know that a var implicitly gets two methods with it a getter and a setter

4986365
free	malloc
there are plenty of options other than increasing or decreasing one of which is that each function call performs the equivalent of malloc to obtain memory for the callee s automatic storage calls the callee and performs the equivalent of free after it returns

4986412
margin	height
you need to use absolute positioning add a height and margin should be half the height negated

4986456
implements	sealed
mef chokes because it is scanning all assemblies in the bin folder which contain interfaces and classes and the mvcdynamicsessioncontrollerfactory class which implements icontrollerfactory happens to be sealed

4986468
devise	cancan
devise manages your authentication now you need to manage your authorisation with roles - take a look at cancan and for integration instructions

4986489
put	get
i m trying to get the filenames that are stored on the sd card so i can put them in a listview

4986508
inherited	properties
i d expand point 2 to say all properties that you want to store must be public and read write for integer properties you can get away with having read only properties and it won t try to save them but you don t actually have to inherited from tableserviceentity

4986508
inherited	properties
all of these things you can do to a class that you create yourself and doesn t inherited from tableserviceentity note that the casing of these properties is important

4986518
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to newer versioning of google maps should be less time consuming because you already have working code and even though you make will have to make big changes you should be able to reuse some parts of the codebase

4986567
folder	directory
however i think it s the best to keep all files in the project home folder unless they are used across multiple projects and therefore your version control repository only contains a single root directory the project home for your project

4986630
int	chars
this will handle any unsigned int although large numbers will have an awful lot of m chars at the front and the caller has to ensure their buffer is large enough

4986636
uiview	subviews
it is possible that while your uitextview exists as it becomes a subviews of one of your uiview object addsubview retains the subviews the myviewcontroller object itself is released from the memory after you build up your view hierarchy

4986686
int	chars
for your second question is 8 because the size of an int is 4 the chars is 1 and the string starts at the next 8-byte boundary you are probably on a 64-bit system

4986695
lisp	scheme
it s exactly the same as scheme s begin or common lisp s progn

4986717
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup 3.1 supports python 3 but is also deemed a failed experiment and you are told not to use it so in practice beautifulsoup doesn t support python 3 yet leaving lxml as the only alternative

4986721
getter	setter
just create a getter and a setter method within your class

4986784
google-chrome	firefox
this code work on my computer with ie 8 google-chrome firefox

4986792
macports	homebrew
edit it seems i m getting downvoted for this response for advocating the use of macports over homebrew

4986828
int	boolean
since 10 is not a boolean but an int it is simply returned

4986838
jobs	cron
this plugin allows you to automate cron jobs easily from a rails application

4986853
charindex	substr
if the first url always starts right from the beginning of the string you can use substr charindex

4986853
charindex	substr
charindex simply searches a string for a substr and returns the substr s starting position within the string

4986892
getter	setter
due to implicit creation of a getter and a setter by the compiler you can t create such methods twice

4986892
getter	setter
i don t know if there is a reason why the compiler does not check if a getter or a setter exists and only if there are no such methods it create ones

4986921
rss	feed
the django syndication framework focuses on providing rss or other syndication format feed

4986931
put	get
if you don t want to get involved with all the nuts-and-bolts of the framework for navigation and just want to focus on the application for your users you can check out the professional version of the navigationcontrol that i put together

4986944
margin	height
i can control every element and adjust it s line height bottom margin ecc to keep the vertical rhythm

4986953
pdfsharp	itextsharp
on reflection based on looking at pdfsharp s faq wiki itextsharp has similar stuff for generating tiffs images as pdfsharp has

4986996
strlen	memcmp
examples of pure functions within the c standard library are memcmp and strlen

4987011
profiling	instrumentation
one different situation is where you want to instrumentation your code which is what profiling for example do which lets you hook into the code without actually calling anything explicitly

4987022
google-chrome	safari
however i am running google-chrome not safari

4987029
google-chrome	firefox
when i test the movie through flash ide the movie connects alright.but when i insert the swf in html and view from firefox google-chrome or other browser netconnection.connect does not work

4987053
google-chrome	firefox
the problem occurs in firefox ie and google-chrome so i think it must be a fundamental problem and not a browser issue

4987080
children	parent
i would first create a more suitable data structure -- capturing the link from a parent to its children

4987086
onresume	onpause
the android sdk provides the nativeactivity class which is a convenience class that notifies your native code of any activity lifecycle callbacks oncreate onpause onresume etc

4987096
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried using the excellent scrollto jquery plugin and while it works wonderfully on all desktop browser i tried firefox ie6+ google-chrome it failed for me on my android browser native for android 2

4987121
crypt	salt
you should store the entire output of crypt there s not a lot of point in splitting it up because you need to generate a new salt for each password you re hashing in any case

4987121
hash	salt
using a fixed hidden salt as mentioned by matt is wrong - the salt should be different for every hash

4987121
crypt	salt
for more information see - i recommend using the phpass library because it handles generating a random salt for you unlike crypt

4987152
fossil	git
subversion git fossil perforce mercurial and there are many online code hosting solutions for many of them

4987214
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
but this would bind the events to mouseenter and mouseleave not to mouseover and mouseout

4987260
bazaar	git
people recommend bazaar hg and git - which are the three i believe have critical mass these days - and which one fits you best is up to you to find out

4987271
post	get
you can send both post and get requests with the following parameters

4987271
rss	feed
feedlink the url of the rss feed response json or xml as the response format

4987277
unix	bsd
as far as i can see it s provided on the bsd unix family

4987325
verilog	vhdl
vhdl and verilog are both fairly new and fairly specialized languages

4987325
verilog	vhdl
google trends verilog red vs vhdl blue -

4987325
verilog	vhdl
by these numbers and only these numbers vhdl seems to be more widely-used than verilog

4987328
rss	feed
but in my opinion its still leaves a lot one needs to do for getting your rss feed to be capable of parsing any feed out there

4987328
post	get
you can send both post and get requests with the following parameters

4987328
rss	feed
feedlink the url of the rss feed response json or xml as the response format

4987329
superclass	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass
i m trying create a superclass whom i know will be subclassing i would make the object abstract but according to creating an abstract-class in objective-c you can t

4987329
superclass	subclassing
the superclass defines a method -initwitharguments that just throws an error because it s overridden by subclassing

4987329
superclass	subclassing
the superclass also has a static initializer that determines which subclassing to return at runtime like so

4987330
width	height
use them to return the height or width of the visible window

4987346
powerpc	i386
download and install the python 2.7.1 mac os x 64-bit 32-bit x86-64 i386 installer for mac os x 10.6 or python 2.7.1 mac os x 32-bit i386 powerpc installer for mac os x 10.3 through 10.6

4987348
pdfbox	apache-poi
i use pdfbox library for pdf files and apache-poi library for ms office documents and they re doing the job perfectly

_note location is a typedef struct containing char name double latitude double longitude

4990201
getter	setter
i usually try not to test getter setter directly since i see a greater benefit in testing only the methods that actually do something

4990201
getter	setter
yes for trivial get set testing i d only use one method per property maybe depending on the case even only one method for the whole class for value objects with many getter and setter i don t want to write maintain many tests

4990201
getter	setter
it might break or gets more complicated once you pass in objects array with type hinting but i d presonally prefer it over writing manual tests for 500 getter and setter

4990904
median	max	min	median	min	max
when analyzing performance on a running system it is not enough to get min max mean median stddev because your mean is often going to be too noisy the mean of your write function execution time can be 150nsec and stddev is 100nsec obviously that does not tell you much

4990928

2 sudo could even be configured to allow it without requiring a passwd but there be dragons down that path

vb6	vba
my theory is vba vb6 is using x87 for floating point calculations and this implicitly converts doubles to higher precision if 80 bits for intermediate results

4992431
subtraction	addition
the char values are being implicitly cast to numerical values before doing the addition and subtraction

4992447

4992927
hash	md5
md5 should indeed generate the same hash given the same input parameters however without specific implementation details it s hard to say what would cause the difference you see

4992936
hash	salt
it is different because asp.net membership provider assigns a different salt with each different user so you get different hash even if user name is same

4992936
hash	salt
because internally the mix of salt and same password will always match to the their respective hash

4992937

4993861
cassini	iis
however the identity that resides within this request context ultimately depends on how the web site iis cassini iis express or custom handles identity

that being said there is no substitute for a solid understanding of the underlying technology that you plan on using within windowbuilder be it swt swing or gwt

4993913
swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swing	windowbuilder

4993977
listview	gridview
for example changing a listview to a gridview to show data on a button click

4994055

i knew that given the right circumstances a gridview when connected to a sqldatasource would execute various crud operations directly against the database while applying its own sorting and paging techniques but that didn t translate well to using an objectdatasource with a business object -or so i thought

4994437
typedef	struct
sounds like you need to either use sizeof struct mystruct in your expression or use a typedef struct mystruct mystruct somewhere

keydown	keyup
in your keydown method save the current time and in the keyup compute the twell time as the difference between the current time and the keydown time

4994530
keydown	keyup
flight time from the figure of the article you linked i can t easily understand how it is defined but i would compute it as the difference between when you left the last key keyup and when you start pressing the next key keydown

4994530
keydown	keyup
so in keyup save a time for instance last_key_time and in keydown compute the flight time as current_time - last_key_time

4994546
filtering	grouping
for a more accurate event time you will have to subtract the grouping delay time of the low pass filtering

using setinterval allows you to clearinterval intervalid at a later stage if you need to stop it from running

4996280
getter	setter
there are certain patterns that would work really well if it did and i m constantly writing factory classes with getter and setter and just adding unnecessary cruft to classes just so i can get around to passing instances to methods instead of actual classes to factor out generic bits of code

4996303
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and otherwise there s only one option setting the table width s manually easy to gather by using developer tools that most modern browsers include ie8+ firefox google-chrome safari etc. you can read the width s there

4996314
width	height
the car has a fixed height and width and a position that changes with the mouse

4996344
width	height
if parent is the application then it should already be centered based on the width and height of the application - which is what the viewable area is from flex s point of view

4996740
unsigned	short	int	chars
if you don t care about storage requirements or wrapping behavior use unsigned int instead of unsigned short or unsigned chars

4996740
int	chars
on an 8-bit processor chars types may be faster than int but on 16-bit and larger processors where 16-bit math is faster than 32-bit math int is likely to be 16 bits so there s no need to use short or chars for speed

4996740
unsigned	short
btw on some processors unsigned short is much slower than unsigned int because the c standard requires that operations on unsigned types wrap

4997259
boyer-moore	rabin-karp	boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt	knuth-morris-pratt	rabin-karp
i don t know for sure why this decision was made but if i uad to guess it s probably because for small pattern strings a very common use case the naive brute force algorithm is probably as fast if not faster than some of the asymptotically faster algorithms like rabin-karp boyer-moore or knuth-morris-pratt

inherited	properties
i write last encountered because at project level we cannot specify a delimiter and what gets used there is the last properties sheet that specified inherited for that macro

5003855
inherited	properties
you cannot use a user macro to take a snapshot the local value of say intdir in a properties sheet and hope to bubble up that value through inherited because what gets inherited is actually the formula intdir whose value will eventually be resolved at the project config file level

-now uses the pop-up new item dialog rather than switching to the new item page

5007911
width	height
update i have tried looking for the mediaelement using snoop and the actualwidth actualheigt are both 0 but the height property is 140 and the width property is nan

5007937
fast-forward	merge
yes it will probably be a fast-forward merge but it s better safe than sorry

5007940
onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart
now the strange behaviour begins just after the last ondestroy finishes another activity is created oncreate onstart onrestoreinstancestate onresume and finally onpause are invoked

5008010
mouse	keyboard
traditionally a display has one keyboard and one mouse though it s more complex these days

5008010
children	parent
windows are arranged in a hierarchical tree where parent windows clip their children child windows can be located entirely or partially outside the extents of the parent but only the part inside the parent is visible

5008010
mouse	keyboard
all screens on a display share the same input devices though mouse and keyboard

5008020
button	checkbox
i have a web page with various checkbox and radio button options that help create a quote

5008020
button	checkbox
however if i print to an actual printer checkbox and radio button aren t shown

5008020
button	checkbox
i ve worked around this by running a function when a checkbox radio button is clicked that outlines the div around the button in black so its not really a problem now

5008025
src	attr
audio attr src ogg_path

5008025
src	attr
what about attr src mp3_path along with ogg_path

5008025
src	attr
but in audio attr src is an only src not array alas as far as i can see

5008048
inherited	properties
this is different from publishinglayoutpage which inherited eventually to page which has the zones properties

5008067
memcpy	strncpy
second use memcpy or strncpy to copy the bytes of string into

5008080
macbook	bootcamp
i tried several multitouch pads working on windows such as msi starpad and macbook pro built-in touchpad booted in window 7 using bootcamp but none of them generate windows multitouch or gesture event

5008089
post	get
i believe this can be done using http response headers from php but i understand the post request will become a get request

5008102
subtract	add
i know i can do simple math add subtract divide mulitply etc but i havnt found anything searching forums google etc that tells me how to add a log function

5008106
post	get
unless the redirecting script takes steps to push the post data into the get s url or into a cookie the data s dead and gone

5008106
post	get
most browsers limit the length of a url and post have effectively no limit to the size of the data being posted so you wouldn t want that 500megabyte file you just uploaded appended to the get url s query line

5008197
pascal	delphi
one of the philosophical changes that occurred in the evolution of turbo pascal into delphi was the acknowledgment that delphi lives in a c-dominated world and there was more to be gained by gracefully accepting or tolerating c-isms than ignoring them and forcing the delphi developer to sort it out

5008220
opera	firefox
both opera and firefox 4 draw their menu button on the top-left corner

5008259
vb.net	vb6
i am trying to get the following vb6 listindex to work within my vb.net code

5008259
vb.net	vb6
this is what vb.net did with the converting of the vb6 to .net code

5008280
width	height
you could give each li div a width and a height then use the css background to apply the image positioned with background-position and then use this for rounded corners

5008290
google-chrome	firefox
this behaviour is the same for google-chrome firefox and ie

5008314
children	parent
i need to return li 5 and 11 as these are the last children within their parent ul that dont have .x

5008353
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
besides serving up an image dynamically from your webapp it s also possible to use a webapp to dynamically authorize access to static resources that the webserver will serve -- commonly by putting the files somewhere that the webserver has access to but not mapped to any public uri and then using something like x-sendfile lighttpd apache with mod_sendfile others x-accel-redirect nginx x-reproxy-file perlbal etc

5008363
google-chrome	safari
the problem is only in google-chrome and safari

5008364
folder	directory
folder is in the root directory

5008394
int	chars
i need to know how to cast int to chars and then how to append one chars to another

5008410
free	malloc
if you re doing it to try and catch programming mistakes you want to make sure you don t accidentally mix up my_malloc my_free and malloc free then just pick a random value

5008410
free	malloc
if you re actually implementing malloc free writing your own c library then keep in mind that free ing something that wasn t malloc ed except null is undefined behavior by the standard so your code doesn t need to worry what happens

5008418
typedef	typename
you forgot typename in typedef

5008438
wamp	ampps
there are some other packages like wamp such as xampp and ampps

5008441
int	chars
if you want to convert a int to a chars just do the following -

5008441
int	chars
note that since chars are smaller in size than int this casting may cause a loss of data

5008449
int	double
if you have a math operation + - the resulting type will be int if none of the both operants is a floating point data structure double or float

5008451
serializable	deserialization
if you re using a robust json serializable like json.net you can even skip the intermediate deserialization and change your dataholder type to the correct type

5008457
int	chars
casting int to chars is done simply by assigning with the type in parenthesis

5008463
int	chars
casting int to chars involves losing data and the compiler will probably warn you

5008476
textview	imageview
i have an android spinner item in which the lines are made up of a textview and an imageview a star to mark that the user has marked that particular item as a favourite

5008485
width	height
the map is just a hand drawn image as the background of a fixed width and height div

5008511
children	parent
put another way i need to be able to display each treecomposite that is its own parent as a single row and what that row looks like depends on whether the treecomposite has children

5008521
postgresql	mysql
postgresql will ignore it mysql will run it

5008521
postgresql	mysql
update if you want to include commands that are run only on postgresql but not on mysql you can exploit the fact that postgresql supports nested comments and mysql doesn t

5008528
versioning	upgrade
i also added a major upgrade item that upgrade on a product versioning from 0.0.0.0 to 3.0.0.0 so it should upgrade all the programs

5008616
unsigned	short
getstringutfchars returns const char and getstringchars returns const jchar with jchar being defined as an unsigned short 2 bytes

5008616
unsigned	short
defining wchar_t as an unsigned short would make it compatible with getstringchars and seemingly make my life much easier

5008639
ddms	adb
use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine logcat and look at the stack trace associated with your exception

5008649
mef	prism
prism using any ioc container mef unity ninject autofac etc

5008649
mef	prism
there are a lot of good articles on application composition with prism that s pretty much its job but here is a good article on application composition with mef by itself

5008700
rss	feed
i am creating an iphone app that will contain multiple rss feed

5008701
hash	md5
for cryptographic hash functions look at jca which allows generating sha-1 md5 and other cryptographic digests which all have the effect you re looking for

5008708
put	get
on server run which whenever or whereis whenever you should get full path to the command put it into script

5008747
client-side	server-side
it runs server-side rather than client-side like the yui3 widgets library and chances are if you don t need to roll your own high-performance evented sockets asynchronous http etc

5008785
multiplying	subtract
when it happens that probably wouldn t cause a major change but if for example you later subtract off a fixed amount from each and multiplying what s left the difference would be multiplied as well

5008803
hide	show
i d have them on the page from the beginning and then just show hide them using the filter docs method with this.id and the toggle docs method with this.checked while placing the most recently clicked one at the bottom of the list using the appendto docs method

raphaã l is a cross platform javascript library for outputting vector graphics in both standards compliant svg for firefox google-chrome internet explorer 9+ ... and vml for older versions of internet explorer

5008826
client-side	server-side
the closest thing i found was provider statistics for sql server ado.net on msdn but those stats seem to be client-side stats about network connectivity bytes sent received from the client s perspective not the server-side statistics i m looking for

5008829
min	max
i have a table a sql server 2008 that contains sets of min and max numbers

5008829
min	max
in one of my stored procedures i use this table joined with a product table b to find an available product number that s between min and max and then insert a new product with this product number

5008829
min	max
so i want the next free number that s between min max

5008829
min	max
edit the min max table is a table for different product series

5008863
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari i can see the animated looping progess bar background style and loading...

5008882
implements	extends
when the l f changes to a l f that you support silently switch out their class name with your subclasses class name and then implements componentuis for your custom components and extends the parent lookandfeel.createui method so that it knows about your new components

5009049
boost	allocator
you can then pool your agents using a fixed-size object allocator such as boost pool and pass them around by pointer or shared_ptr

5009096
filesystems	hfs+
update 2 the filesystems is journaled hfs+ filesystems on the mac and is not case-sensitive

5009101
opera	firefox
this works in webkit and firefox not in ie or opera

5009105
ubuntu	linux
however it seems ubuntu 10.04 doesn t support 4.7- only ubuntu 10.10 does and the user does not want to upgrade his linux distribution as his is long term support

5009111
antlr	irony
i ve looked at antlr and irony but they are more tools than methodologies

5009113
post	get
trying to use libcurlpp a c++ wrapper to libcurl to post a form and get the response

5009133
google-chrome	firefox
i tried firefox and google-chrome and it doesn t work in both

5009185
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net list box does not have the concept of itemdata thus a direct conversion of the vb6 code is not possible

5009214
stateless	stateful
web applications are generally stateless views into stateful systems and use a request response architecture whereas desktop applications are stateful and usually event-driven

5009216
addition	multiplication
i find it really useful for time calculations but most other conversions are just simple multiplication addition combinations

5009245
centos	linux
please remember i have little to no experience working with centos and linux .

5009250
firefox	safari
best thing to do it use the developer menu in safari preferences advanced or firebug with firefox to see what js is loading and if there are js errors

5009262
post	get
i can get this to work if i have the server use _get and just add the extra data in the url string but i want to use post

5009262
post	get
heres the function notice the url string where i m trying to get the variables api_key session_key and method to be sent in the post request

5009301
firefox	safari
and the solution to the trick is just to more closely duplicate what a regular web browser does thus comparing your headers sent to the headers sent by firebug in firefox or the inspector in safari can help a lot

5009319
int	double
3.2 isn t an int value but a double

5009339
post	get
as your post begins to explain you could accomplish this yourself with your own c++ code but sqlite solves the problem very well and you get many advantages out of the box sorting aggregating etc

5009353
jquery	livevalidation
livevalidation + jquery ui tabs

5009355
try-catch	exception-handling
the exception-handling will be throw by the call of getdirectories and getfiles so you can try-catch them instead of the for-each

5009364
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the script works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari but does not work in ie8.

5009380

oledbcommand	sqlcommand
i ve created the oledbcommand with the following sqlcommand property

5009384
post	get
which is fine but ideally i dlike to set up the request for the iframe to have var stored in post variable as opposed to the get

5009414
firefox	safari
this works just dandy in firefox and safari on mac fails unreliably in firefox on windows and fails completely with an undefined in the alert on ie 7 8

5009492
pop-up	dialog
basically the user experience is that the termsheetprinted div pop-up on a jquery dialog and as it s open the other elements are populated in real time in front of them even though the code was not really meant to work this way that s the way it works

5009493
migrate	staging
i am running rake db migrate version 20110213100531 rails_env staging with one sshlogin and i have my sql login defined in my database.yml under staging as separate mysql database login

5009518
post	get
i followed the advice from this post in order to get authlogic working in rails 3

5009538

if this interface is meant to display data suitable for a more-trusted client then odds are good you should take the efforts to do proper ssl tunneling via https

5009543
hash	salt
a very simple class that generates a salt and the hash for me and has a pepper included for added security the makehash function i use for verification when the user logs in

5009595

mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort
there are various algorithms for doing this including mergesort quicksort and heapsort

5009703
width	margin
for block elements you have to fix the width of your element and define auto margin

5009720
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
the amount they need to win is predetermined however we d like to come up with an algorithm which uses addition multiplication and division to get to that amount in x amount of steps

5009724
button	checkbox
this ensures that the radio options act as radio button and not as checkbox

5009771
width	margin
note that in order to center horizontally using margin 0 auto you need to specify an absolute width

5009789
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in theory firefox google-chrome and safari all support data uris

5009817
hide	show
does anyone know a code as simple as possible to show hide html

5009817
hide	show
-effect to the show hide

5009823
getter	setter
the thing is some of the objects i need to do the isdirty on have dozens of properties and i m hoping there is a way to use the auto getter setter but still set isdirty when the field is modified

5009833
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can set it in a cookie and then add a few httpd.conf and or .htaccess rules to check for the existence of that cookie

5009845
division	multiplication
with your division and multiplication only being by 2 s and 4 s it makes it easy to know when you can or can t perform those operations

5009848
hide	show
as far as showing hiding html is concerned you may take a look at the show and hide methods

5009867
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome

5009881
debian	linux
i use debian unstable argh..i meant testing because i need to track development in some linux applications

5009881
freebsd	solaris
the best alternatives seem to be freebsd and solaris

5009881
freebsd	solaris
solaris pro java and virtualization support con see freebsd pro stuff

5009900
wordpress	joomla
mod_rewrite is widely in major web applications like wordpress drupal joomla

5009919
margin	height
specify a top margin equal to the height of your image

5009931
swt	swing
etc so the language choice should rely on what external libraries are you using and whether or not you want native look and feel for your application only qt and swt jface can give you native look and feel for your application swing is very bad at it

5009934
google-chrome	safari
however i still just see my source code in safari actually google-chrome decided to download the php file instead--different problem story

5009942
pull	push
if you can integrate at the http level and you only need to share content between the apps you have a number of choices here to pull and push content to alfresco straight away

5009961
getchar	getline
but using getline getchar getint store the input keeping the type char char etc and i need to pass rough input to that function so the inferring system is able to detect that its type is my user-defined type fecha

5009964
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is far less conservative than debian so you will get closer to the bleeding edge

5009966
free	malloc
c and c++ can get memory either from the built-in freestore malloc free or new delete or from the os via mmap or other system calls and in the case of c++ from get_temporary_buffer or return_temporary_buffer

5009978
freebsd	solaris
freebsd s main weaknesses here are java and virtualization support which happen to be solaris strengths

5009978
freebsd	linux
i d expect that freebsd would be more stable least changing from release to release than either linux or s11e

5009982
google-chrome	firefox
i have not seen any great ways in either google-chrome or firefox to deal with tab overload

5009982
google-chrome	firefox
i know there s a couple of tab grouping organization extensions for firefox and google-chrome but i ve tried most of them and haven t found them all that helpful

5010019
children	parent
since forked processes inherit the parent processes fopen file handles etc. you ll have to close or redirect the file handles you don t want children processes to use

5010031
ubuntu	opensuse
get ubuntu fedora opensuse slackware or something equally well-tested and stable

5010034
mdpi	hdpi
so in my understanding if no hdpi - mdpi - and ldpi -folders are found android will use res drawable as the fallback

5010054
prepare	execute
occasionally the prepare statement just fails to execute and the app acts very oddly hard to explain how

5010063
google-chrome	firefox
in both firefox and google-chrome i can drag tabs between windows to reorgaize them as desired

5010073
cpu	processors
accelerator is a high-level data parallel library which uses parallel processors such as the gpu or multicore cpu to accelerate execution

5010085
uilabel	nsstring
i probably would ve created an nsmutabledictionary with an nsstring containing the letter as the key and the associated uilabel as the object

5010091
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
this is why most platforms have evolved conventions like hdpi mdpi etc. that let you embed images that are best for each screens size

5010119
freebsd	linux
linux i believe has had better java support than freebsd

5010119
freebsd	solaris
both systems have large suites of available software packages available freebsd is likely larger and there s a better chance something may have been ported to freebsd over solaris depending on the niche of the package of course

5010119
freebsd	solaris
solaris i believe has a bit higher base resource requirements than freebsd if that matters most likely not

5010119
solaris	bsd
so in my priority list mac solaris linux bsd unless bsd s java support has gotten completely hassle free and functional with no oh you re using bsd isms

5010159
restructuredtext	textile
i m primarily interested in generating static html from html sources so markdown restructuredtext textile aren t relevant

5010161
for-loop	arrays
if i want to use arrays and for-loop to extract all the elements into local arrays

5010239
post	get
i ve been told some time ago that asp and asp.net are somewhat equivalent to php since they perform basically the same tasks handle post and get requests can print html access a database and so on

5010248
hlsl	glsl
i m working with opengl and cg glsl but this question should apply to direct3d hlsl coders as well

5010278
quicksand	isotope
or you could use views to output a list and theme the list with something like isotope or quicksand

5010334
sorting	filtering
filtering and sorting can be done easily with a query based on the parameters received from the form

5010416
textmate	bbedit
if you are on mac os x there are such modes for textmate and bbedit

5010438
getter	setter
and you can use this to generate simple properties with basic getter setter

5010547
draggable	droppable
first let s set our draggable and droppable elements with absolute positioning

5010550
width	height
while yours is a more innovative solution it seems like unexpected css behavior to set an element s width height by setting its bounds and browser implementation may change for this case in the future

5010577
factors	mean
yet being pythonic does not mean being the most concise or using comprehensions at any place possible - if a simple loop is more readable go for it if there are no other factors hinting to a list comprehension for example

5010714
portrait	landscape
here is a picture of what it looks like right now in portrait and landscape

5010735
nspopupbuttoncell	nscell
to achieve what he s looking for i think it should be as simple as calling setbordered no on the instance of nspopupbuttoncell that he is using the method is inherited from nscell

5010765
put	get
every time the user completes an action that could get a badge put the user in a list if he was not there already and process this list frequently using cron

5010775
move	drag
if the scrollbar is still in drag mode but the mouse hasn t move since the data has been appended the scrollbar has now changed size and jumped up a bit scrolltop is still set to 800 and the data is in the same position

5010788
post	get
then with the default route slug would only have a value if you had a querystring get or form post value with the key slug

5010795
hide	show
so i have this javascript i am working on and i want to show hide another html element on mouseover but it wont work

5010830

starting with firefox 3 google-chrome resources can no longer be referenced from within or other elements contained in or added to content that was loaded from an untrusted source

5010950
width	height
ok i have this 100 width height flash embedded and when the user moves the mouse i want to display a panel which disappears after x seconds if there is no more mouse movement

5010950
hide	show
it works kinda but when i move the mouse for more than 3 seconds i have a small flash on the panel hide - show

5010954
hide	show
since you will presumably want to display the warning message only when it s applicable you will need to programmatically hide and show the two controls depending on action taken by the user in your dialog

5010961
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
code leaves a gap between the end of #main and the end of the actual page on ie google-chrome and safari but not on firefox

5010961
google-chrome	safari
switching from one page to another allows google-chrome and safari to set the proper height for #main

5010971
google-chrome	safari
important is taking precedence over in-line css for google-chrome and safari

5010978
wiimote	infrared
i want to use the wiimote to control a cursor without the infrared sensor bar

5011040

you use having clauses to filtering rows after grouping

5011045
filtering	grouping
you would use the having statement with grouping by typically as a way to filtering on an aggregate column

5011058
public	protected
if the parent class declared the variable as protected or public you would get a compiler error about the variable already existing

5011061
int	boolean
after that is executed will contain either a single int or boolean false

5011064
versioning	upgrade
i unfortunately cannot upgrade this environment so i am going to setup another to test the newer formtastic versioning

5011066
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome everything is fine but in ie and firefox the rendering of the page seems to hang as if it s waiting for the videos to completely finish loading before applying the jquery styles and effects

5011113
int	double
this isn t legal because if you tried passing in a double into a function that took an then since int and double have fundamentally different binary representations you d end up clobbering the bits of the double with meaningless data

5011148
superclass	subclassing
note that a private field of a superclass might be accessible to a subclassing for example if both classes are members of the same class

5011148
inherited	subclassing
nevertheless a private field is never inherited by a subclassing

5011150
mouseover	mouseout
i have a mouseover function and opposite mouseout function attached to images on my page to bring up a larger version when they re hovered over

5011165
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you put that viewwillappear code in viewdidload it will probably work as expected

5011243
min	max
i ve set the contentsize of the uiscrollview to be the full size of the image and have also set a min max zoom scale

5011244
google-chrome	firefox

5011259
pull	push
is there a command that can tell git to go physically rescan every file for changes and see if there are any. at this point i am unsure which files were changed from the ftp download and so when i do a git push pull it says there are no changes even though i know there are

5011274
int	double	int	chars
look i learned that basic types to function are promoted to int and float is promoted to double but wait if i pass a chars to a function like

5014048
min	max
this works in more cases than the built-in min and max which do not work on a single scalar argument min 42

websphere	ibm
i am using ibm websphere server v6.0

5016191
client-side	server-side
reference that common contract assembly from both your server-side service code as well as your client-side silverlight app

5016210
button	checkbox
i have looked at custom implementations of data grids but none had the resources i need they are live update of rows the last entries are going to be on top of the table that is lifo adding widgets like checkbox button combobox.

5016210
vaadin	smartgwt
so i have two questions if there is an already implemented solution i already know implementations like livegrid from smartgwt or from vaadin gxt.

currently fdt does not have a library project which automatically saves a swc for the whole project

5016239
folder	directory
create folder in data directory that will be the database

5016249

5016266
textview	imageview
i am iplementing app in that i am fetching data from web and set it to imageview and textview

5016273
post	get
if you make changes to the list without safely determining whether it should be a get or post operation the list items will get rebound assuming you adding them in code not markup

5016283
filtering	grouping
the problem is how to filtering includedirs on compile item grouping such that each compile item will have its right include dir

5016358
post	put
the other approach is to put instead of post to create

5016358
put	get
if you cannot get the client to generate the uri then you can ask the server to provide a new uri with a get and then do a put to that uri

5016451
min	max
working on this assumption i have also assumed that the configuration attributes of the connection pool min max size etc are per managed server rather than per cluster

5016467

in my pom.xml i use the maven-assembly-plugin to create an executable jar-with-dependencies when running mvn clean install

5016467
maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml
this is the maven-assembly-plugin definition in my pom.xml

5016536
inherited	properties
that will return either an aes object either an aescryptoserviceprovider or aesmanaged and all of these inherited from symmetricalgorithm which has a mode properties you can set to ciphermode.ecb

5016561
width	height
idea of this is that you can create any shape not just boxes which are possible with width height top left.. and you can upload these shapes to texture buffer

5016575
subclass	abstract-class
if it were otherwise imagine that you obtain an instance of the subclass but refer to it as the abstract-class

5016611
ostringstream	std

now i have a new custom control class for - say - buttons which inherited from button with extra properties methods etc

5016738
ant	maven
-- looks like you should automate this task and employ one of traditional java build tools such as ant or maven

5016747
post	get
you could create a regular drupal form with the ususal validation stuff and instead of putting the date into the db send it over to the other site via post or get or whatever

5016796
webkit	gecko
i am fine if gecko and webkit browsers show this properly

5016839
sorting	filtering
you could use a component library like primefaces which has a datatable with support for sorting and filtering

5016840
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
oops that works in ie8 and google-chrome but not firefox opera

5016912

5017039
hash	md5
i believe storing md5 and sha1 hash is adding unnecessary complexity and not good design

5017044
min	max
i m going to assume that when max is positive min is zero since that s what your example suggests

5017044
min	max
the final value you seek given an input is the proportion of the change from min to max that the change from min to input consists of

5017080
implements	extends
this adapter extends baseadapter and implements sectionindexer and i have got this result

5017086
comparator	comparable
collections.sort requires the comparable in order to call the comparator method

5017154

you can explode the string first using a spaces as a delimiter

5017188
primefaces	richfaces
or you can use primefaces as mark said or richfaces

5017248
curb	httparty	typhoeus	curb	typhoeus	httparty
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp

5017273
minimum	max
sometime you get that in java if you do not have the minimum heap size set high enough and also a well defined max heap size too when you start up

5017274
serializable	deserialization
and i think the problem may be while serializable binaryformatter using the paramatered one and on deserialization process it needs a parameterless one

i can add the control to other projects with client profiling and do everthing until i try to debugging the project

5017416
free	malloc
after a day of cursing i converted my project into c++ which is a bold statement for saying i typecasted all heap allocation and i use new and delete instead of malloc and free and wrapped up some definitions in extern c .

5017449
free	malloc
just adopt using new delete instead of malloc free and you ll be fine

5017642
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	opensuse	linux
the thread is about ubuntu linux but i had the same problem on opensuse

5017691
int	chars
so your code could probably do chars comparisons up to an int alignment area then int comparisons then chars comparisons again but again the alignments of both areas will probably matter

5017721
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in firefox google-chrome and ie8

5017733
post	get
i want to send the data to the next page using get not post

5017773
int	chars
if you compare as int you will need to check alignment and check if count is divisible by sizeof int to compare the last bytes as chars

5017784
implements	extends
often times i will extends an asynctask that implements audiorecord to read the audio buffer and push the buffer back to the ui thread for visualization if needed

5017872
affinity	processors
check affinity masks for processors

5017883
int	chars
unsigned chars - unsigned chars signed int

5017883
int	chars
int at a time only works if the pointers are aligned or if you can read a few bytes from the front of each and they are both still aligned so if both are 1 before the alignment boundary you can read one chars of each then go int-at-a-time but if they are aligned differently eg one is aligned and one is not there is no way to do this

5017925
hide	show
give them all another class for example item and then make the click hide all item and show all of the selected value

gson	jackson
actually i just want to learn what configurations i must to change to build my own httpmessageconverter to use with responsebody to do json things with gson and not with jackson

5018066
post	get
this is not a port but it looks like you are sending a post and then obtaining the authorization token and then sending a get request using this

5018067
udp	tcp
it should be like this another program is sending a tcp udp packet - my program is calling a function triggered then.

5018068
int	boolean
if you re looking at specific combinations of states i think gorillapatch s suggestion is right you would turn those four boolean into a single 4-bit int and compare it against bit masks representing the various combinations you re interested in

5018080
webkit	gecko
if you really want to do it yourself from scratch your best bet would be to look at the source for gecko webkit and or chromium and re-use whatever you can from there assuming your app s source license makes that possible

safari + google-chrome increment by 2

5018138

5018143
multiplying	add
add them all together divide by 100 and multiplying by 25

5018257
int	double
the decimal type is represented in what amounts to base-10 using a struct containing int i believe as opposed to double and other floating-point types which represent non-integral values in base-2

5018289
rtsp	sdp
in the sdp a control track1 and a control track2 whereas in the rtsp setup request you are using trackid 1

5018315
copying	overwrite
the reason i think there are breaking changes is that when the litmus application comes to section 2 copying moving step 4 verify that server does not overwrite unless told to it says

5018344
devise	cancan
mymodelscontroller has following options inherited resources + cancan + devise

5018403

robotlegs	puremvc
what i really search for is something elegant like a jquery- puremvc port which as far as i know does not exist or robotlegs for those who are familiar with this as3 framework

5018635
cos	sin
i use simple sin cos calculations to determine the position of the lines around the circle

5018640
put	get
hi i have problem with url rewrite on my site..my situation is that the site is fully ajax loaded and i am changing hash in url to navigate within the site..when someone put the hashed url into his browser it would load correctly..with this i had first problem with links for example on facebook and to with copied links on the site..these links are only sef urls produced by joomla so i when people comes to the site for example from facebook with this link i have to parse it and change to the hashed on..simply it has to be consistent..it all is fully working but today i got another problem with links in newsletter sent from joomla..these ones arent parsed by jrouter so i have another problem with parsing these ones into hashed form..it is getting to be pretty much complicated si i am asking if someone here know some best practices to get the kind of behaviour to work

5018659
sorting	filtering
to have advantages of server side data filtering paging and sorting jqgrid work better with the data which included additional information about the current page see here

5018659
sorting	filtering
if you can not change the server side which produce the json data you can add loadonce true parameter and then the filtering paging and sorting of data will be done locally

5018717
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 produce hash codes which are longer than 64 bits md5 - 128 bits sha1 - 160 bit

i am developing a rss news feed app for android and using toast.maketext to show the news or current update

5018727
int	chars
example source 123-45-6789 int - destination 6789 chars 4

5018736
inherited	subclassing
on the other hand if you do write an intermediary abstract-class you solved that problem but now your subclassing may not be a subclassing of another class because of absence of multiple inherited in java

5018751
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
you have a simple foreignkey relationship which should work for you just don t confuse it with inherited where you would set up a guest to inherited the properties of contact through subclassing

5018752
serializable	deserialization
for serializable and deserialization

5018786
super	abstract
using interfaces is preferred and writing redundant abstract super classes for the sake of redundancy is redundant

one advantage of jqgrid is using a server-side library that automatically interacts with the client-side jqgrid

5018890
children	parent
i m trying to avoid duplicate blocks of code--each dealing with different children of a parent

5018898
post	get
if you need a get instead of a post you should also set the #method

5018925
serializable	deserialization
emf generates classes to represent instances of the model in-memory with support for xml or xmi serializable deserialization hooks for validation an optional editor and more

5018978
aggregate-functions	sum
the thing i find important is realizing that you can group by multiple columns and still apply aggregate-functions like sum max or count using the following syntax

5019004
ssl	https
all transport is over https ssl

5019042
google-chrome	firefox
this example shows that with a 30px text size the line height in ie7 and ie8 are not on par with google-chrome and firefox

5019108
jobs	cron
i just schedule cron jobs that run php scripts

5019111
folder	directory

5019113
jobs	cron
on unix machines you use cron which is for re-occuring jobs

5019132
set	bag
use an iset instead of an ilist and map it as a set offcourse instead as a bag

5019133
subclass	abstract-class
a reference to an abstract-class is just like a pointer to an abstract-class it needs to reference an object of some non-abstract subclass of the abstract-class

5019144
vmware	virtualbox
sometimes this is because they have some virtual adapters from applications like virtualbox or vmware or because they have more than one physical network adapter connected to their computer

5019155
min	max
rather than introspecting the model field i just put min and max values in a variable at the top for simplicity

5019157
innodb	myisam
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

5019165

5019433
rss	feed
if the volume of news is very low you could use notifications as sugested but as i assume an rss feed may have a lot of things to notificate it would flood the notification list if you want to display them one by one

5019506
hash	hmac
i would suggest looking into using an approach like hmac hash message authentication code for your security or a similar token-based approach

5019511
radgridview	xamdatagrid
no i m not quite sure what you are after but you could provide normal form controls to add an additional item to the list outside the markup of the listview or use a third party grid which provides in place editing such as the telerik radgridview or the infragistics xamdatagrid

5019530
stdout	fflush
perlvar states if set to nonzero forces a fflush right away and after every write or print on the currently selected output channel. the code in this example should turn on autoflush causing a fflush then add noting to the stdout buffer and cause a fflush

5019532
maven	pom.xml
but you have to tell maven to include non java stuff which is in src main java by adding something like this to your pom.xml file

5019636
hide	show
but with jquery you could override the hide show functions so that they fire custom events onshow and onhide then you could bind event handlers to these events to run various code when those events fire

5019638
jar	.war
you ll probably need to get most or all of the axis 1.4 jar files into your web app s .war file

5019651
public	protected
by default the asdoc tool generates output for all public and protected elements in an actionscript class even if you omit the asdoc comment

5019651
public	protected
it explicitly says for all public and protected elements which makes sense for api documentation private members are not accessible from outside the class and therefore remain hidden

5019666
firefox	safari
but the problem with this it works perfectly in safari firefox etc but does not work in internet explorer 8 and probably not for 6 7

5019748
post	get
the solution is known as prg post - redirect - get

5019788
hash	md5
sqlite doesn t have md5 built in so i m considering using the hash function instead

5019788
hash	md5
i don t know much about hashing but i can see that hash output is numerical and of varying length while md5 returns mixed characteds numbers of a fixed length

5019887
portrait	landscape
when i rotate it to landscape and back to portrait it looks crisp

5019917
oncreate	onstart
re-entering the app in this case calls the classics oncreate onstart onresume

5019922
rss	feed
zend_feed i m not completely sure how to make an rss feed properly set the content type etc.

5019951
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out that only works in google-chrome and only works in firefox

5019981
hash	salt
with the php hash function you can pass sha256 to the first parameter and it will create a strong hash of the password + salt

5019981
hash	salt
putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end

5019982
children	parent
have the children processes wait for an exclusive grab of the shared memory segment via a parent process created mutex

5019982
children	parent
create a per-process pipe between the parent an children processes

5019990
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
use bufferedinputstream fileoutputstream and bufferedoutputstream

5020031
fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter
if all that you want to do is reduce the number of system calls to write to the disk you can wrap the fileoutputstream in a bufferedoutputstream with appropriately big buffer size and write to this bufferedoutputstream or bufferedwriter instead of writing directly to the original fileoutputstream

5020059
gif	bmp
the user can drag any image jpg bmp gif on a picturebox

5020079
d3.js	protovis
protovis succeeded by d3.js

5020117
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
aggregate-functions are functions such as sum avg min max etc

5020119
hash	md5
i would stay away from sha1 and md5 as they both have vulnerabilities or known reverse-lookup tables ie if someone got the hash password they could go to many sites available online and enter that in and it will give them a password that will when passed through md5 or sha1 give the same password.

5020123
width	margin
if any of your floating div s have padding border or margin styles the floating width will be off since you re doing width

5020169
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for google-chrome and firefox

accessor	properties
no there is no way to convert a collection of elements into an array without looping or special accessor methods for the type - let alone convert a common properties from a collection of elements into an array

5020458
maven	m2e
i m using maven in eclipse m2e and i have a multi-module project which i used checkout as a maven project to bring it to my workspace

5020458
children	parent
the structure seems to be flat in eclipse and it has duplicate of children parent is there with all the children nested in it as folders doesn t show the packages inside children as a package should look like but has them as nested ordinary folders also all the children show up as independent projects beside the parent under the children projects the packages are shown as they should the package icon is shown and it is dot notation

5020458
children	parent
i have changed a lot of files in children s projects but the changes don t show in the parent s project and i cannot commit them all in one commit i will have to commit each child one by one which adds a lot of commits and increases the version number unnecessarily

5020488
translation	localization
the localization files provide localisations translation of messages

implements	extends
the only downside with passing a string name of a class is that you can t be sure that it implements an specific interface or extends some other object

5020522
put	get
for instance if i put in robert randolph for the artist and colorblind for the title i get robert randolph and the family band s colorblind album

5020538
stdout	stderr
my assumption was that the output was being written to stdout but the exception pulls its output from stderr

5020694
post	get
you will get as post or get those checkbox values which are checked

5020699
opera	google-chrome
however opera and google-chrome although receiving the same object print out the object in an incorrect order it seems like they both perform a sort by id number instead of just leaving it alone

5020699
opera	google-chrome
however i d still like to understand why opera and google-chrome feel it is their right to change the order of my objects ids

5020727
ant	maven
you can select not to fetch from an scm specify which ant build file to run from which script to run or which directory to run maven from - anywhere on your file system

5020739
pull	push
they pull types using the service locator instance must be coupled to it whereas dependency injection containers push the vast majority of the application is di agnostic so the code is far less brittle and more re-usable

5020747
ccl	clisp
i am using clisp and ccl

5020750
google-chrome	firefox
also i ve only tested in firefox because you suggested using firebug where your site seems to work - in google-chrome there are no images

google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox stealing away audiences from ie to fast i forecast that its only a matter of time that before such questions will be obsolete.

5020811
i2c	spi
while it is possible for a processor to control any number of inputs and outputs using a four-wire spi bus or even a two-wire i2c bus in many cases the number of signals a processor will need to monitor or control is sufficiently small that it s easier to simply include the circuitry to monitor or control some signals directly on the chip itself

5020812
hide	show
the navigation bar that the users will use to change screens will exist outside of the screen but when a user clicks it what common ways have people been using to hide one and show another

5020891
google-chrome	firefox
it s working just fine on google-chrome and firefox 6

5020924
hash	md5
the only way i can think to implement this would be to md5 all the variables that the generated php was given and then check against a list of html files as to whether the variables have the same hash however i imagine this would be very cpu intensive and a complete waste of time

5020927
int	chars
a is initialized to a cast to int and truncated because chars is 3 or 7 bytes too small pointer that points to a chars array propably somewhere in rom

once you do something like this you can use get and it would be a read-only resource since you can t post or put to it - it gets updated when it s get ed

5021041
getter	setter
generally i prefer the semantics of object attribute access over dict get set access but there are some circumstances where dict-like access is required for example and i d prefer not to have special getter setter methods for these cases so thus the dual behavior of dict object at the same time with shared attributes

5021283
websphere	ibm
i m connecting to an ibm websphere mq

5021357
children	parent
when you have an aggregate the repository is the same for the aggregate parent root and its children because the life cycle of the children is controlled by the root object

5021391
pthreads	fork
this hasn t got much to do with c rather with fork which is a pthreads system call and i guess it could behave differently on different systems

5021398
rubber	capistrano
i ve looked at rubber not chef but deemed it needlessly automagical and too poorly documented and i m really not sure what it offers that can t be done just as well with roles in capistrano

5021398
apache	nginx
it s actually very similar to the server + mongrel cluster you described but probably a bit better as passenger has an understanding of the underlying workers that nginx apache don t

daemons	launchd
now if i understand what s going on behind the scenes mod_wsgi launchd 5 daemons processes for each of my sites

5021462
post	get
had forgotten name labels from the input fields and that s why php post couldn t get any info

5021466
stdout	stderr
and when it comes to similarity child process inherits its parent s file descriptor table thus you would see that always three file descriptors of child are always occupied which correspond to stdin stdout and stderr

5021488
cassini	iis
if so then visual studio 2010 with sp 1 beta beta yikes and iis express can be used in place of cassini

5021560
post	get
i m trying to post some very simple data to a php file using jquery and then get the json response but i seem to be running into a road block somewhere

5021597

width	height
and set the width and height through css

5022038
visualvm	jhat
however while this works correctly using jhat it doesn t work in my version of visualvm 1.6.0_22 because cls.fields seems to improperly return a list of static fields rather than instance fields

5022076
client-side	server-side
the javascript parser is used both client-side and server-side to guarantee consistent markup special thanks to the jurassic javascript compiler

5022089
interpolation	splines
worse for 3000 points an interpolation splines will give you roughly that many cubic segments

5022089
interpolation	splines
if all that you need is a tool that can provide an exact interpolation at any point and you really don t need to have an explicit formula then an interpolation splines is a good choice

5022103
ssl	https
then in iis have it use an ssl certificate and https

5022239
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
btw it would also be wise to move all your static content css javascript images etc.. to a separate multithreaded web server nginx lighttpd etc.. so the simultaneous user accesses do not make your apache fork to much processes

5022303
public	protected
example from here two or more public protected protected internal members defined with only case difference

5022307
textwrangler	bbedit
in addition to finder barebones excellent free textwrangler text-editing app is recordable as is the pro bbedit editor

5022329
inherited	subclassing
since java does not have the concept of inherited of static methods subclassing the static bits of a class is a nonsensical idea

you ll need to create your own iprincipal and iidentity implementations that you then will assign to httpcontext.user after they have been authenticated

5022346
int	double
never int or double or car

5022361
google-chrome	safari

ubuntu	linux
the goal of the ubuntu project is to provide a free computer environment centered on a linux distribution and complemented by online services

many-to-many	one-to-many
now for one-to-many relationships i can just use the text instead of trying to link a foreign key which you don t have in nosql but with many-to-many linking that because a problem

5022459
dreamweaver	aptana
i m fairly new to using aptana but i m wondering if it supports a feature that i used to use a lot in dreamweaver where you could create a page template the header and footer of a page that would stay the same for each page on a website leaving only the content to be coded

5022462
width	height
if thay are increase the width or height of the container div

5022476
folder	directory
personally i d recommend creating your uploads folder outside of your web app s directory so that it is not replaced during deployment etc

5022493
put	get
final question now everything works except that it seems that when i put my variable instance in the queue then it does not get updated and everytime i get it from the queue it does not contain the observation i added in the previous iteration

5022506
inherited	subclassing
i am trying to build some classes that inherited from a parent class which contains subclassing that inherited from other parent classes

5022525
getter	setter
its not necessary to lock synchronize getter and setter of primitive types - tagging them as volatile is sufficient in most cases apart from double and long as you mention

5022528
post	get
great article better article explaining post get

5022528
post	get
post includes name value pairs in the body of the request while get does so in the query string

5022584
folder	directory
you should copy one of those directory to just plain django in the specified folder to get it to work with the current pydev

5022619
hide	show
the expand collapse of the div works without a problem using hide show methods

5022648
post	get
i showed it to the client and they say that i can t have the data seen in view source and i can t pass this data via get even though anyone with a sniffer can grab the post contents

5022704
width	height
the bottom div should fill the rest of the page width 100 height 100 and also show scrollbar if needed

5022738
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is a language that is derived from the earlier language vb6

5022752
int	double
then you can call this with any built-in type int short double float etc and it will instantiate the function add at compile time according to the type you use

5022764
int	double
it does get a bit more complex when the two might not match so for example you could add an int to a double and get a double result

5022764
decltype	auto
with c++0x you can look into auto and decltype for such tasks

5022778
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome is unaffected but ie still makes a mess

5022826
createelement	domdocument
i m using php s domdocument library for certain xml stuff createelement appendchild etc

5022835
swt	styledtext
the essential thing to realize is that swt styledtext widgets can themselves contain other widgets

5022836
x86	64bit
i m running this on a 64bit machine and my target platform is set to x86

5022899
gif	png
in general gzipping gif png or jpeg images will not yield gains over a couple percent in fact the compressed file may be larger than the original

5022908
versioning	upgrade
i ve been working with dnn for years well since versioning 3 and there is no great conspiracy to force ce users to upgrade to pro

5022947
innodb	myisam
the table concerned is myisam but most of our tables are innodb

5022967
put	get
but both the get and put could fail if the size of the arraylist is the index

5023012
vbo	normals
you don t need to use vbos glvertexattribpointer takes a normals cpu-pointer if no vbo is bound you can call glbindbuffer gl_array_buffer 0 to make sure

5023017
min	max
my current version for get min or max value is

5023116
portrait	landscape
however when i try to use it i just get the method getrotation is undefined for the type display and eclipse tells me to change it to the deprecated function getorientation which will not work for what i need because it only returns landscape portrait not 0 90 180 270

5023164
richfaces	tomahawk
t is for tomahawk and a4j is a richfaces prefix

5023183
strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup
you need to stick something like into the lex.l action to ensure it points at valid memory or just use the simpler and equivalent call to strdup as that combines the malloc and strcpy

5023209
int	chars
this casts the filenames to an int which effectively changes anything that starts with an int followed by any chars to just the int

5023322
int	double
when dividing an int by an int you won t get a double as result

5023327
int	boolean
your example looks like you want to have a map from pairs of int to boolean with the default value being false

5023367
int	double	division	multiplication
you can either calculate the expression as a double or do the multiplication first so that you don t lose relevant precision from the int division

5023370
vmware	virtualbox
not an answer but a suggestion that might be suitable vmware virtualbox with a linux image

5023371
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 9.0.597.98 safari 534.13

i plan to make those pages only accessible to ie8 and up firefox 3 and up google-chrome 4 and up and safari 4 and up

5023512
ivar	subclassing
i m assuming here that the subclassing has appropriately assigned a subthing to the ivar

5023512
ivar	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
however i like the fact in the typed version that the superclass in effect documents what subclassing should do with the ivar

5023513
post	get
if i render the hidden input field for id when adding a post i get an error stating that the id can t be null

5023514

i have +100 sprites images that need to go into this arrays so a for-loop is necessary

5023538
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you want to do different things on mouseenter and mouseleave then bind two different handlers

5023674
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox but in internet explorer it gives an error in the jquery file

5023677
base-class	derived-class
in vb.net one can do things a little better since vb.net supports exception filtering and since vb.net runs field initializers after the base-class constructor and thus allows base-class members to be used within the derived-class field initializers

5023695
portrait	landscape
the problem is that when i add the tabbar to the rootview the app does not rotate to landscape if i change the orientation the view remains in portrait mode

5023718
post	get
i m trying to get the post data in java

5023718

it works but theres a catch i can only get that post data once

5023732
ssl	https
work with and without ssl https +

5023746
min	max
generally efficiently would probably be a measure of how much memory and gpu cycles average min max of your program is using

5023748
jax-ws	jax-rs
jaxb is the default binding layer for both jax-rs restful web services and jax-ws soap web services

5023748
jax-ws	jax-rs
jaxb was designed in conjunction with jax-ws and jax-rs was written to leverage jaxb

5023764
for-loop	loops
so in ff your for-loop loops 6 times but it only loops once in ie and fails on the if statement

5023770
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome fox safari would show img.jpg just fine

5023781
width	height
i ve got my height and width set not only in the thumb class but on the instance of the thumb that is being added to the stage

5023800
postgresql	mysql
i used to develop everything with mysql this week an opportunity to work with postgresql appeared why not

5023837
client-side	server-side
authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts to process using the data- attributes

5023862
post	put
i can t put in the same line i did for line 6 because there are no post

5023927
hash	md5
base64 encode a md5 hash

5023988
hide	show
i think you re getting a bit confused to be honest with you to do this in css would be much harder would involve using a div to hide show with the options to exit or stay

5023994
width	height
without javascript i think about just float left all the element but i do need to control the size of the picture to be 2 times or 4 times height or width to each other

5024002
rss	feed
i want to use cooliris www.cooliris.com in my asp.net website and it should take images from my website images folder not from external sources like facebook flickr youtube or external rss feed

5024045
put	get
to get around this you need to explicitly put thing in the window s adorner and not that of the listbox or listboxitem

5024109
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the solution i found for all of the browsers that i tested ie firefox google-chrome safari opera is that the first input element on the form has to be visible and has to be the first element in the form

5024111
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari if i assign the same src as the one before the handler function is not run

5024117
pop-up	dialog
4 a file save dialog pop-up asking the user to save this formatted text as playlist.m3u on their own harddrive

5024124
width	height
have the function recurse upward through itself and parents and print out width height scalex and scaley

5024124
width	height
my suspicion is that you are artificially setting width and or height on something before the image is loaded and scalex and scaley are ending up with bad values

5024138
firefox	safari	versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade our server to php 5 and file uploads are now failing but only from os x clients safari 5 firefox 3.6 although the same browser versioning on windows work fine

5024143
google-chrome	firefox
gradients stay fixed in firefox and google-chrome and scroll with the page

5024166
coalesce	isnull
sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull

5024195
getter	setter
where item is a public static class item with constructors and all the fields above with getter and setter

5024245
temp	tmp
in that case perhaps just write the files to a temporary directory tmp on unix machines and c windows temp on windows machines

5024253
puts	gets
anything a cobol program puts in it gets scaled by 100 behind the scenes 15.25 gets stored as 001525 16 gets stored as 001600 etc.

5024264
screens	tablet
there is more than one screens size in android and what fits on a qvga 2.8 screens and what fits on a 10 tablet will not be the same

5024273

but when i send my auth token and registration id to ubuntu and try to post it by php php s curl and only curl to request to c2dm to get a message

5024276
post	get
for the post create update step you need to look into the formcollection to get your results

5024310

also lxml is best one which is drop-in replacement of elementtree in third party libraries

5028389
salt	md5
i have a question about how to use md5 and a salt to secure a password i have already made many searches for answers to my questions

5028389
salt	md5
now the problem is i want to use salt with the md5 md5+salt to make password more secure with randomly generated salt string

5028396
clang	llvm
when i was searching for a good compiler i came across clang llvm

5028396
icc	pgi
this compiler gives me same result as other compilers like icc pgi

5028408
createfile	deviceiocontrol
drivers have standard operations like open close read write which are called using createfile closehandle readfile and writefile api and custom driver-specific operations called using deviceiocontrol

5028436
clang	llvm
the clang is not a compiler it is just frontend of llvm compiler

5028436
clang	llvm
so when you calls clang it parses c c++ file but the optimization and code generation is handled in llvm itself

5028456
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
hash password md5 salt + raw password

5028456
hash	salt
store hash password and salt along side username dispose of raw

5028456
hash	salt
once they have logged in it might be a good idea also to regenerate a new salt and hash

5028545
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got nothing for firefox but the webkit inspector in google-chrome has a profiler built in that is great for that kind of thing

5028564
filtering	grouping
rather than instantiate all the product objects and a subset of their barcodes how about using criteria against barcode filtering by the type grouping mentioned and joining onto the parent product

5028581
downcasting	upcasting
i am sure that that all this weird upcasting - downcasting is the cause but i was not able to find a formal explanation in the specs or online

5028607
width	height
you can use displaymetrics to obtain the screen s size and pixel density and then calculate your rectangle s width and height accordingly by adjusting the width and height in relation to the screen s characteristics

5028616
daemons	launchd
i ve written a daemons in php which i launchd from a terminal

5028674
ienumerable	icollection
changing the predicate to an will not work since .where on the orderdetails links to the ienumerable where since the details are icollection

5028722
pow	math.h
the only math.h function used in pow everything else is just primitive operations

5028726
min	max	minimum	max
since we still get multiple results by doing that a groupby with min max is done to filter out the minimum and maximum timestamps of the complete resultset

5028756
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
initially width height actualwidth actualheight desiredsize are all 0 or nan

5028756
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
if i call panel.measure new size double.positiveinfinity double.positiveinfinity then its actualwidth actualheight desiredsize are calculated width height remain as nan

5028810
width	height
in ondraw method create a random object seeding it with width and height of screen and draw points on those points as many time as you want

5028822
hide	show
i want to build a program that can change the brightness of my monitor using ddc ci and i want to show hide a window where it is written the level of brightness exactly like the apple brightness bezel of leopard or snow leopard with the exact same style

the multiplication division portions i am not sure how to emulate

5028995
button	checkbox
the problem is that when i press a submit button all the checkbox are returned with the checked property as false

5029008
implements	extends
if you also want to intercept clicks in your table and not only dragging and scrolling you can extends and implements your own uitableviewcell and use the touchesbegan methods in there

5029025
button	checkbox
i have a php form with some text box list of radio button and checkbox with a submit button

5029046
hash	md5
note that i ve converted the hash to a base 64 string and that you could use md5 too as the hash is calculated for checksum purposes

5029057
int	double
you need to create geocoder object and call getfromlocation double latitude double longitude int maxresults

5029075
put	get
though the only exception to this is multi-threaded application where other thread can put arbitrary value to the same key in between your calls to put and get

5029125
textarea	textbox
i want to create chat window with textarea and textbox in lwuit

5029142
pop-up	dialog
then in the dialog box that pop-up pick the types of objects you want to see groups is disabled by default - check it

5029203
hide	show
show hide

5029214
addition	multiplication
in fact it might even be feasible to leave all those matrices alone and do your matrix-operations block-wise addition and multiplication with a scalar are simple multiplication with a vector would be a bit more complicated

5029321
google-chrome	firefox
browser is able to validate it by clicking on https firefox and google-chrome

5029332
chown	sudo
chown git git git .ssh this will all need doing as root or use sudo

5029347
submit	submission
i am having the problem is attaching those multiple images the user can choose to submit one or 2 or 3 files with one form submission to one album

5029347
submit	submission
right now if the user submit 3 files it creates 3 albums with every form submission

5029377
folder	directory
where installlocation is the directory id of the folder in wix but this doesn t work

5029408
getter	setter
they are kind of like python s getter setter and properties but better

5029414
hide	show
in lotus notes hidden client hidden views are not show by default but you can further hide them by using outlines

5029437
int	double
this would work if you have marshallable values int double strings matrices but not structs or cell arrays

5029443
mkmapview	mkoverlay
assuming you re on ios 4 you d use an mkmapview and an mkoverlay

5029453
udp	tcp
if you want to have control over individual packets most certainly tcp is the wrong protocol for you - look at udp

5029453
outputstream	inputstream
for tcp you simply have a byte-stream or in fact two streams - a sending outputstream and a receiving inputstream and don t have to care about the underlying packets sent by your tcp implementation

5029474
integer	fractions
i d recommend using one integer value instead of separate whole and fractions part

5029474
subtraction	addition
than addition and subtraction are the integeral counterparts directly and you can simply use 64-bit support which all common compilers have these days

5029494
width	height
for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be. property values are treated as a number of pixels unless otherwise specified

5029538
integer	fractions
since it looks like you re specifying 16 bit integer and fractions parts you could do this with a plain 32 bit integer

5029538
subtract	add
when you add or subtract the format stays the same

5029552
hide	show
i m writing a form for a custom module and i want to show hide some fields according to which radio is checked kind of like what happens when you select a payment method in the onepage checkout and a description appears

5029620
stdout	stderr
also you may want to redirect stderr to stdout

5029633
google-chrome	firefox
i have a dropdown menu in css it works fine in google-chrome firefox but not ie8 i haven t checked it in ie6 7

5029638
google-chrome	firefox
this method works perfectly on google-chrome and firefox

5029728
many-to-many	one-to-many
as you ve correctly identified in your database schema this isn t a pure many-to-many relationship - it s two one-to-many relationships as the intermediate table has an attribute the access level

5029770
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid should only be called after you have called setcontentview r.layout.main

5029822
client-side	server-side
the problem with you code is its a server-side event trying to invoke a client-side event

5029836
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works just great in firefox safari and google-chrome

5029851
onkeyup	onkeydown
if you need to run some kind of code each time a letter is pressed you will need to register and handle the client-side events onkeyup onkeydown onkeypress with vb or javascripting

5029865
allocator	stl
this is the logic behind stl allocator

5029904
cpu	hyperthreading
and on my windows machine i see a four-fold speedup when using 4 device_matrix instances giving 4 threads on my dual-core hyperthreading intel core2 cpu

5029941
int	chars

you can convert a chars type simply by assigning to an int

5029975
hide	show
it show on click as it should but as soon as i try to enter the .subnav div the entire drop down hide again clicked class is removed

5029975
mouseout	mouseenter
here s the jquery that adds the clicked class to the li on click and is supposed to not remove it until mouseout but is doing it on mouseenter instead

5030009
strtol	atoi	int	chars
if you have a series of chars that represents an int like 123456 then there are two typical ways to do that in c use a special-purpose conversion like atoi or strtol or the general-purpose sscanf

5030009
int	chars
if you mean you want the exact bit pattern in one of your int variables to be treated as a chars that s easier

5030011
google-chrome	firefox
the timeout should be 4000 as it is set for google-chrome 10000 for firefox

5030067
udp	tcp
you could in theory implement tcp ip or udp ip over raw network packets using jpcap

5030067
udp	tcp
then run one of the above over the tcp ip or udp ip stack you ve just created

5030077
ssl	https
i want the whole rails3 application to run trough ssl https

5030122
cairngorm	flex	parsley	cairngorm

5030147
division	multiplication
the rounding error in the multiplication just happens to cancel out the rounding error in the division

5030223
orientdb	neo4j
however neo4j and orientdb are the only ones for which i found any sort of ruby api

keydown	keyup
you just need to bind it to the keyup keydown event of the boxes

5030276
subtract	add
find a random number in a sufficiently large range and either add or subtract that to sysdate

5030285
lisp	scheme
common lisp scheme emacs lisp

jboss	glassfish
i think that is a glassfish issue because works fine under jboss 6

5030307
folder	directory
folder under the system directory

5030315
portrait	landscape
if you hold the device in portrait or landscape orientation this is the result i would not only like to achieve but would also expect

5030315
portrait	landscape
to be clear it should be possible to navigate from the second view in landscape mode to the third but because that third only supports portrait orientation it should only be shown in portrait orientation

5030447
inherited	subclassing
setusercredentials is inherited from googleservice which calendarservice is a subclassing of

5030447

5030510
wxpython	pygtk
two other popular choices are wxpython and pygtk

5030541
int	chars
chars is just a 1 byte int

5030541
int	chars
just as you can assign a short to an int or an int to a long you can assign a chars to an int

5030541
int	chars
there s a lot of subtle things like this going on between the lines where chars is implicitly treated as an int

5030547

i don t know what is passenger exclusive and how to write it for a typical 4 workers 3 thin instances conf

5030706
hide	show
other jquery later show the element when i click on things so i could possible hide it using css but that won t degrade nicely on the absence of js

5030727
getter	setter
the closest you can get to pass-by-reference behavior in java is to create a holder class with a getter and setter

5030740
inline	inlining
when you mark a function as inline you hint the compiler that this function is a candidate for inlining

5030741
itunes	entitlements
if you re getting an error in itunes which btw don t make sense about your entitlements when installing the app - add an application icon

5030801
inline	inlining
as for the discretionary decisions that the compiler takes as to whether or not to inline as opposed to whether or not inlining is possible they are not documented and can be considered an implementation detail

5030817
maven	pom.xml

5030981
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve got a uiwebview inside a uinavigationcontroller in a uitabbarcontroller

5031056
int	chars
we need to access this memory location through a pointer so therefore we typecast the int constant 0x1234 into an unsigned chars pointer a pointer to a byte

5031056
unsigned	short
had it been two bytes large we would perhaps have used unsigned short instead

5031068
google-chrome	safari
a client server solution that hooks into safari or better google-chrome s developer tools

5031095
portrait	landscape
by just keeping if condition weather it is landscape mode or portrait mode and then change the imageview frame

5031136
for-loop	loops
here s one problem you re going to have when you set up those ajax calls inside your for-loop the code in the success handler references the variable i that s used for loops iterations

5031193
put	get
but if you re trying to get your text under you image try to put them both in different paragraphs p tag

5031328
lwjgl	jogl
it uses lwjgl rather than jogl but the translation between the two will be the least of your worries if you want to integrate it - it s meshed with the texture management etc

5031346
windows	wow64
incidentally wow64 stands for â œwindows on windows 64-bit.â

5031363
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors

5031613
sequence	permutation
permutation of a given input vector typically just the sequence 1 n

5031616

this is a process called normalization it will allow you to make joins and perform complex queries like give me the last 5 users that have subscribed to this post or get all post for this user which have changed since his last visit

5031616
post	get
it allows for indexes quick search foreign keys users can t subscribe to a post that does not exist if a post gets deleted all subscriptions get deleted automatically and much more

5031658
gridview	sqldatasource
last night i was doing a gridview combined with sqldatasource in visual studio for my school project

in addition your code is already covered by return-value-optimization and nrvo

5031926
int	chars
main should have this signature int main int argc chars argv

5031961
children	parent
yes tree views are good for structures where you know the root and have a connection from that to all its children an object knows its properties and those properties are in turn objects which behave the same way for types it is quite problematic since the traveral is the other way around the supertype knows nothing of its subtypes but the subtypes know their supertypes unlike objects which rarely have a reference to their parent

5031988
treelistview	objectlistview
reason i want to do this is that i m using a control phillip piper s objectlistview s treelistview that binds itself to a list so i need to get data from that control back into the db in a sensible manner that ideally doesn t involve tons of boilerplate code

5032020
opera	google-chrome
the css works as expected on all of the other browsers i ve tried ff3 google-chrome opera

move	drag
it ll still drag around if you move your mouse out of the browser window and the mouse will be outside of the browser when you release it

5032059
google-chrome	firefox
my most recent problem is that the firefox extension code makes heavy use of ajax calls to google-chrome ... urls it fetches .html files that way and then displays the html on the page

5032090
subclass	accessor
in your test package derive a subclass from your system under test which contains pass-through accessor to protected data

5032100
post	get
method post doesnt seem to be working and i get an authorization error posting to that url

5032144
implements	extends
let s assume that we have a simple web application which contains custom component that extends canvas and implements mx.managers.ifocusmanagercomponent

5032183
put	get
potentially amount of users maybe large enough and i want to speed up the put get process of this data by usage of memcache and delayed persist to the bigtable

5032183
put	get
no problems just to put get objects by keys

5032261
postgresql	mysql
a proper database like postgresql or mysql or sql server or sqlite or many others gives you proper data types and table joins and indexes and row iteration and proper handling of multiple matches and many other things which you really don t want to rewrite from scratch

5032274
getter	setter
then convert in the getter setter of permission

5032307
google-chrome	safari
browser like google-chrome or safari you

5032331
google-chrome	safari
however on google-chrome or safari line 1 becomes the same height as line 2 as if the style of the outer span does not apply to the space

yes keep it in a php config file somewhere preferably in a folder above the directory that is the web root

5032490
jquery	simplemodal
i have a simplemodal jquery popup that has to have overflow set to auto because the resulting list can be long

5032555
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can do it in httpd.conf or in a .htaccess

5032567
uiview	subviews
the bounds property does limit where a uiview can draw but does not limit its subviews

5032606
hide	fadeout
i ve got a list of these div s on a single page so if i click the hide class text everything would fadeout since everything in the list has the same class name

5032612
client-side	server-side
twitter used it in their recent redesign so they can share templates between server-side ruby and client-side javascript.

5032709
next	except
ok so next i thought maybe i can somehow slice out everything except the last word in the in the url and do a replace .php to get the extension tacked on.

5032709
folder	dir	folder	directory
i originally had everything in one directory and wanted to manually append the files to the url but was running in problems with the same logic so i thought i move them into a folder called files and figure out how to trick the js into leaving that dir path in there.

5032749

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here s the finished code for ie firefox safari and google-chrome

5032837
persistent	transient
the database identifier will change if a transient object is made persistent

5032837
instances	transient
if the transient instances usually together with detached instances is held in a set changing the hashcode breaks the contract of the set

5032868
tunnel	vpn
when you create a vpn you do not have to tunnel the whole network in fact itâ s not nice to do so as local servers will become unreachable you can decide on which ports services ips to tunnel

5032890
profiling	debugging
to be more specific the application takes extremely long to start up up to 2 minutes - profiling and debugging showed that creating a hibernate jpa entitymanagerfactory which happens at startup takes extremely long

5032892
datamapper	activerecord
doctrine uses the datamapper pattern while propel uses the activerecord pattern

5032892
datamapper	activerecord
so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway

5032917
inline	inlining
early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline

5032951
equals	gethashcode
as a commenter noted though a dictionary would be using equals and gethashcode to determine equality which would still by default end up determining that they were not equals

5032951
equals	gethashcode
you could probably create a class that inherits system.linq.expression and override gethashcode and equals to use the result somehow though and use that as the key for your dictionary

5033021
min	max
marklogic can store index billions of xml documents and allow sub-second searching across all of them complex sum count min max operations etc

5033066
put	get
since your code has lots of python calls random.sample for example you likely won t get huge speedups unless you find a way to put those lines into c which takes a good amount of effort

5033093

5033229
draggable	droppable
now i want to make the items draggable and droppable on the to box via the jqueryui library

5033322
inherited	properties
i find it stupid that you need the private field i feel this type of code should be inherited inside of that you should have implicit access to a field of the type of the properties whether you use it directly or fall back to the default auto-property wiring

5033395
hide	show
that is instead of using three distinct pages use a single page that has panels for each of the virtual pages. just keep track of which page the user is on with another viewstate-managed property and show hide the forms as appropriate to that page

5033417
versioning	upgrade
mike vosseller has an upgrade versioning of this script for xcode 5

5033431
decoder	encoder	rtp	sdp
as for encoder decoder support if the sdp signals packetization mode 1 or 2 it means that there might be fu-as in the rtp stream

5033431
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
i don t understand the last part of your question relating to the sip b2buas the sdp signals packetization modes and based on that the rtp receiver must be able to handle the different nal unit types that are specified in rfc3984

5033463
g++	gcc

this works great in ie safari and google-chrome but firefox seems to lag

5033486
multicastdelegate	delegation
have a look at delegation and multicastdelegate both msdn links for more information on how this works

5033547
children	parent
i must be missing something trivial with sqlalchemy s cascade options because i cannot get a simple cascade delete to operate correctly -- if a parent element is a deleted the children persist with null foreign keys

5033547
children	parent
the script creates a parent adds 3 children then commits

5033547
children	parent
next it deletes the parent but the children persist

5033554

the problem is not only that i don t know how to use the timer class but i also don t know what to put in the method that the timer will be repeatedly calling so that i can get the animation.

5033867
oncreate	setcontentview
you shouldn t be calling setcontentview more than once in oncreate

5033920
move	drag
click and drag the mouse off screen and you will see that move events are fired and you can get the x and y pos of the mouse

5033922

i have a class ball which extents view.inside there i give some characteristics and implements ontouchevent so i can handle the movement.also i use ondraw so i can draw the bitmap of the ball

5033936
superclass	subclassing
there it is mentioned that in order for the compiler to recognize the property of the superclass when using the subclassing the subclassing s implementation file must import the superclass s header file

5034009
hide	show
i need to show the when the li class is current and hide the when it is not current

5034013
hash	salt
according to this so post this is the process they use to encode hash your password salt

5034027
cpython	pypy
since the programs are compiled one could simply contribute modules written in rpython and it could compete with other python implementations including cpython and pypy

5034033
post	get
when applied to an action it restricts the action to only requests made with that particular http verb get or post

5034070
children	parent
you might want to add delete-orphan as well delete causes children to be deleted when the parent gets deleted delete-orphan also deletes any children that were removed from the parent even if the parent is not deleted

5034071
haskell	sml
in other languages such as scala c# haskell sml and f# even that wouldn t be necessary

5034112
hide	show
here is an example that will hide and show based on your classes

5034151
for-loop	arrays
i ve then simplified the for-loop for populating the plotdata arrays with some values

google-chrome	firefox
browsers tested google-chrome 9 firefox 3.6 on ubuntu 10.04 lucid

5034217
cpython	pypy
that s necessary for implementing pypy but generally if you want fast compiled code that can interact with python you d use cpython which is targeted at cpython extensions and supports pretty much all of python seamlessly or write code in one of the more common languages that can do this

5034220
getter	setter
however the class has become a long around 200 lines of getter and setter including 4-5 class definitions class with bunch of inner classes

5034233

int	chars
the system tells the type of the expression which in your case is chars int int int int - int int int but cannot print it because it is a function

5034402
put	get
so i put validation into the property s get as well

5034430
getter	setter
as alxx mentioned in his comment you can change the property accountstate in your component from an actual property to a setter getter

5034440
super	self
notice that at the time you define b.__init__ you might think that super b self .__init__ is the same as calling a.__init__ self but you d be wrong

5034440
super	self
in the above situation super b self .__init__ actually calls c.__init__ self

5034454
ssl	https
i m providing a file download usually csv or pdf in my jsf web application on a https ssl host

5034461
superclass	subclassing
if you keep it around even as a private field you can t count on somebody else not having a reference to it and mutating it. if you need your subclassing to interoperate with apis that require the superclass then include an asxxx method that generates the superclass object on the fly

5034483
getter	setter	accessor	properties
because a properties can designate any method to be the getter or the setter not just the default pair of foo and setfoo so the compiler needs to know what properties this is in order to generate the correct accessor calls

5034525
telerik	radcombobox
i have a silverlight telerik radcombobox

5034552
put	get	post	get	post	put
in the context of a rest endpoint the endpoint would contain the requisite get put post and delete methods as applicable

i have a form with some select lists that will show hide more input fields when certain values are selected

5034795
google-chrome	firefox
edit it appears this also doesn t work in google-chrome but works fine in firefox

5034954
hash	md5
so now when i display the password field of course they are in md5 don t worry for testing purposes i am showing the password in the field instead of displaying hash or dashes

uitouch	uibutton
i am trying to make it so that my ipad app records with nslog the coordinates of the uitouch that occurs whenever they press one of my app s uibutton

5034967
hash	md5
in the database you overwrite the old md5 hash with the new md5 hash

5034972
width	height
so create a new hidden div set a fixed width of 600 but not height then loop through

5034972
width	height
set a width 600 and leave the height

5035003
hash	md5
the md5 hash is a one-way hash that cannot be decrypted so there s no need to display it

5035003
hash	md5
changing the passwords updates the database with a new md5 hash

5035012
bmp	png
a variation on the png answser output to bmp

google-chrome	firefox
if u re running under firefox or google-chrome you may be try console.log ..any

5035200
ubuntu	linux	g++	gcc
so if i m using unix only as a tool to run gcc g++ valgrind for this cs course and these can be run on linux instead it seems like i can get the job done faster using ubuntu linux

5035201
portrait	landscape
you ll get onpause as soon as it goes to the background and onstop and ondestroy if it s shut down or if the configuration changes like you re changing orientation from portrait to landscape - they won t typically be called if you re just switching apps

5035217
range	minimum
if you want to be able to set a minimum and or maximum range you could prototype your own function into number

5035217
range	minimum	range	min
2nd argument is the minimum range pass null for no min

5035217
range	max
3rd argument is the maximum range pass null or leave blank for no max

5035237

i would check to see what versions of gcc g++ and valgrind the teacher is having you use and make sure that you have the same version running on your install of linux

5035326
mef	prism
i have a wpf application that loads modules into my application via prism mef

5035332
children	parent
the left and right values of a parent node will always set the boundaries of values for it s children

5035332
children	parent
what we ve done here is created an alias to the same table for child and parent then find the children that fit between the given parent node

5035343
client-side	server-side
otherwise you ll need your server-side project to be dependent on your client-side project since any data objects that are shared will need to be part of the client so gwt can create a javascript version of them

5035374
vmware	esx
vmware s desktop software runs on microsoft windows linux and mac os x while vmware s enterprise software hypervisors for servers vmware esx and vmware esxi are bare-metal embedded hypervisors that run directly on server hardware without requiring an additional underlying operating system

5035422
qlineedit	qlabel	qcombobox	qcheckbox
so currently i have code in c++ that creates a few qlabel a qlineedit and a qcheckbox when a selection is made from a qcombobox

5035428
free	malloc
unfortunately this would require allocating memory for the array and using manual memory management malloc free which depending on the lifecycle of the array can be anywhere from a nuisance to awful

5035446
folder	directory
so of course the easiest solution is to get a list of folder in the directory and build the paths to the auto load files if the files exist then the script includes them

5035520
kerberos	ntlm
first if you set up sp to use ntlm either move to kerberos which requires operation on the domain or force the ntlm as the only authentication provider

5035544
qunit	jsunit
check out popular javascript unit test suites like jsunit fireunit qunit etc

5035577
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
ie8 9 supports the xdomainrequest object but will support xmlhttprequest level 2 as of ie10

5035633
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i understand that doing this with inherited is not good because of the bulk of subclassing and those subclassing would not override anything just add new properties which really isnt that good in my opinon

5035656
lapack	gsl
specifically use the industry-standard lapack library or use the gsl or whatever other linear algebra library you want

5035691
getter	setter
i see absolutely no reason to use maps for future proofing the argument that you can avoid having to add new methods is laughable especially when you consider that adding a new field takes about 20 keystrokes adding getter and setter for it another 3-4 mouse clicks

5035698
force.com	salesforce
soql the saleforce object query language is a sql like syntax used on the force.com platform to query records within a salesforce instance

5035769
cldc	midp
and in the main there is no one solution for all phones using cldc midp framework

5035802
google-chrome	safari
it makes a lot of sense for ios and android devices because both safari s and google-chrome s webkit implementation are pretty far along

5035807
mef	prism
now prism mef do allow this kind of capability for the front end but the problem is with the database end

5035811

your for-loop just copies all values from one arrays to another

5035943
width	height
i needed the height and width of the scaled bitmap before it s ever drawn to the screen so that i could draw some overlays in the correct position

5035943
width	height
i got the original width and height of the bitmap

5035943
width	height
the imageview s height and width are hard-coded in the xml file at 335

5035943
width	height
since the width was scaled down to the the width of the imageview i have to find the scaled down height

5035943
width	height
i just multiplied the ratio of the imageview s width to the bitmap s width times the bitmap s height

5035943
width	height
if the height is greater than the width just reverse the width and height variables

5035946
client-side	server-side
i thought i read in a tutorial on yql by chris heilmann that if you re generating any content client-side with json you should include a server-side function to generate the content at regular intervals for search engines to find

5035980
public	protected
there isn t any standardized idiomatic means i know of to prevent a parent class protected member from being accessed in a sub-derived type but declaring a new public useless member of a clearly-useless kind would be one approach

5035996
wadl	wsdl
wadl or wsdl 2.0 is able to describe rest service but non of them is currently supported by wcf

5036032
google-chrome	firefox
this is standard browser behaviour firefox will make the content jump but google-chrome keeps the current position when increasing the scrollheight

5036054
google-chrome	safari
if you try this code for yourself and run in google-chrome or safari youll see that webkit applies the border-image gradient to the entire element rather than to just the border

5036110
width	height
i m trying to animate an image to the full width and height of a div it works with the top left image as i d expect but the others it moves the image to the top left and then animates it

apache-poi	docx4j
how you do this is dependent on your chosen toolset eg plain xslt or docx4j apache-poi etc

5036128
inherited	subclassing
you could also do it with inherited where user is an abstract class that defines the abstract methods signin and signout and different subclassing such as adminuser and guestuser implement completely different behaviour for these methods - no behaviour for signout for a guest

5036140
inherited	properties
is the percentage relative to a given properties otherwise inherited from an element s parent

5036143
mouse	keyboard
although this question is mainly about the mouse input i would also like to know how it works for keyboard input as well

5036157
hide	show
you can study what they did and do something similar - or just write the show hide code yourself

5036161
for-loop	arrays
in the code below i am trying to use a for-loop to initialise the member name of five objects of the class book using names taken from the string arrays arrays numbers in this case for testing purposes

5036184
submit	submission
you could just attach an onsubmit handler that cancels the default submission action by returning false and replicate the default browser submit by making an ajax call

5036203
min	max
in the search engine i m making i have a query built up from the various inputs which are required by the user whereas two of these are the age min and max

5036203

this would select all the fields with the corresponding age to min and max

5036212
qsplitter	qwidget
i have a qwidget window which contains a qsplitter

5036217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is only compatible in safari firefox and google-chrome

i d think ex should be used instead of em when dealing with vertical rather than horizontal measurements height instead of width

5036247
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you want something that works in firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+ with no images then try raphaã l

post	get
create renders a blank form for a get and validates saves for a post adding the new item to the sale it should belong to

5036441
int	chars
int main int argc const chars argv

5036473
sequence	permutation
for the first 3 permutation of the sequence 1 10 permn pays a heavy price for computing unnecessary permutation

i m writing some open source software to capture and process raw mouse and keyboard events

5036664
children	parent
i want to display a flow chart of a process showing time spent in children relative to the parent

5036675
post	get
also according to the documentation you need to provide a post of the parameters to the api not pass them in as a get parameter

5036699
tolower	toupper
to make your life easier i suggest you use std toupper or std tolower to convert the string before you compare

5036738
uiview	subviews
second subviews the custom uiview

5036745
versioning	upgrade
pull from projects to upgrade them to the latest versioning of their template

at the moment i m using setcookie to set my cookies however it only works in firefox and safari and cookies are not set in ie and google-chrome and maybe other browsers

5036756
int	double
this table has 7 variables id int index approved int city text country text heading double lat double lng double

5036761
entity-relationship	diagram
that said if you don t want to explicitly define that particular column as foreign key you can still perform the query without any problems but it makes the entity-relationship diagram difficult to read by your coworkers because the relationship between 2 tables aren t explicitly defined

5036785
titlebar	window
i can t think of an easy way to prevent a window from being dragged around short of removing its titlebar by creating it with the cpborderlesswindowmask mask

5036821
draggable	droppable
you should be able to set up a draggable and droppable and tap into droppable s drop event handler which is fired when an item is dropped

5036832
post	get
on page load get every new post topic that was created after that timestamp then serialize this data and store it in the database or in a cookie if this serialized data already exists unserialize it merge the two and reserialize it

5036832
post	get
if a user visits a topic get all data from the serialized entry that matches ie in the same topic or the post number and remove it from the serialized data

5036863
submit	submission
when i submit a third time i get three submission - and so on

5036868
width	margin
of course at this point you might very well be better off using a container div with a margin auto applied to it and a width of the 3 contianer div s you have with it

5036877
google-chrome	firefox
note that it uses jquery and assumes you are running firefox or using tampermonkey if you are on google-chrome

5036899
portrait	landscape
i say in theory because it appears there s a bug in the code that handles a configuration change landscape to portrait resulting in oninflate being called after oncreateview when the fragment is being reconstructed after a configuration change

5036928
jsf	seam
pros of jsf + seam default support

5036931
textarea	textbox
after jeditable creates the textarea is created and adds it to the dom i d like to attach the elastic plugin to the element so the textbox expands and shrinks nicely

salt	md5
in order to secure ajax requests ran bar-zik sugested to create a small flash file to receive the data salt it and encrypt it with md5

5036985
fadein	fadeout
it definitely is possible just not with the fadein or fadeout functions

5036985

5038336
getter	setter
i am reading a java book about encapsulation and it mentioned the getter and setter method

5038336
getter	setter
i ve read that to hide the attributes i must mark my instance variables as private and make a public method of getter and setter to access the data

5038381
getter	setter
traditional you create a single getter and setter for each variable as needed like so

5038381
getter	setter
don t create getter for variables that won t need to be accessed outside of the class and don t create setter for variables that won t need to be set outside of the class

5038381
getter	setter
if following mvc and using the traditional getter and setter like above you would have the view code elsewhere and call something like

5038383
getter	setter
all other classes will have to use other accessors for example getter and setter methods

5038383
getter	setter
you don t have to use getter or setter although sometimes there are good reasons to do so inside the class too

5038383
getter	setter
using getter and setter sometimes makes sense if you do some logging or validating before a value is set

5038387
getter	setter
like i describe in the first paragraph use of accessor methods getter and setter is a more idiomatic approach and easier to understand for someone else using your code

5038394
getter	setter
you use setter and getter to make the variables accessible from outside your class

5038397

quicksort	mergesort
implementations of mergesort are most common since it is worst case o n logn while quicksort could degrade to o n 2

5038927
getter	setter
i would like to add another great benefit about using encapsulation and is the fact that by hiding the data from its clients just as the examples described above you can guarantee how to set and get these instance variables making your class easier to maintain and test i.e if you have many clients manipulating your objects variables you don t need to go class by class writing the new functionality instead you just modify the getter and setter

5038927
getter	setter
by making usage only of the objects setter and getter the details of its implementation can be hidden from the outside world

5038935

this all works fine in firefox but not in other browsers google-chrome and ie

hash	md5
just for completeness i ll add why you might want to design with the ability to use other hashing algorithms easily - if this was used for any security purposes md5 has been shown to be vulnerable to hash collisions - the us department of homeland security advises that md5 should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use

5041799
integer	unsigned
use a larger signed integer type such as int while doing intermediate calculations this to make sure that over- and underflows can be detected and dealt with in particular not casting to a signed type could force to compiler to promote every type to an unsigned type in which case you wouldn t be able to detect underflows later on

5041803
portrait	landscape
a rotation from portrait to landscape can for example restart your activity and if you re unfortunate your first activity is not gc-ed properly in my case due to some listeners still holding a reference to it

you can set height and width like this

5042317
udp	tcp
you can simply use udp tcp sockets

5042333
firefox	safari
everything fine in firefox and safari but in ie obviously it gives me a problem i can t figure out

5042335
integer	unsigned
on the other hand you might mean to interpret the bit value of the memory referenced by some variable to be interpreted as an unsigned byte regardless of the signed integer representation used on the system if it has bit value 0b10000000 it should evaluate to value 128 and 255 for bit value 0b11111111 this is accomplished with reinterpret_cast

5042345
hash	salt
just salt and multiple hash the password

5042747
multiplying	add
edit a handy trick in case it wasn t apparent is that if you want to order by n things and you re already using compare you can just multiplying each thing by 3 k with the first-to-order being multiplied by the largest power of 3 and add

5042798
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both ie and firefox oh and google-chrome

he gets the image response and puts it in the imageview

5042936

however since animations fadings use settimeout setinterval i highly guess that the call depth does not increase it s not prone to stack overflows

5042965
public	protected
if you inherit with private word and that s how you inherit when you don t specify any word for class every method from gtk window become private in mainwindow even if it s declared as public or protected in gtk window

5042965
public	protected
if you inherit with protected word every public methods from base class become protected methods in inherited class

5042997
folder	directory
my solution is now like i said in my first answer change the paths to use the sub directory and then redirect old files to that folder

5042999
put	get
note that if the current statement is a pl sql block - then the entire blockl will get executed with the execute statement so if you put a begin..end around your two statements then they could be run as a unit without running the rest of whatever is on the editor

5043000
freemarker	velocity
if you want to stick more closely to java then another approach is to use a template engine like velocity or freemarker

5043052

have you written files to the folder at this point or just assuming the directory will be deleted since you see it being deleted today without an new files in it

5043403
folder	directory
i m creating a game and i must list only folder in directory

5043404
submit	submission
what you probably want to do is trap the key event and cancel it to prevent the form from submission but maybe you could be more specific about what you do want to submit your form

5043407
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s available in webkit google-chrome safari since a while and in firefox 4

5043411
haskell	scheme
the standard paramorphism recursion scheme isn t in haskell s data.list module though i think it should be

5043457
jtextfield	jlabel
if i use jbutton and jtextfield and jlabel the items do not show up until i interact with them click on the text field mouse over for the button i cant get the label to show up and if i use the normal versions i get the ugly gray backgrounds around the labels

5043481
sorting	grouping
sorting seemed a difficult option so i thought of grouping

5043497
google-chrome	firefox
here s a simplified example that shows the problem in firefox and google-chrome

5043552
redmine	trac
it is just like if you use sourceforge googlecode redmine trac or whatever you have the repo where your actual code is and then you have a broader project that includes your repo but also has things like an issue tracker maybe a wiki etc..

5043564
bmp	pgm
your code would be a lot simpler if you ditched bmp and wrote images as pgm files instead

5043564
bmp	pgm
at the very least if you write your images in pgm and broken bmp you can use imagemagick to reliably convert the pgm to a working bmp

5043588
width	height
i think you should be subtracting the padding from the width in the height instead of adding it

5043603
awt	swing
don t mix swing with awt

5043607
for-loop	loops
i also sucked the if statement into the for-loop expresssions because it s slightly safer that way weird things will not happen if the next token after the close brace of loops body is else

5043705
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

5043713
min	max
the interval min and max should

5043713
min	max
distance between min and max meaning

5043720
gif	png
i think you will have to create it to gif first and then back to png if you wish

5043747
folder	directory
under windows you can use _findfirst and _findnext to iterate through the contents of a directory and then use createfile and getfileinformationbyhandle to determine whether a particular entry is a directory or a folder

5043749
sorting	filtering
it is highly likely you actually do not need an inner loop for the filtering and the sorting

5043754
hide	show
have the scrollviewer sit in column 0 with a columnspan of 3 and then add a button to columns 0 and 2 that you can show and hide when the mouse rolls over that cell of the grid

5043769

how uitableviewcell draws its contentview is not how you would normally draw subviews in an uiview

5043776

5043840
integer	fractions
he suggests using a mappingtable with fractions indices though i would suggest integer indices

5043851
post	get
you would not be able to post the resulting form back to your site but with some javascript you could read the form data and create another get request by building up the querystring of the url

5043855
printf	strcpy	strcat	gets
examples for functions to avoid strcpy strcat printf gets scanf s ptr

5043855
memcpy	strncpy	printf	strncpy	printf	fgets	fgets	strncpy
instead use things like memcpy strncpy or better yet strlcpy though not available everywhere printf fgets

5043857
stdout	stderr
anyway when i run this in an executable script task.communicate doesn t seem to store anything in stdout and stderr

5043857
stdout	stderr
to be precise i get stdout stderr . instead the stderr stream from mcf seems to be leaking to the terminal rather than getting captured by the subprocess pipe

5043857
stdout	stderr
when i step through it line by line in the interpreter stdout and stderr are correctly assigned

5043890
rss	feed
i m implementing a jquery mobile site and i ve hit a snag when trying to show a count of rss feed using

5043954
post	get
there might be a way with groupby to get something similar or you can get the last x items order by date if you know that for example no more than x items are created per specific date and do some post processing in linq but at first sight you re on the good track

5043978
udp	tcp
it provides some of the same service features of both it is message-oriented like udp and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like tcp

5043979
sctp	tcp	sctp	udp	udp	tcp
stream control transmission protocol sctp is a transport layer protocol providing reliable transport of data like tcp but with message oriented features like udp

5044005
min	max
you could weaken your restriction to allow 0-length values by specifying min and max length

5044020
width	height
replace the #### with your video id 195111727174972 and appropriate width height

5044043
submit	submission
if you re submission a form via ajax and also want to submit a file you might consider placing the file upload in a completely separate form tag then trigger the form submission after the ajax call is successful

5044062
google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 as soon as we exceed 1000 divs the html simply doesn t show works fine in google-chrome and firefox

5044092
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
your tableview should live inside a uiviewcontroller subclass that is itself inside of a uinavigationcontroller

5044188
ws-trust	ws-federation
it implements the ws-trust ws-federation and saml-p standards

5044195
children	parent
so the child rows are not sorted at all but the parent are sorted preserving the order of the children

5044218
multiplying	subtract
if you implement the box blur by doing horizontal and vertical strips seperately an extremely fast implementation is just to scan each strip of pixels and maintain a running total adding the pixel radius 2 in front while subtract the pixel radius 2 pixels behind and multiplying by cached 1 radius to calculate the running average

5044226
hide	show
when this happened to me i write a function on event start on lightbox show and there i hide the object ie i place the youtube video inside a div with class name tohide and then o use

5044267
for-loop	loops
to fix it you could split the data into a list of tuples outside the for-loop and loops through that

5044320
post	get
php s string comparisons are case-sensitive and request_method is all-capitals post or get never post or get

5044345
pop-up	dialog
but when javascript wants to close that window internet explorer will normally open a dialog box and ask the user to confirm closing the pop-up

5044345
pop-up	dialog
my old approach with the annoying confirmation dialog was to run iexplore.exe with the pop-up url as parameter via system.diagnostics.process

5044345
pop-up	dialog
thus the pop-up has a base window and javascript can close it without the confirmation dialog

5044355
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead or an incrementing variable with the foreach loops to check

5044405
quicksort	heapsort
another instance quicksort is o n 2 in the worst case while technically correct even heapsort is o n 2 in the worst case

5044451
min	max
variables i min max are declared as numeric

5044451

5044574
wan	lan
let s assume that i have many tens of thousands physical nodes running erlang on linux that need to communicate and synchronize small infrequent amounts of data across the lan wan

5044595
min	max
you could run the loop variable from 0 to the difference between min and max

5044654
awt	swing
it is oldest resource but by the way java awt swing event queue

5044670
mouse	keyboard
in practice it gets more complicated with modal dialogs and the like but basically it is getting the events from the underlying os for keyboard and mouse and posting them as events on the eventqueue and the various components get those events and use and consume them or pass them along as they wish

5044688
jtextfield	jlabel
you can t do that with a plain text field but you can put a disabled jlabel on top of the jtextfield and hide it if the text field gets the focus

5044694
mvp	presenter
in mvp the presenter assumes the functionality of the middle-man played by the application controller in mvc

5044695

model view presenter mvp is a derivative of the model-view-controller software pattern used mostly for building user interfaces

5044716
cpu	processors
the other way around a 32bit binary on a 64bit cpu is generally possible if the os and processors supports such things

5044717
implements	extends
this extends c++ a little bit adding nice features like more powerful rtti the signals slots mechanism similar to events delegates in c# allowing typesafe callbacks the plugin interface mechanism which provides a way to extends applications by implements a pre-defined interface

5044717
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
this includes windows at least xp and later linux pretty much any distribution mac various unices like freebsd hp-ux solaris and much much more

5044752
caanimation	calayer
the caanimation way also requires that you add it to the view s underlying calayer

5044752
uiview	caanimation
there s additional functionality available by using caanimation but if it s something you re not familiar with chaining uiview animations or resetting it in the completion block is perfectly acceptable

5044759
int	double
all int are guaranteed to be stored exactly in double - so still use the same trick

5044785
jar	war
the web container i ve found easiest to embed in a jar file and it is still a valid war too is winstone

5044837
post	get
this blog post by lee also seems to get into a pretty details explanation of the process

button	checkbox
you need to add an action listener on every checkbox except the seventh one which doesn t have any impact and re-compute the enabled state of the button each time the listener is called

5045047
xml-rpc	json-rpc
both json-rpc and xml-rpc can use http as the underlying transport protocol but can also work with others

5045047
xml-rpc	json-rpc
by now this is the preferred way in javascript development comparison of rest vs xml-rpc is a nice read and applies to json-rpc as well

5045061
int	chars
all arithmetic on unsigned chars values is done by first casting them to int and doing the operations on int values and so c which is equal to -1 - int c will return a negative int value

5045061
int	chars
an explicit cast would be needed to get the unsigned chars result before printing it out and the call to printf would cast it back to int anyway

5045091
int	chars
chars gets promoted to int when you pass it to printf

5045103
gson	jackson
but if that is not possible i think both jackson and gson would require either custom deserializer

5045549
width	height
if you don t specify the height and width of the canvas element then per the specs

5045549
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150.

5045549
width	height
the width and height css properties control the size that the element displays on screen

5045550

base-class	subclassing
if 90 of your casts are from subclassing to base-class then removing them would be a start - they shouldn t be needed

5046866
base-class	subclassing
the rest you re telling the compiler that something strange is going on and you re breaking the rules - either the rules of the type system with a reinterpret_cast or a const_cast you re risking representation with a static_cast to a smaller integral type or you re breaking lsp and having to know about specific type of a subclassing when given a base-class

however when i add the button class to an input button google-chrome safari and firefox all add a margin-right 3px .

you may be better served using a listview instead of gridview in this case

5047607

it s not the like that has an id it s the post - which is why the api call uses post_id likes as a target - if you delete post_id it ll get rid of the post but if you delete post_id likes it ll get rid of the user s like for that post

virtualenv	yolk
yolk doesn t know anything about the current virtualenv

5047706
virtualenv	yolk
so run pip install yolk with the virtualenv activated

it seems to indicate that the order of precedence is such that screens size small med large xlarge is higher than density ldpi mdpi hdpi

5047745
screens	hdpi
but unfortunately adding the large qualifier makes it so they don t show up on medium sized screens with hdpi densities

5047943
folder	directory
determining whether a directory is a mounted folder

5047952
getter	setter
in a real application you may not need to generate a loop for example while uploading a file your flash aplication will tell you the filesize and let you know when you have reached the max value needed so my first code is intended to demonstrate just the use of the progressbar setter and getter and of course what make the whole thing play that is for instance the loop

i ve gone down this jquery rabbit hole of finding the anchors respective parent but am having trouble selecting the textarea children of said parent

post	get
after the edit you could either make sure the variables you re going to use have some value just blindly echoing a get post var isn t the best practice - or you could use an object to store the variables you want to output as properties and use __get to return an empty string or a false when the property hasn t been set

5048176

in oncreate use setcontentview r.layout.main or whatever to load up the layout file

use pixel values instead of 100 in your height width for the menu divs but that again creates a problem that is you will have to center the menu divs manually i doubt if even margin auto will work then

5048431
strlen	strcpy
again use strlen to get the length or store it somewhere beforehand and then use strcpy or probably a better stl function that has the same function

5050041
portrait	landscape
by using this way im able to set the app in landscape mode but the view is not rotated to landscape.the login view is fixed at portrait mode

5050041
portrait	landscape
in nib file if i fix the view in landscape the split view s rootviewcontroller appears on on e side and in the detailviewcontroller of splitviewcontroller this login screen is opened that too in portrait mode...

5050089
int	chars
you can t truly do it in standard c because the size of an int and of a chars aren t fixed

5050089
int	chars
and that int are normally 32 bits so 4 chars

5050090
int	chars
if you want to convert an int which is in the range 0-9 to a chars you may usually write something like this

5050099
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
note that charset.forname ... can throw exceptions illegalcharsetnameexception illegalargumentexception unsupportedcharsetexception but these are all unchecked-exception so you don t have to catch or re-throw them yourself

5050112

magpie is an rss and atom feed parser written in php

5050352
rss	feed
magpie is an rss and atom feed parser written in php

5050386
clang	llvm
you could use the clang c++ frontend to generate llvm bytecode and use llc to emit c code see llc doc especially the c option

5050400
onresume	onpause
i think using onpause onresume for this purpose is a bad idea because activity is partially or even fully visible

5050406
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid looks for views in the hierarchy starting from the view from which you re calling it or from hierarchy root if you re calling activity.findviewbyid and of course this works only after setcontentview

5050424
bison	lemon
it produces the smallest parser i found i compared parsers of similar complexity generated by flex bison antlr and lemon

5050424
bison	lemon
lemon requires to write more rules in comparison with bison because of simplified syntax no repetitions and optionals one action per rule etc

5050428

5050429
swift	objective-c
ipad applications are usually written in objective-c or swift in the xcode ide although it is also possible to use other tools to build ipad applications

5050433
post	get
for http you can send a head request instead of get or post

5050461
children	parent
now some people in the database will be a parent entity and therefore have children defined

5050482
children	parent
one part will query only persons and second part will query only parent with included children

5050482
ienumerable	iqueryable
edit it will work only in memory ienumerable not in db iqueryable

5050497
libs	buildpath
correction adding the same libs to the buildpath twice once to the one of the project under test and once to the testproject does not work because junit does not understand that both are really the same libs

5050497
libs	buildpath
the solution here is to export external libs from the original project configure buildpath - order and export - select libs to be exported instead of adding them to the buildpath of the test project directly

5050523
ubuntu	linux
if you re in ubuntu or any other aptitude enabled linux distro try running apt-get install openssl

nsurlconnection	nsoperation
create a concurrent nsoperation on which you run your asynchronous nsurlconnection

5050556
google-chrome	firefox
but it has the same behavioural difference between firefox and google-chrome as the button fragment in the question

5050589
width	margin
so you need to set its left margin equal to the negative width of the element

5050602
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome don t know about opera you can use the data uri scheme

5050730
int	boolean
some variables created in this manor such as an array of object seem to be passed as reference and therefore any changes are reflected within globalstate however for almost every other variables boolean strings int it seems the changes aren t reflected and therefore are being copied rather than referenced

5050759
int	boolean
it s exactly the same behaviour for all primitive types int boolean etc

5050772
folder	directory
alternatively make sure the folder name is as distinctive as possible and add a search routine to look for the directory in a number of sensible places at load time

5050776
put	get
i can hard code data into the controller and that does get saved but i want to know how to get the data the user put on the form back into the controller

5050780

since i install pending updates for my ubuntu server as soon as possible i have to restart my linux server quite often

5050801

now strlen substr and

5050839
mousemove	keydown
i d like it to observe not only mousemove but also keydown at the same time

button	checkbox
im looking for a way that i can have checkbox on a form that can be passed via the submit button to a php file that generates a header locate based on the values

5050965
int	chars
don t just print out the strings as strings - log the unicode value of each chars by casting it to int

5050972
inherited	subclassing
you re violating the contract stipulated by the interface by telling its implementer to only return objects of one specific subclassing of classparent which due to the nature of single inherited in classes is why it isn t allowed

5050985
portrait	landscape
i ve set initial interface orientation to landscape left home button in the plist but how do i actually rotate the view because when i load it up the view stays in portrait and the device is sideways

5050996

i want jquery code hide all then show the fist and the second one

5051007
hash	md5
in a linux system passwords are stored using an md5 hash

5051007
hash	salt
the next time it uses salt s2 and the system must generate a different hash

5051011
whenever	capistrano
we deploy with capistrano and use the whenever gem for cron processing

5051032
hash	salt
now with salt added to each password even same passwords generate different hash

5051057
accessor	properties
config accessor do not actually perform i o from your config classes if coded properly as they generate compiled properties so i think this not much of a problem and i doubt you would gain performance from caching it

5051071
width	height
if not this property make the parent of your component disregard the bounds like width and height of your component in render their own bounds

5051078
hash	md5
md5 is a hash as you know so if you give it an input like password you get a unique hopefully - however md5 has collisions these days output like 3de2af...

5051078
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to add arbitrary random data to the string being hash such that you increase the length of input to hash

5051078
hash	salt
of course if you re salting with password and you hash password you re hashing passwordpassword which isn t that much more secure so the choice of salt is important too

5051078
hash	salt
ideally you should use a random salt with each hash string but of course you need to know what it is

5051106
umbraco	dotnetnuke
if you re thinking of webforms rather than mvc try dotnetnuke or umbraco both of which are also open source cms s with add-on capabilities though umbraco is in fact transitioning to mvc in the next version

5051146
post	get
depending on what exactly you mean by updates a field in a local site you probably either want to send data in a get or post variable

5051156
outputstream	inputstream
for nonblocking io don t use inputstream and reader or outputstream writer but use the classes in this case a socketchannel and additional a charsetdecoder

5051164
swt	swing
startonfirstthread option should not even be used now since hosted gwt no longer uses swt but swing

5051167
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested this in ie8 google-chrome and firefox .

5051177
paredit	slime
for emacs one uses slime with the extensions paredit and redshank

5051178

a quick and dirty solution is to use protected instead of private methods and then test using a wrapper that makes the methods under test public

5051195
put	get
i would like to put together something for tomcat one day so i m experimenting and trying to figure out how not to re-invent the wheel but it just seems like i can t get my hands on the source code for keytool .

5051222
setcontentview	findviewbyid
this is the correct behaviour because findviewbyid will only search for views set in the view hierarchy passed to setcontentview

5051239
subtraction	addition
saturating addition subtraction on _eps would be cool but isn t really necessary

5051243
post	get
with some configuration of other wget options you should then be able to get it to traverse to the homepage and download this especially if there is a link to it on the post login page

5051251
imperative	declarative
if you are familiar with .net permission coding either imperative or declarative the pattern is exactly the same

5051324
super	self
then in the implementation of the methods of the class c self stands for the instance of c itself and super stands for the instance of c as an instance of its superclass a

5051325
int	double
var to cast to a double xsd int

5051331
subtraction	addition
comparisons would work automatically with a single operations addition and subtraction would need to mask out carry over from eps into padding zeros

5051331
subtraction	addition
there s no obstacle to using mmx for addition and subtraction masking out happens automatically then and ordinary integer comparison for comparisons

5051347
pop-up	dialog
if i push flex button - i can see flex pop-up dialog

5051379
hide	show
so why dont u check on page load if the id 3 or not and use same logic to hide or show the element

5051403

5051500
int	boolean
the values stored will have different data types boolean int float - even 14 byte width strings are possible

5051532
inherited	subclassing
the problem is that if i subclassing abstracttexteditor then i will lose all the inherited classes functionality of course

5051571
width	height
well getting the width and height of a flash file is also interesting for me

5051589
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
so adding an hmac to an md5 hash would make it substantially more difficult to break via a rainbow table

5051638
apache	nginx
other systems such as apache or nginx as fronting web servers can use the same cookie format to authenticate a user

5051642
codeigniter	pyrocms
i would reccomend looking into pyrocms which is also a free beer and speech cms built on codeigniter that directly allows for module development which is straight codeigniter development with a few added meta installation files that would allow you to build the extra functionality you need within the codeigniter structure

5051667
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in the above dtd the calender program is working fine in ie 8 google-chrome safari opera but in firefox it makes problem of displaying all the values as 1

5051703

xsl-fo	xslt
tables are pretty standard i thought html table could be easily transformed to xslt xsl-fo

5051754
put	get
finally i will say until you get the hang of perl s precedence rules it never hurts to put in explicit parentheses for lists and function s arguments

5051796
width	height
if your element is fixed height you can put it on your sprite width 100 width of the sprite with the required max-height of the element

5051796
width	height
or if you know that its max width is smaller then the width of the sprite then make it a rectangle with the max width and height of your element

5051806
qstring	qmap
afterwards from this reference qmap will attempt to copy the argument in this case going through the implicit sharing mechanism of qstring

it appears that the crashes occur during touchesended and touchesmoved events only particularly when i start the touch on the target image but move it off the boundaries of the image in the process

5052184
width	height
for rotate from the center you ll need to add dx and dy to ie filter then add displacement via css and add css hacks to increase elements width and height in ie

5052192
post	get
as i know that in a web browser end users can see the get form values in the address bar but for post method it won t have this issue

5052196
width	height
4 in ms access columns positioning sort order width row height etc

5052201
put	get
to get the raw float value and put it into a string you would use something like this

both get and post data will be in plain text unless you use https

5052228
post	get
both get and post are http verbs

5052232

5052247
post	get
from http perspective both get and post requests can be intercepted and modified

5052252
atexit	main
about the only excuse for it is to avoid problems from other bad practices such as functions registered with atexit that depend on the continued existence of local variables defined in main

5052252
stdio	puts
what this does i think is basically references directly the location of a function defined in the implied header filesâ i get the impression that gdb is auto-magically including the header files stdlib.h for system and stdio for puts

5052267
put	get
i tried to write an parcelable-container in which i can put any object i wish to get it parcelable without the need to implement this for every object again using methods of java reflection

a typical jax-ws+jax-b or jax-rs+jax-b service is very little code with cxf and manages all the data serializable and deserialization for me

5052269
post	get
then if you get stuck at least you ll be able to post a much more specific question one that is more easily answered with a specific and helpful answer

5052272
folder	directory
the way i have this working is that each directory is a form submit button that reloads the page when clicked but with a value in _post that tells the site to open or close a folder this is done within an array in _session

5052278
onkeyup	onkeydown
i set up a custom view overrode onkeydown and onkeyup and i have a switch statement to identify the key being pressed

5052312
post	get
and once you do a post you should redirect using get parameters or some other method

5052312
post	get
if you use get parameters instead of post then you can just make the page navigation stateless and just fetch the page they ask for

5052319
post	get
replacing post with get should disable the prompt

5052324

5052567
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout or setinterval

5052606
setinterval	settimeout
yes you could use either the javascript settimeout method or setinterval method to invoke the code that you would like to run

5052632
postgresql	mysql
if you do find the need to support multiple database systems then your best option is to simply create two different queries - one to be run on mysql and one to be run on postgresql for example

5052661
setinterval	settimeout
as others have pointed out setinterval and settimeout will do the trick

5052673

the for-loop in the second code listing will finish almost immediately even though in the example it loops for 100 iterations and will then wait for all i o requests to finish

5052860
post	get
you might get a more in depth response if you post a code sample

5052873

but when the onmousedown and onmousemove events are triggered when the mouse presses and holds the left mouse button on the div i mentioned earlier sometimes when you hover over a cell the variable gridplacement isn t set and sometimes you have to move your mouse over the cell a few times for it to work

5053081
onmousedown	onmousemove
it seems the onmousedown and onmousemove events seem to have an impact on the onhover event on my 15x15 table

5053093
width	height
set it s width to be two times the width of the letter found in step 3 and record its height

5053110

5053376
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the problem is that i assumed the action sheet would delay the exit of viewwillappear but while the action sheet is up viewdidappear gets called

5053657
nunit	mstest
you can certainly have one test project using mstest and another using nunit

5053657

5053902
vim	emacs
over the years i got to like more using a good editor like emacs vim is also ok i used it for many years and a command line compiler but mainly because i work in a variety of languages on several different operating systems and no single ide can cover all that

5053902

5054461
inherited	properties
note that getprivate won t work as written for properties inherited from superclasses but it s not too hard to loop up the hierarchy to find the declaring class

5054465
min	max
producefirst and producesecond use hardcoded parameters to nextint rather than using max and min as provided by the class

5054465
for-loop	loops
indeed the while loops in run is a good candidate for a for-loop

5054504

5054927
hash	md5
what i m considering doing as an alternative is have those fields store the data with a primary key on a separate field which has an md5 hash of the data such as md5 field_1+ - +field_2+ - +field_3 and then my script just queries one field such as

5054942
adplus	cdb

5054979
int	double
i ve seen some code where they don t use primitive types int float double etc

5054991
range	minimum
c and c++ don t restrict the exact size of the numeric types the standards only specify a minimum range of values that has to be represented

5055009
int	chars
because the types like chars short int long and so forth are ambiguous they depend on the underlying hardware

5055009

it s working in all recent browsers ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome but will not render adequatly in ie7

5055265
getter	setter
getter and setter have a number of related purposes

5055265
getter	setter
all of these add up to a convincing argument for using setter and getter everywhere

5055265
getter	setter
to my mind there is only two cases where getter and setter are optional

5055265
getter	setter
in these cases the reasons for using getter and setter mostly don t apply

5055265
getter	setter
however if there is a risk that the inner classes implementation details will leak in a revision of the code you should immediately add getter and setter

5055272
sitecore	umbraco
i can only comment mainly on sitecore and a bit on umbraco from my knowledge of others using it

5055272
sitecore	umbraco
based on my previous research and conversations with friends umbraco is very similar to sitecore

5055392
post	get
jquery ajax vs get post

5055455
swing	windowbuilder
i should point out the windowbuilder docs on swing data binding are expressly intended to document how to use the wb tools and not how to use the swing data binding api itself

5055455
swing	windowbuilder
in fact windowbuilder expects you to have a fairly good grasp of swing data binding fundamentals before you can effectively use the tools it provides

5055455
swing	windowbuilder
the bottom line is that if you know how to create the swing data bindings that you need by hand in source you should be able to more rapidly create then using windowbuilder

5055476
swt	swing
the wb docs themselves are quite extensive but intentionally focus on the tool itself and not the apis that it supports swing swt and gwt

validation logic can be stated once but applied both client-side nice ux and server-side security and consistency for non-sl clients of the service

5055641
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
data binding is your friend and ria services makes it not so annoying tedious to implement inotifypropertychanged over and over plus it adds lots of other great harder-to-implement interfaces like inotifydataerrorinfo i think and ieditableobject and so forth which many silverlight controls respect out of the box to do the right thing

5055660
integer	unsigned
pointer is nothing but a unsigned integer indicating position in a memory virtual address space to be precise

there is no guarantee that the fonts you have loaded on your computer when you design the web page will be loaded on your visitor s computersâ fonts are generally handled client-side rather than server-side

5055906
client-side	server-side
fonts are client-side not server-side and if you don t have the font that the css specifies your browser falls back either to the next font specified or a default font

5055913
client-side	server-side
i know you stated you want to do this in vb.net but then you re at server-side and it is far easier to deal with this on client-side if you don t have something not to

5056164
cvs	svn
when i moved a team from cvs to svn almost everyone in the office was thrilled getting something close to changesets was wonderful no more endless tagging before and after every checkin and having some vaguely tolerable move functionality was great

5056164
cvs	svn
the cvs options for move were awful and bad and svn made the downsides small enough to warrant renaming files as needed

5056164
cvs	svn
svn really delivers on its goal of being cvs done right

5056164
pull	push
that one person could do all the work of git pull and fixing minor conflicts in a local working tree then git push to the bare repository on the server for every one else to pull from again

5057179
inline	inlining
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function

i am using a jquery plugin called fcbkcomplete which shows up fine in google-chrome and firefox see here

5057183
margin	height
i just confirmed its not an overlay issue and definitely a height of input issue as when you add a top margin to the dropdown the height is still small on ie6

5057200
many-to-many	one-to-many
bonus point if i can use the same thing with very little change for a one-to-many relation when an article can only have one author but i don t want to use dropdownlist for that since there can be many authors and it wouldn t be searchable and if i write an async findauthor for the many-to-many scenario i d like to use it in the one-to-many as well

cvs	svn
proper usage of some git svn cvs whatever saves here situation really getting to the point where it worked is great

5057314
disk	ram
in the same time although hosting on a java stack has a higher starting barrier needs ram and processor even if no request is made and grails projects must start with minimum 512 ram for a small medium project to work reasonable when the number of visitors is big it handles them much better than a php interpreter which would need a lot more processing power and disk speed on a high load

5057315
post	get
what i have so far is a script that uses the graph api to get the json list of post and i also have a php file that can like a post who s id is submitted in the post_id query string parameter and this does work

5057335
post	get
so with an ajax post we would usually send data in this format also and not as a query string parameter which is how data is usually sent with a http get request and how you are sending data above

5057342
clang	llvm
you can also compile clang llvm from source for that see here

5057342
clang	llvm
update regarding your edit the frontend description reflects either the fact that llvm can be used as a backend in a gcc compilation through llvm-gcc google has loads of info on this or the fact that clang itself is unable to link your code together into an executable or library

5057459
hide	show
i think the problem was that show and hide see the item as it is and when the item is show only 50 it struggles

5057460
folder	directory
i believe you can just create a helpers folder within your module directory and load it as you would normally

implements	extends
public class doublekey k extends comparable k j extends comparable j implements comparable doublekey k j

5057526
getter	setter

5057527
width	height
of course what you need is to remove these declarations of width and height

5057540
width	height
2 you can just set up a fixed height or width only one of them to put the image in a fixed dimension

5057570
hide	show

snmp	mib
all my investigations to date indicate any .net snmp solutions out there seem to replace the windows mib and the snmp service s

5057785
snmp	mib
the solution must add its own mib to the windows deployment pc which from what i can tell means it must at least in part provide an unmanaged snmp extension dll to extend the standard windows snmp service

5057789

getattr	setattr
in the c interface it s the other way around an extension class has by default no __dict__ and you would instead explicitly have to add one and add getattr setattr support to handle it although luckily there are methods for this already pyobject_genericgetattr and pyobject_genericsetattr so you don t have to implement them just use them

5058733
post	get
this is the return type for both http get and post and this seems to work ok in my scenarios because i throw exceptions in exceptional http result situations like 404

5058733
post	get
another nice aspect of this setup is that the code to attach parameters to a get or post are fairly similar so this logic is pretty easy to construct

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
using a viewmodel first approach you can instantiate your viewmodel and then use caliburn.micro to locate your view via convention and automatically bind the two up

5058882
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
caliburn.micro will also do view composition so for example if you have a collection of view models on your parent viewmodel and you expose that collection from a property with the same name as a listbox on your view then caliburn.micro will automatically use the corresponding view for each item in the collection and bind up each items viewmodel with the view

5058884
unsigned	short
the difference is that char is unsigned short is signed

5058931
nginx	lighttpd

ormlite supports a number of jdbc databases including mysql postgresql microsoft sql server h2 derby hsqldb and sqlite and can be extended to additional databases relatively easily

5059322
calloc	malloc
the only thing that i see you shouldn t do in c is to cast the return from calloc or malloc

5059336
integer	unsigned
the idea is that high - low never overflows if the result is interpreted as an unsigned integer so the unsigned shift correctly performs division by 2 and the formula computes the middle value

if you want to open a source file into something like macvim textmate bbedit you can use their command-line tools mvim mate or bbedit respectively

5060050
textmate	bbedit	macvim	textmate
you could look into using one of the open3 methods to open apps too though you will have to find the right binary to call unless the app supplies a shortcut like macvim textmate or bbedit

5060079
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
i would suggest you create one nsblockoperation for each object and add it to the nsoperationqueue in the end of each iteration

where 4321 is the port that you need to specify your remote profiling debugging application to attach itself to

5060265
accelerometer	gyroscope
angle phi is the integral of angle velocity omega over the elapsed time and doing numerical integration with the trapezoidal rule like described is ok for gyroscope s data not for accelerometer

5060265
accelerometer	gyroscope
in general i would recommend to use the timestamp delivered by core motion instead of the defined period 1 5 as recommended by apple because device motion data is often delivered in a lower frequency than expected see what is the official iphone 4 maximum gyroscope data update frequency and or push method for core motion and frequency of accelerometer gyroscope data

5060280
children	parent
for example i have parent which has many children

5060305
try-catch	exception-handling
just send it to ad in a try-catch and if it s not validated the reason why will be in the exception-handling message

5060438
post	get
i ve sorted out how to get each section to highlight just fine when viewing that parent page however ive run into some trouble with achieving the same effect when i choose to view a post or subpage

5060438
post	get
since im utilizing categories to filter content to specific pages i was able to get each section to still highlight when viewing a post by using yet this also caused a few problems as well unfortunately....what happened was as soon as there was content posted to both the blog media section - both sections would highlight simultaneously which is obviously not what were going for here

5060466
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could write 2 routed event handlers for getfocus and lostfocus events by declaring them as attributes of getfocusevent and lostfocusevent or mouseenter and mouseleave depending on whether you want the glowing dimming to happen with an explicit click or reactive to just hovering

5060478

5060656
strcpy	malloc
the strcpy function copies a string into a buffer you need to get some other way such as malloc

5060657
free	strcpy
you provide a pointer to the destination buffer for strcpy so it depends on how you allocated that buffer as to whether it needs to be free and how to free it

5060657
free	malloc
for example if you allocated the buffer using malloc then yes you will need to free it

5060716
post	get
so insert if not exists post get id insert if not exists tag get id insert blog post tag with id s

5060718

datamapper	activerecord
if you mean a data access object dao which is a class or classes to function as a bridge between the database records and your application objects try the datamapper or activerecord patterns

5060900
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in ie firefox and google-chrome

5060927
innodb	myisam
i would like to convert some of our myisam tables to innodb so i can take advantage of foreign key support

5060931
disk	ram
if you are asking the more complex version of the question 0 - 10 million repeats allowed then you will need to to sort chunks that fit in ram store them on disk and then you can merge these chunks in linear time and streaming so you don t ever have to store the whole thing in memory

5060932
dom4j	xom	jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j
if you want a dom-like api - that is one where the xml parser turns the document into a tree of element and attribute nodes - then there are at least four to choose from dom itself jdom dom4j and xom

5060932
xslt	xquery
and of course there are other styles of processing low-level parser interfaces sax and stax data-object binding interfaces jaxb and high-level declarative languages xslt xquery xpath

5060957
try-catch	exception-handling
you could wrap that call in a try-catch structure to handle the exception-handling for whichever items are failing without exiting the loop and the method prematurely

5060966
implements	extends
you might be able to extends recordreader and or fileinputformat and implements what you need to do inside those

5060966
implements	extends
i haven t worked with extends those and not sure about your exact situation it might or not work to extends and implements the different functionality with recordreader and or fileinputformat

5060981
width	margin
instead of defining the width you could just put a margin-left on your li so that the spacing is consistent and just make sure the margin s +li fit within 900px

5060999
post	get
when i was playing with it usually the javascript will open a new post request that request you must get it from request.body which is an inputstream use that inputstream with ioutils to save the file once saved return a json object with the filename or path of the file

5061014
installation	upgrade
i upgrade my rails installation and now when i run

5061061
maven	pom.xml
when i use the maven pom.xml in my laptop i see 7 all 3.0.5

5061070
strdup	malloc
you should avoid this pattern in any language including plain c unless it s clear from the function name what s going on e.g strdup malloc

5061089
getter	setter
assuming jpa rather than strictly hibernate you might do this by applying embedded to a getter setter pair rather than to the private member itself

5061117
children	parent
if you are using orm like hibernate it is common for a parent domain class to write something like this to configure a bidirectional dependency with the children domain class -

5061139
serializable	deserialization
this allows to automatically generate the serializable deserialization code for ios and android

5061153
many-to-many	many-to-one
many-to-one or many-to-many if you

5061181
post	get
give your python script an http or xmlrpc front end and call that with a get post

5061262
width	height
8 191 pixels in width or height and

5061310
post	get
been getting a parsererror from jquery for an ajax request i have tried changing the post to a get returning the data in a few different ways creating classes etc. but i cant seem to figure out what the problem is

5061327
free	strcpy
strcpy itself doesn t allocate memory for the destination string so no it doesn t have to be free

5061327
free	strcpy
of course if something else had allocated memory for it then yes that memory should be free eventually but that has nothing to do with strcpy

5061327
free	strcpy
with strcpy even if you pass in an already-malloc ed block for the destination the responsibility is not being passed so you will still have to free that memory yourself

5061334
post	get
going to try to get someone to post them for me

5061357
hide	show
all widgets including windows in perl gtk support the show hide method

5061357
hide	show
plus you can have as many toplevel windows as you want and just show and hide them as needed

5061363
opera	firefox
the specific problem is that 4800 records take about 30 seconds to bind in internet explorer only 2 seconds in opera firefox

5061366
happy	cup
on top of that they encapsulate everything within an object oriented approach so if that s your cup of tea you ll be happy

5061392
freebsd	linux
however as i m pretty sure a cross-platform solution does not exist i m mainly interested in windows and linux and to a much lesser extent mac os and freebsd

5061392
free	malloc
ideally this would be something more intelligent than calling malloc copying and then calling free on the old block

5061435
free	malloc
you have to pass back the exact same address into free as you were given by malloc

5061435
put	get
then have your malloc16 function call malloc to get a block 16 bytes larger than requested figure out where the aligned area should be put the padding length just before that and return the address of the aligned area

5061435
free	malloc
for free16 you would simply look at the byte before the address given to get the padding length work out the actual address of the malloc ed block from that and pass that to free

5061438
multiplying	transpose	multiplying	add
i have matrix class and i want to add multiplying and take transpose of the matrix

5061447
x86	64bit
for example 64bit linux on x86 64 has a 16-byte long double which is 16-byte aligned - so all memory allocations are 16-byte aligned anyway

5061447
free	malloc
yes - you can only free the pointer returned by malloc

5061452
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you must free memory using the same pointer returned by malloc posix_memalign or realloc

5061452
realloc	memmove
use realloc as usual including sufficient extra space so if a new address is returned that isn t already aligned you can memmove it slightly to align it

5061470
width	height
in your case it certainly makes sense to save the height and width of the matrix and set up the arrays of elements

5061497
wordpress	joomla
the focal point is that i d like to architect it allowing administrator to activate or disactivate more functionalities by adding a new plugin ie he could do that by uploading an xml - as joomla does - or by clicking on activate button - as wordpress does.

5061515
textview	imageview
edit to apply this animation to a button a textview an imageview etc

5061538
width	height
however if you re asking how to fit it within a specific constraint as where the width and the height is 125mm it kind of depends what you want to happen

5061538
width	height
the image is placed in a correct height but the width could be bigger or smaller than the height constraints

5061546
realloc	malloc
if it worked at all for malloc i d think it would work for realloc just as well

5061555
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
since this is the first site we are doing with asp.net asp.net-mvc i was curious how it would handle html.actionlink s in the views

5061585
clang	llvm
i m planning to switch to llvm backend and clang for my objective-c soon if this makes any difference

5061606
decltype	auto
but i guess compilers that support lambdas usually support decltype and auto as well therefore matteo s answer is probably better

5061617
button	checkbox
when you connect an event to a form element that performs an action such as a checkbox or button returning false will prevent that default action

5061638
folder	directory
i have a mac with a folder that i want to clean of all hidden files directory - anything hidden

5061645
put	get
the easiest way to get the root path of your app is to put a module in the root of your app which stores the result of os.path.dirname __file__ then import that where needed

5061672
realloc	malloc
the trickiest requirement is obviously the third one since any malloc realloc based solution is hostage to realloc moving the block to a different alignment

5061678
for-loop	loops
on my system the dedicated for-loop comes out as being roughly twice as fast that s not particularly surprising since loops is executed twice with the generator based approach but it is still interesting to confirm it

5061688
umbraco	n2cms
things like umbraco and n2cms and microsoft orchard and others are simple open source not complicated and should all be good things to start your project from them and develop any functionality you need that doesn t exist as a per their existing plugin architecture

5061693
put	get
i know how get a image from a view i can detect the drag with a gesture recognizers so i have all the setup in place but have not expertise in graphic development so don t know how put this in motion.

5061703
width	height
i tried databinding the canvas s width and height properties but the dimensions always came out as zero which meant that all the images on the canvas would appear dead centre rather than positioned as desired

5061801
mdpi	hdpi
if you want to find the pixels per centimetre using just the logical densities hdpi mdpi ldpi then you may be out of luck

5061813
try-catch	exception-handling
by adding try-catch block i found the exception-handling was occuring because of wrong oracle version

5061842
super	self
copy super self.__class__ self .__new__ self.__class__

5061851
google-chrome	firefox
feel free to take a look using firefox google-chrome and ie8 do not have this problem.

persistent	transient
sectionnamekeypath might specify a key for a transient property derived from the persistent property

5061961
expression-blend	silverlight
i want to make an animation in the silverlight 4 expression-blend 4 - a running man

5061993
union	distinct
for performance reasons use union all instead of union which performs a distinct against the final result

5062003
put	get
i am trying to get the element id from all the heading tags that have a specific class and put that into an array so i can do something with it

5062016
int	chars
when adding a chars mychar you call get mychar and if null create a new item for the map for that chars with an int value of 1

5062035
int	double
-currentplaybacktime returns a nstimeinterval double which you are printing as a signed int

5062035
int	double
try either casting to int int playeridle.currentplaybacktime or printing the double 1.3f

5062044
mouseleave	mouseenter
similar solution can be found here using jquery to set the auto width when focus or mouseenter and set the orignal width back when blur or mouseleave

5062063
public	protected
it needs to use the base class version either directly if polygon _points is accessible public or protected or via accessor functions

5062088
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve programmatically created some uinavigationcontroller and added them to a uitabbarcontroller

5062090
put	get
i know how to put ringtones in the ringtonemanage but i want to be able to set the ringtone that the user pick and also get the title for ringtone the user pick

5062126
for-loop	arrays
i am writing a for-loop to fill an arrays

5062137
oledb	dataadapter
the easiest way to read excel spread sheets imo is to use a dataadapter and an oledb connection as shown in this code project sample

5062159
children	parent
basically you d have to iterate over each top level parent recursively iterate over its children until there are no more children

5062182
pylons	pyramid
pyramid pylons

5062186
post	get
post and get are only carried to the page you request it to

5062186
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

5062186
post	get
if you were using get or post the session var zipcode would not show up but it would if you are using session

5062206
post	get
but for post and get you need to take the data to the other page explicitly

5062224
onresume	onpause
i have used a tab host with 5 tabs and 3-4 activities in each plus complicated methods http calls and image adapters and there were no issues this way the activites dont call the ondestroy method but just call onpause and then onresume

5062224
onresume	onpause
remove some of the references when onpause is called and then if you need them again just reference them again maybe on onresume

5062285
vbscript	vba
the issue is that activedocument doesn t automatically reference what you think it does in vbscript the way it does in word s vba

5062290

5062324
google-chrome	safari
hey guys getting a error in webkit browsers google-chrome safari where the padding is being cut off from anchor tags

5062327
hide	show
my idea was to create a list with images in it that would hide all the items first then show the first one then repetitively hide the current li and then show the next one

5062327
hide	show
then when the last item was reached it would hide it then show the first and start the process over

5062327
hide	show
if on last hide this item show first item

5062327
hide	show
if else hide this item show next item

5062327
hide	show
if on last hide this item show first item

5062327
hide	show
if else hide this item show next item

5062327
hide	show
if on first hide this item show last item

5062327

your network devices the disk in your pc having to fetch from ram rather than l2 cache critical paths on your gantt chart trying to walk your kids to school when one is a 7yo speed daemon and the other a 5yo want to stop and look at every single god-damned flower -type -

5062380
children	parent
one approach would be to start with the parent viewgroup loop through its children and their children and so on and then check tags on each one of them

5062399
hide	show
i modified the accepted answer from this question how to show hide divs by select. jquery the question the op linked just so he could see the similarities between doing the two

5062405
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller that contains 3 uiviewcontroller on the stack

5062431
google-chrome	safari
try using another webkit-based browser safari or google-chrome and watch the error console in case something being thrown there

5062438
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the navigation item is owned by the uinavigationcontroller after all so it makes sense to me that changes made to it will not be saved restored depending on which uiviewcontroller is in the uinavigationcontroller s stack

5062454
installation	upgrade
iâ m interested to know what you all think and what strategies you employ for such activities as upgrade windows updates software installation etc

ant	maven
i usually use maven cause you can have a repository for jars and dependencies this makes life easier but since you have already refactor your code to use ant maybe this is not what you want to use subversion with netbeans then you might want to add another folder for jars like libs or something and then another for the binaries like audio etc

5062597
robocopy	xcopy
if your batch file only needs to run on windows vista or later you can use robocopy instead which is an even more powerful tool than xcopy and is now built into the operating system

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit i ve tried using the media -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio 1 queries with google-chrome safari and firefox 4 and apparently webkit treats the property as a constant device pixel to screen pixel ratio which doesn t change with zoom whereas firefox 4 treats it as device pixel to css pixel ratio which increases when you zoom in

this works great for portrait mode but the minute i try to do it for a landscape view it goes wrong

5063726
post	get
now not only that the views look clean but you get correct names for the input fields so that you can bind the values back in the post action

5063760
postgresql	mysql
to extend this process with data analysis we need to allow rules to query the database directly but we must retain dbms independence such that queries can be applied to postgresql mssql and mysql

5063775
children	parent
if all children means only direct children simply put a list of children as well as a pointer to the parent on each node

5063775
children	parent
if all children really means all children one option would be to build a string of the ids of each parent and add it as an indexed column

5063775
children	parent
again though this is expensive when you need to change the parent of a node with children

5063787

decoder	encoder
you abstract away the encoder and decoder into a different interface

5064558
decoder	encoder
then use composition in your data holder class to reference to encoder decoder

5064558
decoder	encoder
if you are using di then the encoder decoder would be injected w o data holder having knowledge of the actual implementation

5064558
decoder	encoder
or have a service that would take data holder instance and apply encoder decoder based on the implentation attached done again using di with that service

5064596

5064817
int	chars
an 8-bit microcontroller will almost certainly be able to access an 8-bit chars faster than a 32-bit int

5064817
int	chars
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems

5064870

post	get
i noticed that wordpress for example creates what is called an auto draft when you click the new post button to get around problem

5065005
implements	extends
if base was an abstract class you could declare the dosomething as abstract and have the extends classes implements it

5065005
implements	extends
alternatively you could even create an interface with the dosomething method and have which could even be a better decision and have the base class implements it given that only the extends classes would actually implements the method

5065053
inherited	subclassing
i thought private meant that the field will not be directly accessible in subclassing and that this was a fairly basic tenet of class inherited

google-chrome	firefox
as you can see it is fine on firefox google-chrome and even ie9 when viewing a local version of the site

5065362
google-chrome	firefox
the only difference between the local and live versions is that the font is being loaded from a different domain on the live site i have set up the cross-domain policy correctly as illustrated by the fact it works on firefox and google-chrome

5065362
google-chrome	firefox
it appears ie8 has a superior rendering engine that is closer to firefox google-chrome than ie9

5065376
unsigned	short	int	chars
as well the 32-bit variables are faster than 8-bit and 16-bit ones so if you have any chars or short loop counters it might be worth updating them to int s or better unsigned int s

5065383
google-chrome	safari
but when i open this page in google-chrome or safari

5065473
portrait	landscape
uiimagepickercontroller camera preview is portrait in landscape app

5065487
paradox	bde
use the tado component to get the data and then use bde components like tquery to import the data to the paradox table

in this case the quickest way to get the results i wanted was to put down the wheel and the chissel and use third party controls from obout the calendar control

5065527
distance	pdist
you can use pdist this function gives you the pairwise distance

5065541

update i d also like to point out that the code sample i give may have problems if your machine happens to have different alignment requirements for int than chars

5065697
button	checkbox
i want to change the display to none on the click event of a checkbox button

5065742
hash	salt
as an attacker i can generate a precomputed hash list containing the most common usernames with the weakest and most common passwords - that is if a web programmer is naive enough to salt their passwords with usernames my job as an attacker has become much much easier - the collisions are very predictable

5065799
hash	salt
this is why when you generate the hash of the password instead of hashing once with salt ie

5065833
profiler	yourkit
a good memory profiler i personally use and really like yourkit java profiler should be able to show you where the memory is being used

5065907
put	get
we managed to reach the servlet and also get a hold of the pdf and put it in the response

5065935
int	double

it actually works and post all the get values correctly

5066012
hide	show
i have a custom attribute yes no and what i want to do is on the product detail page of my magento site show or hide an image based on wether the value of this attribute is yes or no

5066032
post	get
also use post instead of get but not because the string is multiline but because you are storing it in the database

5066042
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is when you mouseover .changepic which is inside .userpic the mouseout event will fire and the image will not be displayed

5066042
mouseover	mouseout
so when you mouseover the images and .changepic the image will still be displayed and the mouseout event will not fire

5066044
profiler	yourkit
i used yourkit profiler to analyze the heap

5066086
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
you want to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

5066086
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout bubble so when they fire on elements within the element you re watching you receive them at the element you re watching

5066086
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave only happen when the mouseenter or leaves the specific element in question they don t bubble

5066136
int	double
now i can run the subtract method on two int s double s or even string s but i can t run on mixed which i thought i would be able to because of the .todouble conversion

the database is much better at sorting and filtering data then your systems so it s best to do as much on the db as you can

i am playing with some camera code found online and i want to show hide some buttons on screen

5066785

presently in my office we are using cvs repository which is very old and i m asked to upgrade to any new versioning

5066888

5067088
getter	setter
obviously this assumes your book class has appropriate getter and setter methods

5067134
min	max
instead of sorting you could just get the min and max of the strings

5067145

stdout	stderr
let s assume that we have command x which can be executed in shell and return some result in stdout and stderr

5067306
portrait	landscape
in my project it need to see in portrait not landscape

5067324

5067324
width	height
which would retain height and width

5067336
prepare	execute
if you want to collate data from seperate mysql instances then as others have suggested you will need to create 2 db connections fire a query against one connection then dynamically build and execute queries against the second note you ll get significant performance benefits by using a prepare statement for the iterated query

domxpath	domdocument
updates to the domdocument in this case a call do not follow through to the domxpath object

5067967
mp3	flac
you can specify user-defined fields in the info chunk which is probably suitable for your needs but there s no simpler way like you get with id3 tags in mp3 or vorbis comments in flac

wav	flac
otherwise for a simpler time you might want to transcode your wav files to flac and then write fields to the flac tag full flac c and c++ api documentation here

5068028

5068189
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 9 google-chrome and firefox all work without any issues so all i can think of is that it is using unsupported javascript code

on other implementations though the compiler may turn those pow calls into multiplication or at least into intrinsics which may in turn specialize for integer exponent

5069379
helpers	actioncontroller
the send_file method is defined in actioncontroller streaming and is therefore not available in helpers

floating-point	integer
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

5069643
floating-point	integer
on somewhat limited processors like those in high-end cell phones floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally within an order of magnitude or better so long as there is hardware floating-point available

addition	multiplication
for example integer addition often has only a single cycle s latency and integer multiplication is typically around 2-4 cycles iirc

5069753
x86	64bit
the x86 architecture due to its long convoluted history has to support both 8 16 32 and today 64bit operations natively and in general they re all equally fast they use basically the same hardware and just zero out the upper bits as needed

5069759
put	get
so i usually put the actions-of-cruding functionality in the controller of whatever view is presented at the time and populate my model layer depending on what i get back

5070005
ssl	https
you want to switch to the https protocol not specify the ssl port

5070016

1 create a new document pdfwriter with page margins matching the size height width of your header

5070199
quicksort	mergesort

naturally by lock-free i mean an implementation that makes no use of locking primitives in .net but rather uses interlocked operations atomic operations to achieve thread safety..

5070505
width	height
note that you can set the height and width values directly on the object tag

5070505

that particular site uses jquery fadein and fadeout to show an image an actual png of the tooltip like this

5070629
width	height
i create an error array and attempt to check the check sums for width and height

counting related entities without loading them will is already possible in code-first ctp5 final release will be called ef 4.1 when using dbcontext instead of objectcontext but not by direct interaction with collection

5070660
post	get
it works fine when you submit via post but on a get i receive an unhandled 404 error

5070693
superclass	subclassing
reason it is because the superclass has no idea what features did its subclassing add to itself while inheriting

5070693
superclass	subclassing
so this assignment of superclass object to subclassing reference is incorrect and futile

5070801
ubuntu	linux
following piece of code works on ubuntu 9.04 and not in ubuntu 10.04 with 2.6.32 linux kernel

5070848
button	checkbox

content-disposition	content-type
occasionally though rarely the content-type content-disposition and filename headers are missing from attachment headers

5070909
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ultimately just went with mouseenter mouseleave but i want to see what my problem is here for future purposes

5070922
textview	imageview
to use something other than textview for the array display for instance imageview or to have some of data besides tostring results fill the views override getview int view viewgroup to return the type of view you want

5070936
dictionary	map
from there you can access your tables and value with valueforkey in dictionary or objectatindex in arrays and then map it into your chosen local storage for which i recommend coredata or you could use sqlite if you are familiar with it too

5070970
ssl	https
ssl tls including https which is simply http over ssl tls do support client certificates and it is often referred to double sided ssl or ssl with client authentication

5070980
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning

i ve just refactored my application to get rid of a domain object layer because it was causing nhibernate s lazy loading to break - i spotted this using nhprof and put the blame on automapper

5071314
int	chars
if chars or short happen to be smaller than int on the current platform they are implicitly promoted to int which is a major source of bugs

5071314
int	chars
thus operations on chars short int are generally equally fast as the former ones are promoted to the latter

5071316
google-chrome	safari
i m not getting this style degradation in safari google-chrome

5071340
int	double
the idea is that the pointers in the array point to the nodes in the hash table or trie holding the string associated with the double while the int value with each string stores the index of the double paired with that string

5071370
apache	nginx
all apache nginx infrastructure considerations aside

5071374
innodb	myisam
the problem was that mysql was using myisam instead of innodb - rollbacks are not supported by myisam

i would love to post proper code but - noob that i am - i ve wasted about 20 minutes trying to get it to work with stackoverflow s code formatter and parts of it wouldn t show up

5071420
versioning	upgrade
also the python s versioning at work is 2.7.1 on my ubuntu box it s 2.6.6 but don t think my issue is related that i upgrade my work computer s python from 2.6 to 2.7 a few weeks ago without trouble

5071425
folder	directory
currently the hierarchy is flattened out and all the headers files are copied into a single headers directory no matter what subfolder they were in in my classes folder

5071431
mouse	keyboard
i use a similar system for capturing the mouse and mouse movement works smoothly and responsively so the problem must be in this automatic correction the keyboard is doing to prevent double taps

5071459
listview	gridview
there seems to be an answer here force resize of gridview columns inside listview

5071486

fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
also if you just want to blindly concat files you don t need to read line by line just open a fileinputstream read chunks into a byte and write using a fileoutputstream

5071915
clang	llvm
when porting this codebase to use clang llvm it certainly doesn t do the same thing

5071949
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
the additional overhead incurred by finding a suitable projection plane should still be smaller than the overhead incurred when using more complex operations such as sqrt or sin cos functions i guess i could use lookup tables for sin cos but this would increase the memory footprint and defeats the purpose of this assignment

5071949
min	max
my first attempts found the delta between the min max values on each axis of the polygon then eliminated the axis with the smallest delta

5071973
folder	directory
directory and related subdirectories and display allowed roles for each web page and folder directory

5072022

5072024
super	implements
check out swipeview within this project it does exactly what you want it to do and is super simple to implements

5072064
pthreads	fork
your use of the word fork suggests to me that you are approaching windows threading from a pthreads background

5072066
getattr	kwargs
return getattr trans real_name args kwargs

5072081
put	get
when i put the result in a variable and echo it i don t get any output

free	malloc
and also check in your main if initialize returns 0 or not aka if malloc succeeded or failed and if the return value was not 0 make sure you free the memory

5072288
innodb	myisam
you should switch your table storage engine from myisam to innodb

5072288
innodb	myisam
innodb provides row-locking as opposed to myisam s table-locking meaning while one query is busy updating or inserting a row another query can update a different row at the same time

5072316
udp	tcp
is there a reason you ve chosen udp over tcp

5072319

again it s not really practical unless you ve stored the complete sorted list of interests as a string and you re prepare to execute a separate query for every subset of your list of gifts

5072710
min	max
i m clearly not understanding the min max concept

5072710
min	max
if i change from min to max it changes the returned timestamp but it never brings the status info from that record

width	height
clip image height and width if browser window is smaller than image size

5072758
interpolation	splines
i own the reasonably popular text book numerical recipes in c which has their own implementation of cubic splines interpolation but found this to be unsuitable due to use of custom headers and remapping of array indicies use of custom vectors etc the gnu scientific library gsl also does similar

5072779
button	checkbox
but that would style all input elements text boxes button radio button checkbox

5072797
implements	extends
let s now extends to something not already implements in corelib such as cyclically assigning value from a given array to each enumerable element say for colouring table rows

5072802
textwrangler	bbedit
i ve also seen people speak well of subethaedit bbedit smultron and textwrangler that s weighted toward mac apps since that s what i use normally.

5072971
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
npapi for google-chrome firefox opera

5072976
nsstring	nsdata
as zebs has already pointed out you can only store plist-able objects into nsuserdefaults nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdata nsdate and nsnumber

5072991
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
edit regarding your update i would just use bufferedreader and bufferedwriter and leave it to the jvm to optimise reads writes i would do the replacements in a streaming fashion

5073003
hide	show
these tabs show hide divs when clicked

5073003
setinterval	clearinterval
would i use setinterval to have it run the first tab ajax call every 30 seconds then when the other tab is clicked a function is called to run clearinterval on the id the first setinterval was running

5073004
min	max
sure you are working with min or max and only one at a time but consider this query

5073013
post	get
after every page turn a rest api uses a get request to post the progress data to a web server

5073032
post	get
in your case storing u m records to track unread post where u is the number of users and m is the number of messages would get out of control very very quickly

5073038
post	get
my suggestion is to not do so because the second that header is launched you will not see the url and it be better for you to just pass it as a get statement or a post

5073053
nexus	artifactory
to strictly control what artifacts get downloaded you can use a repository manager such as apache archiva artifactory or nexus to intervene as well as add several interesting features

5073181
free	malloc
is it possible that linux malloc free have changes so this isn t possible anymore

5073183
int	double
as above you could use float instead of double and you could cast the results to an int if you don t require the precision of the float like so

5073192
move	drag

webkit	gecko
that works great on webkit and fails on gecko - the latter informs me that getelementsbyname is undefined

5082374
uiview	subviews
since both uiview and ivars retain then the objects would have 2 in retain-count when view receives memory-warning then the uiview will release the subviews but they still have +1 in retain count so i have to setself.myivar nil

5082376
integer	unsigned
also there s a modified version of this check to determine if some positive unsigned integer is a power of 2

width	height
use its cresolution nested class to set the screen resolution to a new height and width

5082683
width	height
but understand that doing this will only work for height width combinations the display actually supports 800x600 1024x768 etc not 817x435

5082705
width	height
it tells you the width and height x and y offset in pixels without taking into account the scaling of the element

5082736
children	parent
i think the problem with your first approach is that you are keeping the values in the parent s viewstate but never reading the values back in from the children

5082758
post	get
i have had success calling a function within the ror app via a get but i would like to do it using a post

5082779
post	get
now the problem is that in other browsers then firefox i get the needed results via post if unchecked 0 if checked 1 but in firefox for both cases i get 0 i know that this is because of that hidden field

5082789

if you are planning on reassigning myusefulregistry you will obviously have to omit the final modifiers and also implements state based on the type parameter by storing it to use again

5083070
width	height
its really your css at fault here you need to define an area div with dimensions like height width that match your input form and then it should not be deformed in the manner you see right now

5083077
width	height
give each image a defined height and width in your new css classes

5083077

fourth line sets the links to block elements which means they will take up all of the li s width then i set the text-align to center which centers everything inside the

5083123
put	get	post	get	post	put
if you want to avoid those messages which warn the user about resending post and you also want to have multiple proper pages rather than just different steps in javascript you can put the answers in the url as get parameters

submit	submission
i d recommend you to use javascript add a custom handler for form submission and submit form content via ajax and then load the next form on ajax complete

5083133
implements	extends
to sum it up you can either extends the component in this case the vaadin button and have the subclass implements comparable or you can use an itemsorter

5083150
width	height
i can tell you what i d do each item in the linearlayout would have a background set with a width of match_parent and a height of wrap_content using a 9patch with the right-pointing arrow inside it

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in other words google-chrome and opera are doing it correctly ftr firefox 3.6.13 does the same thing as opera

5083252
width	height
css without the help of javascript cannot calculate dimensions in that manner but if your li s were floated within a ul with no height limit and a constant width then your tabs would populate left to right and top to bottom

5083294
stdout	fflush
the solution is to either add a n to the end of the very first printf or call fflush stdout

5083305
for-loop	arrays
i m having some variables in my hash of multidimensional arrays disappear as soon as i leave a for-loop

5083305
put	get
so to get the data from the mlid 7202 from the 7th person and the 4th column in excel i should put longhash 7202 7 1 because i mapped the 4th column to the 1th value of the array.

multiple view controllers can be stacked in a uinavigationcontroller or a uitabbarcontroller but other than that you should only have one uiviewcontroller

5083518
google-chrome	safari
just as an aside you should be able to confirm that this is what s happening by looking at the response headers using either firebug or safari google-chrome s developer tools

5083523
put	get
if you have lots of items in the hundreds of thousands it s probably faster to use a min heap after you get the counts the idea being that you put the first n items into the min heap and then only insert an item if its count is larger than the smallest item in the min heap

5083524
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
my problem is that i use a for-loop to loops through the arrays of particles each game tick to update that particles state

5083524
for-loop	loops
my problem is however that the for-loop loops through all the particles in one go each tick and all the particles are updated simultaneously and therefore drawn on top of each other giving the illusion that there is only 1 particle on the screen

5083529
division	multiplication
a solution in this case would be to first perform the multiplication which gives you just 9 digits and then the division

the int and chars types may be different sizes

5083775
put	get
put the alert in the callback and it will work provided you get a valid response

5083880
post	get
secondly and maybe this is the reason i get an error saying the entitycollection has already been initialized when i try to post the consultant object if using it as a model in the view and the cause of the error seems to be the collections of objects such as workexperiences

5083922
post	get
also you need to query the stream table to get the wall post then check if you have attachments and the type of the attachment

5083956

plot	heatmap
i would like to cluster a matrix with kmeans and be able to plot it as heatmap

5084108
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
then you would know that you could use the built in iphone navigation controllers ie uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller without their standard view counterparts ie uitabbar uinavigationbar

5084190
hide	show
the message might be a keystroke send the enter key or the space bar to a window but it might also be a command to close the window wm_close a command to alter the window hide it show it minimize it alter its title etc. a request for information within the window getting the title getting text within a text box etc. and so on

5084216
for-loop	arrays
for an arrays using an old-fashioned for-loop with an index is probably the sensible thing to do particularly since you often need to know what the index is anyway

serializable	deserialization
i think its must be due to serializable deserialization

5084385
int	double
sometimes it will crash sometimes the result will be long sometimes the result will be double or decimal sometimes the int will wrap around

5084385
int	double
if the compiler would have added an int and a double to produce a double then the runtime will add an int and a double to produce a double

5084422

you add as a sublayer the tiledlayer that draws the pdf page cgcontextdrawpdfpage to a uiview and then you add that as a subviews to a uiscrolview

5084483
int	double
all others get messed up data int gets value 48464 instead of 2 string showing odd signs double is -3.16...e-161 instead of 20...

you have base class interface called ithankyou that implements common methods and two classes extends base functionality

5085149
profiling	debugging
the build section of your properties has an output path which is set to bin debugging if you are using this profiling

5085157
implements	extends
for decently sized projects i ve been told that when you have classes extends jpanels that the best practice is to use nested classes to implements the listeners

5085157
implements	extends
for example i could have a class factoryscreen that extends jpanel and have a nested class factoryscreenbrain that implements all the necessary listeners

5085157
implements	extends
i ve never been able to get a good explanation for specific benefits or disadvantages to encapsulating my classes in this fashion and until now have always just had classes that both extends jpanel and implements listeners

5085158
free	malloc
your code correctly does use malloc and free but the way that you re doing so makes the implementation more complicated than is necessary

5085158
free	malloc
now that child is locally-scoped to the loop the memory management will be handled automatically without any need to call malloc or free

5085178
awt	swing
what comes closer is to create a screen capture of the awt component while a swing component is to be shown above and eventually refresh the screen capture now and then

5085192
distance	polygons
once you ve got the polygons points you can just do a distance calculation on each segment

5085203
vim	emacs
i suggest using the editor or visual environment variables people set those to preferred editors for programs to use ie if someone prefers emacs and can t even exit vim they won t get confused

draggable	droppable
i have put all the droppable in a container and simply want to be able to detect when the draggable is hovering over the container of droppables.

5085210
mouseleave	mouseenter
so my next approach was to in the drag start callback do an event listener for mouseenter and mouseleave on the container-- and then stop listening on the drag stop callback.

5085210
mouseleave	mouseenter
when dragging the box to the red dropzone you should see enter when the mouseenter event fires and leave when mouseleave happens

5085215
implements	extends
i think that anything is better than having a class extends a swing component and implements a listener as it gives the class too much disparate responsibilities and sets one up for creating the dreaded switch-board listeners

5085317
hide	show
next up we hide the map initially so that it s not show until we fire up our fancybox

5085329
windows	wow64

the super keyword keeps the receiver self the same but just skips over the current class when resolving that message to a particular implementation

5085501
x86	64bit
i have no particular knowledge of sqlite but this is indicative of a problem where two 32-bit words of a 64bit ieee 754 format double are swapped over as you can see in this example which was run using gcc on an x86 machine

you seem to be using the itemlistener class properly but when i saw that it takes two clicks to select a button that was an obvious sign of awt swing mixing painting problems

5087536
pull	push
if your table is variable length you need to either maintain arrays of uilabel and switch or you can also subclass uitableviewcell note that you can provide a custom interface for a uitableviewcell via nib without having to necessarily subclass you don t mention whether you ve subclassed or not hook up the switch event to go to your uitableviewcell subclass then read the corresponding label and or forward the event to the uitableview subclass this is a push model rather than the pull model sometimes this organization is easier to manage than trying to maintain arrays of objects in your uitableviewcell that track objects in individual uitableviewcells

5087563

5088054
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

5088054
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

5088054

int	chars
int 10 is 32-bit chars 36 is 36 - byte 288-bit

5091110

the most common ftp operations that a client will initiate include downloading files get files from the server and uploading files put files on the server

5094707
hide	show
it contains various controls to allow the user to show hide sections or sort rows in tables

5094762
pull	push
so this would be workaround number 1 don t let them push have them fork and then pull from them

5094762
pull	push
this is a combination of the two other approaches have one repository that your collaborators can push to and another one that only you have access to that you pull into from the first repository

5094839
implements	extends
the answer is because you can implements multiple interfaces but can t extends multiple abstract classes

5094856
pop-up	dialog
apply the dialog class to your modal pop-up panel and supply the dialog-bkg class in the backgroundcssclass property of the modalpopupextender

5094899
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome firefox

5094957
packets	pcap
a udp packets stream arrives at machine x which is running two programs - one which is listening for the packets with recv and another which is running pcap

5094957
packets	pcap
in this case as i understand it the packets are stored in the interface until it is polled by the kernal which then moves them into a buffer in the kernals memory and copies the packets into another two buffers - one buffer for the program listening with recv and one buffer for the program listening with pcap

5094988
google-chrome	firefox
i only need to support latest firefox and google-chrome so ie8 isn t an issue

5095030
public	protected
just create a new temporary app that makes all protected private internal functions public plug that into nunit run the tests there and then go back to using the private functions for the release version

5095073
many-to-one	one-to-many
the parent to child is a one-to-many while the child to parent is a many-to-one

5095083
post	get
note you are specifying to use get on your controller method so you can configure a specific post method to be able to receive both get and post form restfull methods something like this

5095090
yelp	zillow
all the other iframed ummapped contents yelp schools zillow stats etc appears correctly

5095110
nunit	moles
secondly if by testing purposes you mean a framework like nunit you might want to check out microsoft moles which allows you to substitute any static method call with your own custom implementation while testing

5095150
typemock	moles
sorry can t give you specifics on the problems i faced - typemock was definitely more powerful to use as it is a lot older and mature - pex moles is fun though i found the tutorial for sharepoint rather nice unit testing sharepoint foundation with microsoft pex and mole

5095161
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox etc the execution runs fast and fine

5095189
post	get
there was an extra newline character inserted which has no means in get requests but matters in post ones

5095219
move	drag
i m working on a small cocoa utility that lets the user drag files onto its window and then move those to a different folder

5095241
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that when i add new lines in firefox and google-chrome the new lines are completely ignored by the form submission process and they never get passed through into the _post array

5095253
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works normally without lag but in firefox it s slow

5095263
button	checkbox
plus anything else like whether a bit or boolean should be represented by a checkbox or a yes no dropdown or a radio button

5095272
integer	unsigned
the variable type uint32_t is an unsigned 32-bit integer data type defined according to the so-called c99 standard

5095275
google-chrome	firefox
i have my site and it looks great on firefox sf ie8 but on google-chrome it shows a blank page but if you click on view source it is there

5095298
portrait	landscape
when in portrait mode it scrolls fine but when in landscape even if i set an arbitrary value let s say 1400px it doesn t really scroll along that size removing around 400 pixels and it stops before the content is fully visible

5095336
mouse	keyboard
edit ie behaves differently if the select is focused with the mouse or keyboard

5095336
mouse	keyboard
when focused with the mouse keyboarding through options does not fire onchange but when tabbing to focus it via keyboard the onchange does fire when arrowing through

5095359
uiview	subviews
inside the xib i have a uiview and 3 subviews 2 lables and a button

5095399
prepare	execute
i finally found the problem and it was that psqlodbc s sqlprepare sqlexecute by default doesn t execute a prepare execute

5095414
singleton	facade
facade singleton is only responsible for receiving packets and passing it on to the processing it does not wait for processing complete event

5095443
hide	show
hide the wrapper element show the content element using jquery fade

5095446
width	height
i created a standard uitableviewcell however i altered the frame of the cell to my own custom frame of 1000 width by 50 height catered to my needs for project

5095465
for-loop	loops
if you observe the two for loops each for-loop gives an o n because each loops is incrementing decrementing in a linear fashion

5095494
width	height
however wpf will call canexecute on the button s command before the imagescrollviewer control is necessarily laid out rendered - so there is no actual width height

5095500
int	chars
in the general case of assigning an int value to a chars object the compiler doesn t know whether the int is out of range of the chars

5095500
int	chars
a narrowing conversion like int to chars if int has a larger range than chars yields some implementation-defined conversion

5095515
implements	extends
you can t do this with interfaces but you can implements multiple interfaces extends only one parent class

5095525
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
from reading various blogs and staying somewhat updated i ve read about libraries similar to backbone.js and javascriptmvc which both sound like good alternatives in order to make the code more modular and separated

5095550
disk	ram
the underlying assumption is that the limit to the life of a disk is how many disk seeks there are while ram has a fixed cost for its size and a fixed lifetime regardless of how often it is accessed

5095550
disk	ram
what they are trying to find is the break even point between where it is cheaper to keep data on disk or in ram

5095550
disk	ram
if you re processing large data sets and don t want to pay to keep it all in ram then you will be streaming data to from disk

5095568
google-chrome	firefox
here is the code i have this is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7

5095600
nstableview	nstabview
i have an nstableview bound to the parent entities arraycontroller on the first tab of an nstabview

5095600
nstableview	nstabview
the second tab of the nstabview has another nstableview which is bound to the child entities arraycontroller

5095600
children	parent
what i m trying to do is allow the user to select an entity from the list of parent then switch tabs and work with the list of children

5095600
children	parent
what s happening is that if i start the app with an empty storedata file i can add parent but cannot add children

5095600
children	parent
if i add some parent then restart the app i can add children

5095600
children	parent
the list of children however doesn t seem to be filtered by which parent is selected on the first tab

5095607
direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	gdi	gdi	direct2d
you can use gdi + opengl direct3d direct2d as well if you re using vista 7

5095654
put	get
beyond that i would put some more thought into how i was getting to these nested loops in the first place and try to get rid of as many as possible

5095657
public	protected
for completeness here is a copy of gaurav s answer using visibility modifiers private protected public

5095663
post	get
i haven t tried this yet but if you re creating pages on the remote wiki whose url you know then it looks as if the way to do it is described in which says that you need to get an edit token and then post with the token your page contents etc

5095698
free	malloc
then you ve free it and asked for another buffer and malloc happens to have handed you the same memory again this time containing the values you left in it

5095744
actionscript	mxml
the way it works is the mxml is compiled into intermediary as3 then that as3 along with any other as files are compiled into actionscript bytecode abc and that is all linked up into a swf file

5095749
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
see graphaã l - scalable vector charts that work in firefox safari google-chrome opera and even internet explorer 6+

5095788
sudo	passwd
another solution if you really can t use sudo with nopasswd is connect via ssh using the user credentials user passwd with paramiko

5095816
width	height
i mentioned width 1800 height 1800 for usercontrol in mainpage.xaml

5095849
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
if it does compile then your next step would be to open the file you want to transfer on the server with a fileinputstream and a new file for writing on the client with fileoutputstream

5095858
getter	setter
when i have marshaling issues with simple types i tend to create an extra getter and possibly setter to simplify it

5095867
post	get
i m attempting to upload a file asynchronously using http post and jquery but i m running into a strange issue i can t get the right callback to fire

5095879

5095944
ubuntu	linux
the following code succeeds on a 32-bit machine but fails with a segmentation fault on a 64-bit machine linux ubuntu

5095978
int	double
if the second parameter were rewritten as a _tp c++ s built-in implicit type conversion would cast the int to a double and your code would compile

5095999
backbone.js	javascriptmvc	sproutcore	javascriptmvc	sproutcore	cappuccino	cappuccino	javascriptmvc
both backbone.js and javascriptmvc are great examples of using a framework to organize large projects in a sane way sproutcore and cappuccino are nice too

5096019
daemons	launchd
launchd a daemons process for each user having access to this application

5096057
versioning	upgrade
as an additional caveat due to the legacy nature of the system we canâ t upgrade to a later versioning of python so we canâ t utilize the improved memory performance of 2.5

5096097
width	height
you re changing the width and height on the xaml only you need to think about the browser object declaration as well if you re using de basic project template you ve the object declaration with width and height declared as 100

5096098
mouse	keyboard
using the mouse in an emulator is very different to a touchscreen - i had levels in my game that were easy in the emulator with mouse keyboard but incredibly difficult on the actual device

5096100
maven	pom.xml
if you don t want to add the repository reference directly in your pom.xml you can add it in maven s settings file

5096107
weblogic	oc4j
in the oc4j to weblogic conversion doc the jsp-cache-directory setting is described that unlike the jsp-cache-directory configuration in oc4j this directory is not relevant for tlds and later on that unlike oc4j tld caching cannot be disabled with a deployment descriptor element.

5096107
weblogic	oc4j
all of the documentation that i can find points to the old oc4j documentation and not the new weblogic docs

5096162
backtracking	greedy
the problem with this routine is that while it actually does a pretty good job parsing email addresses it also is not very efficient since regex is greedy and the terminating condition which is supposed to match things like .com and .edu will overshoot then need to backtracking costing considerable cpu time

5096174
devise	cancan
i have an app i m writing in rails 3 w cancan and devise

5096201
crypt	hash
so we need to crypt hash the cookie in some way

5096201
hash	salt
so when you process a login and the username and password is correct and the rememeber me option is checked in addition to saving the username in the session you store a hash of the username password and some salt if you will in a cookie you send to the user

5096201
salt	md5
you might like plain md5 or sha salt md5 or sha better or some time-consuming method like blowfish recommended

5096201
hash	md5
to hash the cookie i ve used plain md5 but you may choose any of the method described early

5096211
layoutparams	viewgroup
layoutparams is a class inherited from the viewgroup class which is the super class of gridview

5096266
subtraction	addition
comparisons and addition and subtraction with -0.f give the same result as they would with +0.f in the default rounding mode

5096458
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
progress-bar in firefox google-chrome safari

5096468
required	placeholder
per the extended question in the comment this would allow you to put your format in something that required a placeholder and store the aforementioned version of thetimeformat in the db

5096476
uiview	subviews
add a single top-level view if it doesn t have one already as your main view and add your other custom elements uilabels and uiimageviews as subviews of the main uiview

5096476
uiview	subviews
what this does is loads the view hierarchy from your nib into the nsarray and since you only had one top-level uiview you just add that as a subviews of your custom uiview

5096476
iboutlet	ibaction
buttontest.xib change file s owner class to buttontest and link up all iboutlet and ibaction

5096487
postgresql	mysql
after busting my brain on this problem for a week and looking at various databases mongodb neo4j mysql postgresql i have only found a few possible solutions

5096489
emacs	kate
personally i like using a plain old editor emacs vi kate etc. and a terminal window

5096534
daemon	cron
2 i want the scripts to run in the background almost like a daemon or cron job and for the page to load telling the user the details are retrieved and will be available shortly

5096603
width	height
when you animate the height or width the usercontrol tells its children also to readjust that is the way the layout system works in wpf

5096614
ienumerable	ilist
also it is often nicer to use ienumerable instead of ilist when possible

5096618
move	drag
in a dream world i d like to somehow embed imagebuttons within the image and have the image and imagebuttons scale and move with the drag zoom

5096630
spaces	delimiter
key value delimiter is equal to sign with one white spaces leading and trailing

5096689
memcached	apc
i mention apc but it ll work for memcached too

5096702
web.py	bottle	django	web.py
the framework is also designed to be simple along the lines of web.py or bottle without some of the more complex setup of web frameworks like django

5096728
swt	swing
the dj native swing project and dj sweet project have several html editors including ckeditor implemented using the swt browser and they all use this technique

5096748
getter	setter
values returned from getter setter functions

5096752
inherited	properties
from my recollection on this test system when documents were uploaded as a specific site content type that inherited from document and metadata was provided we could search for specific metadata by making managed properties for each and search results would be returned as documents with the isdocument flag set to true

5096775
splash	homescreen
this includes doing things like attaching a special icon to use on the homescreen styling the iphone s status bar removing the browser chrome like the url bar and incorporating a splash screen

5096870
post	get
our iis was returning an internal server error when trying to execute a jquery to get some html content due to pagehandlerfactory was restricted to respond only get head post debug verbs

i have been developing a game with opengl-es for android and have a glsurfaceview displayed

5096923
int	chars
if the user gives some string or chars instead of int

5096940
accessor	properties
they are the accessor for the public properties name

5096956
wav	riff
often however wav files are a lot more complicated than this and require much more elaborate code to locate the various riff chunks and parse the file

5096971
gmail	hotmail
unfortunately it seems that my email is triggering spam filters gmail hotmail probably others and not making it to the users inboxes

5096998
post	put
this worked out great for me the post was awesome and i simply modified the perl to put in a datestamp like thus

5097013
mouse	keyboard
it is much more harder than what you think because input macro programs produce legit mouse and keyboard input messages to your game

5097013
mouse	keyboard
i don t think there is a way to check if the input message is actually triggered by a physical hardware input like mouse or keyboard unless os provides you with accessibility of input-driver-level

5097017
hash	salt
since you should only know the salt hash of the password you probably want to make the user reset their password instead

5097041
ubuntu	debian
on two other machines one ubuntu one debian i have tried to use this package and the classpath is not being set by the .jpackage call

5097059
mdpi	hdpi
make sure you have an mdpi and an hdpi version if you test on different densities

5097059
mdpi	hdpi
if you put your 9patch in res drawable for instance it will be treated as an mdpi asset and scaled up automatically on hdpi devices nexus s

5097143
width	height
when the scrollview is positioned at the last page and the user changes the orientation the os scrolls the uiscrollview a few pixels back to compensate for the difference between height and width

5097181
jobs	cron
as for linux yes cron jobs is your answer

5097184
post	get
it cannot use the jquery ajax post or get methods

5097193
hash	salt
store the salt and resulting hash

5097211
dumpsys	adb
using the the adb shell dumpsys meminfo command i could see that the allocated native heap grew whilst switching activities until it approached 16m when it crashed

5097211
dumpsys	adb
adb shell dumpsys meminfo relevant pid gives

5097217
width	height
firefox won t let you create a window of less than 100 pixels in height or width

5097225
hide	show
my assumption is that my usercontrol should know how to slide itself into view and out of view this control is basically a glorified input dialog so it will be told to show it self externally but only it will know when it hide itself

5097234
google-chrome	firefox
edit it works in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie

5097239
getter	setter
by not referencing the property with self you are bypassing the properties auto generated setter and getter

5097264
daemon	cron
you could build a script and let it run as a daemon and perform certain tasks on a set interval but that s actually just simulating cron .

5097264
daemon	cron
there is also a great comparison between daemon and cron inthere worth the read

5097282
dlsym	dlopen
one of the things this application does is search for shared libraries on specific paths and then loads classes out of them dynamically using the posix dlopen and dlsym calls

5097282
redhat	fedora
i ve confirmed that it works on fedora 12 redhat 5.5 and redhawk 5.1 using gcc versions 4.1.2 and 4.4.4

5097288
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox google-chrome but ie the slide show arrow buttons move to the left

5097321
width	height
try adjusting oob settings width 1 height 1

5097321
width	height
i also found that when restoring the window position you have to set the width and height first then top and left

5097331
button	checkbox
this answer doesn t treat radio button as checkbox users really don t like that and attempts to provide a slightly more realistic scenario

5097338
google-chrome	safari
in webkit what google-chrome or safari uses debug tools click the scripts section on the top

5097383
gmp	bigint
knowledge of how gmp works what it does and of general bigint division algorithms so i was able to understand much of your argument

5097401
for-loop	arrays
you can fill the arrays with a nested for-loop

5097433
post	get
a good restful practice is to post to jobs get a 202 accepted with a content-location header pointing to the running job

5097437
gitolite	gitosis
the other classic way to restrict push access to a repo or a branch or even a directory is by using gitolite which actually is a big evolution of gitosis

5097438
filesystems	ntfs
vhds that have been compressed by ntfs or encrypted using encrypting filesystems on the host volume are not supported for native boot

5097481
pop-up	dialog
also in my case i used the fb js sdk to pop-up dialog that would log the user into facebook then my serverside code was simply checking to make sure the user is logged in and then calling graphy apis to get information which i use on the server

5097508
put	get
if you don t put in a lot of tricky type declarations just right you don t get any speedup

5097529
goto	break
for example here s what a nested break might look like in c assuming you re willing to ignore dijkstra s advice and use goto

5097542
post	get
it may be worth noting my http post is correct i know because if i post to the http version of clientlogin rather than the https one i get the http 302 moved temporarily error page

5097542
dataoutputstream	inputstream
my httpoperations class is built using httpurlconnection class in java i then set the headers and method of this httpurlconnection accordingly and open a dataoutputstream to write my post request i then open an inputstream to retrieve the response

5097544
gridview	detailsview
now the application gets the read data from a gridview but when i attempt to get the detailsview with edit permission it fails

5097547
post	get
you could also append the variable to the form s action value but that would be passing that param via get instead of post

5097547
post	get
without a hidden input appended to the form prior to allowing the default browser submit action there is no way to access the raw post data of the http request before it s been submitted - it s a chicken before the egg dilemma - what you re intending to do is change the http post data headers that get sent to the next page but the only way that data exists prior to the browser posting the data to the next page is by having the input tags embedded within the form element

5097561
lisp	scheme
now the thing is i kind of suck at emacs-lisp i don t really use any lisp except scheme and in scheme mit this works

5097589
min	max
re 2 you just need to find the number of days between max booking_start period_start and min booking_end period_end inclusive

5097605
getter	setter
the only way i can think of enforcing this would be to have a cararray class that has getter setter etc

5097626
for-loop	loops
you re putting the condition in the for-loop instead of an if inside of loops hence if it s not met even once it breaks out of the entire loops

5097650
for-loop	loops
first you are setting i as n-1 so it would be 4 if n is 5 then your condition on the for-loop states that i must be odd which 4 is not so it doesn t even do one loops

5097663
for-loop	loops
after it goes into the second for-loop it doesn t go back to the first loops instead it ends the program

5097674
pull	push
using eclipse you can push and pull files to the emulator using the ddms perspective

5097674
pull	push
the sdk tools will also provide a way of push and pull via the command line

5097686
hide	show
i have a site and in the home page i have an embedded youtube video the div that is containing the player is initially hidden display none so when a button video is clicked i hide the content of the page and show the youtube player all works ok but i would love that when the button video is clicked the player show up and start to reproduce the video automatically but i ve faild in each attempt i m using a code that i find in other web and made some changes

5097819
width	margin
every mousemove event i calculate the new left margin the slider spans 100 width of the screen

5097833
subtract	add
then subtract and add the semi_diurnal_arc acos cos_omega which is based

5097866
int	boolean	int	chars
in typical implementations boolean byte chars short and int will be 32-bits always on the stack while long will be 64-bits on the stack

5097866
int	chars
in typical implementations bytes chars shorts int and longs will be their native size in arrays that is 8 16 16 32 and 64-bit respectively

5097882
portrait	landscape
these later calls came simply from rotating to landscape and then back to portrait so it s definitely the same detail view controller as well

5097906
openni	kinect
openni comes with some tools nite that do skeleton tracking and some gesture recognition for you if you plan to program for the kinect

5097938
google-chrome	firefox
browsers like firefox and google-chrome and smart enough to render there issue correctly but its still a good idea to have valid code

5097974
rss	feed
i d prefer setting up an rss feed for your articles on sitea and pulling them in with an existing library nice and tidy and means others can get your articles via rss too

5097983
width	height
the bitmap is of width m and height array.max - array.min

5098006
super	self
assigning the result of super init back to self is a standard objective-c convention

5098006
super	self
so it s self super init

5098023
width	height
this is a cross-browser way for setting minimum width and or mimimum height

5098023
width	height
ie 6 sees width height 200px overwriting auto

5098044
lisp	scheme
keep in mind elisp isn t scheme or even common lisp

5098052
width	height
run a draw call of type gl_points and size equal to the width height of your source fbo

5098131
width	height
0 0 width 0 0 height width height

5098131
width	height
which would width 2 height 2 in image coordinates

5098185
addition	multiplication
i would like to be able to do some basic math with the copied text such as multiplication or addition but i can t figure out how to assign the clipboard data to a variable

5098213
selecteditem	selectedindex
i ve tried setting selectedvalue to null setting selecteditem to null setting the selectedindex to -1 and even tried calling the unselectall method

5098253
ftp	smb
if the ftp folder has an smb share name use that to get to it but it s likely not shared since it s purpose is for ftp access not smb access

5098274
gridview	repeater
i want to have a number of these little progress bars in a gridview or repeater so i can t use position absolute

5098298
udp	tcp

as mapped your relationship does not use any transitive persistence that is to say you have not told hibernate that when you save the parent you want to save the children

5099972

inline	inlining
very often classes providing trivial functions use the two forms of expected-inlined function definitions inside class or with inline keyword if those functions can be expected to be called inside any performance-critical loops but the countering consideration is that by inlining a function you force client code to be recompiled relatively slow possibly no automated trigger and relinked fast for shared libraries happens on next execution rather than just relinked in order to pick up changes to the function implementation

5100532
post	get

5108312
client-side	server-side
but basically if you wanted to use client-side code to populate and manage the contents of a a grid that is based on a large server-side database you ll be running ajax queries from the client for every event that needs new data such as paging and rebuilding repopulating the grid

when your query requires parameterization or when the same query must be compiled and execute repeatedly then you ll benefit from the prepare statement

5108742
ant	maven
this approach works for all ant plug-ins most of which are available in the central maven repository

5108742
versioning	upgrade
the second benefit is that it s easy to upgrade the plug-in versioning across all builds

5108752
cout	cin
when you use std cin it knows how to tell std cout to flush the buffer before the input starts so you don t have to

5108858

because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

5108858
integer	unsigned
so it s well defined what will happen when you try to overflow an unsigned integer

5108858
cpu	processors
at a slightly different level the cpu might issue traps if it cannot carry out the operation the operation specified memory location that does not exist or tries to do some illegal operation division by zero or encounters an op code the processors does not understand or tries to do unaligned access to data

5108864
ubuntu	linux
it should work on linux ubuntu

5108872
httpresponse	request
plus adding to the querystring on the request won t affect your httpresponse and i m assuming that s what you want to do

5108915
cpu	processors
the addition operation is processed inside the processors afaik so whatever you do the add operation will be done inside the cpu in the alu more precisely

i ve tried decoding the nsdata to nsstring using some examples i ve found but none could solve this problem

5109277
uiview	subviews
if you use a custom uiview subclass in your program this method can be used to do custom subviews layout instead of relying on cocoa s default autoresizing methods

5109302
int	chars
the table has varchar chars smallint int and float columns

5109303
children	parent
the parent needs to be able to have multiple children so this isn t going to work

to dynamically add children objects to a form with the proper html so that they would be auto bound to the parent when passed to the control method meaning i needed html like this

5109631
children	parent
i just wrapped my editor template in a div so it can be easily grabbed as a whole from jquery cloned it emptied the values of the inputs and incremented the counter for each element so when posted i get a collection of children entities on my parent without having to explicitly catch them in the method or pull them from the formcollection dictionary

5109631
children	parent
also if the form errors since the parent object has the multiple children they get auto rendered automatically by my form code and nothing is lost because of client side additions

5109657
for-loop	loops
i left the inner loops in place but changed it to a for-loop since that makes all the control happen in one place

5109658
rubygems	bundler
the other thing i noticed is this the line means that the environment is already being loaded--this includes rails all rubygems you re using rails 3 which uses bundler sqlite3 assuming it s in your gemfile and you ve run bundle install to generate your gemfile.lock and all your models

5109823
entity-relationship	diagram
if an employee can have many projects and a project can have many employees it is a many-to-many join that rdbm s can only represent easily in one way the way you have outlined above. you can see in the entity-relationship diagram below employee departments is one of the classic many-to-many examples that it does not have a separate entity-relationship component

5109823
entity-relationship	diagram
here they do not event bother with a separate box although they add in later at this step it is a pure entity-relationship diagram

5109857
post	get
data is transferred between the device and server via http post and get

5109864
sse	avx
it uses sse and avx specific code but i don t think it will be hard to turn it into standard c loops

5109912
put	get
maybe strings aren t the right way of visualising it maybe it s better to think of i don t know a bunch of queues servers in an airport airport staff replicators moving people from queue to queue according to certain rules and put yourself into the mind of someone trying to skip the queue ie somehow get into a queue before someone who s ahead of them in their current queue

5109912
queue	fifo
or maybe there s some way of expliaining it as a towers of hanoi type game although with fifo queue instead of lifo stacks

5109913
mpmedialibrary	mpmediaquery
the only way for now i found is to check lastmodificationdate of mpmedialibrary - as long as it s changing you won t get results using mpmediaquery - delay your changes to a moment when that property stops changing by any way you like and you should be fine

5109945
subtract	add
if all you want is how many items in the set are in common with each other you could find the cardinality of a and b add the cardinalities together and subtract from the cardinality of the union of a and b

5109956

min	max
to order results by value you can end a sql query with order by column_name desc in order to get the results returned in max - min order of that column

5110137
min	max
you can replace desc with asc to get it to go in min - max order

5110153
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and or google-chrome may be silently ignoring this but it s not valid

5110224
int	chars
instead you should get the length of the varchar or the hard-coded length of the chars field and pass that to the readchars int method

5110257
getter	setter
you could add the beanproperty annotation to generate getter setter and then declare a method to guard for null

5110271
filtering	grouping
this is not spam or commercial for software companies there are very nice grids and report engines done at least by devexpress and telerik among many others which would enable you to filtering sort grouping and much more your data and export as pdf xls html and so on with really no much code

5110288

5110489
min	max
i also let the boxplots determine the chart min and max values

5110489
median	max	min	median	min	max
from what i ve gathered when showoutliers is disabled the api expects the values array to be passed as min value 1st quartile value median value 3rd quartile value and max value

5110495

mousemove	mousehover
you could handle mousemove events instead of mousehover

5110960
int	double
you wouldn t expect a method of double to appear on int just because int is convertible to double. we then look at the base type and find that system.array implements ienumerable with a public method so we ve found our getenumerator

5110960
put	get
next time you design a type system put generics in v1 and make sure you get strong collection types nullable types and non-nullable types baked in to the framework from the beginning

nsmanagedobject does not implement the nscoder protocol so managed objects cannot be serialized

5111301
put	get

quite the opposite getter and setter are one of the cornerstones of oop where such side effects are desired

5121200
getter	setter
getter or setter by themselves are not bad oo design

5121200
getter	setter
what is bad is coding practice which includes a getter and a setter for every single member automatically whether that getter setter is needed or not coupled with making members public which should not be public - because this basically exposes class s implementation to outside world violating the information hiding abstraction

generate loop in verilog vhdl describes multiple parallel instances of a same hardware building block say a and logic gate

5121853

verilog	vhdl
one must really be aware of these differences in order to become a good verilog vhdl programmer

prepare	execute
any place you need your database to run a query or execute prepare statements you use the singleton instance

5123495
geocoding	geocode
the recommended practice if you have addresses that you know should geocode to a specific location is to build a cache and use local client-side geocoding

5123495
geocoding	geocode
when your application receives a geocode request for a known address the response would come from your cache rather than google s geocoding servers

5123500
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve got a uiviewcontroller that is being served up as both a uimodalviewcontroller and pushed onto the view stack via a uinavigationcontroller - depending on where the user launches the view from within the app

unsigned	short
but that results in files between 53 and 65 mb in size the image is 4713 5908 sizeof unsigned short

5123588
getter	setter
i did this because i didn t want to have to implement actual properties with backing fields getter and setter in vb.net for the metadata class to keep the maintenance to a minimum i m on .net 3.5 no auto-properties for me

you ll want to use ant or maven if you prefer to set up continuous integration and automated testing

5123664
ant	maven
trying to get that working with eclipse which i did a long time ago when the android sdks were first coming out is a nightmare while ant maven is easily used from any of your favorite ci tools i ve usually used hudson for this

5123704
ostream	istream	std	ostream
this is probably one of the most blatant violations of sensible operator overloading in c++ but that is just how std ostream and std istream work

5123704
cout	cin
just think of it as the direction that the data flows in puts a foo in cout puts cin in foo smile and be happy

5123714

full details of ostream s operator and of istream s operator

5123750
superclass	subclassing
it doesn t violate the liskov substitution principle unless you have something in the subclassing that makes it behave in a way that doesn t make sense for the superclass violating the contract of the superclass

5123755
factors	matrix
to scale the point above by a factors of 1.5 you can left-multiply it by the following matrix

5123755
multiplying	multiplication
now matrix multiplication generally isn t commutative so when adding a transformation by multiplying your matrix you need to specify whether you re left-multiplying or right-multiplying

5123824
width	height
you can calculate the width then hide the scroll bar with overflow hidden then add a div on the left with same height as the box you want to scroll and same width as the user s scrollbar then write a script that scrolls the right box to the same position as the one on the left thus imitating built in system scrollbars

5123855
folder	directory
the last example on the above link is to do a recursive copy from one directory to another maintaining the folder structure

5123857
daemon	cron
suppose i have a service set up that will track the number of errors that happened with a particular service recently and then wrote a daemon or cron job that will go over those numbers periodically and send an alert if there is a spike in the number of errors a service is giving

also to support the arithmetic purposes before doing the first get you can use the head call to learn the length of the resource which will tell you the max index in the range you can use

5124011
int	chars
you can cast the chars to a int or byte

5124014
rss	feed

getter	setter
properties are syntactic sugar for getter setter methods

5124028
getter	setter
the synthesize keyword simply installs a default getter setter implementation

5124057
int	chars
ascii protocols usually use a special chars to delimit the end of the data while binary protocols usually send the length of the data first as a fixed-size int both sides know this size and then the variable-length data follows

5124094
int	chars
and the chars type can be promoted to int

5124104
int	chars
you can use a value of type chars every where a value of type int is allowed and apart from string concatenation and where there are two methods of both types it works the same as the int obtained by casting

5124145
mouseup	mousedown
problem is that when i get x and y co ordinates at the mousedown event and set that co ordinates on on mouseup event but it is not going to its original position because x and y are its local co ordinates in container

versioning	upgrade
we re using an older versioning of django 1.1.1 and are preparing to upgrade to the latest versioning currently 1.2 soon

5124363
versioning	upgrade
i m under the impression that the upgrade is not simply linking to a new versioning of the django files but that we also need to manage the migration of our database since we rely on some built-in django apps django.contrib.auth django.contrib.sites etc.

5124365
put	get
now undoubtedly i d use command bindings but in the xaml if i put a name that s not the built-in ones i get an exception using the wpf editor

i have a div div1 that has its position width height everything all set and it is set externally so i can t know ahead of time what those values are

5124481
uiview	uiwindow
is highly suspect because the uiwindow for your application should have only one child uiview

5124481
uiview	uiwindow
having more than one child uiview of uiwindow gets you into trouble very quickly -- for example device orientation changing can break

5124515
ssl	https
perhaps the most well-known protocol that uses ssl is the https protocol which is the http protocol running over ssl

5124620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to see how i can get google-chrome safari to behave like ie firefox

5124745
getattr	setattr
consequently since the instances c can t have a real pvar field the best is to set up a mechanism controling the creation of with _ setattr _ and access to with _ getattr _ these c s seemingly pvar objects to give the illusion that they exist

5124794
direct3d	directx
it is even necessary to carefully optimize if you used low-level api like direct3d because down into the graphics driver architecture it will hit the batching bottle-neck especially for directx 9 level driver interface

5124807
nsresponder	nsstatusitem
in case anyone cares one way i can think of is to have the view for the nsstatusitem be a custom nsview that overrides the nsresponder methods mouseentered mousemoved and mouseexited

5124813
hide	show
instead i made a basic show hide

5124845

5124872
jlist	jtable
i m able to create a jlist with arbitrary-size cells or a jtable with fixed-size cells and a header but i can t get both at the same time

5124872
jlist	jtableheader	jscrollpane	jtableheader
i also looked into putting a jlist into a jscrollpane and setting the header on the jscrollpane to a jtableheader but as far as i can tell there s no way to get a native look-and-feel renderer for the resultant header -- and a native appearance is important

5124874
rss	feed
ideally i d like to be able to expose a list of custom content types via an rss feed

5124875
opera	firefox
edit i have updated the html to work in both firefox 4+ and opera 11+ -moz-transform and -o-transform respectively

5124909
width	height
how to scale an imagebutton to 50 of the screen width and height

hide	show
for example i would like to show the index a...z if the table has over 50 entries but i would like to hide it if it s less than that

5124926
hide	show
as far as the popover is concerned the way the api manages autorotation is to hide the popover and then show it again at the end of the rotation

5124926
portrait	landscape
would it work to just have two backgrounds one for portrait and one for landscape that you could switch between

5124956
put	get
as jeremiah said getting data out of a union through a different member than you used to put the data in is technically undefined behavior but it s probably the closest you will ever get to standardized undefined behavior

5124962
profiling	debugging
i m still using the developer profiling which the organizer assures me is installed on my ipad for the debugging project settings

5125037
put	get
i put together the following which is all but identical to your code and works fine for both the get and set method

i have a data template for a listbox which has a button and a checkbox .there is a togglebutton outside the listbox which decides the visbility of the checkbox

5125414
post	get
post your code if you get stuck

5125449
int	chars
chars are equivalent to unsigned 16-bit int but that s really an awful design flaw in java and shouldn t be abused

5125466
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
smoke and mirrors would be if implementing something like a calculator you code all the methods for add subtract multiplying and divide but the more advanced functions all return random appearing to do the job

flask	django	flask	pylons
we take your django flask pylons or other wsgi code run all the annoying hosting parts for you and make sure everything s redundant and backed up

5125565
superclass	subclassing
subclassing the new class has all the properties and methods it s superclass defines

5125595
button	checkbox
because you are not binding any event handler to the checkbox s also you haven t shown us the java-script you are using for button click so i assume that you instead wanted to run a server side code instead of client side java-script

5125622
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i have the following code and i have problem accessing the inherited properties or function from a closure within a subclassing as illustrated below

5125629

java is an interpreted-language so performance will typically be worse than that of other compiled-language

5125678
hash	md5
that data field stores a hash - which i can t make any sense of looks like an md5 hash

5125721
width	height
if your texture width or height is a value that is not a power of two you fall into the non-power-of-two texture npot which is handled with limitations on iphone see

5125749

getter	setter
you can declare some static getter setter to manage a static instance of the compononent

5125983
maven	pom.xml
i included 2 dependencies in maven pom.xml

5126007
ubuntu	linux
depending on your flavour of linux ubuntu redhat you should be able to install it via the package manager

5126007
ubuntu	debian
so for instance on ubuntu debian you should be able to enter sudo apt-get install graphviz from the shell and have it be installed

5126025
post	get
generally speaking you ll get more useful answers if you post real code especially if you take the time to implement the smallest minimal subset of your existing code that still exhibits the problem you re trying to solve

5126050
inherited	subclassing
- the contract is not inherited but please note that invariant and post-conditions are protected and can be reused by a subclassing

while eclipse can handle large projects it is in most cases necessary to use an ide-independant build tool like ant or maven

5126090
ant	maven
i have experience in ant how to get started with maven

5126126
multiplying	add
if you need to do that you should probably parse both times check the length check the colon parse two substrings and probably multiplying the number of hours by 60 and add it to the number of minutes to get a total number of minutes

5126131
ant	maven
there s a quite large difference where ant forces you to create your own targets you will get a default set of targets for maven clean install package etc without scripting them

5126131
maven	pom.xml
then you need the maven binary and the project definition file pom.xml which i typically also copy paste between projects

5126132
post	get
the difference is that get sends data open and post hidden in the http-header

5126132
post	get
auth-data shall never be send via get - so use post here

5126151
ant	maven
in comparison to ant what maven does well is dependency management and standardisation of the build lifecycle

5126164
min	max
ideally you should be doing an sql query that uses the max or the min function -- a bit like this

5126177
ant	maven
in my opinion maven is a lot more powerful as compared to ant

5126203
minimum	max
and don t avoid this by just limiting the value to the max minimum of the type in question

5126224
switching	screens
if you still want to use thread you can use wakelock to prevent cpu from going to stand by mode but still to switching screens off but this is not the best way in your case

5126502
maven	pom.xml
following i wrote a maven pom.xml which creates an izpack installer using the izpack-maven-plugin

5126663
post	get
what you need to do in this case is to tell fancyupload to append the cookie data to the request with the option appendcookiedata set to true and then reconstruct the session in the server based on that cookie data goes as part of the get or post request not as headers so most frameworks won t automatically handle this way of authentication

5126721
post	get
i find it very strange that regular non-ajax get and post requests work and ajax get requests work with no problems it s just the ajax post that don t

it seems like an owl reasoner is used to determine subclassing superclass relationships only for ontologies

5127087
superclass	subclassing
but in terms of data how to you query for subclassing - superclass relationships in sparql

5127111

immediately after that at offset 8 there are the width and height values both 4 bytes wide i m not sure of the byte ordering

5127685
width	height
at offset 18 there is an int32 value specifying width and at offset 22 the height both will use little endian byte ordering

5127685
width	height
armed with this info you should be able to write a little bit of code to read the first 26 bytes of a file stream and from that determine the file type along with the width and the height

5127704
submit	submission
since i m using ajax for this i want to prevent the form from actually submission when the submit button is clicked

5127710
for-loop	arrays
where is an arrays and each element is a class with name as a string and it is put in a for-loop

5127726
pop-up	dialog
i can make my ui tabbed so i can open the form in a new tab or i can open the form in a pop-up modal dialog save-cancel

5127743
verilog	vhdl
verilog vhdl is used to create and design specific application system on the chip which embedded into electronic devices

5127765
setinterval	settimeout
not sure why you would want to do that but you can use settimeout docs or setinterval docs methods

5127782
put	get
things would definitely be simpler if you could get rid of the factory method and put the logic into an enrichment interceptor oncreation clause in your structuremap registration

5127786
inherited	properties
create a class that inherited from binding and exposes properties that you can bind the displaymemberpath to and changes the underlying binding read here for how you can do this complicated

5127794
itertools	functools
map filter reduce zip all any sorted as well as the contents of the operator functools and itertools packages all offer a fairly concise way of expressing data queries

5127795
unsigned	short
i have unsigned short int from 0 to 65535 and i must save it to the file using stdio and consuming 2 bytes but i don t know how

5127804
packets	multicast
obviously if every multicast were spread to every computer on the internet the whole thing would collapse so your router will ignore and not route multicast packets

5127812
floating-point	integer
lastly write a loop that takes as input from the file a string for the student s name and an integer or a floating-point point number if you so choose for their mark

5127817
fgets	fread
also the man page for fread and fgets could be helpful

5127847
cout	ofstream
cout is of ostream type the other temporary is ofstream and they are not convertible to each other in any way

5127875
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can have a uitabbarcontroller in the same class as a uinavigationcontroller

5127938
cout	ofstream	std	ostream
from my reading of the standard cout is an lvalue of type std ostream and ofstream tmp.txt is an rvalue of type std ofstream

5127938
std	ostream
neither has any cv-qualifiers and std ostream is a base class of std ofstream so the conditional operator is valid an the result is an rvalue and has type std ostream

5127938
std	ostream
the overload that you are using is a member of std ostream so there is no need to bind a temporary to a non-const reference the member can be called on a non-const rvalue

5127961
cpython	ironpython
i don t know if the current version of ironpython has an equivalent mechanism cpython only fixed it when pep 366 was included in version 2.6

5127976
disk	ram
mmap is a system call for mapping disk blocks into ram almost as if you were adding swap

5127976
disk	ram
you can t map the uncompressed data into ram with mmap as it is not on the disk

5128001
do.call	lapply
however for larger datasets and for situations where you don t necessarily need to return a full dataframe i would consider the following do.call + lapply solution

5128022
children	parent
on the show view of an existing parent i would like to have a form to create children

5128162
jython	pypy
use a python implementation with a more multicore friendly garbage collection mechanism such as jython ironpython or pypy

5128163
coalesce	nullif
however you can overwrite the value of a column in the output which is where you would typically use a case nullif or coalesce expression

5128183
inherited	subclassing
you could try to create a subclassing of listviewitem but since that class inherited directly from system.object and is not an actual windows form control you might be borrowing trouble as you would need to replicate all the functionality of the inherited chain of an actual control

5128185
width	height
after i log out the width height of the bitmap it tells me an other value then the bitmap realy is

5128193
public	protected
visibility public protected private

5128202
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is shown properly in google-chrome opera ie and safari but not in firefox it falls back to arial

5128214
memcached	apc
you could use apc s cache instead of memcached

5128224
google-chrome	firefox
full code just replace your parsexml function and test it on google-chrome or firefox with firebug

5128260
mdpi	hdpi
you can t specify whether it is in mdpi hdpi or whatever it will choose the version that match your running system

5128260
mdpi	hdpi
suppose you are using a hdpi device but no mdpi resource is defined what it will do is take your mdpi resource and during decode it will make it into hdpi it enlarge your mdpi bitmap to about 1.5x larger

5128331
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux amd64 64bit testing with gcc 4.5.3 glibc 2.13 and glib 2.26.1

5128351
for-loop	arrays
ideally the check would be contained within a for-loop without creating any other arrays

5128355
ienumerable	ienumerator
then i would remove the ienumerable and ienumerator from the viewmodeltables class unless you have a specific reason why they are on the class definition

5128376
int	chars
edit the reason i say that this isn t particularly pretty is that my array is actually referenced by chars values not int

5128381
inherited	properties
you could inherited from the current ones and then specify further properties such as db connection string to use when getting the resources from your custom provider

5128382
uiview	calayer
my class which sub-classes uiscrollview has a uiview as a sub-view and in this sub-view i draw on a calayer

5128384
maven	m2e
i m developing some applications in clojure + java using eclipse and maven with m2e

5128405
django	web2py	camping	ruby-on-rails	pyramid	web2py	pylons	web2py	pylons	pyramid
ruby-on-rails is perfectly well suited to this sort of thing as are lift django pylons pyramid camping web2py plone yes i said plone luci and many many others

5128416
post	put
for peter s #1 suggestion above i put together a collection of examples using java to run groovy scripts in a blog post awhile back that comes along with code samples on github

5128438
google-chrome	firefox
however in firefox camino and google-chrome the base page briefly flashes the content and the the swf starts playing

5128451
folder	directory
to use python as a simple http server just change your working directory to the folder with your static content and type python -m simplehttpserver 8000 everything in the directory will be available at http localhost 8000

5128493
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m on a mac with macos snow leopard and checked your site using opera 11.01 safari 5.0.3 and firefox 3.6.13 the links are screenshots of the browsers

5128504
disk	ram
driven ram and disk implementations of

5128512
mouseleave	mouseenter
use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

5128541
qapplication	qdialog
i understand that all ui elements must be created in the same thread as the qapplication class but i need to be able to instantiate or at least have a reference to a qdialog in another thread

5128541
qapplication	qdialog
to create a qdialog outside the main thread were the qapplication class exists

5128549
submit	submission
in my add_page.php page i am submission a form and saving a message in submit action in the session and then re-directing to index.php page using header location ...

5128560
outputstream	inputstream
you can use the url and urlconnection classes to obtain inputstream and outputstream to files located on an ftp server

5128585
int	chars
the reason that is that the string is apparently downcast to an int in a string int comparison and string_index is parsed until a chars is encountered that is not a digit thereby evaluating to the empty string which equals 0

5128614
google-chrome	safari
in ie8 google-chrome and safari the favicon shows up fine

5128633
put	get	post	get	post	put
in this way you are not constrained by cross-domain restrictions but will only be able to do a get request not post put delete...

5128645
width	height
at a first look i just notice a big contentsize width and a small height .

5128684
hash	hmac
in cryptography hmac hash-based message authentication code is a specific construction for calculating a message authentication code mac involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key

5128684
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
any cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha-1 may be used in the calculation of an hmac

5128684
hash	hmac
the cryptographic strength of the hmac depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function the size of its hash output length in bits and on the size and quality of the cryptographic key

5128684
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
the size of the output of hmac is the same as that of the underlying hash function 128 or 160 bits in the case of md5 or sha-1 respectively although it can be truncated if desired

5128685
hash	hmac
in cryptography hmac hash-based message authentication code is a specific construction for calculating a message authentication code mac involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key

5128686
google-chrome	firefox
the above link works fine with firefox and google-chrome but ie 8 does not show properly the main content #main

5128696
maven	m2e
create the maven project from within eclipse with m2e vs

5128708
width	height
i would like to take the photo and crop resize it to 200 width by 150 height even if it means doing it destructively

5128720
pseudo-class	visited
for the best browser support includes ancient but not quite forgotten browsers use the link and visited pseudo-class instead of the attribute selector combining both will match the same as

5128722
qimage	qwidget
the paint device could be implemented by the qwidget qimage qpixmap qglpixelbuffer qpicture and qprinter subclasses

5128734
width	height
add width and height attributes to the images

5128734
width	height
all of this happens before the image is loaded and since there are no width or height attributes the dimensions come out way off

5128760
mockito	jmock
this will allow you to use mock implementations of those interfaces in your unit tests jmock mockito etc

5128777
width	height
all you really have to implement in a manager is the sublayout method which is where you call layoutchild f width height on all your fields and then setpositionchild to exactly place them

5128786
width	height
we have some measures for the grid like grid height grid width and tile height width

5128786
isometric	draw
we do not have the isometric positions for the rectangle but rather have the normal draw coordinates for the grid where the top left hand corner is 0 0 and south is y+ right is x+

5128786
width	height
if we had the top left height width of the rectangle in question - how could we calculate an array of iso-cells that crossed by the bottom edge of the rectangle

5128904
webclient	webrequest
imo unless you are doing something particularly subtle it is often a good idea to use webclient which is a wrapper around webrequest etc that greatly simplifies the api - for example you can just call the uploaddata method or downloadstring etc

5128988
postgresql	mysql
relstorage supports postgresql oracle and mysql backends

5129059
outputstream	inputstream
if you connect the serial port-s rxdata with the txdatapin and the rts with the cts pin then the integration test can check that every thing send into outputstream should be received by the inputstream

5129063
outputstream	inputstream
files give you inputstream and outputstream both which have in-memory equivalents

5129070
firefox	safari
on safari and firefox for os x the orange in the image is noticably darker than the css background

5129085
scipy	sympy
i don t know why you mention scipy in your question when you use sympy in your code

5129122
folder	directory
create a new web site or virtual directory in iis and point to the folder

5129162
hide	show
you can then hide or show the pickview or toolbar within the superview or hide everything by hiding the superview

5129211
qcombobox	qcompleter
i m using qt4.6 and i have a qcombobox with a qcompleter in it

5129221
width	height
i can assume that all the pictures have the same width and height the aspect ratio

5129233
int	double	int	chars
there is no standard set of sizes for numeric types but generally speaking chars short int long long long and float double long double

5129233
int	double
in some cases such as converting an int to a double or an unsigned type into a signed type information can be lost

5129247
strftime	strtotime
use strftime or date not strtotime

5129268
crossover	mutation
it is probably worth some consideration as to what representation you want these programs in because if you plan to perform crossover mutation on them then a string representation is probably not ideal

5129270
helpers	actioncontroller
view helpers benefits you can use it inside actioncontroller also e.g echo and i have see this used very off-ten

5129351
cube	skybox
i m rendering an orthogonal quad filling the viewport before everything with vertex coloring at each corner right after i m rendering a cube skybox with 6 transparent polygons gl_blend source gl_one dest gl_one

5129365
next	except
starting with the first point in yv and stepping trough all except the last check the distance of this point with the next 7 points or any that are left if there are not as many as 7

5129448
bmp	png
it can read and write jpeg png and bmp files

5129463
mouse	keyboard
i m making a game gui and basically each widget can have other widgets which listen to mouse or keyboard events

5129470
post	get
the idea is to get language of post from custom fields

5129481
sorting	grouping
but if you want do it in php your need uksort for sorting + foreach for grouping i think

5129507
maven	m2e
the m2e and command line mvn tool take two very different approaches to eclipse maven integration

5129518
pull	push
actually i d say the chance to corrupt a repository is very very low when using the regular commands only add remove files commit push pull merge

5129523
getter	setter
no i believe these are getter not setter

5129537
pop-up	dialog
when i try to run it launch failed no binary found dialog pop-up

5129550
sorting	filtering
this might support filtering sorting summing

5129557
shadowing	named
you re taking a and b as parameters then immediately shadowing the named to create vars

5129600
superclass	subclassing
one approach would be to use an instance of a custom subclassing of nsproxy rather than of your device superclass to handle the initial login and device detection

5129620
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

5129620
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

websphere	ibm
the code is running in a web-application running inside a ibm websphere on z os

5129626
maven	m2e
are you using surefire plugin m2e maven or only testng eclipse plugin

5129626
maven	m2e
then i started using maven but when i do maven test phase using m2e there is only console output and surefire reports that i can check in browser and to choose what test suite test or test method can be set up only via testng.xml

5129634
children	parent
i have been reading about storing nested data and the examples i have come across so far demonstrate on how one can create and manage an hierarchy of nodes in a database table when using the nested set model.i am wondering if a table parent can have children tables nodes .by table i mean the ordinary mysql table with data of course

5129699
implements	extends
i find it a little bit odd that t has to extends executable rather than implements it in the source code but then t could end up being an interface itself so i guess it makes sense.

5129718
post	get
use requestparam - it will work with both get and post requests

5129735
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
if you are in a navigationcontroller then you have to use pushviewcontroller animated to drill down and popviewcontroller animated to go back

5129762
put	get
i am having trouble correctly formatting my put request to get my server to recognise my client application s put command

5129802
client-side	server-side
in all the examples i ve seen even with the brand new unobtrusive client validation introduced w mvc 3 we have to create .net code for our server-side validation and jquery or javascript code for client-side validation

5129821
datamapper	activerecord
yes it does in activerecord as in datamapper

5129826
ssl	https
make sure you specify ssl in the ajax url when the rest of your page uses ssl too e.g https

5129826
ssl	https
any https asset html or otherwise can only be accessed by something on the same domain ssl certificate

5129832
int	chars
for your first error you re passing an int instead of a chars or chars

5129859
post	get
now i have a slightly different problem which is how to get extra information into the eventsmember record but that s for a different post

5129862
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need to develop a mini clickonce plugin for firefox google-chrome operah and safari preferably one that works on all of the above

5129904
put	get
step 1 put in in your code and see if you get a time out

5129947
floating-point	integer
that s because you re doing integer division instead of floating-point division

5129953
min	max
if you take a look at the reference documentation you ll see that the min max annotations both have an impact on the hibernate metadata while decimalmin decimalmax don t

5129953
min	max
also max min accept a long value while decimalmax decimalmin accept the string representation of a bigdecimal which makes these the only possible choice if you re dealing with big numbers that exceed long.max_value or are under long.min_value

5130076
hash	md5
the etag represent the md5 hash or any other free information which will be changed if the data are changed

5130082
post	get
yes before i get flames i have read through the community wiki and post on so about this particular subject so don t just fob me off to them as well as that i have gone through john reisg s notes on the subject too which helped a great deal

5130110
int	double
i know how to do it for an int and double which get converted to strings but am stuck on character....i was thinking using charat

5130121
int	chars
edit your assumptions in your code are wrong since charat takes an int input the index of the chars not a chars

5130122
hide	show
when you use li.backlava on the unhover function you re telling any list item elements with the class backlava to show again which is why the tracking li appears again when a sub-menu hide

5130124
ati	nvidia
i don t think either amd ati or nvidia publishes how to do things like this

5130152
post	get
i have posted this question a while ago but got a partial answer to my issue so i thought i post more explanation hoping to get a more accurate answer

5130165
sorting	filtering
two different things going on here filtering and sorting

5130201
octal	decimal
01602 - this 0 at the beginning means you are using octal rather than decimal numbers

5130202
octal	decimal
when you specify a number with a leading zero it gets treated as an octal base-8 as opposed to decimal base-10 or hexadecimal base-16

5130228
setinterval	settimeout
although it would have a bunch of advantages it turned out to be much worse for me than using plain setinterval settimeout for generating an animation

5130242
versioning	upgrade
in theory you could use those to restore a backup of an old versioning and upgrade to a current versioning

5130243
twig	smarty
smarty and twig are famous and good

5130265
width	height
after i log out the width height of the bitmap it tells me an other value then the bitmap realy is

5130349
maven	pom.xml
after you made maven and eclipse work together use svn subclipse or whatever to share your project files including pom.xml .classpath .project and may be .settings but excluding all derived files compiler output etc.

5130378
ubuntu	debian
should using windows not be mandatory i recommend using a more developer-friendly os like ubuntu or debian in combination with rvm

5130387
stdout	stderr
how to implement a qt application reading from stdin printing to stdout and stderr and having no main window

5130411
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade from an older versioning of xampp to 1.7.3 and encountered a the same problem i got mysql workbench to connect if i edited the my.ini file and

5130418
textview	simpleadapter
you will have to create a custom subclass of simpleadapter and override setviewtext or use a viewbinder and customize each textview for each row

5130421
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
this is done within the xml of your game screen. assuming you ve done a tutorial on opengl-es you should have an xml file that holds your custom glsurfaceview

5130458
hide	show
obviously the above doesn t hide the created ul but the demo s to show one way of going about creating it dynamically

5130495
post	get
i don t know ruby but if you know how to perform http https requests get post with custom headers in ruby this pin code flow should work fine if you follow twitter api document carefully

5130496
actionscript	mxml
you ll probably have to set this up in mxml and dissect the generated actionscript to figure out the appropriate as3 syntax

5130501
screens	hdpi
drawable-hdpi - for hdpi screens 72x72

5130529
getter	setter
using attr_accessor and instance variables i can get data by using the getter and setter like

5130551
profiling	debugging
but distribution profiling don t work with debugging

5130551
profiling	debugging
you have to make sure you don t override your developer profiling under your debugging configuration

5130551
profiling	debugging
if you do that just go back to your project select debugging under configurations and select the appropriate developer profiling to compile with

5130577
filesystems	ntfs
this will differ a lot depending on the filesystems type - fat32 ntfs and so on

5130604
mdpi	hdpi
honeycomb s launcher will use available hdpi drawables as higher-res mipmaps on mdpi devices

5130651
slug	permalinks
i m trying to use permalinks in django using a fairly standard app year month day slug model

5130717
width	height
it turns out that glsubteximage2d actually requires the width to be a power of two but not the height for some gpus including the tegra 2

5130738
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie7 ie8 firefox 3 and google-chrome

5130846
int	chars
i am developing an iphone app i need to assign every user with a 5 chars unique key consisting of int and alphabets like whoishere and pmesssenger applications

5130873
width	height
assuming then that i have the match in which to join the two images together the calculated new width and height of the resulting image and an allocated 2d array for the resulting image based on these new dimensions i m wondering how i could put the appropriate pixels into the new image

5130889
stdout	stderr
pipes both stdout and stderr of one command into the standard input of another one

5130904
google-chrome	firefox
am testing it on linux google-chrome and firefox - both latest stable versions

tabcontrol	tabitem
in the xaml i have a tabcontrol and inside one of the tabitem s content is a busyindicator

5130991
rss	feed
i have generated the rss feed successfully

5131012
post	put
in the past i have done it more simply by getting the javascript to put the token value into the post data

5131018
int	double
- what is the best practice for converting or casting those types into their useable int or double e

5131046
rss	feed
run your feed through an rss validator and if it passes you re probably fine

5131056
jar	war
for more advanced reading you might want to read about how to define the classpath for your own jar files or the directory structure of a war file when you re creating a web application

5131091
manipulators	iomanip
take a look at the setfill and setw manipulators in iomanip

5131096
portrait	landscape
this works fine for portrait orientation but when in landscape the text view grows to accommodate the additional horizontal space which is desired but the above code makes the height larger than the content

5131110
listview	gridview
this view shall be put into a listview of songs that is using a gridview this works already but currently it only displays in the artists-cells

5131159
getter	setter
i m using getter and setter for creating an instance of a class

5131170
getter	setter
you cannot use auto property for getter and have a definition for setter

5131184
nsurl	nsstring	nsurl	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
you can t directly store an nsurl in nsuserdefaults only nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

5131190
nsstring	nsdata
basically property lists objects are things like nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary the required format for saving to nsuserdefaults

5131218
ilist	icollection
as listview s datasource is an icollection or ilist

5131236
subtract	add
so just add 128 subtract key_c and do modulo 127 again to keep in range

5131304
cpu	processors
this approach is problematic for multiprocessor operating systems when one cpu is idling in a process thread that another cpu wants to dispatch to and is why the idea of a special process thread that was always ready to run one per processors in the system so that the cpu could idle in its own private thread context became the norm

5131375
post	get
the best way to go about is to do a on you query and get the count like it s demonstrated in this post beforehand

5131378
folder	directory
this will create the directory structure and copy everything in the projects resources folder to the application bundles resources directory

5131404
typemock	moles
your second option is to hook into the profiler api which is what typemock isolator and microsoft s own moles do

5131432
google-chrome	firefox
firefox for example most of the times loads from cache so it s ok but google-chrome reinits the form every time

5131447
passenger	webrick
i just changed in my local development laptop from webrick to apache2 passenger

5131458
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that it works in firefox and google-chrome but only works partially in ie8 i have not tested other versions

5134358
serializable	deserialization
on the other hand if there s very little logic other than calling into your serializable deserialization code then it s often acceptable to skip the unit tests and run integration tests that test the full cycle create a bobject in memory persist it via calling saveobject read it back out using getobject ensure that it is equal equivalent to the one you persisted in the first place

from the viewdidappear method to the viewdidload method

5134521

the adt creates a bin folder which contains all of the class files for all matching source file and directory in your project you could using the jar command create a jar archive containing these class files and directory and presumable your library but of course the class files platform level would only be targeted for current level of the project build- you would need a different jar file for each platform level

5134762
implements	extends
now you only have your new parsers implements the new messageobjectparser interface which should extends the old parser

5134779
unsigned	short
the range of a unsigned short is 0 - 65535

5134789
unsigned	short
the range of a unsigned short is 0-65535 so 70000 doesn t fit into it 2 bytes use a datatype with 4 bytes instead unsigned int should work you can check the size with sizeof

5134797
unsigned	short
...although just u unsigned int rather than unsigned short would probably work as well because the short will get promoted to int when it gets pushed on the stack for printf

5134797
unsigned	short
but again that s only if the value 70000 will fit in an unsigned short on your platform

i realize that the linked answer applies to linux unix hosts but i just tested your code on a windows 7 machine and verified that it also sends tcp packets to the echo port 7 rather than an icmp echo request

5136847
icmp	tcp
your java program not being able to send and receive icmp packets to test for the reachability of the remote windows host will attempt to initiate a tcp connection to the remote windows host by sending a syn synchronize packet to port 7

the dns tcp ip protocol is not identical to the dns udp ip protocol

5136925
udp	tcp
it doesn t really make sense not least in terms of network overhead to have one-connection-per-query tcp ip on the back end when there s only udp ip on the front end

5136925
udp	tcp
moreover a properly written forwarding proxy dns server has to cope with large udp ip packets truncated responses truncated and otherwise malformed queries tcp ip connection timeouts and resets loop detection and dns udp ip retry

for-loop	arrays
both of those could probably be overcome by changing things around so that your keyword appears first on the line but now you have keyword somestuff where the name of the arrays is somestuff and you re firmly within the pattern that most of the other modules have carved out -- only if you re generating a for-loop you ll probably be leaving the block as a genuine block instead of getting it to be parsed as a sub definition instead

5154896

c++ s standard library does not use or define max or min as macros

5155793
min	max
from what i can see in the infos you gave i d reckon that on your system some old header is included which defines max and min as macros

5155793
min	max
you ll need to identify the header or source file which defines max min and try to figure out if there is a way to configure the source code to build without that header

5155793
min	max
duplicated definitions usually mean that the code needs cleanup anyway so you could start by removing the macros and replacing max min with std max std min

5155824

width	margin
this would add all the children div node s width along with the margin if there is any and finally set the width from document.body

5156194
width	height
width and height parameters might query string parameters

5156229
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
it would be much easier to use a control like the repeater gridview or listview instead which is built to display a dynamic number of comments

5156233
width	height
div s should update height and width automatically unless otherwise told to

5156252
inherited	properties
but don t get confused with them you will rarely need to use primitive wrappers because even if primitive values are not objects you can still access their inherited properties for example on a string you can access all members of string.prototype

5156252
accessor	properties
that s because the properties accessor the dot in this case temporarily converts the primitive value to an object for being able to resolve the indexof properties up in the prototype chain

5156255

i managed to come up with a solution though not exactly by using a qtablewidgetitem basically i placed a qlineedit in the cell instead and attached the qcompleter to that

you can capture it using any number of javascript methods getelementbyid getelementsbytagname ...

5156901
disk	ram
but since this is software and almost anything is possible here s a really lame solution embed the dll as a binary resource in your .net app and at run time pull its contents into a binary stream save it to disk and then load it i m not sure if there is a way to execute an unmanaged dll from memory other than cheating by putting it on a ram disk

5156977
photoshop	fireworks
i have been working with a partner and he has been designing some of what we d like to use in photoshop and fireworks

5157038
cout	cin
it is possible to use rdbuf to change the destination of std cin and std cout inside your program

5157038
cout	cin	stdout	stderr
if you don t do that it is probably quite safe to assume that cin 0 cout 1 and clog and cerr both 2 as the c++ standard states that they are synchronized with c stdin stdout and stderr and those have per posix those file descriptors at startup

5157062
hide	show
for example two divs with my problem there hide div show up onchange in the textbox

5157063
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have performed my frst venture into html5 video using the video for everyone and it works well in ie opera saf google-chrome firefox

5157076
stdout	stdio
however since in a c++ program both cout as well as stdout exist and work at the same time c++ by default provides synchronisation between stdio and iostream methods your best bet in my opinion is to do a isatty fileno stdout

5157089

i d recommend moving all the css properties having to do with dimensions height width margin padding etc. to the li tag and adding a br tag between each word in the list items

5157291

another way is to bind an event to window.resize and make the canvas element equal the width height of the image element

it should be possible to do what you are wanting to do with just isinstance hasattr getattr and setattr

5161472
springsource	grails
there is a new mongodb plugin for grails made by the springsource team

5161538
datamapper	activerecord
this leads to patterns such as datamapper and activerecord that fall into the category of object-relational mapping orm

5161586
width	height
the images are user-added so i have no control over the aspect ratio but i will be enforcing a maximum width and height on uploaded images

5161594
pull	push
basically i want to be able to just type git push and git pull and it will automatically push and pull to origin with the appropriate branch

5161616
min	max
write a template function vectormaxmin that will accept a vector and a number indicating the size of the vector and will return the max and the min values of the vector .

5161616
min	max
create a class vector to avoid the size passing value and control the insertions and can get from this the max and min values.

5161616
min	max
when i read the problem i thought in a tuple to return max min values is it correct

5161687
getattr	setattr
as an alternative to update you could override getattr and setattr for your class instead

5161737
rvm	bundler
i ve got rvm running on the remote server as well as locally and bundler is managing all my gems

i am making a get request to twitter to receive a jsonp object back of most recent post of a specific tag

5161892
rss	feed
i was thinking of setting up a central google reader account and hooking all the rss feed for the elmah installations into it

5161893
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you can get mousedown mousemove and mouseup though

5161894
width	height
i am able to manually set the width and height of the frame to force the view to resize but this breaks the dynamic nature of the view

5161894
width	height
for example if i manually set the width the height doesn t adjust as the content doesn t re-layout

5161909
folder	directory
assuming your have setup your project with a scm maven will ignore the .svn directory and as long as your eclipse properties files aren t within your src folder you won t get those either

5161930
inherited	properties
uitableviewcell just inherited this properties from uiview

5161931
ssl	https
https resolves it -- even the data in the http header including the uri is protected since the whole connection happens over an ssl channel

5161951
put	get	oncreate	findviewbyid
so i put a textview in the layout get it with findviewbyid in oncreate and put this in run after progress.setprogress pos

my practice is to install apache via rpm packages on centos linux and deploy rails apps to apache s default dir of var www application_name

5161964
google-chrome	firefox
you can run the scraping code in ie firefox and google-chrome

5161996
rss	feed
the problem was that in the rss feed there was one node that didn t have an enclosure item

5162062
children	parent
strange that the children don t respect the cursor defined by the parent but thus is life

5162077

i m trying to create a custom layout that it automatically sets it s dimensions height and width according to the screen resolution

5162078
devise	cancan
i successfully made login system with devise and cancan and i have 3 types of users

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
in my case i have a third party library not jquery centric that creates mouseover mouseout events on an element using addeventlistener attachevent

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
my solution thus far has been to simply unbind the mouseover mouseout

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
however every now and again an error can occur think validation error that results in the page not refreshing and i need to re-attach the mouseover mouseout event listeners

5162084
mouseover	mouseout
it s probably worth mentioning that because the mouseover mouseout event listeners are created and attached within a third party library i cannot simply assign the event to a variable and bind unbind it in that manner which afik is the best way to do this

5162110
audiotrack	audiorecord
i ve an app that records audio using audiorecord and audiotrack to play

5162118
getdate	datepart
sepcifically i d like to use datepart hh getdate as the formula and the resulting sql that i expect is

5162118
getdate	datepart
where datepart hh getdate 17

5162193
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie 7 and 8 firefox and google-chrome

5162195
stdout	stderr
the output is possibly being sent to stderr rather than stdout

5162235
int	chars
then you need to convert the chars to an int

5162268
qgroupbox	phonon	qcombobox	qgroupbox
in this application i have 3 qgroupbox one with several buttons the second one with a glwidget displaying webcam content captured and processed using opencv and displayed with opengl and in the third one i was trying to play different videos using phonon basically i intend to select the videos using a qcombobox although this is not relevant to my problem

5162370
serializable	deserialization
all those details are taken care of for you on serializable and deserialization - in only a few lines of code

5162390
inherited	properties
use .hasownproperty to skip inherited properties

5162392
inherited	properties
the reason why you want to use for and not for..in here is because for..in uses inherited properties of the iterated object so to avoid that you can use hasownproperty but in this case where you re only iterating over a numeric indice i think it s better to use a simple for-loop over using for..in and hasownproperty

5162440
put	get
i would say you need to put in about 80 hours of practice to master the basics so give yourself a month of self-learning to get to that point

5162482
quicksort	mergesort
most javascript implementations probably use some variant of either quicksort or mergesort

5162512
getter	setter
are there setter getter methods already synthesized for these

5162542
ndepend	fxcop
in essence i m looking for the db equivalent of fxcop or ndepend

5162556
accessor	properties
properties get accessor

5162564
setinterval	clearinterval
if you want to animate the scroll you could use some combination of setinterval and clearinterval to call scrollto until you ve reached your desire y-position

5162623
hide	show
just show hide an absolutely positioned div on load

5162649
cpu	processors
the registers still on x86 physically reside inside the processors as opposed to ram and are loaded by the processors from the text area and can also be loaded from elsewhere in memory or other places depending on the cpu instructions that are actually executed

5162670
int	chars
also i understand that chars is by default an int but we still need to convert it to chars when reading from input is it right

5162781
google-chrome	firefox
we run our tests in ie google-chrome and firefox and aside from some differences in what the test runner itself looks like it works

5162858
integer	unsigned
as pointed out by james mcnellis it is not undefined to assign an unsigned int int_max to an integer - rather this is implementation defined

5162858
integer	unsigned
as such the context here is now specifically on my preference is to ensure this integer resets to zero when the unsigned int exceeds int_max

5162860
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
a for-loop will loops through a collection of data such as an arrays

5162887
imap	nntp
if you just want to read mails using php php has native functions to talk to imap nntp and pop mailboxes

5162888
intersect	contains
the problem i see with the hashset intersect and other set theory answers is that you do contains duplicates and a set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements

5162911
getdate	datepart
the easiest workaround is creating a function call it gethour that returns datepart hh getdate

5162952
jstl	taglib
you need to declare the jstl core taglib in top of your jsp to get them to run

5162971
post	get
yes create a linkbutton have it post back to the server then get the information you need which may need to be loaded from the db and do a response.redirect instead

5162974
integer	unsigned
if all the shared values for int and unsigned int correspond and you want other unsigned values such as int_max + 1 to each have distinct values then you can only map them onto the negative integer values

5163006
post	get
no only get post are valid values for the method attribute

5163030
post	get
html up to version 4 only defines the use of post and get for forms

5163070
put	get	post	get	post	put
get post put and delete there are others are a part of the http standard but you are limited to get and post in html forms at this time

5163081
inherited	subclassing
edit one possibility that occurs to me is to go ahead and use regular django model inherited set the base goal class to abstract as required and create the sub-models and then instead of trying to query for goal entities creating a model for each user with a listfield that contains references to the various subclassing entities and retrieving the listfield

5163101
ant	maven
static weaving is in fact being done via an ant task from maven

but do i change the hello to a variabele so each time the for-loop loops its another name

5163187
debian	linux
in debian linux file is located at etc mysql my.cnf

5163188
rar	zip
what i d do is try the using rar zip 7zip lzma with very small dictionary sizes otherwise they ll just use up too much space for preprocessed information and see how big the raw compressed file they produce is will probably have to use their libraries in order to make them strip headers to conserve space

5163198
pull	push
the good way uses only push pull and merge

5163256
google-chrome	firefox
thanks to everyone reminding me to debug in either firefox or google-chrome and adjusting the quotation marks

5163291
mongodb	bson
update ok seems like batch insert only allows array or any insert maybe i misunderstood that mongodb can query in bson including inserts

5163293
ubuntu	linux
if not i would suggest recommend setting up a virtual machine such as virtualbox running linux ubuntu is my preference

5163293
disk	ram
lower ram usage cleaner disk and you can turn on off the ror instance as needed by starting up shutting down the vm

5163294
google-chrome	firefox
however this seems to problematic in at least google-chrome and firefox that is when using inspect element in google-chrome the and the text markup are reported to be like

5163294
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari firefox google-chrome all produce slightly different unexpected interpretations

5163331
folder	directory
under linux each process has a directory under proc folder where you can read out all sorts of information about the process

5163332
inherited	properties
i thought it might inherited from system.array or somehting similair considering you can call methods and access properties on an array

5163374
getter	setter
however i don t really like the idea of having read_attribute methods inside my getter setter

5163379
google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected for google-chrome firefox and ie 8 but not in ie 7

5163379
google-chrome	firefox
will display in google-chrome firefox and ie 8 like this

5163403
devise	cancan
i have some pretty good posts about cancan and devise here and here

5163507
google-chrome	firefox
i am using a jquery slider panel that pushes the content down rather than overlap it intended which works fine on google-chrome but not firefox

i have been trying for hours to simply call a table in a wordpress dbase through a .ajax post and return the value i want but i get this error on the returning page call to a member function get_results on a non object

5163527
nunit	moq
with these classes i would try to test the behavior using nunit and moq of the useractions class in regards to logging in and logging out

5163538
tcplistener	tcpclient
i typically use tcpclient tcplistener and their asynchronous functions

5163615
int	double
if c or v are not int class c evaluates to double then i get the following error message

5163680
put	get
it looks like i forgot to add that to the plugins doc page i ll put in a task to get that documented

5163693
nicedit	fckeditor
i m programming a new free free speach web application for managing medical clinical labs via python so i used wysiwyg editors like tinymce fckeditor and nicedit

5163693
hide	show
i put two buttons for show and hide tinymce but they didn t work unless i call function alert

5163722
prepare	execute
read prepare again the mysql file by breaking multiple queries then execute one-by-one

5163818
single-quotes	double-quotes
the src attribute will always be formatted with double-quotes not single-quotes

5163840
getter	setter
basically synthesize automatically generates the getter and setter based on the property declaration

5163843
ftp	smb
as previously mentioned there is no way you can track directories via ftp or smb

5163886
integer	unsigned
i am not fully sure about the exact type but based on the name it looks like an unsigned 32 bit integer

5163908
getter	setter
synthesize creates getter and setter for your property.if you do not synthesize the property then you can use property. it gives crash

5163908
getter	setter
without synthesize you cant use the setter and getter

5163981
rss	feed
grouping comparing the similar news stories together which are gathered from different sources using rss feed

5163984
jar	.war
i jar ed the logon.html and logonerror.html and added them as a library along with the .war webapp file

5163993
prawn	pdfkit
they both work good for one page documents i usually use pdfkit to convert html and for larger documents that are going have lots of pages i use prawn because it gives you a smaller file size and handles multiple pages better

5164003
uitableview	reloaddata
my suggestion would be to present a uitableview in a popover with the search bar at the top then simply drive the table view s data source using the search term and call reloaddata on the table view every time the user types into the box

5164034
java.util.date	simpledateformat
use a simpledateformat instance to parse the date you get from the file to a java.util.date object then you can use another simpledateformat to convert to the xsd date format

5164035
pull	push
further the listening url can be used to push and pull from as well using hg

5164035
pull	push
this is in fact the same website that is channeled via hgweb.cgi and also the underlying mechanism for doing push pull over ssh

5164054
int	double	int	boolean
int double boolean etc

5164063
jar	war
as far as i understand html files should be placed in a war instead of a jar because those are web resources

5164090
mkmapview	mkannotationview
here is my code of - mkannotationview mapview mkmapview mapview viewforannotation id annotation method

5164115
post	get

width	height
all elements in the custom widget have a fixed width and height and minimum and maximum height and width are set to 660 300

5164153
client-side	server-side
you should validate in both the view client-side and controller server-side

5164161

5164219
hide	show
i have an application i m working on where i need a button upon click to show hide a label

5164219
iboutlet	ibaction
i set up the label as an iboutlet and the button as an ibaction - but don t really know where to go from here

5164266
rss	feed
i am using yql to parse multiple rss feed

5164267
width	height
to change it to use a specific application you need to change the first line to getdc game where game is the handle of the game s window and then set the right height and width of the game s window too

5164290
kerberos	ntlm
it s simply because you are initializing another kerberos ntlm authentication since you provides uername and password again

5164298
put	get
but when i am trying to perform a put request i get some problems for example the update action for the user

5164340
getter	setter
as same way how can i write setter and getter method for a map like this

5164354
put	get
you can have your desktop application call a method in you asp.net application and get back the value and then put it in that required textbox

5164366
getter	setter
you can write a getter or setter for a field that s a std map just as you would any other field - just have the getter return a std map and have the setter accept a std map

5164366
getter	setter
of course if you have a field that s a std map that you re trying to use getter and setter on that might suggest that there s a better way to structure the program

5164405
queue	fifo
you get simple read write and fifo queue at lowest development cost

5164416
multicastdelegate	delegation
the c# delegation multicastdelegate to be correct gets the info from using method methodinfo which is the same thing you would need to do for the delegation class using java.lang.reflect.method

5164418
bazaar	svn
i m curious about this behavior and maybe its just because i ve come from using svn and bazaar mostly

5164440
switching	screens
everything else switching the desktop looking up the selected screens saver loading and starting it is buried inside windows

5164506
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it also has native border-radius rounding in browsers that support it opera 10.5+ firefox safari and google-chrome

5164519
hide	show
or another situation rather than .addclass use a jquery javascript so when randomize is clicked to randomly show 3 out of 6 items one in each category of boat car bike and hide the rest blueboat redcar greenbike

5164519
ready	each
in this situation all 6 items are on the page when document is ready but with the randomize only 3 are left one from each category

5164563
hide	show
i want to show and hide the tab bar in two differnt views.i used the code

5164581
g++	gcc
i ran them on mac os x 10.6.6 using g++ i686-apple-darwin10-g++-4.2.1 gcc 4.2.1 apple inc

5164590
implements	extends
one class may implements any number of interfaces even if those interfaces extends other interfaces as well

5164616
width	height
each of your controls expose a similar width and height property that you can use to set their sizes relative to the size of their container form

5164616
width	height
you might have a treeview that takes up 100 of the form s height but only 50 of its width

5164616
width	height
a listview that takes up 50 of the form s height and 50 of its width

5164616
width	height
and a textbox positioned under that taking up 50 of the form s height and 50 of its width

5164720
post	get
as i was trying to figure out what you were asking i finally decided the simplest course was to post my code and get your feedback

5164732
serializable	deserialization
finally a work-around for the generic collection s problem was found out changing from arraylist to simple array helps to do serializable and deserialization

5164763
postgresql	mysql
additionally bear in mind that when using postgresql you cannot use operator as it will have the same meaning as in mysql

5164781
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and also to linux commands

5164793
width	height
removing the minibuffer-lines parameter will give you a full screen width window that s the wrong height and removing the fullscreen parameter means nothing resizes correctly

5164793
width	height
attempting to set fullscreen to fullscreen gives the same issue as setting nothing and fullscreen to fullheight gives blank space only across the height and not the width when a smaller font size is used

5164869
getter	setter
setter and getter for std map is no different except that you need to pass the necessary parameters for the setter

5164869
int	chars
assume if i have a struct and has a member variable whose type is std map whose key is of type chars and data is of type int

5164889
put	get
what you want to do is put the image into the assets folder in your android app which will then get bundled into the app and link to it appropriately with file android_assets

5164909
ubuntu	linux	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is only with firefox 3.6 on macintosh this does not happen on linux my development platform nor on ubuntu 8 and 10 nor on windows and not with any other browser ie google-chrome safari just to name the major ones

5164933
getter	setter	accessor	properties
accessor are setter and getter methods for a properties

5164933
getter	setter	accessor	properties
so when you make properties then for setting and getting properties values you need accessor methods means setter and getter

5165016
width	height
see chris coyierâ s fluid width equal height columns

5165019
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that if i click on the webbrowser and i press ctrl+o an internet explorer dialog pop-up instead of doing what my menu item does

5165070
superclass	subclassing
i was under the impression that even though you may set a superclass variable to reference one of it s subclassing the type information of the subclassing should be retained and therefore also included in the serialised representation of that object

5165098
width	margin
by giving c a left margin it will appear to the right of a and b as there s available space for it there and because you are not assigning it any width it will occupy the remaining space

5165119
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
my first idea was extension addon for browsers then i found that opera firefox google-chrome all use javascript but not c c++ for extension development

5165148
quicksort	shellsort
if you want to implement a sorting algoritm yourself you can look at different ones like insert sort merge sort quicksort shellsort et.c

5165161
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
you can develop php python module opera firefox google-chrome plugin miranda plugin some windows service

5165178
post	get
i believe that the ideal is that the representation that you post to create a resource is the same as the representation that is returned when you get that same resource

5165178
post	get
for example if you have a property of a user such as their reputation then clearly that would be returned on get but not required on creation for post

5165178
post	get
maybe there s private information that is only returned on get when requested by the owner and that is information that you have to supply on post when creating but when another user requests the resource they don t get that information

5165187
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
as an aside do yourself a favour and look at some of the alternatives to svn such as mercurial bazaar or git

5165224
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
through this code i can istantiate the uipopovercontroller inside mycontroller class that extends uiviewcontroller inside a specific touchupinside event handler

5165296
postgresql	mysql
it also has fully support of mysql mongodb postgresql

5165309
easymock	powermockito
it also supports mocking calls using powermockito and easymock

5165338
xslt	xquery
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery

5165356
appdata	denied
i have created document set in that document i have programmatically created an tempfolder but when i access that folder it shows error like access to the path c users administrator appdata local temp mytempfolder access is denied

5165388
google-chrome	safari
i wish everyone over here would use google-chrome or safari but unfortunately ie still rules in japan.

5165610
getter	setter
you need to add setter and getter

5165610
getter	setter
when the facescontext will resolve and inject dependencies it will use setter injection so appropriate setter getter should be there.otherwise it won t find the property

5165622
put	get
not only get variables but all variables being put into query in quotes should be processed with mysql_real_escape_string no matter of their source or origin or possible dangerousness

5165650

inherited	properties
i got the implementation of these from reflector but immediately noticed that one properties was not accessible at all from a inherited class namely isscrolling and the field _scrolldata

5165788
urllib	httplib
you could try doing an equivalent post to your view from a test script using httplib and urllib as httphandler itself does

5165860
django	turbogears
it has been used to deploy many wsgi compliant python web applications and frameworks including django turbogears mercurial and trac

5165895
int	chars
you cannot convert from int to chars so this would be illegal

5165912
int	chars
chars is effectively an unsigned 16-bit int type in java

5165912
int	chars
byte short chars or int

5165932
int	chars
actually converting from int to chars is legal it just requires an explicit cast because it can potentially lose data

5165937
children	parent
as it is now i output the whole menu with wp_nav_menu but since the children is outputted inside theire parent i cant make a submenu

5165947

if you begin with an array of unsigned chars rather than an int then any direct-copying from the array needs the array to have been populated with the same endianness as on your platform

5166169
google-chrome	firefox
the extension apis for browsers with add-on functionality google-chrome firefox etc. are all very different and much of the browser-chrome-privileged code must be rewritten for the different browsers

5166524
getter	setter
declare the field as private and add a setter getter or others access methods

5166588
super	extends
in the second situation since you are redefining __init__ in num2 you need to explicitly call the one in the super class num if you want to extends its behavior

i changed the mouseover and mouseout to hover since you mentioned hovering in the question and added css rule

5167041
put	get
put that in your parent class then you can go one step further and also add this to your parent class so you get sanity checking on column names

5167068
post	get
use erikkallen s enumerator on this post to get all controls

5167140

i want to design a forum using php but the problem i am facing is that i dont know how can i put a post creator in it

5167325

whenever i access the post method operation contract i get a timeout error

5167607
post	get
but when i try accessing the post method after a successful get method everything works fine

5167632
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
public methods otoh are called from the outside world so you may have no control over the concrete arguments passed thus it is better to do explicit argument checks and handle invalid arguments appropriately by throwing a suitable runtime exception such as illegalargumentexception or for null references let the jvm throw a nullpointerexception

5167633
rss	feed
i ve setup a rss feed link on a self-hosted wordpress website clicking the rss link in safari shows the feed - because safari has a built in rss reader

5167633
rss	feed
unfortunately clicking the same rss link in chrome displays the raw xml feed

5167633
rss	feed
click the rss feed top tight of the page in a rss enabled browser safari and it uses the built in rss reader to display the rss feed

5167633
rss	feed
click the same rss feed link in chrome chrome has no built in rss reader it displays the rss feed using what looks like a custom page

5167696
content-disposition	content-type
setting the content-disposition header should help if not working try also to set the content-type as application unknown

5167785
rss	feed
i think you could use jquery to check browser s version and then redirect to the normal rss feed or redirect to a page using a feed reader plugin like zrssfeed

5167842
post	get
i m only adding to edorian s post but i ve used static get methods in the past where there is a caching engine in place and for example i might have a given person object in memcache and would rather retrieve it from the cache than going off to the database

5167914
put	get
put them in an object that you get when you load the library

5167937
photoshop	paint.net
i am pretty sure this can be done because softwares like photoshop paint.net handle this very nicely

5167941
implements	extends
i have a java class that extends jpanel and implements mouselistener and trying to duplicate some basic functionality of jbutton but with some loaded images to make things more pretty

5167946
comparator	comparable
as for the comparator if you re not using generics you also need to validate both argument for the same base type at least comparable since you re using that interface

5168004
loops	if-statement
so i can imagine i have to loops through my news and then load the display form by the return value from some sort of if-statement that checks if the news has a banner or not

5168016
mouseup	mousedown
what happens i make use of three mouse events mousedown mouseup mosemove and the paint event

5168022
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox opera safari and google-chrome i get before onload after onload then the page appears then onload

5168030
jtextfield	jlabel
i have a group of jtextfield and jlabel

5168054
hide	show
using spring-security you can not only show hide parts of a jsp with somewhat called rol but also allow disallow access based on a specified url

5168124
folder	directory
in the simplest case this should do it inside your working copy from the parent folder of your new directory

5168136
inherited	properties
aside from this the designer.cs also gets update w inherited properties such as text numericupdown.value displaymember valuemember etc w c again are already defined in the parent class

5168173
hash	md5
i would use a simple md5 hash

5168192
apache	nginx
it uses the inbound host header and any virtual hosting configuration set up with rewrite rules in apache or nginx to calculate the correct absolute url when rendering the page

5168204
int	double
thus these concerns are independent of data type float int double etc.

5168220
put	get
then on pageload you get the usertype pull the data from the table find the div where you want to put the data and then add the controls like

5168267
hide	show
after the show method is called the visible property returns a value of true until the hide method is called

5168288
shadowing	named
then you will both get a shadowing warning and at the same time a protection - only the correct option full named will be used

5168288
shadowing	named
avoiding shadowing otoh is a general necessity so the case of options is no more special in this respect than for function named etc

5168315
children	parent
i know that in entity framework i can add children to parent if i have navigation properties between them

5168315
children	parent
because if it is possible-i do not have to create all that lists of children to add after parent insert

5168323
mouseover	mouseenter
if you simply clear the timeout using cleartimeout when you mouseenter or mouseover the menu then that will solve your problem

5168323
mouseout	mouseleave
then all you have to do is reset the timeout when the next mouseout or mouseleave happens

5168364
super	abstract
well for an abstract super class you have to group everything common to both

5168384
ubuntu	linux
matteo italia on g++ 4.4.5 -o3 ubuntu linux 10.10 x86_64 with a random 180 mb file

5168384
g++	gcc

5168398
mechanize	hpricot
i just installed the latest version of ruby 1.9 - hpricot mechanize and scrubyt installed without any issues

5168417
accessor	properties
although â œatomicâ means that access to the properties is thread-safe simply making all the properties in your class atomic does not mean that your class or more generally your object graph is â œthread safeâ â thread safety cannot be expressed at the level of individual accessor methods

5168422
button	checkbox
ultimately if you can afford the real-estate i would use radio button instead or checkbox and only allow them to select 2 checkbox at the most

5168444
min	max	width	height
i have a button which max and min height x width are 1024x1360 and 72x95 pixels

5168444
width	height
the problem is the updation of height and width at lower levels i.e upto 210x280 gives out a smooth operation which is not the case with greater sizes

5168452
width	height
if you specify only a width the height will be set proportionally and thus prevent stretching of your images

5168460
width	height
they are stretched because you specified both width and height attributes for the tag

5168460
width	height
if the actual image is of different dimensions one can see how the browser has no options but to distort the image to make it fit the specified height and width

5168460
width	height
just don t specify either height or width or both and the images are going to be ok

5168481
disk	ram
compilation speed on a core i7 920 9 gb ram single 7.2 krpm disk

5168488
width	height
- if i specify a uri for the image in advance and then load the image later from that uri the width height are always -1

5168496
getter	setter
i developed an application for iphone and made all my setter and getter and handled sqlite3 database select insert delete update in appdelegate.m

5168516
getter	setter	accessor	properties
properties are atomic by default so that synthesized accessor provide robust access to properties in a multi-threaded environmentâ that is the value returned from the getter or set via the setter is always fully retrieved or set regardless of what other threads are executing concurrently

5168516
accessor	properties
if you do not specify nonatomic then in a reference counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned valueâ the implementation will be similar to the following

5168516
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic then a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

5168517
width	height
you should set the height only on the img and add the width 200px

5168534
stdout	stderr
or you can close stdout and stderr for the command being executed under unix

5168541
post	get
doing a get before a post is not necessary

5168541
post	get
if this is the case then is it possible for that data that the get sets to be the data that when unset makes the post fail on the server

5168541
post	get
update another possibility is that your get code is initializing something on the server side that your post call is missing

5168573
post	get
i want to do that so i get my xml code with the sub sub element like presented in my first post

5168618
vaadin	wicket
you could also consider vaadin gwt or wicket

5168647
mako	genshi
several templating engines support this in one way or another mako jinja and genshi are all popular choices

5168806
debian	centos
i m moving our servlets pure java running in tomcat 6 from centos to debian and faced the problem with executing commands with runtime.exec

5168809
mouse	keyboard	mousemove	keydown
i m creating a wpf application and i need to do something when i get some user input it may be keyboard mouse ... my question is if wpf have a generic event that tells me if the user have entered some input or do i have to handle all the events mousemove keydown touchdown ...

5168850
sudo	passwd
the easiest solution would be to give the user that java program logs in as the ability to run that sudo command without entering the passwd

5168883
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
although you declare request to have nsmutableurlrequest type you create an instance of nsurlrequest class which does not responds to -sethttpmethod selector

5168887
getter	setter
i don t want to memorize 100 different statements and which one to use depending on whether my method has a return value or not whether my property has both getter and setter or just one of them whether it s a full moon or not etc.

5168895
hex	binary
actually computers do all their work in binary so unless you want to go to a great deal of pointless effort to force it to do the arithmetic on the raw hex digits you ll want to parse the numbers add them and render the result back out again as hex

5168957
rtp	sip
i am able to successfully send the rtp packets to my sip server and on the other hand i am getting rtp packets from which i need to parse the header and payload

5169013
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp
this c++ library is available under lgpl and implements the rtsp rtp rtcp protocols and payload formats for many different media types

5169013
rtp	rtsp
should you choose to use standardized protocols you might want to read up on rtp and rtsp

5169034
getter	setter
using getter and setter gives you some flexibility built into the coupling of your objects

5169038
getter	setter
imo the most compelling reason for setter getter is isolating change

5169038
getter	setter
if you don t already have a setter then all client code needs to be updated to use getter setter which could be a nightmare

5169052
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
jqxhr is a superset of the browser s native xmlhttprequest object

5169052
inherited	properties
i understand that all methods and properties of the original xhr are inherited but that doesn t seem to be the case

5169107
children	parent
environment variables are only inherited from parent to their children and can t easily be set the other way around

5169108
folder	directory
just stick ci inside a folder inside your wordpress directory

5169119
getter	setter
i agree in part with the other answers regarding the use of getter and setter methods to allow for future changes but there is still a fundamental problem you are exposing the internal data of your object for other objects to modify

5169119
getter	setter
here s an interesting article on why getter and setter methods are evil it s written with java in mind but the same applies to c++

5169133
post	get
the question is pretty broad as it doesn t specify how the map gets initialized if you post a question describing how you propose to do the initialization you will likely get a more directly helpful answer

5169145
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval have a hidden feature you can specify parameters after the timeout

5169145
mouseleave	mouseenter
it s important to do it this way since the first one is the mouseenter handler and the second is the mouseleave handler

5169203
tax	shipping
include all tax and shipping charges

5169210
getter	setter
getter and setter are indeed a good practice in most cases

5169238
cpython	pypy
there is also psyco the forerunner of pypy which can provide performance boosts to many python scripts without changing out the whole interpreter and cpython which lets you write high-performance c libraries for python using something very much like python syntax

5169259
cpython	pypy
i could see python gaining v8 speed in the future if a jit a la pypy gets implemented for cpython but that does not seem likely for the coming years the focus right now is python 3 adoption not a jit

5169277
avr	microcontroller
the avr is a modified harvard architecture 8-bit risc single chip microcontroller which was developed by atmel in 1996

5169277
avr	microcontroller
the avr was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage as opposed to one-time programmable rom eprom or eeprom used by other microcontroller at the time

5169278
avr	microcontroller
avr refers to two families of either 8- or 32-bit risc microcontroller

5169307
keydown	keyup
the second method is to keep the spark textinput control but to use a very short timer in your keyup or keydown event to let the text property be fully filled with the barcode scan data -- i don t know exactly why this works but it does

5169346
youtube	vimeo
it is also widely used by streaming internet sources such as videos from vimeo youtube and the itunes store web software such as the adobe flash player and microsoft silverlight broadcast services for dvb and sbtvd direct-broadcast satellite television services cable television services and real-time video conferencing

5169383
width	height
edit after charles comment i m wrong about this and the problem probably comes from the display inline-block not well understood hence the width height not applied because the anchor is treated like inline

5169517
width	margin
how can i set an image to have a width based on the main view it is located on and to let it have a margin of for example 50 pixels on both sides

5169517
width	height
and if it s overruled how can i give the image a fixed height and a flexible width

5169543
width	height
i want them displayed in a grid just like facebook does every picture with the same width and height

5169544
bridj	jnaerator
jnaerator does exactly that it reads c c++ objectivec headers and outputs java bindings that rely on bridj c c++ jna c only or rococoa objectivec uses jna

5169552
getter	setter
so instead of having to write the getter and setter you just have to write a property and the compiler does the rest

5169552
getter	setter
you still have the option of writing the getter and setter but you don t have to write all of the boiler plate code for what should just be 1 line

5169573
post	get
you can use a default form action to get post back the values and therefore also use the normal jquery methods without additional

5169606
bridj	jnaerator
bridj was designed on purpose for that and it s supported by jnaerator which will parse your c c++ headers and spit out the java bindings for you

5169643
webkit	gecko	google-chrome	firefox
last point the day that google-chrome gets a fully-featured firebug is the day firefox basically dies for developers because firefox had 3 years to make firefox s layout engine gecko as fast as webkit and they didn t

5169643
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is simply a better browser until firefox upgrades their javascript engine

5169647
children	parent
tries to repaint its children and the children tries to repaint its parent - then i assume we re talking about a loop

5169647
width	height
i don t think that was the solution itself but instead of using width and height from the graphics instance i tried using widht and height from the jpanel itself

5169647
width	height
i m not quite sure why things go wrong when i use width and height from the graphics instance

5169647
width	height
i thought the width and height from the graphics instance was already prepared with regard to dimensions from the jpanel component

5169658
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have created a custom combocheck which extends the spark dropdownlistfor that is a dropdownlistfor of checkbox

5169668
bridj	jnaerator
you should give a look at bridj and jnaerator

5169669
free	malloc
you should check if malloc succedded and make sure you free also make sure on copy_link that none of the args is null

5169694
maven	pom.xml
lots of jars out there in the maven repositories have their dependencies not correctly defined in their pom.xml file

5169695
integer	unsigned
as i is an unsigned integer 0 - 255 i will equal 0 after 8 iterations due to binary round off

5169696
pdfsharp	migradoc
use migradoc pdfsharp and go the code way without any visual designer

5169697
post	get
i am working on api the api supports both https post and https get methods

5169723
children	parent
children tries to repaint its parent -

5169817
pull	push
when direct push and pull are not available or when exporting an entire

5169818
maven	pom.xml
using sed i want to search a string and replace that with other in maven pom.xml

5169846
sudo	passwd
assuming there is a sess.getstdin you should be able to pipe in a passwd to the sudo command

5169861
put	get
first you should put your ... .val lines inside the submit function or else they will get the value of the select boxes when the page loads

5169887
integer	unsigned
1000 0000 0000 1100 signed int value -12 and a large unsigned integer

5169887
integer	unsigned
unsigned int x -12 takes -12 as an integer and stores it into x

5169900
folder	directory
there actually is a difference between a directory and a folder and both terms are used correctly here

5169900
folder	directory
like windows explorer the folderbrowserdialog which as benny almost mentioned calls shbrowseforfolder presents an abstract view of folder 1 not a direct view of the drives and directory of the file system

5169900
folder	directory
although the shbrowseforfolder function can return any namespace folder the folderbrowserdialog uses the bif_returnonlyfsdirs flag to restrict returns to only folder that represent file system directory

5169900
folder	directory
nonetheless though it does browse by folder even if it will only retrieve the path to a directory

5169900
folder	directory
2 most modern file browsers borrow the metaphor of folder representing directory graphically with folder icons but the abstract concept of folder as presented here is a windows concept that isn t universally present across platforms

5169913
post	put
it will help you interpret post methods with parameter _method with value delete as put

5170037
integer	unsigned
the compiler generates code to move this signed integer into your unsigned integer x which is also a 32 bit entity

5170037
integer	unsigned
if you wanted to assign a value to x and were not sure whether the value on the right side of the equals was positive you could have written and forced the compiler to generate code to take the absolute value of a signed integer before moving it to the unsigned integer

i would suggest reading up on linq particularly iqueryable vs ienumerable

5182499
ienumerable	iqueryable
the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql

5182499
ienumerable	iqueryable
however the heavy lifting of pulling records out of a data store and creating in-memory object representations has to be done at some time and iqueryable linq will almost certainly be faster than instantiating all records as in-memory objects then using ienumerable linq linq 2 objects to filter to get your actual data

5182501

5197477
rss	feed
however there s a big gotcha to be aware of - if you use advanced forums the rss feed for the forum categories will stop working

5197477
rss	feed
my guess is because forums uses taxonomy vocab terms for the forum categories and it seems the rss feed uses the items taxonomy term array to generate the feed

5197477
rss	feed
now my site successfully 404s any request for taxonomy term and rss feed still work

5197921
hash	salt
there is some benefit to also using a site-wide salt on top of the per-user salt this will prevent possible collisions with password hash stored at other sites and prevent the use of general-purpose rainbow tables although even 32 bits of salt is enough to make rainbow tables an impractical attack

superclass	subclassing
by the way i don t think there will be any problem subclassing uibutton no matter what you ve heard as long as your implementation is correctly added to the superclass implementation or does responsibly override it altogether

5205024
websphere	ibm
so i believe that ibm guys tested it with websphere

5205034

5205038
int	chars
there is a function unicode in t-sql that returns the unicode int value for a chars

typedef	struct
you can typedef a struct before defining it

5205195
maven	pom.xml
when running mvn install then the created source tar ball and the pom.xml file is installed to the local maven repository

5205202
width	height
when i step through the code there are 10 elements in the array and all of the textviews are there so i would expect to see the 400px linearlayout filled with 10 relative layouts one after another each with 50px height and fill_parent width reading test - but all i see is one as if only one got added or they are all positioned on top of one another

5205214

5205247
int	boolean
linq-to-sql interprets a bit field as a boolean value not an int value

5205250
base	fractions
decimal obviously enough uses base 10 so fractions can be composed of a sum of powers of 2 and powers of 5

5205445
hide	show
i have been looking at the blink plugin but as far as i can see it only does show hide on an element

5205451
subtract	add
you could count the users once and then create stored procedures that subtract from the user count when members are removed and add to the number when members are added

5205554
ant	maven
maven support for alfresco might look chaotic because alfresco itself is currently built as an ant project so that what s currently supported by the community projects you probably used are just the most common use cases -- developing an alfresco extension a share extension or a plugin amp in the alfresco jargon

5205599
hash	salt
so far i have a salt sha1 hash made from mixing username password and my salt variable

this part overrides my entities with public setter and getter

5205838
google-chrome	safari
since both safari and google-chrome run on webkit the browser.safari actually selects google-chrome as well..i definitely do not consider this an optimal solution

5205869
width	height
what matters in textsize is to set the row width for the width attribute and an height value which is large enough to host the text

5205915
udp	tcp
so my question is that suppose i give the type parameter as sock_stream which is reliable and add the protocol number for udp would it give me a reliable udp which is same as tcp but without flow control and congestion control

5205926
textarea	textbox
i just can t get this input textbox textarea and the button to be aligned like that and to be honest the tutor isn t doing a great job to clearing stuff out

5205943
udp	tcp
for an ipv4 or ipv6 protocol stack sock_stream is going to get you tcp and the type sock_dgram is going to give you udp

5206007
textinput	textfield
i d like to add a textinput that automatically grabs this information for the user and displays it in the textfield

5206009
persistent	transient
transient persistent errors inserting the object graph in one session

5206019
stdout	stderr
the reason is that the first two commands produce output to stdout but not stderr whereas the latter will produce output on stderr since you are not giving valid parameters to tar but not on stdout

5206019
stdout	stderr
using to redirect the standard output and to redirect the error output to different files you can see that tar produces messages on stderr and the other two on stdout file sizes for the other files are zero there was no output

5206047
client-side	server-side
that server-side script could fetch the specified page and parse out the title then return it to the client-side javascript

5206051
int	boolean
i have been thinking about this and using a little bit and i found it to be more helpful that just return a boolean an int or to go all the way to the over creating a class to return state and some values associated to that state and i really find practical to return a simple enum my code seems more readable and i don t have all the burden of the exception because as i read one exception should be exceptional

5206065
serializable	deserialization
if you can define structure of json messages you can use wcf and its build in serializable deserialization of json messages to .net types

5206080
post	get
i thought i d post here to see if i can get confirmation

5206083
children	parent
edit as you pointed out in the comments below the children should be tied to the parent by the end of the contstructor

5206119

5206286
nsmenu	nsstatusbar
essentially i have an nsstatusbar item with an nsmenu attached as the menu

5206286
nsmenu	nsstatusbar	nsmenuitem	nsstatusbar
as i say in ib i have connected the nsmenu to statusmenu in the application delegate thus the menu all shows up under the nsstatusbar and i have connected an nsmenuitem within the nsmenu to the nsobject with the application delegate class and hooked it up to call showpreferencepanel but nothing happens when i run it

5206299

int main int argc chars argv

5206363
sorting	filtering
i am trying to implement a kohana sorting filtering for a virtual store meaning that whenever i want to sort some products after price etc i must only select the sorting criteria from a list

5206378
sorting	filtering
now you can return the strongly-typed list of objects out of your business layer and your ui layer can use linq or whatever to do sorting filtering paging

5206414
octal	decimal
the easiest workaround would be to simply write the numbers in decimal format 07001 in octal is the same as 3585 in decimal i think

width	height
note that on some opengl versions width and height must be powers of two

5206538

5207590
multiplying	add
the exact function that should be used to generate a true maximum load varies quite a bit with the exact details of the processor micro-architecture different machines have different load store bandwidth in proportion to the number and width of multiplying and add functional units but numerical software libraries and signal processing libraries are great things to start with

5207652
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
for generic java applications i would recommend amazon-web-services if the costs associated with beanstalk and rds are not too high

5207914
nginx	lighttpd
use nginx lighttpd

5207929
gridview	repeater
never used a repeater but with some simple jquery and html i think you can get the same effect without the bloatedness of the gridview controls

5207935
nhibernate	automapper
okay so i have an issue at the moment which is either down to automapper my nhibernate query or domain dto design

5207935

implements	extends
and i believe some portlet apis also use a non- httpservlet class they just implements servlet and don t extends httpservlet

5208321
put	get	post	get	post	put
as to the http methods next to http get and post there are also head put options etc

5208321
post	get
but when it comes to homegrown servlets then it are indeed get and post which gets the lone attention

5208335
int	double
1 if as the name indicates this converts an ipv4 value s ina string to an unsigned int the return type os not double as you say - it would be ctypes.c_uint32

5208335
int	double
2 your example value is not a valit ipv4 address and cannot be converted to a 32 bit int neither does it makes sense as a double - a 64 bit floating point number - it is simply invalid

5208450
post	get
however when i dont add it i can get the other post data but of course no file upload

5208454
superclass	subclassing
i mean that the superclass rely on subclassing methods

5208455
min	max	minimum	max	range	max	range	minimum	range	min
if we assume that you know the maximum and minimum values of all numbers in the array or can at least limit them to some maximum range say max - min + 1 then create an auxiliary array of that size initialized to all zeros say auxarray

int	chars
by using a chars pointer you point to the first byte and change it to 0x00 which changes the int to 256 256 1 + 0

5208587
width	height
why have they not used coordinates according to image width and height

5208602
tabs	tabpanel
i have a rich tabpanel with about 5 tabs

5208603
int	chars
so basically the problem is not that you have data loss is that the chars pointer points only to the first byte of the int and so it changes only that the other bytes are not changed and that s why those weird value if you are on an intel processor the first byte is the least significant that s why you change the smallest part of the number

5208604
int	chars
so in your case the int pointer refers to a block 4 bytes in size while a chars is only one byte long

5208604
int	chars
when you set the chars to 0 it only changes the first byte of the int value but because of how numbers are stored in memory on modern machines effectively in reverse order from how you would write it you are overwritting the least significant byte which was 4 you are left w 256 as the value

allocate a uitabbarcontroller a uinavigationcontroller and 2 uiviewcontroller

5208609
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
now you have a uiviewcontroller and a uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller inside it

5208629
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
however in the performance perspective implementing a view container such as uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller would be most effective

5208673
integer	unsigned
u treats the integer as unsigned whereas d treats the integer as signed

5208675
put	get
this is an edit multiple situation so i created two new controller actions select which handles the get request and the view and assign which handles the put request from the checkboxes in the select view

5208801
hide	show
i think that jquery will return an object with following methods and property which we use on them like hide and show

5208856
inherited	subclassing
it usually does not involve hiding all methods since those are the public or in some cases inherited contract between the class and the client classes and or subclassing of that class

5208871
ssl	https
- ssl tls support in case of ftps and https

5208872
textarea	textbox
similarly i wanted that the applet should appear when the user clicks on textbox textarea element and after some operations the result in the applet textbox should go into the html text element

5208926
getter	setter
say i have a property whose setter is protected by a lock but without any lock around the getter

5208932
udp	tcp
given your gps coordinates are periodically updated you could consider using udp instead of tcp

5208962
strsplit	substr
your data is a mixture of fixed width and comma delimited column 6 and you can use substr and strsplit to separate your lines columns

5208990
rspec	machinist
i m using rails 3 machinist 2 cucumber and rspec all together and have two blueprints.rb files

5209035
actionscript	haxe
this is a separate language that compiles into other languages so you can code in haxe and have it compile into actionscript javascript php and a few more

5209049
floor	sqrt
using fromintegral is necessary because the incoming type is int but the functions floor and sqrt operate on types realfrac and floating respectively

5209120
post	get
if i post this i get 3 results for context

5209120
post	get
but when i post it i only get results for the first and not for the ajax-loaded ones

5209192
post	get
here s what i get link to image sorry i don t have enough reputation to post images

5209207
selecteditem	selectedindex
since selecteditem and selectedindex are currently under the private set rule indeed you cannot modify them through the application

5209228
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that for some reason location.reload effectively is not a writable property in firefox and google-chrome

5209228
opera	safari
alternatively you can limit your testing to ie safari and opera in which .reload is writable

5209229
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you can achieve this using graphics2d and bufferedimage

5209264
switching	screens
any attempt to switching back to it when it is running causes crash or black frozen screens

5209312
width	height
that said for pixel perfect operations you often have to often the texture coordinates by a fraction the image s pixel width say 0.5f float image- width and height in order to make sure opengl or d3d samples from the correct place

5209317
daemons	systemd
the biggest problem with storing the pid in the file is that a low-numbered pid used by a systemd start up daemons can get reused on a subsequent reboot by a different daemons

5209349
awt	swing	swt	swing
after that the details vary depending on the window toolkit awt swt swing etc. you re going to use

5209349
awt	swing	swt	swing
there s not much difference between swing and awt you create a frame add the canvas to the frame and add an eventlistener for opengl events reshape draw etc. as i recall swt changes things a bit more but it s been long enough that i don t remember the details

5209350
peer	p2p
the program i m writing aims to create a p2p network of jocaml runtimes which all make private computations and store their results locally relying on data stored in other peer of the network

5209350
peer	p2p
p2p network of peer on the internet so 1-1 connection between any two nodes

5209366
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview willdisplaycell uitableviewcell cell forrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5209392
cruisecontrol	teamcity	cruisecontrol	jenkins	teamcity	jenkins
cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net teamcity and hudson jenkins are all good choices for that

5209426
width	height
if i load any new views whilst in landscape mode i get inverted width and height values on the loaded view s frame

5209437
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
furthermore we need this functionality on all other browsers google-chrome opera and safari except for ie

5209449
versioning	upgrade
partitions are upgrade to versioning 662

5209465
int	chars
2 an app that determines whether chars string x is an identifier or int or whatever

5209476
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and safari and firefox showed it in one form or another

5209476
firefox	safari
safari showed it as blue firefox showed it as a dotted outline.

5209487
nhibernate	automapper
make sure that your source object along with its collections is eagerly loaded from the database before passing it to the mapping layer or you cannot blame automapper for being slow because when it tries to map one of the collections of your source object it hits the database because nhibernate didn t fetch this collection

5209498
hide	show
the order should be show loader open box hide loader then finally scroll to content

5209498
hide	show
instead it seems like this is what s actually happening when i test it show loader hide loader scroll to content then open box

5209511
hash	md5
use md5 hash of column data for unique keys

5209511
hash	md5
then either have your php script calculate the md5 hash of the text fields or have mysql do it as in the following

5209586
composite	memento
i d suggest to use a composite memento serializable into xml

5209608
listview	gridview
if you can get away with it gridview and listview can be much easier to work with using adapters such as arrayadapter and cursoradapter

5209632
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

5209651
mouseup	mousedown
what i would like is for textbox.leave to be triggered by mouseup not mousedown

5209655
hash	salt
using sha-512 is a good idea to get a cryptographically strong hash but your choice of a salt does not add much extra security

5209655
hash	salt
if the salt is known then the attacker can just precompute a table of hash values with the salt hardcoded in

5209655
hash	salt
if i wanted to attack your system i could iterate across a bunch of known strings deterministically compute the salt for each string then compute the sha-512 hash of the salt string and store it in a table

5209655
hash	salt
if you want a better security system instead consider using a salt that s randomly-generated and then stored alongside the resulting hash

5209688
int	chars
this function takes three arguments a pointer to a string chars a pointer to an int holding the size of that string and a file pointer and returns the length of the line read

5209688
realloc	malloc
getline dynamically allocates space for the string using malloc realloc and thus you do not need to know the length of the line and there are no buffer overruns

5209718
hash	salt
additionally use a random and unique salt for each hash operation and store it together with the hash to be able to reproduce the hash for comparison

5209740
ienumerable	iqueryable
but if you really want to do it in lambda expressions and linq then your problem with the above code is that .select ... returns an ienumerable iqueryable which creates a new query but doesn t execute your lambda expressions

5209740
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could force the lambda to evaluate by calling an extension method that forces an enumeration of the data the ienumerable iqueryable represents

5209760
int	boolean
o1 o2 can be primitive types long int boolean strings or arrays

5209850
width	height
i believe that has the display inline by default so width and height do not affect it

5209866
post	get
you get one single global feed that combines all the comments from all the post into one giant feed

5209870
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
if you prefer line-oriented reading instead you could wrap the fileinputstream in an inputstreamreader which you can then pass to a bufferedreader

5209884
next	except
it is like the next command except that when until encounters a jump it automatically continues execution until the program counter is greater than the address of the jump

5209915
ssl	https
i ve been using perl s mechanize library but for some reason with https the timeout parameter i m using crypt ssleay for ssl

5209936
cpu	processors
the two have slight differences in semantics but it may be enough to know that a sched_rr task will eventually relinquish the processors to another task of the same priority due to time slices while a sched_fifo task will only relinquish the cpu to another task of the same priority due to blocking i o or an explicit call to sched_yield 2

5209937
qstring	qdebug
inline qdebug operator const qstring t stream- ts t

5209954
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to fadein an fadeout items in the array to a div

5209954
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to make this work in a fadein fadeout manner

5209965
disk	ram
you create a complete snapshot of the computer s ram cpu registers and i o registers by simply copying it all to hard disk without any modifications or re-orderings

5210035
fadein	fadeout
the code you re using won t work for various reasons - having zero delay between calling fadeout and fadein means you won t get the 3 second delay you re looking for between fading in and out and that calling both functions lead to some strange effects with the jquery effects queue

5210049
pull	push
i think you just forgot to push your changes on one side and then do a pull on the other side

5210146
children	parent
the whole point of the inherited scale is that when you place some items in a parent mc and you start to scale the parent all the children follow suit

5210153
versioning	upgrade
however for the visitors who for some reason don t want to upgrade their silverlight versioning they are seeing this annoying message on every single page load

5210161
firefox	safari
when i use border-radius to create rounded borders in css3 it just works fine on safari firefox and so on

5210188
getter	setter
in my implementation i have getter and setter like below

5210188
getter	setter
i want to use properties and synthesize the getter and setter but have a few questions

5210188
getter	setter
readwrite so both getter and setter are present

5210243
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it is common though not always required to use copy semantics for nsstring properties to avoid issues with nsmutablestring objects being changed behind your back

5210258
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the releasedate property setter can t be synthesized as you re transforming a nsstring into a nsdate to store it that also avoids common issues with nsstring properties for which you d better use copy to avoid problems with nsmutablestring

5210290
memcpy	memset
when moving setting small blocks of memory i prefer using intrinsics based on rep movsb and rep stosb rather than calling memcpy memset which are usually both optimized for larger blocks and not especially limited in size

5210318
apache	nginx
btw2 i added the python tag because i currently use python django apache and nginx linux and some lame developers use windows

5210384
versioning	upgrade
i am using catalyst for an application and am getting ready to upgrade the production versioning to the next major release

5210408
division	multiplication
so no multiplication or division

5210479
firefox	safari
i ve kept the pngs as small as possible and optimised as possible but when testing it in any browser safari firefox ies it takes at least 2 seconds to render

5210491
filtering	grouping
alternatively you can use the not filtering to remove the current input selector from the grouping

5210494
lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml	erlang	scheme	ocaml	scheme
in reality almost all functional programming languages lisp scheme clojure scala standard ml ocaml f# erlang are impure and rely upon uncontrolled side effects

5210501
teamcity	dotcover
i wanted to take advantage of included dotcover in teamcity 6

5210509
versioning	upgrade
i read about this being a bug and upgrade to a newer versioning of glassfish to solve the bug

5210515
anjuta	gedit
you can also use a full grown ide to edit your sources such as sharpdevelop or anjuta but i find gedit and a terminal to be my preferable dev tools for c

5210515
vim	gedit
one reason being that i actually have to do everything myself mostly so i know what s going on the same can be achieved with vim instead of gedit

5210519
uiview	subviews
as example you could have your own class uiview which uses a subviews

5210596
minimum	max
the problem is that if the region is not a rectangle the function will still returns true as it looks at the max and minimum coordinates to create the square

5210672
jpopupmenu	jmenuitem
in my java swing application i have noticed that when i click on a disabled jmenuitem in a jpopupmenu it hides the menu but i i do not want to hide it as if nothing is clicked

5210682
explode	implode
i was gonna go with an explode implode but this is better and shorter

5210690
put	get
you put implementations into the directory and they get auto-discovered

5210718
cos	sin
these values will be passed to sin cos tan functions and will return the proper values to be used in glut camera

5210722
actionscript	mxml
it has the same actionscript language but uses a tag based syntax called mxml similar to silverlight

5210737
int	double
float is a type like int or double

5210785
filtering	grouping
there are reasons for separate tables such as not having to include categories or filtering and logically separating entries that should not be grouping blog comments vs news comments

5210802
cos	sin
then sin a is defined as the amount of rightwards and cos a and the amount of forwards to reach the point at angle a on the unit circle

5210802
cos	sin
tan sin cos so as we approach n pi 2 90â it diverges to + - infinity

5210810
post	get
you can also add an order by latest desc to the end of the query if you wish to get an ordered list of the latest post across all user ids

5210834
children	parent
edit alternatively you could build a view linking parent to all its children and use that view as a basis for tying items

5210846
post	put
therefore it was using the put method to post my form

5210867
implements	extends
i usually suffix the name of classes of what they extends or implements

5210873
min	max
also nice is to print out result that have the same max or min value different characters on different kart or bike that add up to the same value

5210951
queue	fifo
make sure you use a fifo queue

5210971
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

5211031
switching	airplane
switching to airplane mode

5211100
nsstring	nsdata
this method recursively validates that all the contained objects are property list objects instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary before writing out the file and returns no if all the objects are not property list objects since the resultant file would not be a valid property list

5211101
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox but blows up on google-chrome

5211116
getter	setter
what i m trying to figure out is if i should have a getter and setter method for each field in the database or should i just pull in the entire row and just grab the particular column i need inside of php

5211148
min	max
the user is only specifying colors for each level not the value which determines min and max

5211148
min	max
57 would result in a color hue in between positive min and positive max

5211160
google-chrome	firefox
i simply want to reuse my code from my google-chrome extension by hosting a webapp online and including it in the extension both google-chrome and firefox by using a popup window

5211162
integer	unsigned
doubtless this seems like a strange request given the availability of tostring and convert.tostring but i need to convert an unsigned integer uint32 to its string representation but i need to store the answer into a

5211183
google-chrome	safari
try to verify that the problem with the horizontal scrollbar exist in google-chrome or safari web browsers

5211183
width	height
setting the grid height explicitly like height 120px instead of height auto can also follows to vertical scroll bar which will take the grid width

5211203
printwriter	bufferedwriter
the printwriter could also delegate its operations to a bufferedwriter if desired

5211216
printwriter	bufferedwriter
if you need the buffer you can wrap the bufferedwriter in a printwriter

5211222
postorder	inorder
printing can be done pre-order or inorder as here or postorder

5211243
uitableview	uisearchbar
the alternative would be to write your own uisearchbar and uitableview combination similar to how uisearchdisplaycontroller works then you ll get better control

5211272
versioning	upgrade
so in case anyone else is struggling with a similar issue - upgrade to the latest versioning that should resolve it

5211292
folder	dir
open mkspecs folder inside qt dir

5211334
put	get
but it would be great if i could put in my directory zip-file with arbitrary name click on my bat-file and get the exe-file with the name same as my archive s name

5211359
put	get
so while i now get why the outputstream connected to a socket needs to be flushed when data should be sent immediately i still don t get why i need to put a newline at the end of the string

5211362
submit	submission
i use the plugin on a very large project for various things and i generally handle that myself via some additional code to track whether a form is in mid submission and avoid entering the function to submit again if it is

5211435
hash	salt
if you re only using this for the purposes of authentication you shouldn t store the password itself but rather a salt hash of the password

5211435
hash	salt
there are some good php specific tips in the existing how to hash and salt passwords question

5211439
post	get
i m trying to get this post value of this variable but i can t access it

5211445
hash	salt
you might want to consider storing a salt hash of the password instead of encryptint the entire xml file

5211468
filtering	grouping
additional to the answer posted if you are filtering for a single query you should - for performance reasons - add the poll_answers to the grouping sub query since you only want to count the votes for a single poll not the entire table

5211469
min	max
the min and max functions provide a key argument for exactly this purpose

5211469
min	max
if you do want to apply this to much larger data sets you could find the driver and vehicle with the min and max for each stat and then for each stat combine the max driver with the max vehicle and the min driver with the min vehicle

5211512
folder	directory
in an attempt to find out what was going on with my documents directory i enabled file sharing and instead of seeing the file i copied i get an inbox folder and upon copying that folder to the desktop i see that my files are in there

5211518

5211558
qdialog	qwidget
how can i cast qdialog to qwidget or is there any other workaround other than doing the whole design over again

5211601
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
also i would like that any of the installation packages could remove upgrade a previous versioning of any of the other packages

5211623
post	get
the java program would use http s get post processing to send receive messages to the cics cobol program

5211635
qdialog	qwidget
for that the simplest path is to change your class to inherit from qwidget directly rather than qdialog

5211635
qdialog	qwidget
also qdialog inherits from qwidget

5211635
qdialog	qwidget
no type-casting necessary to use a qdialog when a qwidget is expected

5211648
put	get
with a wildcard and the word extends it means that you can get b out of the object but you cannot put anything in the object in a type safe way

5211652
median	rank
3 races find the rank of the median of median

5211652
median	rank

5211652
median	rank
1 race similar to a binary search check the rank of another median 29

5211671
post	get
as ajsoaks says in case if there is 302 error you should repeat the request but this time using get method instead of previous post

5211671
firefox	safari
the new url you can see in the browser or if you want it is very useful also in the future checking it with firebug firefox plugin or safari web inspector

5211675
udp	tcp
if c can talk to a at all it must use 1.2.3.4 and r must be configured to relay packets addressed to 1.2.3.4 to a in typical configurations r will only do this on certain tcp or udp ports if at all

5211679
onresume	onpause

can you just put them all into a map with the ids as keys then get the values collection of that

5211718
post	get
try using this optimized code if you still get error post it here edit your original question and we ll see

5211739
spaces	delimiter
the first takes the output of w uses grep to only select the line with load and then cuts everything except for the 11th chunk of data delimiter is a spaces which is the first load number with a comma

5211761
post	get	draggable	droppable
the callback would need to a identify the id of the draggable item b the target list based on which droppable tab it was droppped on and c send both to a php script via get post which would do the database interaction moving the item from one database table to another

5211763
put	get
you may get better results from the compiler if you put in expected function signatures everywhere so that the type checker can tell you where it went wrong

5211763
int	chars
specifically your expression 1 x or n x fail to be of the type chars int so they don t match the type inside the list you re feeding it

5211776
onresume	onpause
enable it by calling enablemylocation onresume and disablemylocation onpause

5211784
cos	sin
it should support + - special functions cos sin and constants pi e and parenthesis

5211794
post	get
as to why they are using a get rather than a post that is odd behavior

5211814
put	get
and i can t figure out what to put instead of the question marks in order to get the value of the element into the value

5211831
submit	submission
in any case when you submit the form from firefox you should see that the url of the form submission appears in the firefox address bar

5211832
post	get
i have been trying to get the jquery address plugin to work properly for about 12 hours now thus i figured its time to post

5211843

children	parent
wherever a tag claims its parent its children should replicate beneath

5212211
children	parent
if kampala uganda had other tags that claimed it as a parent these children would cascade beneath kampala uganda in each instance

5212290
centos	linux
i have a php cakephp based app running on linux centos and mysql

5212330
hide	show
for example if you know ahead of time what the graph html is going to look like couldn t you just hide it in the html and insert an anchor tag before it and show it with javascript

5212338
google-chrome	firefox
i am getting this behavior in both firefox google-chrome and internet explorer on windows

5212344
jruby	mri
most of jruby s documented success stories involve the ability to access java from ruby. also it is possible to run jruby on systems that may be difficult or impossible to get mri to run on

5212344
jruby	mri
there are some differences between mri and other c-based rubies and jruby you should be aware of

5212404
scrollable	panels
i have a jquery scrollable on a page where on the third scrollable panels there is a form

5212418
clang	llvm
the -xclang flag is a llvm driver option for â œpass argument to the clang compiler â and the the argument

5212418
put	get
so if you put them in reversed order the compiler will use -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2 as cflag which isnâ t and get you the error in return

5212438
touchesbegan	touchesended
turns out that this older type of animation doesn t seem to block new touchesbegan or touchesended

5212479
prepare	execute
instead since you are prepare to accept the use of execute i think the quickest and easiest solution will be to use a tool like reshacker

5212499
rss	feed
someone else might have a better answer but i would do something like this - good post about creating an rss feed

5212503
int	chars
but then all tuples in that list must be of type chars int

5212508
width	height
a rectangle is also going to need a width and height

5212608
textview	imageview
the items of the list are made of several textview imageview linearlayout i set for each focusable false it changed nothing dynamically inflated with a view holder

5212630
int	chars
sadly from its origins of the c programming language chars pointers to chars are not treated as just a pointer to a type like int pointer to int or float pointer to a float but many library functions treat these as nul-character terminated strings

5212646
single-quotes	double-quotes
in a regular expression for patterns every char is considered must be there and as you have the whole of the command quoted in single-quotes the shell will not strip away the double-quotes

5212663
sorting	filtering
i am using isotope for the thumbnail layout which allows sorting and filtering

5212681
post	put
tell the ajax form in your part s .cshtml razor view file to post to your controller action ajax.beginform and put the returned data in some existing div

5212736
setinterval	settimeout
this is also why i would use the settimeout in the last line instead of the setinterval you use because the script may not have cycled through all of the elements before you want it to start again

5212763
portrait	landscape
i ve chosen this way because the whole tab bar view logic runs in portrait orientation while the navigation view controller does its job in landscape orientation

5212763
portrait	landscape
the first run is always fine when it starts with any portrait view via tab bar changing to the landscape view of the navigation view controller

5212763
post	put
i ve decided not to post any code lines because there is lots of it and might not make sense to put it right in here

5212950
stdout	stderr
the subprocess.popen mechanism uses an underlying file descriptor instead of a file-like object to write its stdout stderr

5212950
stdout	stderr
i need to capture both stdout and stderr while still displaying them to the console

5213038
jboss	glassfish	apache	nginx
3 your business logic can be processed by application server sort of jboss glassfish etc when we talk about java but javascript is static so it can be server by http server like apache or better lighttd nginx

5213145
onresume	onpause
i know that glsurfaceview s onpause destroys it s content and onresume should rebuild it but it wouldn t work for me

5213147
puts	gets
what this gets you is code reuse any table can return an instance of your tttablemessageitem subclass and get an appropriately colored title rather than the above technique which is a bit of a hack because it puts the cell color knowledge in the table view delegate which isn t really the right place for it

5213148
return-value-optimization	nrvo
nrvo and return-value-optimization are different optimizations

5213157

5213265
google-chrome	firefox
this is working perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but for some strange reason it reacts strange in ie8 haven t tested earlier versions of ie

5213301
hide	show
either that or if you know the id of the panel you can manually use javascript and bind the change event to a function that checks the values and show hide the panel accordingly

5213344
children	parent
produces all the children from the string value of the handle attribute of the first only item child of their parent sibling

5213349
switching	screens
the prime examples are for search engines to promote content in the searcher s known languages higher than other content and for screens readers to switching to a pronunciation library for the language the content is in

5213355
fadein	scrolltop
what i want is this first load the content then fade in and scroll to the top at the same time then finally change the color after fadein and scrolltop are both done

5213355
fadein	scrolltop
let s say the scrolltop animation takes twice as long than the fadein animation

5213355
fadein	scrolltop
what simple piece of code would i add to my code so that the scrolltop callback in fadein doesn t wait for the fadein animation to complete

5213355
fadein	scrolltop
so the only change whatever it might be would affect the callback within fadein where scrolltop is called

5213366
ubuntu	centos
if i understood correctly your centos installation is not in the virtual host document root while it is on your ubuntu workstation

5213391
free	malloc
free free-s the exact same amount you allocated with malloc but it is not as smart as you think

5213399
dictionary	map
since you are usually going to access columns by the name this sounds like a good place to use a map dictionary class in c# that maps strings to columns string arrays

5213402
preorder	inorder
example preorder abcdef inorder fedcba tree

5213467
fadein	scrolltop
move the code that animates scrolltop outside of the callback to the fadein function

5213502
jax-ws	jax-rs
apis like jax-ws and jax-rs

5214081

you can show hide anything in your theme implementation

5221864
filtering	grouping
5 you may or may not care about grouping delay which is a measure of the distortion caused by different frequencies taking different times to pass through the filtering

5221906
sorting	grouping
i changed the sorting property within the milestones grouping to completiondate and it seems to be working fine now

5221907

i am not entirely sure why this is the case but from what i found while trying to debugging this there are some things that are gotten from the user s profiling

5221971
public	protected
and like already said var is an old syntax you should now give a visibility to your variable with public protected or private like in c++ or java

5221971
public	protected
in your case you want to use public or protected

5221971
getter	setter
usually getter and setter are defined at the same level ie the same class and there s no point in instantiating a test object in a variable from core

5221991
ubuntu	debian
you can find out more about patchutils here and it s packaged in debian ubuntu as patchutils

5222018
for-loop	arrays
if you have to go that way i would just go for a for-loop iterating the elements of the bi-dimensional arrays and initializing them

5222056
integer	unsigned
i understand that this is an unsigned integer so my question is how to convert this value to a range of -1 to 1

5222099
filtering	grouping
you need to specify the parameters of your filtering sample rate cut-off frequency width of transition band pass-band ripple minimum stop-band rejection whether phase and grouping delay are an issue etc

5222193
width	height
with ax and ay the coordinates of a and bx by the coordinates of b and assuming the centre of the rectangle with width w and height h is at 0 0 the following should work

webm files - vp8 video codec and vorbis audio codecs

5222222
folder	directory
i browse to the php directory and then the ext folder where it copied the dll files to

5222224
width	height
after it rotates set its width and height to be the width and height of the page

5222224
width	height
if you change say the image s height and width to be 100 then you only need to change the size of the div and the image should scale with it

5222319
getter	setter
you can set setter getter for properties of objects though

5222326
setcontentview	findviewbyid
in order for findviewbyid to work you must have previously called setcontentview

5222342

int	chars
the next few chars it is likely to meet will be the int itself and depending on the endian-ness the zero byte will be either the first or second

5222446
oncreate	setcontentview
when you are extending activity there should be a method oncreate in which you need to setcontentview r.id.textview1

5222447
cumsum	tapply
you can create a data.frame and assign the elements to groups using diff ifelse and cumsum then aggregate using tapply

5222470
for-loop	arrays
currently i have the oncreate call an asynctask that has a for-loop which iterates through an arrays of paths for the files one at a time which then calls the next asynctask inside the for-loop which downloads the file from that path and then in the onpostexecute assigns the file to the ui view

5222493

put	get
i was wondering if there is some easy way in tfs to get a specific project and put it into a destination folder of your choosing and put a label on it or version number

5222611
folder	directory
i created bin directory in my project folder and placed there libvorbis_static.lib and libvorbisfile_static.lib

5222611
folder	directory
also i created in the bin directory libvorbis folder and an include folder in it and placed there vorbis with codec.h vorbisfile.h vorbisenc.h and ogg with os_types.h and ogg.h folder

5222611
folder	directory
i added libvorbis_static.lib to additional dependencies of my project and the bin folder to additional library directory

5222710
sudo	passwd
use sudo -k for testing to clear your sudo timestamp so the next time the script is run it will require the passwd again

5222711
width	height
i need to scale down an image that has a height or width greater than a predefined pixel value

5222711

it just init s returns self and all i do in setselected is call super

5222771
unsigned	short
furthermore ..why i must use template here i read the template tutorial and it is used to optimize code and reduce code repeation but here the n must be always unsigned short

5222771
int	double
when i look this exmaple i understand that i use template because my datatype can be anything i want and i can use it for int double or any kind of numbers

5222810
button	checkbox
otherwise when the button is triggered the gridview will be rebound meaning all checkbox are reset

5222842
width	height
the first step in your algorithm should be to calculate the aspect ratio by dividing width by height

5222842
width	height
width 300 height 200

5222922
jruby	rubinius
rubinius especially the current development trunk which adds ruby 1.9 compatibility and removes the global interpreter lock and jruby would both be fine choices

5222922
jruby	rubinius
as an added bonus rubinius comes with a built-in actors library for concurrency and jruby gives you access to clojure s concurrency libraries or the akka actors library

5222922
jruby	rubinius
this shows you that ruby code at least when it is carefully written can be just as fast as c especially since databases tend to be long-running and thus rubinius s or jruby s and in the latter case specifically also the jvm s dynamic optimizers which c compilers typically do not have can really get to work

5222925
opera	google-chrome
you would do well to start using console.log instead of alert as you can use firebug or the built-in console in opera or google-chrome

5222936
int	double
in your case it s a good idea to use templates because it enables you to have vectors of int floats double or whatever you like

mouse	keyboard
when i say protocol this can design can either be implemented using inheritence or for some cases it s better to use an actual protocol declaration and ensure that classes confirm to the appropriate protocols. a perfect example of this is that many applications written for the mac can easily be moved over to ios because the only major difference between the two platforms is at the user interface level which is completely understandable given that the interface for the mac is traditionally a large screen that the user interacts with via a keyboard and a mouse on the other hand the interface for ios consists of a much smaller screen that the user touches to interactive with

i ve yet to implements certain checks like ensuring that the requested controller in fact extends from my flooid_system_controllerabstract but for the time being this is what i m running with

5238367
client-side	server-side
other than that there is one significant difference in the setting of the cookie - only server-side programming language can set a httponly cookie wikipedia owasp - cookie inaccessibly by the client-side scripting jscrip javascript etc

5238376
hide	show
if you can output a class style in php to hide show the buttons i d recommend keeping that unless there is other specific client-side logic that needs to happen

5238395
hide	show
try putting the button html before the php that generates the jquery so that when the page is rendered the buttons are defined before you try to hide show them

5238411
google-chrome	firefox
or run two firefox or two google-chrome instances in different profiles as recommended here

5238475
width	margin
i have tried styling as a block and doing margin 0 auto with a fixed with but thats a problem i need it to stretch along 100 of the width because the fields ip city region country name and country code will be filled in via geoloc services automatically so having a fixed width of say 500px is not big enough therefore it needs to be the whole width i want it centred because if there is someone viewing my webpage that there info doesnt use the whole width it would look better centered

5238483
free	malloc
since the mgrib is allocating the memory using malloc we need to free the memory using free function

5238549
google-chrome	firefox
this is especially true since microsoft has a number of patents in the field of font rendering meaning that there are certain techniques that firefox and google-chrome would be unable to use in their rendering without paying a royalty

5238624
width	margin
each columns would have a margin of say 12px and a width of 152px

5238633
width	height
this should do the trick setting the height and width to your desired dimensions

5238759
portrait	landscape
and that the interface builder simulated user interface elements doesn t seem to know this and keeps the same navigation bar height in both portrait and landscape modes

5238820
folder	directory
how do i tell maven to dump changed resources newly compiled class files to some other directory so that i can upload them to the server and to the appropriate folder our server hosts something like 10+ weblogic instances running on various ports one instance per developer

public class customtablecelleditor extends abstractcelleditor implements tablecelleditor

5238901

let s say you add the id of the table you want to show hide as the rel attribute of the button

5238931
post	get
the method attribute can be either equals to post or to get

5238931
post	get
get means that your values will be sent as arguments in the url post means that your values will be sent to the page through the _post superglobal

5238943

5239067
post	get
if you get started and need help post back here with what you re stuck on

5239135
terminate	timeout
you d have to set up the task to be performed by parallel.foreach with its own timeout mechanism which would end the task thread without performing the operation but also without telling parallel.foreach that there s a problem big enough for it to terminate the entire operation

5239145
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and ie for me but not on other computers including my clients which is frustrating

5239162
width	height
to get your embedded swf to be 100 width and height you need to do it in the html css

5239162
width	height
then make sure you set the width and height of the embedded swf object is set to 100

5239168
maven	m2e
using the m2e plugin i attempted to add maven support via the project s maven context menu

5239192

5239247
nasm	fasm
i was between yasm fasm gas and nasm but other recomendations are accepted

5239265
allocator	stl
then you can parameterize this other container with your allocator in the usual stl way

5239273
listadapter	listactivity
use listactivity and listadapter base or cursor depending on your needs

5239279
udp	tftp
if you want to go for simpler embedded implementation and use udp you could try tftp

5239279
udp	tcp
i ve used that in the past on a modem device since we used udp for the main communications and thus wanted to use udp avoid adding tcp for file transfers embedded firmware upgrades

5239298
getter	setter
just wrap the access to mongodb with a layer of abstract commands than write an abstract model object and all other model objects will inherit from it and will automatically set all getter and setter for the attributes of the record you pulled from the mongo db

5239309
post	get
i spent a few hours looking for answers and finally feel i need to post a question where it might get answered

5239320
post	get
i get that from another post here

5239358
width	height
for example the example here won t work if you inverse the width and the height

5239386
profiler	btrace
if that doesn t help try finding any other shutdown hooks and attaching btrace profiler to them

5239387
allocator	stl
it s perfectly practical to add a custom allocator which is designed to be used with stl objects to a std priority_queue - the queue is templated on an internal container with std vector as the default and you can explicitly specify a custom allocator in a std vector

5239392
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	show	hide	fadeout
you can also use fadein and fadeout instead of show and hide if you want some basic animation

5239395
uitableview	reloaddata
assuming that you have all of your uitableviewdatasource methods correctly defined you probably just need to call reloaddata on your uitableview

5239395
uitableview	reloaddata
see the uitableview reference for details about the reloaddata method

5239458
background-image	background-position
with css it can easily done by setting background-image and background-position

5239468
superclass	subclassing
subclassing defines an is-a relationship but the subclassing is-a superclass not the other way around

5239510
post	get
even using the post redirect get method and including javascript to disable a button after it has been clicked i am having a problem with users being able to just rapidly hammer a submit button and get multiple form post in before server side validation can stop it

5239546
post	get
in the future you ll probably get better results if you post a clear question with a code sample that actually compiles and demonstrates the problem you re actually having

5239547
put	get
however i need to get variables from the get request so if is requested i need the python code to put var1 into a python variable and process it like print it

5239551
post	put
i don t want to put the call to send emails in a try except block since this is being done after processing a form and i don t want the user to wait around for the response to the post

5239554
dictionary	map
as an alternative to an if-elif-else loop you can use a dictionary to map your cases to the desired functions methods

5239601
post	get
if you re going to be submitting anything that s not idempotent i would suggest using post instead of get

5239603
pull	push
if you re working on a branch and someone has committed and pushed some changes on the same branch you have to pull and merge before your push simply with hg merge no revision or branch

5239609
linefeed	delimiter
the first few characters of the string should be 0x0a linefeed 0x1c 0x0d cr followed by more normal text records delimiter by 0x0a linefeed

5239633
graphics2d	bufferedimage
i have thought of getting a bufferedimage with robot class and then using pixelgrabber to zoom in but wondered if i can directly work with graphics2d without using image objects

5239646
post	get
if you are already doing that and you can still get multiple form post then the problem is a delay between the clicking of the button and the button being disabled and you must be submitting the form multiple times during this delay

5239651
fullcalendar	jqplot
for example a google map in one a jquery fullcalendar in another a jqplot in another etc

5239677
switching	screens

5239726
width	height
i am using the masonry plugin and for it to work correctly with images you need to set the width and height within the image tag

5239726
width	height
all the image s height will vary but the width will be set at 200px

5239730
hide	show
2 show hide this form item on the web page based on a condition

5239739
for-loop	loops
having said that i d probably use a good old foreach loops myself given the choice or with a list as source collection a for-loop so i can use the index directly

5239741
websphere	ibm
in fact ibm wrote a 400+ page of some of the migration issues you might face i would highly highly suggest that you use rad for websphere application server development

5239753
for-loop	arrays
create the arrays and then initialize it in a for-loop

5239760
google-chrome	firefox
while ie render these correctly i know that means little firefox and google-chrome both send the user to a place somewhat above or below the actual anchor tag

5239766
post	get
get post and cookie values are placed in

5239768
post	get
on your ipn page you can log all get post and cookie variables pretty easy

5239802
mouseup	mousedown
i can keep current selected index only one item can be selected in a variable in selectedindexchanged and reset it in mousedown but between mousedown and mouseup last item is selected - and it doesn t look good

5239872
for-loop	arrays
if you have only a handful of items in the original arrays say less than 16 then you can also count from 0 to 2 n -1 in a for-loop

5239880
filtering	grouping
my code fails at the regex step because although i just want to filtering out everything except a single regex grouping when i get the results it s always returning the grouping that i want -and- the grouping before it even though i in no way requested the first backtrace grouping

5239882
cout	cin
i m a beginner in programming and i often see many programs using the prefix std if they are using any std functions like std cout std cin etc

5239894
width	height
additionally i changed the width and height properties of the video object both manually and automatically using the metadata of the video clip and the video dimensions seem to be wrong - i have a swfobject with 320x240 and when i changed the size of the video to match the swfobject size it rendered much smaller than 320x240

5239907
google-chrome	firefox
if you disable javascript on your browser you will see that both firefox and google-chrome work fine

5239919
post	get
you could use post here as well but get will be clearer as a beginner and refreshing won t invoke the browser s submit form again dialogue

5239919
post	get
if using post you should really follow post redirect get that wikipedia url is terrible

5239932
move	drag
i am building a sortable accordion with jquery which works perfectly fine but i want it so when someone clicks on on of the items in the accordion and it opens up that it is automatically move to the top of the list without the person having to drag it to the top

5239943
typedef	struct
basecharacter.h makes use of struct and typedef defined in eventtypes.h but eventtypes.h has to be aware of the basecharacter class defined in basecharacter.h

5240139
goto	break
a lambda expression cannot contain a goto statement break statement or continue statement whose target is outside the body or in the body of a contained anonymous function

i save the asynctask in onretainnonconfigurationinstance detach the activity from it in ondestroy and reattach to it in oncreate using getlastnonconfigurationinstance

5240145
onresume	onpause
however if i change it to do some actual work in the background then i get a very long delay between onpause being called to start the rotation and onresume being called later in the new orientation

5240184
base-class	subclassing
since as you say the subclassing has all the properties of the base class it is-a base-class object then a cast from the subclassing to the base class will always succeed but never the reverse

5240184
base-class	subclassing
it has be created first either directly or by instantiating a subclassing of custommembershipuser not a base-class

5240195
folder	directory
since cvsexportcommit looks for the cvs folder in the directory it fails

5240235
ssms	sqlcmd
bit late but if you re using ssms you can put it in sqlcmd mode and define variables that way

5240277
width	height
it s possible to have fields that expand in height and width but you are giving the users free form boxes and may make your processing of the expenses more difficult

5240345
hide	show
yes you can show or hide any canvas programmatically using the show_view and hide_view procedures

5240352
hide	show
the easiest thing to do is apply the same showstock onmouseout onmouseover to the stock1 div as well so that it show itself while moused over but hide itself when not moused over except when you mouse over an area within the a tag that show it

5240419
awt	swing
looks like you are doing swing awt operations in the smack listener thread

5240437
post	put
you just base64-encode it put it into a json object as the value for a key receipt-data and post that json object to apple

5240487
children	parent
i recently learned that it s generally not advised to kill processes by name but by process id pid which assumes you to manage parent children pids

5240532
width	height
i plan on having dozens of images on a single page and don t want to add the width and height attribute to every single image tag

5240532
width	height
i am using the masonry plugin and it requires a width and height attribute for images

5240551
width	height
assuming that you want the height width attributes to be set to the img s actual height width rather than scaled modified in some manner

5240553
width	height
you could use the jquery height and .width methods as these return the computed width and height

5240553
width	height
you should always include the width and height attributes in your img tags however as some browsers will not render these images correctly without them

5240555
tcheckbox	tpanel
note - regarding read-only it appears that delphi s tcheckbox doesn t even have a read-only option this has been faked by placing it on a tpanel and disabling that.

5240581
avassetwriter	avassetreader
i know how to use avassetreader and avassetwriter and have successfully used them to grab a video track from one movie and transcode it into another

5240588
cvs	svn
i d just stick with the same model you had in cvs if you want multiple active versions and setup your svn repo with a new branch root branches v1.1 etc for each active version and make sure that you merge early and often to avoid overwhelming amounts of conflicts

5240599
chunked	transfer-encoding

5240611
pop-up	dialog
when you click the open project button the dialog that pop-up defaults to something strange i ve yet to be able to figure it out i think it might be because i am using dropbox

5240615
min	max	minimum	max
your best bet is probably to just to check for valid country codes a minimum and maximum number of digits for the area code which may be optional or not required for some countries and the min max length for the subscriber number

5240629
division	multiplication
typical examples of microcoded instructions are division and multiplication and this is the case for both cisc and risc

5240629
division	multiplication
an additional insight as to their relative complexity is their respective throughput on k10 a multiplication every other clock cycle can be sustained 2.5 - 5 2 - in operation simultaneously but only sustain one division every 77th clock cycle same as division latency

5240647
integer	unsigned
for a 32 bit machine use an unsigned 32 bit integer or a uint32_t

google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome can do it but the particulars are different

5240684
inherited	subclassing
i realize i can do this manually but i have a large number of classes that all inherited from subclassing and i don t want to have to write the exact same logic over a 100 times

5240694
addition	multiplication
usually multiplication has a higher precedence than addition but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem

5240746
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the login form is working correctly in firefox 3.6 - mac pc google-chrome safari but does the equivalent of a refresh when you submit the un pw in ie8

5240754
installshield	inno-setup
usually you ll do this through your application s installer ie installshield inno-setup etc

5240766
super	implements
you can create a class that will have uitextview as a super class and this class will also be the place for implements your functions to support the custom functionality and further your class will be used directly instead uitextview for availing of the custom functionality

5240804
post	get
when it comes to normal post get methods i usually know my way around

5240807
fgets	getchar
note that this still doesn t consume any trailing whitespace left in the input stream not even to the end of a line so beware of that if also using getchar or fgets on the same input stream

5240809
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby depend on other libraries to work

5240809
ironruby	ironpython
i believe this exception has nothing to do with using both ironpython and ironruby in the same project

5240820

you need to set the content-type and content-disposition headers

5240920

you should override onresume and onpause instead of onstart and onstop for these kinds of things

5241213

5241452
membase	couchbase
membase and couchone merged into couchbase where i work fwiw but i don t work on membase

5241452
membase	couchdb
therefore it seems reasonable that the future of membase will have couchdb features map-reduce query replication backup off-site http rest interface etc

5241455
put	get
when i put itemlist_1.price tamount as totalitemcost i get an error saying tamount is an invalid column

5241466
post	get
lastly navigating to asmx endpoint in browser will invoke soap end-point and you will always get xml request-response this is because asp.net script handler will do json serialization only if request is post request and content-type is json

5241476
jar	manifest.mf
double clicking on jar would invoke javaw java - window mode to run the main class defined in manifest.mf within the jar and therefore system.out would not be available to see

if you were to post the edited contents of the script you might get some answers about how you could port it to a windows cscript or batch file

5241823
accessor	properties
it s good to understand what s happening in this code but if you use properties with synthesized accessor you won t have to write it very often

5241837
strcpy	strtok
but beyond that and possibly why you re getting stack smashing errors is because strtok will return a pointer to whatever token it finds and if that s bigger than the array you ve allocated for the destination for strcpy it will happily overflow it

5241837
strcpy	strdup
i would consider using strdup instead of strcpy

5241898
pull	push
every developer that uses git now could push his changes to this central repository and the other developer doing the review could pull those into his repo

toggleclass	each

5253082
children	parent
however if each child of home was set to position absolute and the home li was set to position static the default you could in some edge cases use z-index -1 on those children and make them appear to be behind the parent

5260191
factories	presenter
i want to inject factories for presenter and views to allow for late creation of those instances deep down the ui view stack

5260191
factories	presenter
we see above that the presenter depends on the view so the presenter factories will depend on the view factories

5260191
factories	presenter
and then resolving the presenter factories

5260191
factories	presenter
the dependency on the view factories inside the presenter factories is resolved as expected

5260191
factories	presenter
now i have a million classes that looks like goodpresenterfactory above and i therefore wanted a small base class to handle some trivial common stuff like the dependency on the view factories in the presenter factories

5260191
factories	presenter
then the presenter factories will change and something in that change will make ninject fail resolving

5260202

the default set is hashset but a treeset is also used occasionally providing the added benefit of having a defined order but it requires you to either provide a comparator or ensure that all elements are comparable

5260621
boost	stl
i m not looking for productivity libraries like boost or stl

5260641
post	get
of course as a general rule it s highly recommended to wrap your ajax calls in a unified method that concatenates the csrf token to the request be it get or post although post is safer and much more correct from architectural perspective so when you make ajax calls you focus on the business input values only and don t need to worry about csrf

5260689
virtualbox	parallels
i skipped all the .net-stuff so i don t have any experience in running visualstudio and virtualbox parallels on the same box but in this scenario you should have at least

google-chrome	safari
this is the default behavior of google-chrome as well as safari

5260856
google-chrome	firefox
if you look at the same page with a file input element in firefox ie and google-chrome it will appear differently in each browser

the chart is just a 100 width by 300 height big pixel space

5261407
tex	mathjax
as already suggested if you want equations in a web page mathjax will process tex math code into proper math display

5261414

pop-up	dialog
doing it this way is a hack because a dialog box will pop-up asking the user which one he wants to use yours or the default

5261513

5261520
post	get
if you think about what that post data contains you re looking at a series of key-value pairs that get encapsulated into a query string

5261543
touchesmoved	touchescancelled
the problem is that the scrolling of the uiscrollview triggers touchescancelled thus ending the touchesmoved calls that the game relies on to know which elements to manipulate

5261543
touchesmoved	touchescancelled
even if my finger movement doesn t visually trigger the view to scroll moving my finger more than 10 pixels in distance triggers the touchescancelled method thus ending future touchesmoved calls until i lift my finger and start a new touch event

5261543
touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
i am confident that it s the scrolling event that is triggering the touchescancelled method because if i set on the view moving the finger on the screen continues to trigger touchesmoved as it should no matter how far i move my finger on the screen touchesended gets called as expected when i lift my finger after i m done sifting through the elements and each element in the path of my touch swipe is indeed manipulated as desired

5261543
touchescancelled	initwithframe
i have tried setting in the initwithframe method of the view but touchescancelled is still being triggered oddly enough

5261549
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari only

5261567
cstring	bstr
however the bit in the middle is the same so if you find yourself needing both representations make a wrapper class that constructs a string with a 4byte header and a null terminator but can return accessors to the bstr portion and the cstring

5261584
lpwstr	bstr
if your program is unicode and your lptstr therefore is a lpwstr you can use sysallocstring to convert from a pointer to a wide character string to bstr

5261865
vb.net	jscript.net
but to cut a long story short don t use jscript.net if you don t have to use a modern language like c# or vb.net instead and if you need scripting functionality i recommend using csscript

5261932
mouseleave	mouseenter
so first of all you need to use mouseenter and mouseleave because they don t bubble up only the specific element they re attached to gets the event

5261936
hash	salt
it s quite doable to use use a js sha-1 implementation and store a salt hash of the password within the source code

5261967

5262216
youtube	vimeo
i have a website where the user is able to add a youtube vimeo etc

5262234
for-loop	loops
1 - calling strlen on the for-loop is a bad idea it will calculate the string length every iteration so it is better to call it once before loops and keep the result in a variable

5262271
mouseover	mouseout
in there i would create the eventlisteners for mouseover and mouseout to change the opacity and or size

5262280
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception do not have this requirement exceptions that extend runtimeexception

5262328
mouselistener	actionevent
this approach is for when you want to handle a mouseclick since an actionevent is guaranteed to be generated whereas as mouseclicked event when using a mouselistener may not be generated in all situations which can confuse the user

5263143
udp	tcp
add to the above question the concept of a wait no wait indicator as a parameter to a readmessage function in a tcp ip or udp environment

5263152
portrait	landscape
the overlay image needs to be rotated to be in landscape mode even though you will be taking the image holding the phone in portrait

portrait	landscape
you need to force the activity to landscape mode while taking the picture now the overlay looks like its portrait

5263165

children	parent
i d like to create a setup where the children are all monitored so when i start up the parent again old children still running are reported

children	parent
when you want to terminate everything prematurely signal the parent to kill off all the children and clean up after them

5263609
printwriter	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	printwriter
worth noting here is that the printwriter really moves you far away from the actual socket and you re not going to catch the socket disconnect on the write it will never throw an exception you have to manually check it with checkerror you could change to using a bufferedwriter instead requires using flush to push the output and handling it like the bufferedreader to catch a disco on the write

but it works the same as a normal for-loop loops variable contains the current index meaning the property of the object and not the value

5263924
for-loop	arrays
to iterate over arrays you should use a normal for-loop

5263963
width	height
if it s the first image in the post then filter out the first tag from the wp_content then apply the filter to forcibly set the width and or height

5264007
folder	directory
also the reason for replicating the source folder structure is that some of the files are contained within a very strict sub-folder hierarchy that must be preserved in the destination directory

5264025
innodb	myisam
myisam does table locking whereas innodb does row locking

5264058
uilabel	uibutton
the best way i could think of to do this would be to subclass a uibutton and add your own uilabel and uiimageviews to it in that way

5264064
post	get
the web server tells the app about the environment - this contains mainly what the user sent in as his request - the url the headers whether it s a get or a post etc

5264083
mouse	keyboard
i can enumerate keyboard mouse and other human interface devices

5264108

the average webserver tomcat jboss glassfish etc in turn has a limit of 2gb

5264177
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs and several nix filesystems however can go up to 16eb

5264196

5264225
codeigniter	yii
i just started using yii coming from codeigniter codeigniter

5264256
post	put
rather than post to an aspx page inside of orchard you should post to a controller that you put inside one of your modules

5264273
postgresql	mysql
if you want to use a database like mysql or postgresql you should give sqlalchemy a try

5264317
ubuntu	linux
these run on the command line in linux ubuntu but when trying to run them via hudson only the first one first one shows up in the console output

5264353
hide	show
another way is to group your controls into subviews of the main view and show hide these subviews as a whole

5264357
unsigned	short
the difference between the two arises when you have for example an unsigned short being added to an unsigned char

5264357
int	chars
value preserving rules say that you promote both values to int if it can represent all values of the original type the common case of 8-bit chars 16-bit short and 32-bit int

5264357
unsigned	short
on the other hand if int and short are both 16 bits so int cannot represent all values of unsigned short then you promote the unsigned short to unsigned int note that it s still considered a promotion even though it only happens when it s really not a promotion -- the two types are the same size

5264367
getter	setter
you should use getter and setter methods for that

5264373
int	chars
if the get parameter were to be an invalid id for the database such as someone enters an int that s not a row in the db or they try and enter a chars or something i d like to display a default record

5264417
getdate	dateadd
dateadd dd -1 getdate substracts one day from the current date time

5264421
gtk	cairo
if i have this right i suggest you learn the gtk and cairo libraries and use those to build your gui

5264433
min	max
select count id max id min id from tablename

5264433
min	max
then you know rows 0 n-1 have ids min max

5264433
min	max
so rows a b have ids min max

5264433
min	max	range	max	range	min
figure out which range i is in and update a b min and max appropriately

5264435
hide	show
clicking on my anchor tag show below does not hide the notify-parent div

5264530
boost	stl
telling you to learn stl or to use shared_ptr boost can be a good advice however as david rodrã guez said you need to think of the lifetime of the objects

5264553
sudoers	passwd
you could add a line to your etc sudoers files which allows the script to be executed without passwd and then

5264614
cos	sin
the basic theory behind it is that the point at angle a on the outside of a circle of radius r positioned on the origin is at a sin r a cos r

5264614
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
finger tracking is done by following one uitouch at a time through the touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended cycle

5264648
client-side	server-side
i can get server-side authentication to work via certificates but when i add client-side authentication using certificates i get tlsv1 alert unknown ca s3_pkt.c 1193 ssl alert number 48 error

5264649
int	chars
the fact that there is a std string on the left side of the expression doesn t matter for the first step give is a which decays to a and n is a chars that is an int type

5264703
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
the main difference between autoresetevent and manualresetevent is that using autoresetevent doesn t require you to call reset but automatically sets the state to false

5264831
hide	show
you d have to pass in the show hide property on the load event of the page

5264862
gson	jackson
so i know this topic has been done before java reflection performance but my particular question is it seems that many popular libraries are implemented via annotations and reflection gson jackson jaxb implementations hibernate search for example

5264862
gson	jackson
i ve definitely noticed that gson jackson etc

5264864
activemq	rabbitmq
the top two that i know of are activemq and rabbitmq which both play well with python plus i found this comparison which states that activemq currently as of 18 months ago

5264905
int	chars
by default it tries to convert runs of chars to an int but you can pass in to have it accept decimal points

5264926
mathml	mathjax
as an alternative i recommend to use qwebkit in conjunction with a javascript-based math renderer such as mathjax which renders both mathml and latex

5264958
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop or a while loops with items.count 0 or something like that

5264962
width	height
this is not the entire script this code will actually be within a function with parameters for x and y coordinates and parameters for height and width

5264962
width	height
my question is that i need to center the text within rectangles of x y width and height .

5265005
g++	gcc
so if you had one file called test.cpp that had two functions declared in it but one of them was unused you could omit the unused one with the following command to gcc g++

5265049
folder	dir
the variable docspath contains the path to the documents folder of your dir

5265079
postgresql	mysql
it supports several database backends including oracle mysql postgresql odbc etc

alternatively you can use css3 transitions which is supported in firefox opera and webkit google-chrome safari

5265169
inherited	properties
assuming myusercontrol.ascx inherited myusercontrol.cs you can define a public properties that exposes the value of your textbox control

5265192
bmp	png
the error occurs when i load an image any image png bmp etc into the imagelist i have in my form in the main app not the dll

5265198

window.location.href doesn t work properly unless it s firefox google-chrome it redraws the page in ie8

5265235
std	ostream
you should be able to write them to a std ostream using

5265268
min	max
i tried doing this for just two graphs and that works when i reverse the order of the coordinates in the second graph from max x to min x

5265330
profiling	benchmarking
however i ve been surprised before so profiling your application to verify there is a bottleneck and benchmarking potential solutions carefully

5265452
post	get
method which is how the values will be passed google post get

5265480

5265569
decoder	encoder
a robust html entity encoder decoder written in javascript

5265624
superclass	subclassing
you can call base implementation using the base keyword inside the class but if you are trying to call it from the other class i am pretty sure you are violating a liskov substitution principle in your code as any subclassing shoudl provide such an implementation to virutal methods to be completely substitutable for superclass

5265669
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a bash script in linux ubuntu but also fedora but it the find command won t work

5265670
youtube	vimeo
it parses vimeo and youtube videos separately which allows using a fast regex for each with exposed literal text at the pattern start which triggers pcre optimizations. also a slightly different array format is used to store the data where the video clip id is stored as the array key and the video type either vim or yt as the value

5265692
starttls	smtps
smtps server response 530 5.7.0 must issue a starttls command first

5265692

5265900
integer	unsigned
i d like to convert an unsigned base-10 integer to a much higher custom base by providing the alphabet but i m not sure where to start and am probably overlooking the simplicity

5265916
cobertura	emma
i have also tried clover cobertura and emma

5265916
cobertura	emma	cobertura	eclemma	emma	ecobertura	ecobertura	eclemma
emma with the eclemma plugin is about equivalent to cobertura ecobertura

5265916
ant	emma
emma integration into ant is a fracton more complex and doesn t offer a complexity factor

5265916
ecobertura	eclemma
the eclemma plugin is nicer and more mature then ecobertura

5265937
uiview	calayer
instead of applying rotation in drawing code i d rotate the view with chart itself if that s possible - either with uiview animations or with calayer animations - they are pretty straightforward and provide much more flexibility

5265976
dxcore	coderush
you could look into coderush express from devexpress - more specifically dxcore which is the free run-time coderush is based on

5265977
lisp	scheme
closures can be used in lots of languages javascript python lisp scheme all do and java does in part through inner classes that can reach final variables in the closure scope

5265978
sorting	filtering
at that point i would disable all sorting filtering removing columns etc etc

5265978
sorting	filtering
all their changes would be in the master datatable and they would be able to edit rows and columns without the rows jumping sorting around on them or disappearing filtering

5265978
sorting	filtering
if i could just somehow disable filtering and sorting but keep the data ordered and filtering

5266080
screens	mdpi
if you use the option to scale display to to real size or create an avd with small screens size but mdpi density you should see components that are about the same size in both avds

5266145
ienumerable	iqueryable
that is what will make the statement go from iqueryable to ienumerable and that will change its behaviour

5266232
ssl	https
i m not sure if i also need the ssl on the windows machine or what settings i need to get an https page to work with a proxy

5266317
activescaffold	hobo
just found here rails scaffold to automatically do one-to-many relationship that it isn t possible to scaffold relationships with the scaffold tool itself but there s a plugin called activescaffold streamlined hobo and autoadmin that allows us to scaffold with associations

5266413
onclick	onmousedown
using onmousedown instead of onclick may also help

5266485
mouseover	mouseout
a better solution is to use a combination of mouseover and mouseout

5266536
hide	show
like doing when use scroll down link after pressing it changing to scroll up show switch to hide and all this continued in case of clicking

5266551
free	malloc
there s no need to do the malloc free if you re on ios 4 or later you can just pass null as the relevant parameter of cgbitmapcontextcreate and let coregraphics sort out its own storage

5266559
erd	diagram
i ve attached a jpg file of the erd diagram

5266683
slideup	slidedown
basically if you re using firefox and your mouse goes up and off the button vertically you can get the slidedown and slideup to sort of flicker in a loop

5266693
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie8 safari and opera all act the way i would expect but firefox is turning this.

5266695
fgets	fseek
sequential read of text line can be done with fgets fseek is of no help for text excpept if structured in fixed length

5266742
serializable	deserialization
the only one i ve found that doesn t have weird serializable deserialization quirks and works consistently in ios webplayer and editor is jsonfx jsonserializer 1.4

5266745
mouse	keyboard
i would love to have a multi user system based on linux using only one x11 session with multiple screens and pairs of mouse and keyboard

5266762

5266818
map	quadtree
the quadtree algorithm they use for their map essentially what i m asking for is

5266829
floating-point	fixed-point
the two floating-point values would be encoded as fixed-point values

5266842
hash	md5
most hash algorithms operate on fixed-size blocks of data - you can look up sha1 or md5 reference implementations they use an init loop update finalize construct allowing you to pass as much or little data as you wish in every update

5266866
guava	javolution
have a look at fasttable in javolution and table implementations in guava

5266964

late-binding	early-binding
seems that your task is not that easy for late-binding trial error maybe you d want to check an option of early-binding - check this link -

5267121
for-loop	arrays
the whole reason for the introduction of the enhanced for-loop was that it eliminates the drudgery and error-proneness of iterators and index variables when iterating over collections and arrays 1

5267121
for-loop	loops
yes i understand that iterables can be re-used to create multiple iterators but that all happens outside of the for-loop inside loops there is only ever a forward progression one item at a time over the items returned by the iterator

5267145
setinterval	clearinterval
more about setinterval and clearinterval functions here

5267149
put	get
personally i d go with the option of using server controls instead of straight up html you d get alot more flexibility and then passing through the settings would be pretty straightforward put something like this in your controls backend code

5267217
ienumerable	icollection
to render the object as a mesh or to apply a transform to the object then consider using a verb adjective rather than noun naming irenderable itransformable - this is a common pattern in .net ienumerable verb adjective rather than icollection noun for example

5267224
gif	png
save for web only accept jpeg png or gif

5267244
g++	gcc
you could also use g++ instead of gcc

5267248

5267313
int	chars
do a data.tochararray and print each chars s code cast to int

5267349

5267353
division	modulo
integer division modulo remainder

5267353
multiplying	division
division by multiplying by the

5267407
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
i know that tinyint can be used with a preparedstatement with setbyte int parameterindex byte x and i also know that bit can also be used with setboolean int parameterindex boolean x

5267426
tinyint	boolean
boolean in mysql is a synonym for tinyint 1

5267534
vb6	vba
it s for vb6 but i am sure it would need little adjustment for vba

5267535
udp	tcp
is this something taken care of by the guts of tcp udp kernel

5267541
google-chrome	firefox
this runs slowly in google-chrome because google-chrome fires the onscroll event continuously as the page is scrolled ie and firefox only fire onscroll when scrolling stops

5267555
accessor	properties
the only thing you have to look out for here is that the bracket accessor will throw a referenceerror if you ask for an object properties that isn t there such as

5267556
gif	png
it can serve your data dynamically from a postgres database as kml or kmz gif jpeg png svg and even pdf out of the box

5267627
put	get
until you get so familiar with this stuff that these mistakes stop happening you might want to make a habit of checking the parentheses any time you run across a mysterious error have you missed a at the start of an expression or put an extra before the arguments of a function or forgotten the extra level of parens round a cond clause or etc

5267632
udp	tcp
seen from the applications point of view a socket represents a reliable ordered byte stream tcp or an unreliable unordered sequence of packets udp

5267635
udp	tcp
is this something taken care of by the guts of tcp udp kernel

5267635
udp	tcp
the port # is what ties a tcp or udp socket to a particular piece of application software

5267661
hide	show
instead of changing the src of a single image i would keep all of the images hidden initially and toggle the visibility css attribute of images you want to show hide

5267661
hide	show
that way you can pre-fetch all of the images that you ll need during load time and simply show hide elements as the handlers for your onkeydown events

5267665
put	get
create the even handler for that event and simply just put response.redirect member memberpage.aspx and your users should get redirected to the right page

5267674
16-bit	64bit
clearly you are using a platform where int is 32 bits wide but on other platforms it may be 16-bit and on some platforms int is 64bit wide

5267716
hide	show
but after that i am not sure how to enable disable gridviewcolumns hide show buttons

5267731
domxpath	domdocument
domdocument for parsing and domxpath for selecting will allow you to easily get that text

5267748
post	get
that code should initiate a post not a get

5267790
width	height
i am tring to get the width height values of an element in dom tree html page and i am using below method

5267790
width	height
as a result is there any way to get width and height values of a node element by using getnameditem method or any other you can advise

5267790
width	height
note i need to get real width and height not css or inline because maybe width is 60 in css but it is rendered as 100px.

5267792
dictionary	map
i figured the best way forward was to map the guids in a list of local ids using a dictionary

5267810
hide	show
also see the show and hide methods which you can use to show hide these messages

5267817
querypath	phpquery
phpquery or querypath simplify this significantly

5267850
versioning	upgrade
i m not sure if during the upgrade svn versioning was updated as well i see 1.6.5 now

5267852
google-chrome	firefox
for example when i go to #riley 2blark 40gmail.com google-chrome sends my valuechangehandler riley 2blark 40gmail.com while firefox sends riley+lark gmail.com

5267868
integer	unsigned
also think about signed unsigned and any integer format

5267898
qtkit	quicktime
i ve linked both qtkit and quicktime frameworks to my target and imported everything necessary into my header and implementation files

5267901
mouseout	mouseleave
by the way just try to change the mouseout with mouseleave event or viceversa

5267902
hash	md5
there exists a successful attack on the md5 algorithm which lets you find a different message that produces the same hash with relatively little work as compared to brute force

5267902
hash	md5
that attack used to have no real bearing when md5 was used to hash passwords or such

5267902
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
in the mean time new attacks have been found so both md5 and sha-1 can be hash collided at scary speeds and cracking entire databases of properly salt and single-hashed user passwords with these elderly hash is not only entirely feasible but has already been demonstrated

5267902
hash	md5
md5 will quite safely detect a bit error or accidential modification but a malware trying to bypass your personal filewall could rather trivially circumvent your entire security by finding a collision for the infected binary so the hash matches the original

5267923
mouse	keyboard
it is my understanding that windows only accepts mouse keyboard input based on the keys enumeration virtual-keys in the unmanged world

5267968
acs	adfs
azure acs is a sts that i can federate with adfs

5267986

5268075
jobs	cron
i need to call a script via curl in one of my cron jobs

5268094
division	modulo
this will allow you to pack or unpack the elements in o n excepting the complexity of actually generating the factorials and the division and modulo of arbitrary length integers which will be somewhat substantial

5268095
int	chars
meanwhile chars can be more than a chars -- you can also treat it as an int type

5268100
vpn	lan
personally if it was my own business or my professional job to write software i would host my own subversion server and it would be private lan only and i would use a vpn to access it from home

5268122
post	get
note that by default prototype s method to send params is post but you can always change that by declaring method get in the same ajax.updater call like so

5268131
free	malloc
it s the allocator the little piece of code that implements malloc free etc. that knows how long it is

5268215
google-chrome	safari
code tested on safari and google-chrome

5268217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site normally works fine in all popular browsers including firefox google-chrome safari and ie

5268283
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested and works in safari firefox and google-chrome

5268322
free	malloc
however free doesn t care about nul terminators instead it keeps track of the length from the original malloc call separately

5268322
strdup	malloc	free	malloc	free	strdup
for pystring_asstring and strdup etc. this is not an option because there is no portable way to get the size of a region of memory -- malloc and free do not expose this functionality

5268414
hide	show
hide the modal window when document is loaded using the settimeout method show the div

5268416
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction and iboutlet are really just clues to interface builder here are the actual definitions

hide	show	mouseover	mouseleave
what iâ m trying to do is a simple toolbar that show hide when i mouseover mouseleave over to parent

5268419
hide	show
the problem is that when i move the mouse over the â œbumpâ the toolbox hide and show like a maniac

5268427
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction are not data-types

5268456
portrait	landscape
internally the os may decide to recycle it especially when it s immediately recreated due to a configuration change like the orientation changing from portrait to landscape

5268458

the other way is to do it dynamically in the mixer code by multiplying each sample by some value 1.0 as you add it to the mix

5275179

wordpress	oscommerce
the majority of the sites that end up in the state you are referring to only last as long as their domain registrations especially since most wordpress or oscommerce deployments are usually set up as the root domain and service the entirety of the web presence. so generally speaking if the domain itself is in a state of neglect and abandonment the natural expiration process will decommission it and it will no longer be accessible in general
