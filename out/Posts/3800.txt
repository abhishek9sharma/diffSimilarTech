put	get	onresume	onpause
your only hope is to do everything in onpause and even then for anything that really needs to be saved i am doing that in a type of background thread that does not get thrown off as readily it s in the docs just read all of it and the only workaround i can figure for the way the whole thing runs is do saves while it is running using the service and put check for null on non-sane values everywhere and check them in onresume so that if you app does get dumped by just removing the pointer from the task-list in the os then at least the app returns to the user in a semi-stable state

8165736
maven	pom.xml
actually you d better import your pom.xml into your favorite ide intellij of course and let the maven plugin do the job of interpreting the poms and creating correct dependencies for you instead of doing it by hand

8165742
ant	cruisecontrol
we use cruisecontrol java version and ant for the build process in a windows enviroment

8165746

mousemove	mousedown
2- when flag mousedown is true mousemove works changing a position of a square div around the little map showing what portion of image the user is seeing

8165892
postgresql	mysql
based on the mysql documentation examples for usage of and empirical evidence for usage of and as ariel says the application fits i think we ll just have to settle for presuming that the above postgresql citation also applies for mysql and file a documentation bug

8165962
teamcity	jenkins
you can try teamcity or jenkins or hudson

not a recent question but if i understand the op correctly he has classes that are children of a parent class which define the allocator deallocator and can all require specific alignment

8166116
public	protected
even if you make it protected or public the members of a template base class are not automatically visible in the derived class

8166161

the css fontfamily and font-size are displayed correct

versioning	upgrade
this is regardless of whatever versioning of service pack or hotfix you have installed since updates to visual studio should not necessarily force your application to have to upgrade as described here

versioning	upgrade
the other difficulty is that when you upgrade visual studio the runtime merge modules in your redistributable folder are also upgrade to those versioning

8166479
post	get
post your results and you will probably get further help

8166508
getter	setter
until now its fine but this static method named getdata needs some data from setter and getter

8166542
getter	setter
getter and setter can be static if they get set static fields

8166564
getter	setter
yes getter setter can be made static based on your need

8166574

getter and setter are just normal methods

8166647
getter	setter
you can t make getter and setter methods static if you use any attributes or properties that aren t static

8166651
implements	extends
i have made a searchresultadapter extends baseadapter implements filterable which works basically fine

8166678

viewdidload	viewwillappear
i think you call - ibaction directionbutton method somewhere in your viewdidload or viewwillappear or like that methods

8166884
width	height
thus you will need to explicitly specify the sizes of your images either in the image width and height properties itself or via css

use integer or signed or unsigned when you need to do arithmetic on the values

8166895
mdpi	hdpi
i have tried re-sizing a png file to different dimensions and placing the image in the ldpi mdpi hdpi folders but the image still looks stretched squashed depending on the device

8166965
int	chars
note instead of chars if i write code to get int or float it prompts for values

8166974
unsigned	short
so you can cast to_ulong to unsigned short or better yet uint16_t with no worries about overflow or endianness

8166976
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian and also depends on the version

8166981
openssl	gnutls

int	chars
i want to convert number from chars format to 32 bit int int32_t but strtol returns long

8167373
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i don t get why you don t have observablefoo implementing inotifycollectionchanged inotifypropertychanged

8167382

8167926
portrait	landscape
if you want a different layout for your landscape and portrait views then android has a very elegant way to implement this

8167926

there two kind of orientation s landscape and portrait

8167932
udp	rtp
it sends an h246 aac stream data over rtp udp

i m looking for something like a printf with realocation strcpy and concatenation

8168042
pull	push
in fact i am not even sure that adding another row in the database will add another row to the db-aware grid push as opposed to pull

8168055
backgrounding	multitasking
more about backgrounding app states and multitasking

8168090
addition	multiplication
boolean operators have analogues in conventional arithmetic so one way of deciding what the precedence rules should be is to follow the rules for conventional arithmetic and is analogous to multiplication while or is analogous to addition hence and should have higher precedence than or

8168171
nsstring	nsdata
nsarray nsdictionary nsdate nsdata nsstring and nsnumber

8168194
subtraction	multiplication
i cannot understand why the multiplication operator works but the subtraction operator doesn t

8168231
width	height
i tried mini-magick and g1nn13-image-science but in the first one i can t take the current images width and height and because of it i can t realize the cropping algorithm and the second one gives me an error when i try to require image_science no such file to load -- inline

8168231
width	height
i used fastimage gem for finding picture s current height and width and the method of minimagick gem image.shave

8168285
addition	multiplication
using addition and multiplication is a convenience feature for working with strings

8168329
mdpi	hdpi

instead you can have a pipe object that encapsulates composition an inputstream for reading and an outputstream for writing

8168369
system.in	system.out
pretty much like you have system.in and system.out in the standard api

8168393
subtraction	add
there is no support for subtraction operator in case of strings but you can simply add one

8168393
multiplying	subtract
regarding operation you should be aware that this is not remove twice the string from a but remove result of 2 times the from a first multiplying the by 2 and then subtract from a

8168431
screens	mdpi
in medium-density mdpi screens which correspond to the original android phones physical pixels are identical to dp s

8168431
mdpi	hdpi
the conversion factor from hdpi to mdpi in this case is 1.5 so for a developer s purposes the device is 320x533 in dp s

8168471
hide	show
this will hide the error by default then show it only if needed

8168514
google-chrome	safari
much of this is specific to webkit safari and google-chrome so you may be limited in browser support

8168545
uilabel	uitextview
another easy solution is to just add a uilabel to your uitextview subview

8168549
nstextview	nsscrollview
you should look at apple s text system user interface layer programming guide specifically the section titled putting an nstextview object in an nsscrollview here

profiling	debugging
here s some information about attempts of simplifying debugging tracing profiling

8168616
getter	setter
that is the bean getter and setter removed

8168626

in particular i m setting a custom badge icon to the files contained in a specific directory through nsworkspace via â seticon forfile options and i d like those badges to be lost as soon as the files gets copied outside the folder

8168721
inherited	subclassing
of course you can have multiple subclassing which extends and inherited from mapactivity if you want

8168721
inherited	subclassing
creating multiple subclassing which inherited from mapactivity is like having lots of subclassing which are also inheriting from activity

8168751
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that the automatic update dialog pop-up when i start my application and there is a newer version on the server

8168775

the ldpi mdpi and hdpi refer to screens density which means how much pixels can fit into a single inch

8168844
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
also you have multiple screens size types small normal large xlarge and each one of them can be ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi nexus 10 or xxxhdpi

8168850

currently i give the images a static width and height using css to position it correctly inside it s container

8168854
union	distinct
it s no surprise that you re getting back two rows now as the union will aggregate all rows from your selects that have distinct values

8168867
pull	push
i am not even sure that adding another row in the database will add another row to the db aware grid push as opposed to pull

8168874
crossover	mutation
crossover evolution strategies just use mutation and are totally fine without crossover

8168878
getter	setter
but better would be to not do any business logic in setter and definitely also not in getter and use instead

8168904
getter	setter
something else to note about json results i ve noticed that when i have a serializable object being returned as a result if that object contains other complex objects with a getter setter that returns the embedded object i will often receive an empty result or no result

8168904
getter	setter	int	boolean
i often end up writing json wrapper objects to use for my json results with getter setter that only return java types string int boolean etc and not the embedded objects

8168904
getter	setter
i think that ve solved this using delegate getter setter but i ll have to go back and look at some old code

8168905
post	get
the first solution that i used was 3des to prevent anyone from seeing the clear data that i send via get and post methods to the php webserver

8168905
post	get
i want to know if it s possible to send the data so that they look different in each get and post method and i can decrypt in webserver

8168907
width	height
i have got this half working but when i try and create an if statement to change the width to be 100 and the height to be auto and visa versa depending on which part of the image is bigger it just doesn t change

8168907
width	height
so i am grabing the img which is the child of the div maincontent then changing it s width and height values if needed

8168907
width	height
i have this other piece of code which does work fine and i added the width and height change to the end of the code and it still doesn t work

8168907
width	height
so does the attribute of the border but the width and height doesn t change

8168911
width	height
to not distort them the images must be given their native height and width or a proportional value

8168920
width	height
without some server side code to actually determine the height and width of the image the best idea would be to set either the height or the width but not both

8168923
textarea	textbox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie detect the input from the masterpages jquery keyboard and input the chars to the textbox and trigger the javascript counter function so real time updates are given to the user the problem is firefox doesn t trigger this javascript counter from the jquery keyboard the keyboard is updating the textarea but fails to initiate the javascript counter

8168923
mouse	keyboard
it seems to function if i mouse over or key press just nothing from the jquery keyboard

otherwise you could wrap the image in a div set the height and width of the div and hide the overflow or use the image as the background for the div

8168993
width	height
if height and width may be different across images then go with the solutions already mentioned setting either height or width

8169001

you can figure out what the height should be by dividing the new width by the old width

8170968
width	height
basically that is the multiple of widths in the new width which is equal to the multiple of height in the new height

8170981
children	parent
it would have been impossible via css prior to the general sibling selector coming about and it may get easier with css4 standards that are being discussed being able to style parent elements from children might be leveraged for this situation

8171063
hide	show
i show it on mousenter and hide onmouseleave

8171072
children	parent
since you are using entity framework there is no such mapping option so you could maybe create a specific repository method such as parentrepository.getorderedchildren parent myparent and load your children using a linq join this is the lambda syntax

8171072
children	parent
please note that your code may suffer from the select n+1 problem since you are loading all your parent and then loading children for every parent

8171079
children	parent
linux uses copy-on-write for fork so forked children share their parent s memory until something is changed in either process

innodb	myisam
we have made a duplicate of the innodb table and added full text indexes on the myisam version and most queries can complete in a second or two

8171853
mouseleave	mouseenter
without modifying your html structure you need to use mouseenter mouseleave events like so

8171853
mouseout	mouseleave
mouseout considers only the target of your binding element so if you hover something inside the container it will count as a mouseout while mouseleave understands that only leaving the container is counted as a mouseout

8171853
mouseover	mouseout
so when you hovered over the x button it counted as a mouseout which hides the element and you are now in the plain container which triggers mouseover and this loop causes the strobo effect

you could represent values in other bases within your source - hexadecimal or base 16 for instance which is closer to the metal than decimal and correspondingly allows your thought process to move easily between human representation and what your code is actually saying since there s virtually no actual math to mentally go between hex and binary

octal	hex
if you re or ing together permissions or color values hex or octal

i have a gnuplot histogram with errorbar

8179080
plot	errorbar	histogram	errorbar
i can achieve this effect for a single data set using the plain errorbar style and hiding the marker at the center but i would like to use the histogram style to show multiple series on the same plot

8179092
oncreate	setcontentview
in its oncreate method i found single line of setcontentview takes 8-12 seconds to be complete

essentially this is one of most important purposes of the getter setter idea

8179288
getter	setter
if you used simple getter setter everywhere from moment one now you can add anything you need to them

8179318
post	get
but certainly you are perfectly ok to want to get a list of post certain user can view edit or moderate for example

8179381
getter	setter
i think it s common style and it s certainly one of the core motivations for getter setter in the first idea

8179421
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception are unchecked-exception that don t need a try catch block

8179448
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
use unchecked-exception extend runtimeexception for scenarios where you don t expect possible recovery

8179456
getter	setter
for doing this i create new instances based on the concrete subtype of a passed oldconnection and pass with a cast the old instance into the constructor so i can easily maintain the inner data for getter and setter

8179482
width	height
2 if you are giving height and width of any widget button or layout in size such as 40px or 40 px etc change this thing into dip device independent pixels

8179492
width	height
you might want to loop through the pixels which is not hard if you know the width and height

8179515
width	height
how can i do to give all my elements attributes as height width position top left .

8179553
width	height
also the only way you ll be able to give multiple elements different height width pos is you would have to post a unique id of each element to the ajax form and then the responce would have to be an object containing the unique id height width pos of that element most likely json so you can select each element by it s unique id and then change the values based on the object returned

8179623
dictionary	map
i d need to see the definition of the map class and the unordered list class but presumably the dictionary is defined as follows

the same thing is however wrong with higher data types such int double folat etc and hence the following case is invalid and causes a compile-time error

8180527
mouse	keyboard
it apparently does not receive any mouse or keyboard messages.

8180576
width	height
just in case someone is trying to solve same problem there is a better solution bitmap.createbitmap bitmap int x int y int width int height

pop-up	dialog
if you are using a winforms application there is a catch handler in it s event loop that pop-up a dialog and prevents windows error reporting wer from kicking in

8181011
zoo	xts
however xts extends and inherits from zoo objects and the zoo package does provide an as.ts method for objects of class zoo

8181011
zoo	xts
so if you get your data into a zoo or xts object you can then coerce to class ts and that should include the na in the appropriate places which arima will then handle if it can there aren t too many missing values

8181248
action-filter	onactionexecuting
if so use action-filter for it override onactionexecuting and supply the data you need into action parameters

8181283
setinterval	settimeout
do not setinterval but settimeout and schedule this for one single time

8181293
width	height
you should perform this calculation in both dimensions width and height since the width and height of both the image and the display area might differ

8181293
width	height
also if the image width or height is smaller than displaywidth scale you might want to cap it to be image width instead

8181319

8181461
google-chrome	firefox
this is not working in ie but working perfectly in firefox and google-chrome browsers

8181524
listview	gridview
for this solution i would suggest you to design custom adapter to be displayed either in gridview or in multi column listview

8181559
pop-up	dialog
you may be better off writing a selection event handler the user selects clicks on a row and that data is saved to the users clipboard could be blocked by security features or pop-up in a modal dialog inside a textarea for easy cut and paste

8181576
implements	extends
in java it would make sense to have each of these classes implements an interface or extends an abstract class

8181596
inherited	properties
most of my original objects are inherited from an other so i would want each inheritance-level to care for their own properties

8181596
inherited	properties
the inherited class should override the todto method calling the parents method and adding its own properties to be saved like

8181603
width	height
if you want your items to be scrollable in vertical wrappanel you should contraint your height in horizontal - width

if this doesnt solve things you will be able to get better help if you post your table structure the query and the code which is accessing the query so we can diagnose the problem more efficiently

8181746
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
indexeddb has been over-engineered in my opinion and is not widely supported yet for all of mozilla s insistence that its better than sliced bread and websql s future is looking a bit uncertain as mozilla is refusing to implement it and it is no longer being worked on due to an impasse between w3c and the browser vendors who have actually implemented it google-chrome safari opera

8181746
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
there is currently a bit of a browser explosion happening thanks to smartphone adoption so its hard to determine how much of the market supports html5 localstorage features but using statcounter i ve been able to calculate that between google-chrome 4+ firefox 3.+ safari 4+ opera 10.5+ and ie 8+ including iphone and android devices you ll have captured around 80-85 of the market with this figure going upwards a rate of 1-2 per month

8181797
innodb	myisam
i keep reading that when you convert your database from myisam storage engine over to innodb engine you must add support for deadlocks in your application code

8181799

int	boolean
your constructor has one int and one boolean

8181859

on a side note the room constructor takes an int and a boolean value while you are sending two int

8181863
int	boolean
public room int roomnumber boolean ensuite

8181865
effort	automapper
automapper does everything you d need here so it seems redundant effort

8181899
versioning	upgrade
have your script create a database versioning table with the versioning number date and time of upgrade and the software revision number that performed the upgrade and whether it succeeded or not anything you can think that is useful

8181899
versioning	upgrade
also make sure it inserts a row into your versioning table every time you upgrade

8181899
versioning	upgrade
when you start your binary program get it to check the maximum versioning number against the expected db versioning to ensure that the binary is compatible with the database versioning else upgrade

8181899
versioning	upgrade
extending this further you can upgrade between vastly different versioning by having it loop through a set of upgrade scripts

nswindow	nsbutton
nsbutton is an nsview subclass nsview has a window property which gives access to the nswindow it is in

8181976
nswindow	nspanel
if the button is in an nspanel then its window property would contain that panel nspanel is a subclass of nswindow

8182053
min	max
the rangevalidator s min max values are set in the button s click event

8182068
setinterval	settimeout
basically similar to a settimeout setinterval can also fire later when the page or the os browser itself is busy with other tasks.

2 i thought that the precise way to keep track of distance traveled speed and altitude is to call the delegate of cllocation every few seconds with an nstimer going to call a method that contains

8182515
post	get
i don t do silverlight but what i get from that post is that you will now need to implement the caching

8182594
maven	m2e
strange as it sounds m2e does not really invoke maven to do the build

8182594
maven	m2e
it does so by mapping maven plugins to special m2e eclipse plugins

8182594
maven	m2e
sometimes when no mapping exists you get a warning and you have a choice of either disabling this part of your build or running the maven plugin in i guess default wrapper provided by m2e

8182649
cos	sin
polar is well-suited to rotation operations and scaling i guess but sticking with cartesian where a rotation is four multiplies see below is probably going to be cheaper than using cos sin acos asin every time you want to do a vector addition

8182649
cos	sin
if a is known ahead of time then cos a and sin a can be precomputed

8182701
switching	screens
create different scenes for different screens in your game and switching between them - switching between scenes is fast and easy much faster than activities

8182915
mouseleave	mouseenter
i also changed it to use mouseenter mouseleave so the event won t trigger when you hover over the slided up info

8182924
for-loop	loops
also note that you don t limit scope loops variable to the for-loop it s not declared with var so that means that later modifications to that variable will be propagated to all closures

one of the other nice things about this method is that the configs are inherited by subclassing but can be overridden

8183230
hide	show
now i would like to be able to hide and show them from each view controller

8183262
superclass	subclassing
note also that this code will print only direct uiview subclassing if you want to go further down the hierarchy you ll probably need to call listed code recursively with desired superclass as a parameter

8183277
for-loop	loops
rewrite your code so that while loops approach and for-loop approach both go in separate implementations of runnable or callable interface

8183284

put	get
for example create seperate folder in images call it thumnails images thumbnails add there put files prefixed with file size for ex original_file_name_200x200.jpg store on database original_file_name and extension jpg to seperate fields name ext then when you need to display it select name add size prefix and add extension you get images thumbnails file_200x200.jpg this way you can add later more sizes leaving original untouched

8183787
serializable	deserialization
i ve been looking at some tutorials but the ones i was able to find only deal with classes from the same assembly plus my understanding of the serializable and deserialization process in .net is minimal - a link to a detailed explanation might be helpful

inherited	properties
the datacontext properties is introduced to the inherited hierarchy in the frameworkelement

8184324

nstimer	nsrunloop
nstimer s attach to nsrunloop s which are the cocoa form of an event loop

jquery	simplemodal
but when you leave the page and go back the scripts loaded via jquery 1.6.1 and simplemodel plugin load instantly but the lazyload d include of jquery 1.6.2 via google doesn t run through cache since its a script and thus is loading after the first two scripts overwriting the jquery object to 1.6.2 and removing the simplemodal script loaded into the object

8185317
pull	push
it s a web app for mercurial that supports pull and push but also does things like fork management on the server like bitbucket or git-hub it s also really nice for exploring changesets or files but for you it s the developers being able to set-up their own forks on the server that i think would be the main selling point

the problem is that google-chrome i haven t heard of safari doing this as well but i ll take you word for it kills the selection after the focus event has fired so you need to add a timer

you can probably get around that with some handling of mousedown and mouseup events

as mentioned by moastab fflush stdout works for octave

8190915

8190941
udp	tcp
well the thing with udp is that it usually works really well and it has a real low latency compared to tcp

8190941
voip	rtp
that is probably the reason why it is used in almost every voip application for real time video etc see also rtp rfc 3550 in almost every online game etc

8190941
put	get
the bottom line is that when using udp you will have to put a lot more effort into the client intelligence in order to get things right than you would have to using a stateful transport protocol

8191078
scheme	racket
historically scheme not racket has always allowed re-definitions

8191090
virtualenv	setuptools
if you want to stick to a setuptools install you should probably look for a config file there and advertise it loudly to your users but if defaults are needed they should be read from inside the package itself using something like resource_stream so that you can be sure you will find it no matter wether setup was run from system installed easy_install into a virtualenv or by a packaging system like rpm

8191244

8191478
virtualenv	setuptools
by default virtualenv will install a version of setuptools but it does have an option to use distribute instead

8191478
virtualenv	setuptools
a simple workaround when using virtualenv on os x seems to be to also use its no-site-packages option which will prevent the setuptools version from the system python interfering with the required distribute in the virtualenv

you ll want to provide getter and setter methods because the variables are inaccessible

8199584
width	height
i haven t tried it but basically you would need to change width related variable references to height and height related variable references to width so that the code will work on the vertical dimension instead of the horizontal dimension

8199624
width	height
it is because you did not set the width and height of the in the html

what you can do though is send that json the content body of a post request via the webrequest webclient

8199803

8200034
mkmapview	mapkit
unfortunately this is a limitation of the google maps api which only accepts integer values when setting the map s zoom level apple s mapkit code is calling the underlying google maps apis when you set a mkmapview s displayed area and the result â no matter which mapkit method you use to set the area â is a map that s zoomed out to the nearest integer zoom level

8200034
mkmapview	mapkit
troy brant s code takes you full circle and puts a layer above the mapkit apis that allows you to set the zoom level directlyâ but ultimately you don t have precise control over the area displayed by an mkmapview unless the zoom level of your desired map happens to be an integer

8201051
rpm	yum
to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system

getter	setter
as per the xhtml page where the data is submitted i ve tested that an all fields make it to the next page through getter and setter

8201585
getter	setter
in most cases getter and setter do reveal bad desing

8201585
getter	setter
the main reason to use getter and setter should be for debugging so when you re accessing some base class member from a derived class you have a point you can set a breakpoint at to intercept changes to that member

8201585
getter	setter
if more protected setter getter might be a better option - you don t want to set breakpoints in every class that can possibly modify a member of the base class

8201587
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are an explicit way of saying that this member variable is available for use and usually they should be used to expose the member to external entities

public	protected
protected is closer to public than private

8202001
getter	setter

this would be a simple hide and show effect

8202152
strlen	substr

8202513
cdr	cons
for instance when you do this define lst 4 5 under the hood this is what gets assigned to lst cons 4 cons 5 so when you evaluate cdr lst you get the second element of the first cons which happens to be cons 5 which in turn gets printed as 5

8202513
cdr	cons
for extracting only the second element in the list not the second element of the first cons which is what cdr does you could

8202513

hide	show
the effect you are creating clicking a div show hide it isn t possible with purely css

8202561
for-loop	loops
please note the use of the and instead of the || or and the useless of the i 2 because you can loops only on the odd numbers by changing a little bit the for-loop

d sin angle and d cos angle gives you the change

8202935
cos	sin
sin a cos a tan a

8202936
strcpy	strncpy
no because when you call scanf strcpy except for strncpy where you need to manually put zero if it exceeds the size it copies the null terminator for you

8202992
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then it is easy to serialize and deserialize each player or an arraylist of them using objectoutputstream objectinputstream

8203001
stateless	stateful
but since it s annoying in a stateless web framework like play to manage stateful entities such as the ones defined in the official jpa specification we have provided a special flavor of jpa keeping things as stateless as possible

8203007
sin	sqrt	pow	sin	pow	sqrt	cos	sin	cos	atan2	cos	sqrt	cos	exp	atan2	sin	atan2	sqrt
note the math functions acos asin atan atan2 cos exp log pow sin and sqrt may result in slightly different values depending on the algorithms used by the cpu or operating system

8203007
cpu	processors
that is i assume some languages implement their own algorithms for the above functions and so may be more consistent except for differences in round-off errors introduced by the choice of processors cpu that would exist for all languages

8203013
google-chrome	firefox
test in the good browsers google-chrome and firefox

that is no problem and is very useful when you only want to use superclass methods over a set of your own subclassing especially common with view controllers in a navigation stack when the specific type of next view controller is unknown

8203091
express	node.js
if you are looking for serious web development using node.js use express framework

note the behaviour of the functions acos asin atan atan2 cos exp

8203099
sin	sqrt	pow	sin	pow	sqrt
log pow sin sqrt and tan is not precisely specified here except

8203101
free	malloc
that s undefined behavior and you re writing to memory that doesn t belong to s1 and would have weird effects maybe even disrupting malloc s backend information making it hard to free memory

8203114
int	chars
my best guess is that strlen is correct in that its a 35 chars string and you re trying to cast that into an int and its too big

8203147
scheme	racket
the more idiomatic scheme racket way to do this would be to write a function that consumes the original input and returns a new separate list that has the modifications you want

8203183
getter	setter
there should be no overhead to synthesized properties to written getter setter as the compiler will create more or less the same at compile time

8203183
getter	setter
at any point in future you can decide to write a custom getter setter

8203184
sorting	filtering
i m using viewer framework in my eclipse rcp application wherein my table has all the capabilities like sorting and filtering the problem is with when i select a row in the table it gets highlighted in blue color by default when a user try to filtering using search box provided which is located above the table then the previously selected row gets faded away.to overcome this i thought it would be better to have a custom color or predefined color like red and which doesn t get faded away even table-viewer loses focus i don t know

8203194
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.4.5

8203201
debian	linux
the underlying operating system debian linux in this case does not allow the process to create any more threads

8203204
public	protected
similarly to c++ objective c provides public private and protected scopes

8203204
public	protected
variable scope is defined by public private protected package modifiers

8203212
put	get
but when i use even the most basic programs and incorporate the cin keyword and run the program i dont get an oppurtunity to put in anything during runtime and sometimes it inserts random values by itself

8203234
implements	modifiers
you can access any methods implements in the base class subject to access modifiers regardless of whether they are marked virtual or not

8203235
folder	directory
i rearranged directory so i have now 54 folder in each below 1000 files and committed this to svn

8203246
public	protected
it is access modifiers private public protected that affects if you are able to call the base class method in the derived class or not

8203283
uniq	grep
since you mention grep i m guessing you want to use the shell so uniq will remove duplicates

8203286
textview	imageview
i am using a relativelayout with an imageview and a textview as children

8203303
google-chrome	safari
it also works on all webkit browsers safari + google-chrome

please refer to my post on stackoverflow testng emma cobertura coverage and jdk 7 result in classformaterror and verifyerror

8203381
hide	show
your datacontext class or viewmodel could implement visibility properties to show and hide different parts of the input if the differences are not too great between the uses

8203416
int	chars
unsigned int is still the same size you want unsigned chars

8203433
rank	max
i have tried changing the id to rank and change it so that it first goes and check rank 1 then rank 2 and up to rank 10 max rank but then it still just shows all of the clans in an order which i don t want it to

8203510
hide	show
hide all appropriate divs and then based on change event show the appropriate one

fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
pick one - macports fink or homebrew are the most popular on os x - and stick with it

8203583
fink	macports
you should at some point evaluate what packages you have installed with fink and macports pick one install any missing ports packages in it and entirely delete the other package system

8203593
super	implements	super	self
the first method copyfrom self event can be implements by calling the super -method

8203694
rss	feed
you wouldn t use sencha for the rss feed it s would just be standard rails code

8203702
qthread	qmainwindow
i have a qmainwindow that starts a qthread and waits for data from the network

8203720
getter	setter
perhaps creating file.prototype.filename setter and getter that set get name will solve your problem

8203727
button	checkbox
i also believe in this case you are looking for a radio button and not a checkbox

8203727
button	checkbox
checkbox allow for multiple checks in a set of boxes where radio button only allow for one to be chosen from within a group

8203735
inherited	properties
in the simplified code below i am trying to inherited the name properties from the synthesizer class to the roland class but the only way i seem to be able to access it is by using synth2.prototype.name rather than by synth2.name which returns undefined

8203760
fast-forward	merge
you can use git merge --no-ff to avoid performing a fast-forward merge and thus always creating a merge commit

8203762
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
then in the qgraphicsscene that s associated with the qgraphicsview i reimplemented the dropevent function

8203784
fast-forward	merge
if the current state of a branch is just a series of commits based on the head of another branch a so-called fast-forward merge is performed

8203790
width	height	jeditorpane	jviewport
jeditorpane seems to have a very interesting feature it seems to track its parent width and determines the preferred height accordingly also if the parent is not a jviewport

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
just replace new jeditorpane with new jtextpane a richer subclass of jeditorpane and the feature disappear

8203790
width	height
this means that first the size width must be set then the preferred size height will be ok

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
but just for jeditorpane not for jtextpane

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
it has been used a jtextpane in place of jeditorpane

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
summary the track size property is observed in jeditorpane but nothing similar exists in jtextpane

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
at this point the feature seems implemented by the document implementation and not by the jeditorpane or jtextpane itself

8203790
width	height
i also notice that the good javax.swing.text.plaindocument that gives us this great service of calculating the height of a component when the width is given through setsize isn t assignable to a jtextpane that expects a styleddocument instance

8203840
post	get
as for your other post related to display some circles as linearlayout s background i m playing with inset scale layer drawable resources see drawable resources for further information to get something working to display perfect circles in the background of a linearlayout but failed at the momentâ

8203983
min	max
use group by and use group functions max min group_concat etc for time column

8203989
qdatastream	qbytearray
if you want to send the whole image in one go you could try using qdatastream for serialization of a qbytearray

8203989
udp	tcp
as udp doesn t provide ordering guarantees like tcp the fragments could come in the wrong order without the qdatastream header

8203989
udp	tcp
you may want to read a comparison of tcp and udp and evaluate which fits your needs better

8204002
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

a view is basically a web page an rss feed a csv file in fact any kind of data that your application might output to the end user

8204130
oncreate	onstart
i tried putting the code into onstart instead thinking that oncreate might run too early creating a race-condition but no luck with that either

8204149
listview	gridview
for the child records you seem to want either a gridview or a listview

8204155
mojolicious	catalyst

screens	tablet
currently there is much diversity of devices conventional computer web browsers mobile browsers browsers tablet etc all with some limitations especially concerning screens resolution

8204218
fast-forward	merge
most of the time that works fine but certain directory operations can conflict with each other even when you are doing the svn equivalent of a fast-forward merge in which case you will have a lot of manual cleanup to do

8204227
express	node.js
i just started getting into node.js and followed this great tutorial on node.js at howtonode express and mongod

8204234
put	get

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
with opera safari and firefox it works perfectly but with google-chrome it doesn t works because google-chrome use an other protocol draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-08

8204341
for-loop	loops
according to the java language specification â 14.14.2 the variable of an enhanced for-loop must be local to loops

8204341
for-loop	loops
conceptually this last perfectly legal loops could have been used as the functional equivalent of the second enhanced for-loop above the one that does not compile

8204341
for-loop	loops
also just as with the regular loops an enhanced for-loop using a bare variable name that was not defined the line state state

8204354
width	height
1em is the height of an m rather than the width

8204354
width	height
and you will notice width and height of the span are different

8204379
unsigned	short
for example is going to be when converted to unsigned short int

8204396
int	chars
there is no semantic difference here but a subtle difference in bytecode ch + 1 is an int so the first code snippet does a chars to chars comparison followed by an int to int comparison while the second does two chars to chars comparisons

8204422
spaces	delimiter
you can t easily use the spaces character as both a phrase delimiter and an allowable character within the phrase itself

8204451
oncreate	findviewbyid
try moving the findviewbyid into the oncreate and check if it works there

8204458
redhat	fedora
in fedora redhat you could use chkconfig --list | grep named to check the status then use service named start to start it up and chkconfig on named to have it start up at boot time

8204463
children	parent
a parent doesn t have any children that themselves have child children

8204580
children	parent
now i need to get the parent text minus the children text

8204594
width	height
make the star image the width height you want for the whole blue block and leave the area around the star transparent

8204594
hide	show
show hide the highlight images based on which tab you re currently in

8204599
regexbuddy	rubular
you can test your regex using a regex tool like regexbuddy or rubular there are tons of regex testers online or a text editor that supports regex

8204700
put	get
i then want to call this method from outside but being very new to java i am not sure how to get that sting in put it in hm object like the one thats commented out

8204722
x86	64bit
note the x86 today definitely does not fetch one byte at a time when it decodes an instruction sensible sized reads occur probably 64bit at a time and the processor will pull the bytes out of that as needed

8204723
post	get
name is also used to label the fields in the message send to a server with an http hypertext transfer protocol get or post when you hit submit in a form

8204777
kde	gnome
ideally i would like to do the same for kde kdm and gnome 2 versions as well

8204898
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
inspect element in google-chrome firefox and view source in safari are there because the internet is open sourced

8204957
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it s possible but it s not yet standardized as far as i know google-chrome probably supports it as well

8205029
rss	feed
to read an rss feed

8205044
width	height
your image takes 3264 1952 4 25.5mb width height argb

8205072
cpu	processors
several techniques were utilized to simulate the co-handling of multiple tasks processes threads user interfaces by techniques known as multi-tasking co-operating or preemptive multi-user aka time-sharing multi-threaded with threads being more lightweight than processes as viewed by the operating system by a single processors by dividing the cpu s usage in varying manners to give the appearance of multiple tasks running simultaneously but technically they are merely stopping and starting so fast that the human user cannot detect the pauses

8205095
ienumerable	ilist
after that your usercontrol will implement the imagesource your ilist or ienumerable of images and your interval as dependency properties

8205163
min	max
i have a winforms usercontrol in a dll that has it s max size and min size set to 600x500

8205192
memcpy	memmove
it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

8205192
memcpy	memmove
a memmove function written entirely in portable c would on many platforms probably take at least twice as long to execute as would a memcpy also written entirely in portable c

8205192
memcpy	memmove
i don t know of any that will do it with memmove although in some cases an optimized version of memcpy may offer the same semantics as memmove

8205192
memcpy	memmove
in theory a compiler could process memmove by seeing if treading it as memcpy would yield an implementation that would be safe even if the address ranges overlap and call _memmove in those cases where substituting the memcpy implementation would not be safe

8205226
cos	sin
convert all latitude-longitude pairs to x y z triples using the following formulae x sin î cos ï y sin î sin ï z cos î

8205234
width	height
would return a tuple with the width and height of the image

8205238
freebsd	solaris
solaris doesn t support getting it via sysctl on an af_route socket like freebsd does

8205239
width	height
then linearly scale the height or the width to match the device s one and put black rectangles on the borders

8205268
int	chars
on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that

8205279
fixed-point	rational-numbers
you can either use some sort of fixed-point interpretation of integers measure everything in units of 1 1000 or you can use decimal floats rare or you can store rational-numbers quotients of integers

8205279
subtraction	addition
if you only do addition and subtraction fixed-point would be the natural way to go

8205283
uilabel	uibutton
i want to know how can i create a custom uibutton with uilabel inside like this

8205284
int	boolean
conversation has relevant fields id int user1_id int user2_id int user1_deleted boolean user2_deleted boolean created_at datetime updated_at datetime

8205345
width	height
and when you put some elements in it they will create their own height and width and the floated-element will be rendered how can push them my english is really bad so sorry

declare it non-static including the getter and setter to have different instances for my and my2 and you re good to go

8205438
int	double
4.096 is a floating point value of type double just less than 4.1 while dword is an integral type usually something like an unsigned int

8205438
floating-point	fractions
naturally you lose the fractions part of the floating-point value in the conversion

8205487
carrierwave	paperclip
both carrierwave and paperclip will use the tools from the path so set the path first and then start your rails application

8205496
implements	extends
1 assuming that movie and cd both extends implements media

8205568
subtract	add
so if you get the date millis and then subtract or add days 86400 1000 and then create another date object with the result

8205607
ubuntu	debian
istr some mutterings from postgres users about how debian ubuntu s default of having ident authentication is more confusing than helpful

8205663
int	double
is a double constant so will perform a floating-point division instead of an int division

8205672
int	boolean
in as3 everything is pass-by-reference except primitives boolean string int uint etc which have special operators behind the scenes to make them act like pass-by-value

8205680
client-side	server-side
instead of using ajax to submit a request client-side you can do it server-side

8205698
post	get
in the query string e.g is known as a get method and the other method which sends data behind the scenes is post

8205698
post	get
you can in fact use both get and post at the same time

8205756
min	max
find the new min max

8205756
min	max
now calculcate the derivative to find min max or iterate over d to get a result

8205757
width	height
if you just want the image to fit the whole screen then make the imageview fill_parent for both width and height and then set the image of that imageview to use the appropriate scale type

8205780
background-repeat	background-image	background-image	background-color
so rather than typing background ... make sure you type it fully and use background-image background-color background-repeat etc

8205813
hash	salt
the hash method takes the input string and hash it using mcrypt + a salt

8205813
hash	salt
i plan to modify the code such that hash method accepts a salt parameter

8205813
hash	salt
this way i can get a salt store it in the db store the hash in the db and use user s input + salt to see if it hash to what i have stored in the db

8205824
post	put	post	get	put	get
all request methods get head post options put trace delete brew may have get-style request parameters

8205824
content-length	content-type
if you have a post-style request body with other methods actually depends less on the http verb but on the presence of a content-type and content-length request header

8205828
setinterval	settimeout
use requestanimationframe instead of setinterval settimeout

8205828
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and settimeout were never intended to be used as animation timers they re just generic methods for calling functions after a time delay

8205828
setinterval	settimeout
even better than using requestanimationframe in place of settimeout and setinterval joe lambert has written a new and improved shim called requestinterval and requesttimeout which he explains what issues exist when using requestanimframe

8205835
homography	keypoint
i ve already found keypoint found homography using ransac but i can t figure out how to align these 2 images i m new at opencv

8205850
hash	salt
the hash in this case also contains the salt

8205850
hash	salt
passing the hash to verify is just done to use that salt value again the rest of the hash is ignored

8205851
hash	salt
when you create the hash returns a string that contains both the hash value and the initial salt

8205851
hash	salt
when you subsequently say the function first reads the salt part out of your input string then creates the hash again with that salt and finally compares that computed hash with the hash part of your input string

8205851
hash	salt
in any salinated hashing scheme you will always have to store the salt along with the hash value

8205867
exponent	modulo
the private exponent on the other hand is derived from public key and the modulo factorization and usually in the size order of the modulo itself

8205906
nsbutton	nsmatrix
you could simply use a single-row nsmatrix of nsbutton objects

8205978
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
these directions will be different if you re working with a uinavigationcontroller that manages its own uinavigationbar

8205998
isometric	draw
i already have my algorithm to draw each position of my isometric map something like this

8206046

keep in mind that by default on x64 os an application compiled as both cpu x64 and x86 will use the 64bit version of the driver this means that if you install the 32bit version of the odbc driver and compile the executable as both cpu or x64 you will get the error so you have to compile the application only x86

versioning	upgrade
as for a tutorial the best way to learn how to upgrade code from one versioning to the other is to read the changelog of the 1.3 to learn about the differences with 1.2 and from the 1.3 to the 1.4 if you want to upgrade to the latest versioning

i have tried firefox ie 7 8 google-chrome and the modal panel and tooltip does not work and in ie it complaing afj undefined tooltip undefined etc

8219323
int	chars
if you re just moving around int s or chars s it would be no more expensive to shuffle the data than the pointer

8219327
int	chars
looking into the source code of int i see that some chars of your string 40 returned a negative value most probably -1 for character.digit s.charat i++ radix where i is iterating over string s chars and radix is 10

8219377
puts	gets
you can test gets that way but not puts

this has the additional benefit of doing fewer calls to cos and sin

8219506
post	get
note that while it s not the primary purpose of the addon superglobals by boldminded lets you access get and post variables directly in your templates via or keywords

8219506
post	get
another addon allowing access to get and post vars is mo variables by rob sanchez which is free

8219641
hash	md5
you ll see that you or at least this example sends some md5 hash random string to facebook

8219654
hide	show
edit if you want to show certain content instead of going to the wall make an absolute positioned div on top of your hidden content and hide the div when it s liked

8219676
atoi	strcpy
the first three are plain strcpy the last one would take use of atoi

8219694
disk	ram
when i use ram disk software to create a virtual drive it is possible to address an image source to load it like this

8219694
disk	ram
img src z image.jpg that z is a ram disk drive

8219857
subtract	add
so you should take the utc time subtract 6 hours off do the check and then add the hour back on if applicable

8219860
width	height
by default the position for each item is static so all i did was change it to absolute so that when the src of the image changes and thus its width and height it doesn t mess with the position of the other elements

8220006
gridview	onclientclick
inside the gridview i have an imagebutton with an onclientclick method

8220006
updatepanel	onclientclick	gridview	onclientclick
previously to get the onclientclick method to fire i would make sure the gridview wasn t in an updatepanel and that the pageload databinding of the gridview was in an if not ispostback

8220031
width	height
my idea is that i should draw horizontal and vertical lines and calculating the width and height by dividing the range of the boundaries by n

8220046
for-loop	arrays
i m going to hazard a guess that you re not getting out of the for-loop because you re exceeding the bounds of either midrep which you haven t given us the type of or diar1 which is clearly an arrays of fileinfo objects

8220106
min	max
edit ah i see what you mean fluid with maximum width most of the aforementioned stands change 95 to 100 and min to max

8220110
stdout	stderr
means redirect stdout to dev null and stderr to the place where stdout points at that time

8220110
stdout	stderr
if you want stderr to occur on console and only stdout going to dev null you can use

8220110
stdout	stderr
in this case stderr is redirected to stdout your console and afterwards the original stdout is redirected to dev null

8220148
rss	feed
i am attempting to consume my zenfolio rss feed so that i can display the images in the feed

8220165

now you just need to hide and show this eventbox via your callbacks

8220174
min	max
i have points of 512 steps between the min and max values

8220187
width	margin
so if you need to have a 1024 pixels width website you just make your container to be 1024 pixels fat and margin auto

8220192
post	get
when i click any of the boxes i do get the post that are in that category but there s no formatting just the header sidebar and footer

8220220

8220316
post	get
i did also go through this facebook fql to get all status messages from an app post and added the limit but still it doesnot work

8220328
express	node.js
also use express npm library instead of plain node.js web server - it does most of this work on sending and receiving json on server for you

8220423
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
appdelegate - uitabbarcontroller - uitableview - uiviewcontroller within which the mpmovieplayerviewcontroller is called

8220444
integer	unsigned
this value is then cast to an unsigned integer which turns into a very large value

8220450
width	height
green border around the width of 1440 and height of 745

8220468
google-chrome	firefox
i was using this with great success in google-chrome and firefox

8220506
width	height	subtract	add
edit it appears you need to subtract double the width of the border you plan to add from the width and height to avoid showing any scrollbars

8220517
children	parent
array_key_exists tree parent children id

8220517
children	parent
array_key_exists tree parent children id

8220553
getter	setter
also is there anyway to control when in the compilation pipeline i can generate code because we have a lot of data objects using public fields instead of getter setter but that are bindable and so if i could generate the proxy based on the generated getter setter methods that would work

8220672
int	double
a c90 compiler will assume that sqrt returns int -- and it will generate code to convert the result from int to double

8220723
ant	maven
i ve always taken the classpath for granted - its something that eclipse maven ant etc handled for me

8220738
queue	fifo
this queue is the correct solution for my requirements and it more importantly allows serialisation of my blocks to be run on the fifo order

8220773
for-loop	loops
run a for-loop by repeating loops based on number of fields

8220883
google-chrome	firefox
you can change volume levels under both firefox and google-chrome like this

8220919
spaces	delimiter
now the problem is the only the first character s before the spaces delimiter gets put into the array

8220924
inherited	properties
this is actually very easy a uiscrollview inherited from a uiview so you just need to set the backgroundcolor properties

8220943
timsort	in-place
so if you want to test sorting some care is required so that one pass at an in-place sort doesn t affect the next pass with already sorted data that of course would make the timsort really shine because it performs best when the data already partially ordered

8220956
boost	stl
is there any standard solution for example in stl or in boost

8220966
bmp	png
for example that list typically returns both png and bmp and other formats

8220966
bmp	png
but there s not one png nor one bmp

8220966
bmp	png
heck bmp is actually so complex that i think that you can embed png encoded pixels inside a bmp shell

8220966
bmp	png
the error consists in thinking that there s one png or one bmp format

8220976
google-chrome	firefox
the same behavior appears to come up in both firefox and google-chrome

8221049
pivot-table	crosstab
note that a pivot-table is also known as a crosstab or cross tabulation

8221055
setinterval	settimeout
then again it s better than settimeout setinterval which fires only once per second if the tab is not active in google chrome a common use case for audio file listening

8221055
setinterval	settimeout
if however in your app you can ensure that the tab is active while listening then settimeout or setinterval is better as it can fire as often as 100 times per second

8221064
int	boolean
queueconnection.createqueuesession boolean transacted int acknowledgemode

8221156
mouseover	mouseout
it s supposed to for sub menus on a top level navigation. however the mouseover event gets fired but not the mouseout event

8221224
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
look at this demo in google-chrome or safari it works as expected in firefox and opera as far as i can tell.

8221235
nginx	cherokee	apache	nginx	apache	cherokee
i personally use cherokee but apache or nginx or anything else can use it too

8221257
postgresql	mysql
due to the complexity of sql language of various databases such as oracle sql server db2 mysql teradata postgresql the sql parser we created to support those databases was a little bit complicated as well

8221275
floor	sqrt
at least with gcc on my machine it s clearly the fastest integer square root function i ve tested including the functions in hacker s delight this page and floor sqrt from the standard library

8221275
integer	unsigned
it can t be generalized for full-blown 64-bit unsigned integer inputs without losing precision though and the first signed conversion would also have to be replaced by a load intrinsic to handle values 2 63

8221276
gxt	smartgwt
depend on smartgwt or gxt

8221276
gxt	smartgwt
smartgwt and gxt will seem attractive for a simple project

8221278
innodb	myisam
i considered using a myisam db and a full text search but decided that because of the performance hit it would be better to stick with innodb

8221309
inherited	properties
this is out-of-scope of the lan properties gui but you should look up dllgetclassobject a c++ class that inherited from ccomobjectroot and ccomcoclass a call to object_entry_auto and a begin_com_map if you re new to com.

8221341
width	height
when i use this method i m playing with the width and height of the scroll bars to come up with 34

it is generally not a good idea to let the client-side make changes to data on the server-side

8221438
children	parent
on my system wait will only return when direct children complete such that your version with wait will print deterministically children will always complete before parent continue

8221442
pop-up	dialog
the lowdown - i have an asp.net form in an intranet engineering application that needs to pop-up a jquery dialog when the submit button is pressed in certain circumstances

8221442
submit	submission
in the certain circumstances the user needs to confirm a question and the form needs to continue with submission including executing the server-side code for the submit button s click event

8221451
min	max
use the main query as a subquery taken for each record the min timestamp and max timestamp and so take the respective open and close prices for them

i have three strings a nsstring a nsmutablestring and another nsstring which i need to concatenate into a mutable string in that order to display as the source for a uiwebview

8221776
nsmutablestring	nsstring
to give a bit of setting for this the first string nsstring is the header and canvas element of a web page the second string nsmutablestring is javascript from a text field that the user can define to manipulate the canvas element and the third string nsstring is the end tags of the web page

8221833
sqldf	rmysql
it is desired to use sqlite with sqldf even though rmysql is loaded

8221908
puts	gets
i prefer to approach this model with the assumption requirement that once an object consumed from the queue it can be considered owned by that thread the thread that puts the object there should relinquish the object until it gets the object back via another queue if ever

8221908
queue	fifo
this queue orders elements fifo fifo .

8221909
vim	emacs
i tried them both and the option key works as expected in bash set -o emacs mode and emacs but not in vim

8221913
uiview	subviews
since the tabview managed by the tabbarcontroller is a subclass of uiview it will behave the same way - so when you add the view to the tabbarcontrollers view list and it thus subsequently adds that view as a subviews to its tabbarview it will also be removing that view from the other tabbarcontrollers tabview

8221914
put	get
you need to put the code in your application delegate applicationwillenterforeground as it s the only thing to get notified automatically when the app is re-opened your view is not necessarily re-drawn

8221930
bindparam	pdostatement
pdostatement bindparam

8221957

the good thing is that if you wish to change database backend say for instance that you transferred your data from access to sql server or mysql or postgresql etc you just need to change the database connection string not your code

8222945
width	height
why don t you use percentage width and height

8228439
gtk#	monomac
i create a new monomac project though i get the same issue with gtk#

8228517
getter	setter
i don t know about ignoring methods but you could take a tool that autogenerates the unit tests for your getter and setter so those methods are covered

8228520
firefox	safari
however it doesn t work at all when running in my desktop browser safari 5.1.1 firefox 7 on windows

8228539
pop-up	dialog
since now there is this alert dialog box which pop-up after user pin point it with 2 buttons yes and no so if yes fetch that location address back to the textbox

8228559
gtk#	monomac
monomac projects are not based on gtk#

8228583
folder	directory
this can of course be resolved by copying the contents of the msbuild visualstudio folder to the equivalent directory on the build server but this is not a manageable solution for server configuration

8228588
maven	pom.xml
now i put both project a and b into a multi-module maven project named c and have the pom.xml of project b changed so it includes the dependency of a

8228734
hide	show
i usually show a progress bar after animation completes wait about 50ms on a background thread to allow the progress bar to update it s ui and then bind to the list and hide the progress bar

8228756
width	height
command with width and height corresponding to the width and height

8228762
opera	safari
this is the case for safari 4 opera 11.00 and possibly other browsers.

8228801
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this is called the named returned value optimization nrvo or just return-value-optimization

8228811
mongoid	mongomapper
jcollum the problem is coming from the fact that you are using mongoid but the examples on mongodb.org are using mongomapper

8228812
google-chrome	safari
also it turns out that in the case of google-chrome and safari as well as ie the scrollbar is brought back to the top for a split second when the page is reloaded

8228823
put	get
in the above example mysessionbean implements the map interface and i have my own custom get method that will create an object and put it in the map if none exists for the key params.id

8228948

mp4 supporting browser ie9+ google-chrome 4+ safari 3.2+ andriod 2.1+

8228990
folder	directory
but in eclipse i could not find the lib folder even after expanding all of the directory shown in the navigator area

8229026
inherited	properties
unfortunately the cascading and inherited level 3 spec does not appear to propose a way to reset a style properties to its browser default

8229026
inherited	properties
however there are plans to reintroduce a keyword for this in cascading and inherited level 4 â the working group simply hasn t settled on a name for this keyword yet the link currently says default but it is not final and it conflicts with the cursor properties anyway

8229026
inherited	properties
for example if an author specifies all initial on an element it will block all inherited and reset all properties as if no rules appeared in the author user or user-agent levels of the cascade

8229033
ssl	https
using ssl for https transfer of wsdl files

8229033
ssl	https
so you need to either download the .wsdl file manually and run you existing wsdl2h on it or rebuild wsdl2h with make secure so that it knows to include the ssl libraries and support for https

8229089
post	put
my theme is supposed to override the 15 post per page limitation of tumblr and with an endless scroll option it should put all my post all of them pictures in one endless page

8229104
firefox	safari
it works in firefox but not on my ipad in the safari browser

8229106

8229157
move	drag
i would like the user to be able move a widget within a layout window in sense drag and drop within the same window

8229157
move	drag
i ve seen drag and drop examples which are around 1000 lines of code which enable dragging between screens and different widgets but i intend to only move the widget in the screen

8229160
children	parent
using normal opacity affects the children of the element so the text just gets 100 of the parent opacity which in this case is 0.12

8229236
maven	cobertura
i use the cobertura maven plugin for one of my project

8229264
qstring	qbytearray
a qstring can be re-created from a qbytearray but be sure to use qstring.fromutf8 since the constructor for qstring that takes a qbytearray assumes it s in ascii

8229264
hash	md5
...but note that qt has built-in support for cryptographic hash of qbytearray as long as you re happy with md4 md5 or sha-1

8229355
width	height
they should get bigger and after this they should get to their old width and height

8229383
maven	m2e
the best way to learn how jung2 works is to look at its samples from svn repository using maven svn checkout jung-read-only via m2e maven eclipse plugin

8229439
nsscanner	nsstring
use the floatvalue nsstring method or a nsscanner which is more powerful and flexible

8229468
google-chrome	firefox
is what it s supposed to look like but when i look at it with google-chrome or firefox i get this

8229508
folder	directory
remember that in windows you cannot create a directory by yourself with name .m2 and so you have to cut the directory paste in in c and then copy it back into your user folder

8229515
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
depending on the selection you can push a specific uitabbarcontroller to the uinavigationcontroller

8229535
width	height
i want to add dynamically to a container but i want this container to have fixed height and width the added divs should scale themselves to fit in the container thus also avoiding scroll bar in the container

8229536
rspec	capybara
try using the capybara rspec matcher have_select locator options instead

8229564
folder	directory
i really think that i need to use a bash script that either iterates through virtual hosts from httpd.conf or uses find or something and one way or another cd s into every site install directory inside very installation platform s sites folder we have a pretty messy setup and runs drush upwd admin --password newpassword

8229588
nsmutablestring	nsstring
given that neither 0x02 or 0x03 will cause the nsstring to terminate if you re confident about the length then i think the easiest thing to do is to remove them after the nsstring is created via stringbyreplacingoccurrencesofstring or nsmutablestring s replaceoccurrencesofstring withstring options range saving you from any errors where 0x02 or 0x03 crop up in the byte stream as part of a multi-byte character

8229621
h.264	webm
additionally although brightcove announced plans to support webm as well as h.264 18 months ago it seems that the html5 player still only supports h.264

8229643
maven	pom.xml
more likely you are wondering how this new jar file can be added to other maven projects by simply adding a dependency in the pom.xml file

8229685
inherited	subclassing
so i created subclassing that inherited from asihttprequest and i m trying to override requestfinished

8229694
width	height
you say you want the container to have fixed height and width but then you make it to have dynamic height and width

8229728
folder	directory
i know with my version of rails 3.1.1 the javascript_include_tag defaults to the app assets javascript directory not the public javascripts folder

8229741
hide	show
i think so i understand it first it will hide all and show the current one thats selected thanks

8229786
oncreate	setcontentview
your custom dialog class will have an oncreate callback in which you can call setcontentview to whatever view you want just like with an activity

8229804
hash	md5
i am using the following command in cmd to generate md5 hash for my app using google maps

8229804
hash	md5
the command runs and no error is shown but md5 hash is not displayed in cmd

8229804
hash	md5
earlier i generated api key for md5 hash regarding the following command

8229828
capistrano	bundler
i am using capistrano to deploy the application code but when i run cap deploy then it fails to install gems using bundler because it expects the gemfile.lock to be in the application directory whereas it is actually in the application rails_code directory

8229842
width	height
you can specify the height and width in the arguments

8229849
width	height
to get an idea of the size of the image itself you should multiply the width height and bytes per pixel

8229882
int	chars
you can use a chars array instead of an int to store large binary numbers for your palindrome class

8229899
google-chrome	firefox
the expected behavior is seen in the image above and is present in ie8 firefox and google-chrome

8229904
factors	matrix
this is making me feel dumb but i am trying to produce a single vector df list etc anything but a matrix concatenating two factors

8229926
packets	pcap
i have a pcap file which have packets

8229932
post	put
there is a default mapping between http methods post put etc. and the functions defined in delphi this is done by a delphi component

8229937
google-chrome	safari
it does not find the geo location on safari and google google-chrome

8229937
google-chrome	safari
can some one tell me how i could make this geollocation example run on safari and google google-chrome

8229975
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show cloned divs

8230020
width	height
i have defined the width and height of a low density screen on my emulator but all of the images and text are now just huge

8230027
for-loop	loops
essentially i call mpi_barrier inside a for-loop and mpi_barrier is visible to all nodes yet after 2 iterations of loops the program becomes deadlocked

8230045
range	max
what i want to be able to do is allow the user to switch between the y-axis going from 0 to max and 0 to the auto range value

8230071
qstring	qchar
eta qstring stores data as 16 bit qchar in order to support unicode

8230090
portrait	landscape
i have a system.window.controls.printdialog and i want to print pages with landscape mode and portrait mode in with single printticket but it seems i only can set the orientation once

8230090
portrait	landscape
there i need pages with landscape and portrait mode in onc document

8230111
oncreate	setcontentview
add this to you oncreate method after you call setcontentview

8230146
youtube	vimeo
if it is a third-party player like for example the jw player or the players from youtube or vimeo you would have to look in to what they support individually

8230162
width	height
the image is too wide the width height and height width need to both be 3 from the docs

8230162
gif	png
we support png jpeg and gif formats

8230169
ready	each
so far i have sped it up slightly by making my stored proc return some of the html ready to be inserted into each element rather than having multiple if statements within the loop and i changed the loop to a while rather than for each which has helped slightly

8230185
move	drag
but i want to move drag on the clip art on the image

8230198
filtering	grouping
i can t figure out the correct way to get a collection of models from the server into my backbone collection assuming i don t want all the models from the db but rather a grouping of models filtering by a specific model property

8230216
hide	show
using show and hide should prove more robust and simpler too

8230224
ssl	https
another way to solve this you can force your code to accept any ssl cert please refer to this discussion accepting a certificate for https on android

8230250
coldfusion	cfchart
i believe that coldfusion s cfchart tag attempts to scale the chart automatically to what it deems the best fit

8230306
min	max
i thought the best way to do this is to obtain the max number and the min number and then populate a table variable with all of the numbers in the sequence

8230311
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
also note that mouseout doesn t actually work very well - hover works using pseudo-events mouseenter and mouseleave emulating some msie functionality

8230314
tiff	png
if i render to png or tiff files this looks just fine on all my servers using this same code put .png in place of .emf

8230318
hide	show
also - you might try the jquery show and hide functions documentation here

8230346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have been messing with this code for quite some time works in firefox google-chrome safari but ie for some reason will only load one time

8230393
overwrite	preserve
on un x edx is a scratch register caller preserve that gets overwrite when you make a function call

8230429
google-chrome	firefox
this is occuring in both firefox and google-chrome browser

8230498
width	height
however you d then have to communicate a message between the gl thread that calls ondraw and the main ui thread which is the only one allowed to change views width height etc

8230575
folder	directory
here is some powershell that will search the appdata directory for all folder containing that special plugin name

8230639
comparator	icomparer
i believe you can implement an icomparer to perform custom joins or unions in linq based on how you implement the comparator method

8230641
profiling	instrumentation
when i run profiling with this code in instrumentation i got 35 memory leaks of player

8230680
for-loop	arrays
so i wrote a for-loop that tells me the values which are stored inside the byte arrays

8230683
width	height
probably you should set the padding then you don t need to set the width and height

8230717
pull	push
normally i push pull changes to server a and only push to server b

8230717
pull	push
however sometimes remote server a is unavailable for me and i push pull my changes only to server b

8230717
pull	push
when remote server a is available again i would like as earlier to push pull to server a and only push to server b

8230765
pull	push
you pull from a merge changes in your local repo and push back to both a and b

8230777
put	get
if i put s in it they get spread out with equal length columns

8230806
folder	directory
you need to create a folder call sqldrivers in the directory containing your exe

8230808
disk	ram
hibernate clarification the main difference between sleep and hibernate is that in sleep everything is kept in ram whereas hibernate saves the current state to disk

8230811
hide	show
if you want to keep the state while the app is running - simply keep the dialog around and show hide it as necessary

8230822
implements	extends
public class mysqlite_methods extends sqliteopenhelper implements tables

8230890
awt	swing
you probably can t use a keylistener to check for user keystrokes since keylistener is part of awt swing but you will need a way to get input from the keyboard

8230903
versioning	upgrade
my package installer says there have been 3 minor versioning upgrade since 17.0

8230961
int	double
in this case bar is not a method taking an int and a double

8230961
int	double
instead it s a method taking no arguments returning a function that takes and int an a double

8230967
children	parent
each parent has two children sprites

8230967
children	parent
what i mean is although the children are attached to the parent and visually appear to move wherever the parent move the point value of the position property remains the same

8230967
children	parent
when you move the parent around the screen you can see the children moving too

8230999
int	chars
how do i do that both the int and chars values can be stored since my given code just takes the chars strings

8231017
versioning	upgrade
you can also upgrade to django development versioning it has more versatile list_filter implementation see which can be used for providing advanced admin filters including or-queries

8231072
dfsort	cobol
i prefer to sort and merge via dfsort in jcl then input that file to the cobol program which takes the user input and provides necessary output

8231098
submit	submission
the return value of the submit handler affects the submission

8231124
int	boolean
i have been reading a lot about volatile but all examples seem to target the basic data types boolean int ... and not objects

8231139
textblock	gridviewcolumn
but i don t know how to find starting from the textblock its containing gridviewcolumn which is in the gridviewrowpresenter columns list and compare it to the grid s gridviewcolumn from gridviewheaderrowpresenter column list to get the header s name

8231150
hide	show
i want to have my view controller sit behind the tab bar so when i hide it it show the view content

8231167
int	boolean
this will return numberfield s as int checkboxes as boolean etc

8231213
client-side	server-side
the objective is to let the client-side object work as normal but when a problem is encountered on any server-side event...pass-in any server-side messages to a separate instance of the validator without affecting any other javascript objects in the page

8231316
google-chrome	firefox
if you inspect your html with google-chrome or firefox when your image is displayed the button div code looks like this

8231319
post	get
i am trying to read an xml feed to get the last post date

8231324
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
seems to be loading fine on my end using google-chrome ie firefox and safari

8231364
put	get
i put them as part of the build path so they get copied but i don t want that to happen every time as it s time consuming

8231410
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome and safari but in ie and firefox it is doing nothing

8231429
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
thus making the uitabbarcontroller pretty much just a uiviewcontroller

8231444
svg	vml
i m not a regular raphaã l user i generally do only straight svg and vanilla dom js but from what i can tell raphaã l explicitly does not support groups svg elements as they do not exist in vml land

8231474
put	get
so i thought maybe it was a scope problem and put at the start of the elif knowing it would be changed in the try but then i get none has no value doesnotexist

8231494
google-chrome	firefox
while it s working great under firefox google-chrome it just doesn t seem to work under ie8 nor ie9

8231535
boost	stl
c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to

8231550
hide	show
this is quite complicated you must listen to various video events to show hide update width of the loader image correctly

8231595
folder	directory
this could also be used for recursively zipping folder of files and other folder however you would need to scan the directory store the file folder names and attributes in order to create a single stream of bytes which isn t so simple basically implementing unix tar

8231612
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari the padding is slightly different

8231612
google-chrome	safari
right now i have the left right padding set to 1.82em which ends up with a little bit of unused space after contact us in google-chrome safari

8231612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have also tried setting it to 31px which ends up rendering perfectly in firefox ie but in google-chrome safari it places the last menu item on a new line

8231612
google-chrome	firefox
i ve read that firefox and google-chrome render padding exactly the same so i m at a loss on this one

8231613
move	drag
when i drag and drop in word as i approach the bottom of the window the window scrolls so i can move to where i want to drop

8231637
spaces	delimiter
if you do not want to use framework tools you could always use string.split on the date time strings and pass in a spaces as the delimiter and then only keep the first element of the result array

8231639
put	get
once you put an object of type x into it you cannot get anything but type x out of it

8231648
put	get
so now i have that one hosting account which serves the wordpress site and when i put domain1.com in the address bar i get that page

8231648
put	get
when i put domain2.com i also get that same page becouse i redirected domain2.com to point to my hosting account and that s fine

8231656
folder	directory
i have the localtestrun.testrunconfig file with some files and folder and they are being copied out to the test run results out directory but when the tests are run it can t find the items because it s looking in c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 9.0 common7 ide instead of the proper test results directory

8231688
portrait	landscape
i found that my device was rotated to landscape before i started my app and my app locks the orientation to portrait by overloading the shouldrotateonorientationchange and returning yes when orientation portrait

8231688
portrait	landscape
i exited my app rotated my ipad to landscape and back to portrait

8231755
copying	overwrite
because you overwrite the null terminator your source string will never end and the method will keep copying until it tries to access memory it shouldn t and segfaults

8231790
portrait	landscape
when i run the app its starts in landscape but when i click the button it goes into portrait mode

8231820
vbscript	jscript
it also means that any application supporting windows script can use multiple languages jscript vbscript perl and others

8231829
min	max
due to some issues we turned it down from 2048 to 1728 max and from 1024 to 512 min

8231862
bsd	aix	solaris	bsd	solaris	aix
i recently did some empirical research on the limits finding values that the number of pushed back characters ranged from 1 aix hp-ux to 4 solaris to big meaning up to 4 kib possibly more on linux and macos x bsd

8231925
int	chars
edit changed from int to chars

8231976
public	protected
i don t know if this is new in vs2010 but you can actually edit the user control s designer and turn all members from protected to public

8231976
public	protected
edit and if you delete a control from the markup whose designer member you had modified from protected to public it will still delete the reference from the designer

8232004
postgresql	mysql
my settings.py did not have a host for mysql database but i needed to add one for postgresql to work

8232014
maven	m2e
to update your eclipse settings or better still make sure m2e is installed and import your maven projects directly into the ide

8232037
post	get
whether i use the feed the post or the statuses parameters i get a lot of information

8232051
width	height
textarea.cleditor width 800px height 300px 0 .focus

8232054
margin	height
i believe that if you give the view property of your uiviewcontroller a fixed bottom margin and a flexible height then it will stretch to fill the height of containing view automatically

8232058
min	max
well i thought this was getting easier but seems it isn t i would like to use boost bisection function bisection but the problems is that sometimes i have only function min and max and the bisection function needs at least 4 arguments 4th argument is tol tol

8232064
webkit	gecko
sub-pixel rendering just isn t supported on webkit like it is on gecko firefox

8232109
opencv	emgucv
i hope this helps you out if not try with a usb camera to ensure it s not a conflict with emgucv opencv not being able to access the device

8232110
opera	google-chrome
note it only currently works on google-chrome and opera

8232119
capitalize	uppercase
the only possible problem is that your month part uses uppercase letters while the mmm returns the month abbreviation with just the first letter capitalize

8232220
innodb	myisam
however if you re doing this with myisam or innodb - i d say that after column option will take slightly more time due to record shifting

8232243
mouseover	mouseenter
try with mouseover or mouseenter with jquery

8232260
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest firebug for firefox or javascript console for google-chrome

8232272
versioning	upgrade
versioning 0.8.2 of cassandra has several known issues - please upgrade to 0.8.8 on all original nodes as well as the new the nodes that came up and then start the procedure over for the nodes that did not complete

8232334
sorting	grouping
by sorting the array region id and i can even remove not add the region id unless a new grouping is starting

8232348
innodb	myisam
again this also depends on a lot on what engine that you are using myisam vs innodb

8232357
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
the main view has a uigesturerecogniser and each subviews also has a uigesturerecognizer

8232357
uigesturerecognizer	uitouch
bool gesturerecognizer uigesturerecognizer gesturerecognizer shouldreceivetouch uitouch touch

8232377
folder	directory
used the directory lib and include in the project properties which i am assuming links to the project folder have never done this before but am hoping it won t cause dependency issues if i compile this on a different machine .

8232383
google-chrome	safari
then look for debug output in the firebug safari or google-chrome console

8232396
mdpi	hdpi
ldpi is 75 of mdpi scaling and hdpi is 150 of mdpi scaling

8232404
facebook	fbconnect
facebook s fbconnect might be another option too or another way could be integrating openid from what i ve read and experienced on stackoverflow s sub sites

8232408
mdpi	hdpi
ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi xxxhdpi accordingly

8232412
ant	maven
use eclipse for coding and for performing specific tasks during build use build tools like maven or ant

8232428
uitableview	nsindexpath
if you re talking about a standard ios uitableview then your index path is an instance of nsindexpath and will have two entries a section index and a row index

8232434
profiling	debugging
i m running the django debugging toolbar to profiling my site and try to figure out why certain views are taking so long

8232448

8232529
put	get
put the laptop drive in your computer directly and get 50-90mbps or whatever same drive on the other end of a usb interface much slower it is mostly the usb

8232529
disk	ram
flash is slow usb is slow think of these technologies as floppy disk not ram

8232534
alassetlibrary	uiimagepickercontroller
you cant do it with the uiimagepickercontroller instead you will have to use alassetlibrary in order to get the users photos and display them then create your own controls to allow the user to pick more than one image...here is a ref alassetlibrary

8232550
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller with several uitabbaritem

step1 we have master modify some files commit pull tag push --tags

8236744

why not use jquery s mouseleave and mouseenter methods

8236822
mouseout	mouseleave

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i ve written some code that contains a main and a number of subclassing that inherited variables from a superclass

8236892
superclass	subclassing
it is expected that additional subclassing will be written in the future so i was wondering if it is possible to save each subclassing and the superclass as seperate modules and that the subclassing will still be able to use have access too the superclass variables and definitions

8236892
superclass	subclassing
meaning they can be written as a stand alone module and the previous subclassing and the superclass don t have to be touched as part of the development but they will still be able to use the suberclasses variables and definitions

8236901
accessor	properties
instead you can do and then set the completionblock with either the straight properties accessor or with -setcompletionblockwithsuccess failure

8236902

subclass hashmap and create a version that lower-cases the key on put and get and probably the other key-oriented methods

8236984
mouse	keyboard
virtual servers with no mouse and keyboard attached can block significantly

8237003
put	get
but if o logn get and put operations are acceptable a treemap with a case insensitive string comparator is an option

8237003
put	get
and if you don t mind creating a new temporary string object each time you do a put or get then vishal s answer is just fine

8237021
matplotlib	scipy
almost all of the stuff is available in libraries scipy and matplotlib

8237029

8237029
width	height
i need to get the height and width of the above control in pixels

8237031
portrait	landscape
you can use savedinstancestate.putparcelablearraylist key value ..the whole idea would depend on whether you want to load the resoures again on orientation change say if your using different layout resources for landscape and portrait modes .otherwise handling using android configchanges orientation would be better choice

8237062
actualheight	actualwidth
you re looking for the control s actualwidth and actualheight

8237065
width	height
even though a trace shows that the width and height are correct

8237065

i am not sure about firefox or opera

8237117
google-chrome	firefox

lxml	libxml2
this bug hasn t been mentioned either in lxml v2.3 bug fix logs or in libxml2 change logs

8237194

8237505
subtract	add
if c were to have adopted the number theory convention it would need to compile additional instructions to compare the sign of the result to the sign of the divisor and if they didn t match then jump to additional code to add or subtract the divisor from the result iow c adopts a convention that corresponds to minimal effort

8237507

8240107
respond.js	modernizr
i am currently using the default modernizr with respond.js build-in script that comes with the html5 boilerplate

8240126

the way transparency works is slightly different than with android or iphone where it s quite easy to have a parent fully transparent but opaque children

8240544

jtree	jtable
i ve already solved that by creating a custom droplocation class which is based on a combination of jtable and jtree versions of it

8240721
jxtreetable	jtreetable
p.s. i ve decided for a custom jtreetable and not for one of the existing components like netbeans outline or jxtreetable because they all appear to be suffering from the jtable.droplocation problem and do not offer support for dropping before or after the selected tree node only inside

8240732
for-loop	loops
you can easily avoid a for-loop by using a while loops

8240739

int	chars
the arithmetic conversion does occur in the example you cite - the unsigned chars result of is promoted to int when it is compared with eof 1

8241104
int	chars
this conversion doesn t undo the result of converting -1 to unsigned chars though - if that conversion results in 255 because unsigned chars is 8 bits then it will remain as 255 when it is converted back to int since 255 is within the range of int

8241104
int	chars
on platforms where int cannot represent all the values of unsigned chars it will be promoted to unsigned int but such platforms are very rare

cos	sqrt
but i don t know how the implementation of the functions cos asin and sqrt compares to one another in regarding speed

8247434
cos	sin
sin and cos are simply the same curve offset by one-half radian or 90 degrees so

8247445
cos	sin
if your sin cos functions take radians

8247445
cos	sin
if your sin cos functions take degrees

8247465
multiplication	exponent	division	exponent	division	multiplication
that being said you can look at a positive exponent as indicated repeated multiplication 10 3 is 10 10 10 or 1 000 and you can look at a negative exponent as indicating repeated division e.g 10 -3 is 1 10 10 10 or 0.001

8247465
multiplication	exponent
the other approach as others have noted is to define a positive exponent as indicating repeated multiplication and a negative exponent as indicating the reciprocal of the positive exponent so 10 3 is 10 10 10 or 1 000 and 10 -3 is 1 10 3 or 1 1 000 or 0.001

portrait	landscape
i need to detect an orientation change in my application but i don t want my layout to be changed from portrait to landscape

8248274
portrait	landscape
i want to detect that the user changed from portrait to landscape or viceversa and that is not just detecting if the orientation angle is 90 or 270

8248274
portrait	landscape
i tried overriding onconfigurationchanged and check if orientantion is landscape portrait however this still changes my activity layout to landscape

8248274
portrait	landscape
it has to be something more complex than i want to detect if the user made the complete movement portrait- landscape or landscape- portrait

8248295
int	chars
cin reads the int and leaves the newline chars unread on the buffer so that when you call getline it s as if you immediately hit the enter key and getline reads nothing because it stops before reading the newline chars discards the newline and puts the empty string in

8248318

you then add to those which you d like to hide from print and to those which you d like to show in print only

8248534
jar	war
this simple setting would let you build both a war and a jar by default with the classifier classes in a single maven execution

8248587
submit	submission
you could solve this by using delegates but i believe after solving the problem that your event is not firing because the event you are wiring is on form submission but you do not have a submit button on your form

8248588
cos	sqrt
in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite costly cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

8248645
client-side	server-side
if you want to limit the number of characters entered i would suggest that you use server-side validation and or client-side validation

in case your form contentpane s width height is smaller than the images width height than a better option would be use

these are public protected default package access and private constructors

maven	pom.xml
you can verify this behavior yourself by running mvn help effective-pom on one of the child poms the effective-pom goal should give you a fully resolved view of the pom.xml you run it on taking into account inheritance equivalent to what maven will actually use when it runs

8250479
post	get
i am learning both ajax and the java servlet api well spring mvc which is based upon servlets at the same time and believe i am understanding most of the basics except when it comes to understanding how httpservletresponse is structured organized populated differently when the server servlet is responding to an http get post as it would with a normal page request as opposed to an ajax-based xmlhttprequest

8250483

n-gram	words
the symbols inputlower wordindexrules n-gram here are some symbols i chose to use for the list of words in a file and for hash-tables

however in order for the server to re-compute requestdigest it must know password but my server will only have access to a salt hash

hash	salt
because the salt on it s own is useless without the hash stored in the database and if the database is compromised then the attacker would have access to both the hash and salt anyway

screens	tablet
3.0 and 3.1 were an awkward period where you had to detect the api version screens size and configure your app accordingly supposing your app supports both phones and tablet

8258729
portrait	landscape
this way of thinking does not end up with you as a developer doing too much more work than before - instead of defining a phone layout a tablet layout each with a portrait landscape layout you just define a few layouts that work with different widths

in firefox this works perfectly but in google-chrome it doesn t feel the need to make the other all the rows total height match that of the first cell that spans every row

8259828
getter	setter
internally textfield text is most likely a getter setter since it needs to set a flag to update the text field display also possibly update the html content etc. so when you set it you are effectively calling a function

8259828
getter	setter
this means that textfield.text is implemented as a property getter and setter so if you had to code it you would see something like

8260101
mouseleave	mouseenter
the jquery hover method is shorthand for the bind to mouseenter and mouseleave events so there will be one extra function call using hover however there will be almost no difference in performance

distance	polygons
algorithm to reduce distance calculations necessary avoiding things like calculating all particles for each other particle or polygons even when they re far away

8260741
client-side	server-side
the only thing i think of that is that you actually never start receiving the file because the server-side doesn t read the command get foobar.txt so the client-side freezes on sending the command

8260943
int	double
i am using a scanner to read strings from the file then converting them to a double or int

8260943
int	double
the reason i am doing this is because it seems like it doesn t read double or int from a text file only strings

8260947
portrait	landscape
the only problem is that the second uiviewcontroller is not displayed in landscape mode but in portrait

8260962
int	chars
when computing the signature and using it you constantly cast between int and chars

8260964
int	double
use filescanner.nextdouble to read double form the user input and filescanner.nextint to read int

8260972
post	get
via get and post

8260978
for-loop	loops
in python 2.6 if you wanted to compact your code a little you could use itertools.product to turn it into a single for-loop but the general efficiency wouldn t change at all - you d still have iterations of loops

8261032
min	max
use min and max in parameters for xrange to omit if in outer loop

8261032

entitydatasource	detailsview	gridview	entitydatasource	gridview	detailsview
instead of using plain text boxes with your entitydatasource control i would recommend using a gridview control with a corresponding detailsview control

8261060
entitydatasource	detailsview	gridview	entitydatasource	gridview	detailsview
when you are configuring the entitydatasource controls you will need two one for the gridview and one for the detailsview make sure to check the enable automatic inserts enable automatic updates and enable automatic deletes check boxes in the configure data selection screen of the setup wizard

8261060
gridview	detailsview
you can also just use the detailsview by itself and leave the gridview out

8261060
entitydatasource	detailsview
to do this you ll need to configure the detailsview s entitydatasoruce expression editor for the where clause a bit differently found in the properties list of the entitydatasource control

8261060
gridview	detailsview
it s important to point out that the gridview and detailsview are pretty heavy controls

8261086
awt	swing
i know that swing supports rtl languages however i can only use awt

i m thinking about hashing full path of the file with md5 and indexing this hash field in the database

8261139
hash	md5
md5 from password and store it as hexa number into varchar or char n field - you don t need to care about case sensitivity because hash for a and a is different

8261142
post	get
it was one that neither of you could have found as i made a typo in the form it get s the post data from

8261163
submit	submission
by submission the form via the event target there is not a recursive call to the submit event handler

8261352
octal	decimal
they could be interepreted as octal values so 009 would be interpreted as 10 decimal

8261373
x86	64bit
that error message also means that you are trying to load a 32bit snapin from a 64bit powershell instance or vice-versa. in your case you need to compile your program to target the correct bitness x86

gtk	xlib
if it helps my wm is metacity and can you integrate gtk with xlib program actually i was developing a basic wm and feels the need for both xlib and gtk doing anything with gtk in my wm simply crashes it

8261612
sproutcore	cappuccino
unfortunatelly i don t know of an library that really helps in building such interfaces - i know jquery ui sencha cappuccino sproutcore and the like but they do not quite fit

8261634
min	max
you could create your own numericwheeladapter that overrides charsequence and instead of generating a value for each index you can do something like index x 15 to get 0 15 30 45 and set min and max to 0 and 3

8261748
hash	md5
there is a slight chance that md5 will produce the same hash for different inputs

8261749
hash	md5
md5 is broken in the sense that it s possible to intentionally generate a hash collision you should probably use the sha family eg sha-256 or sha-2 if you are concerned about someone maliciously creating a file with the same hash as another file

8261749
hash	md5
hash functions have a limited length eg md5 is 128 bits in length so there are 2 128 possible hash

8261777
rss	feed
i am developing a facebook iframe application using php which opens an rss feed from another site and displays a selected item from the feed

8261909
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
port binding php doesn t apply to port binding at all because it is not a process that hooks to an address apache nginx or lighttpd does that for you

8261934
octal	binary
just like octal and binary notation is not

8261943
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
homebrew is the new macports which was the new fink

8261946
for-loop	loops
if it is the for-loop then lets say that there was an integer already declared that we could use in the while loops increment that we didn t need to create just for the while loops

8261980
for-loop	loops
i think compilers are optimized enough these days so it really doesn t makes a difference if you use a for-loop or a while loops

8262032
google-chrome	firefox
you would see that for instance value equals 100 in google-chrome but in firefox for instance that value is defined in pixels 837px for instance

8262035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i saw that except the firefox browser google-chrome opera and safari shows the search input in the upper right corner 4-5 pixels upper than normal

8262047
post	get
and if you want to send data with get or post you have to use this solution

8262063
octal	hex	octal	decimal
in javascript only decimal and hex are defined as part of the standard while the octal is implementation dependent which would explain why octal parsing is not consistent between the examples you gave

8262063
octal	decimal
you can get rid of octal literals in strict mode but in all browsers i tested parseint still tried to parse an octal instead of decimal

8262103
pascal	delphi
in pascal like languages delphi the loop limits are evaluated only once

8262111
width	height
you can set the scrollview scroll height width ..like this.

8262119
mouseleave	mouseenter
for each one of these buttons i want to handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events to animate the height of the button and do some other interesting stuff

8262122
int	double
however when you use the let expression it only has one number to work off of so it decides 1 is an int and 2.0 is a double

8262126
subclass	abstract-class
you can then subclass with another abstract-class to provide the default implementation that currently exists in measurebase and subclass away from there

8262133
width	height
make sure that your scrollview.contentsize property value is set correctly width and height should be 0

8262156
hide	show
in addition the library also provides all of the native functions such as pinch-to-zoom swiping to navigate and tapping to hide show the navigation arrows and back button

8262158
int	double
so 1 is a constant which can be any numeric type double int etc.

8262164
int	chars
yes cast it to int the way php always does it it will take any number and form the int out of it until it founds any non-numeric chars

8262171
indexof	hasownproperty
if indexof comes from the prototype chain you must use hasownproperty to skip over it

8262259
mouseup	mousedown
if you want to keep doing a task while your finger is down on the button create a new thread in the mousedown event and kill it in the mouseup event

8262267
int	chars
for example in the official documentation i saw i used for an int and i found out that you can specify a chars type with c and float with f by guessing

8262290
width	height
in my opinion the api is borderline paranoid even things like asking for the display dimensions width and height require signing

swt	swing
jigloo swt swing gui builder for eclipse and websphere - note jigloo is free for non-commercial use but purchase of a professional license is required for commercial use after successfully evaluating jigloo

8262366
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
in case you re restricted to legacy java.util.date and java.util.calendar apis you need to take into account that the timestamps are interpreted in milliseconds not seconds

8262366
java.util.date	simpledateformat
the constructor of java.util.date and finally use simpledateformat to convert a java.util.date to java.lang.string in the desired date format pattern if necessary with a predefined time zone otherwise it would use the system default time zone which is not gmt utc per se and thus the formatted time might be off

8262405
move	drag
you can then move them around using a drag and drop interface allowing you to specify order and organize them hierarchical

8262435
inherited	properties
even if you know that you do not have rows in your database that do not match on any defined inherited codes anyway you have to set up inherited default properties for linq-to-sql

8262450
post	get
if you want to get the checkboxes values on form post then use which key is checkbox name attribute

8262518
scala	typesafe
see scala integrated query as i understand it is scheduled to be integrated in the typesafe stack as scala language integrated connection kit slick

8262521
groupbox	panel
the easiest way would be to put another panel inside the groupbox so that you only have to reset the font once

8262535
xslt	xquery
another option would be to convert your xquery to xqueryx and you can then process this as xml using xquery or xslt to generate an xform or xhtml form

8262567
toolbar	tabs
in one of my tabs i use the navigation controllers default toolbar

8262571
width	height
since your webview has fill_parent on the width and height the progressbar will stay behind the webview.

8262610
hash	md5
in the both cases i d like to use to determine the md5 hash of the file immediately after it is uploaded

8262610
hash	md5
then i ll check the database for any identical md5 hash and if found i simply won t complete the upload

8262610
hash	md5
does the md5 hash of a file in the tmp directory change after moving it to a permanent location

8262622
getter	setter
gcd takes a lot of the burden of multi-threaded code off your shoulders but it s not a panacea against concurrency problems like shared object references and such - those still remain and are hard problems gcd just making it that much easier to fix them like allowing you to create a corresponding serial queue for every shared contended object in your code and refactoring your setter getter methods to use that queue as a concurrency barrier

8262666
hash	md5
but if you compute the md5 including the file s path the hash will certainly change if the file is move to a new path folder

8262666
hash	md5
final remark while it s very very unlikely md5 hash of two different files may be identical

8262760
set	bag
if you want the database itself to order the collection elements use the order-by attribute of set bag or map mappings

8262771
pop-up	dialog
the only flaw i currently see is that the selected time does not appear in the pop-up dialog if you don t specify timeformat

8262773
hash	md5
if you re convinced by all the reasons given here in the answers and decide not to use md5 at all i m still not sure whether you want to or must use hash you can just append something unique for each user and the time of uploading to each file name

8262803
post	get
server it works fine when i am using it myself but when i get it under load with jmeter it starts giving 100 errors from the moment where jmeter tries to post a login

if you decide you need full-blown maven repository interoperability then i d suggest emulating what other projects like groovy gradle and scala have done which is to embed ivy

8262843
memcached	apc
as we knew that apc and memcached is good cache system for storing value

8262843
memcached	apc
and apc user cache is much faster than memcached to store simple tiny size value because apc is a local-based cache system without creating a connection as memcached

8262889

client-side	server-side
it would be worth while understanding the difference between server-side php and client-side javascript languages and how why they interact with each other

8263103
stateless	stateful
apparently this a bad design approach anyway because mdbs are inherently stateless so stateful ejbs shouldn t be injected

cout is an ostream not an ofstream

8263230
cout	ofstream
std cout is not an ofstream so it will not match your overload

8263273
udp	tcp
afaik tcp ip even on localhost is significantly slower than linux pipes or socketpairs so you should avoid tcp ip and probably even udp ip if speed is a major concern

8263444
subtract	add
add or subtract one of 2 28 or 2 28 -1 depending on whether you want the upper or lower bound and the 2 29 -bit is 0 or 1 because of round-to-even

pop-up	dialog
now when my app tries to close the window word pop-up a do you want to save dialog

8263497
pop-up	dialog
all good but it has alerted me to the fact that using sendmessage wm_close to close another app will snag my app if the other app pop-up a modal dialog

8263501
implements	extends
the most suitable cross-browser approach is to use features that are most widely supported and avoid things like extends dom prototypes since there is no requirement for browsers to implements them and some very common browsers don t and employ suitable feature tests where appropriate

8263508
nunit	moq
btw if you re just getting started with these concepts i think you ll be better off using nunit and moq

8263582
junit	unitils
you could either implement this at the test framework level with a custom junit runner or as a dbunit unitils extension or at the build tool level if your build tool is flexible enough

8263582
spock	unitils
by the way spock provides unitils integration out-of-the-box

you can use jquery addclass and removeclass

8263968
nstableview	nssplitview
i should also note that the nstableview is located inside an nssplitview

8263980
int	chars
those arise when you dump directly on a file the binary representation of int or other types which can vary in size and byte ordering depending on architecture but plain chars s should be safe

8264004
config	ini
also i have my project generator in zend_tool set up to use yaml with sfyaml as my config format so if you use ini or xml you will need to convert appropriately

8264043

the instances of c containing the updated data is transient since i can t imagine there is anyway to modify a persistent instances

8264471
instances	transient
when the transient instances is passed from the front-end to the service layer a session begins and some checks are done to make sure it is a valid operation

8264471

assuming everything checks out the transient object is supposed to be persistent

8264471
instances	transient
trying to update a entity that exists in the session with a transient instances

8264471
instances	transient	persistent	transient
my guess was that it was upset that the persistent instances was a different class than the transient instances

8264471
instances	transient
i tested and when i call .merge on a transient instances of the same class everything works as expected

8264471
instances	transient	persistent	transient
not sure what to do next i tried doing .evict of the persistent instances and then .update on the transient one but that gives me a staleobjectexception

free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
a crash in malloc realloc calloc or free is often a symptom of a bug elsewhere in your program where you have written beyond the bounds of an allocated block and stomped over the housekeeping information used by the memory allocation functions

8265028
realloc	malloc
a realloc of a null pointer is effectively the same as a malloc

8265094
width	height
essentially it uses another wrapper div that has sufficient width height to cover animated surface - on hover it elevates its z-index so that the animated div remains on top

8265144
free	malloc
i ve seen a similar pattern myself in an application that mixed calls to malloc and free as opposed to allocating and deallocating all at once

8265243

trie	dawg
trie doesn t save space as much as directed acyclic word graph dawg does because it shares common node throughout the structure whereas trie doesn t share nodes

8265491
trie	dawg
here is the difference graphically between trie and dawg

8265491
trie	dawg
the strings tap taps top and tops stored in a trie left and a dawg right eow stands for end-of-word

8265491
trie	dawg	trie	tree
the tree on the left side is trie and the tree on the right is dawg

8265491
trie	dawg
trie has duplicate nodes that represent same letter subword while dawg has exactly one node for each letter subword

8265492
put	get
the problem is when i get the rfid data and try to put it in a text field on the data receive event

8265498
trie	tree
to save space when using a trie one can use a compressed trie also known as a patricia trie or radix tree for which one node can represent multiple characters

8265498
trie	tree
in computer science a radix tree also patricia trie or radix trie

8265608
dictionary	map

bottle	flask
they are based on bottle and flask micro frameworks no useless features they give you the flexibility to plugin whatever modules you want

8265983
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to do it with ajax you will need to do a file upload using an iframe or using an xmlhttprequest but transferring files this way is only available in newer browsers at least firefox 3.6 ie9 not sure on google-chrome

8266029
post	put
instead of post update_admin i modified put update_admin

8266035
outputstream	inputstream
update i think it is in some way confusing that we use getinputstream to actually read process output the reason is that initially basic classes outputstream and inputstream were named so relatively to the code that uses them the code you write

8266112
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
the classic unix systems do not support eres with sed solaris 10 aix 6 hp-ux 11

8266119
int	chars
shorts and chars signed and unsigned are upconverted to int in a value-preserving manner and then compared

8266119
unsigned	short
so if an unsigned short were compared to a signed short the result would come out like the c# example

8266131
integer	unsigned
warning comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions

the thing that causes the error is probably that your context does not extends implements locationlistener

8266199
implements	extends
remember that if you do the activity that instantiates the viewpagefragment must extends implements locationlistener

8266262
textblock	itemscontrol
it s not at all clear to me why you re trying to avoid two textblock s or how dynamic your data is but you could either just code it as above or look at using an itemscontrol that is bound to a list of words and produces a textblock for each

8266262
textblock	itemscontrol
afraid there s no easy way to produce a single textblock from an itemscontrol though as it adds its children to a panel not an arbitrary element

8266266
audiotrack	audiorecord
so the idea is to use audiorecord to get a stream of audio from the microphone and send this stream over bluetooth to another device in the form of a raw byte array just like i get it from audiorecord and at the same time over bluetooth receive the stream of audio from the other device and play it with audiotrack

8266283
int	boolean
first rewrite dbcheck to return boolean not int

nsurlconnection	nsoperation	nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
however instead of trying to make the indexpath thread-safe through an nsurlconnection i decided to reimplement the whole thing by moving the nsoperationqueue into the uitableviewcontroller code and having the concurrent imageview class be actually a proper subclass of nsoperation since i was using nsoperationinvocation in the first place to try and avoid the full-fledged nsoperation subclass

if the loss of these multicast packets is a problem for your system rather than just a mystery that you d like to solve for performance reasons then the system design is wrong

bison	jison
but bison and therefor jison generates lr parsers while antlr generates ll parsers

8267531
int	boolean
it may be the case that the underlying data lends itself to a specific optimization - for instance if you can create a custom indexing scheme based on bitmasks to create int and using those int to access data using boolean operators you may be able to beat the performance of an rdbms index

for example in a jit environment you could look at a loop realize the whole of its body is executed on a single object which appears to be frequently of type foo specialize the whole body for foo which allows full inlining of virtual methods and now check at the top of the loop if the object is a foo and if so switch to the fully inline body version instead of the generic one with virtual calls

8273363

if it is a prude player that only allows flv files you can always program your .htaccess file to parse .flv files as php script in the specific folder only and rename your .php file as .flv and try your luck ...anyways...also generate a hash key...perhaps you can take the servers current time and append it to a salt value such as another key known by both scripts and encrypt this final concatenation with your secret key

inherited	subclassing
one of the foundation principles of oop is that if a class is a subclassing of another class then that class gets all the functionality of the class it inherited from

8278949
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing didn t have all the functionality of its superclass you couldn t do that

8278949
superclass	subclassing
you d implement that kind of functionality with an abstract superclass that defines how you interface with payment gateways in general then you d create a subclassing for each payment gateway you want to use paypal sagepay whatever

8278949
inherited	subclassing
as all these subclassing inherited from the same base class you can be certain that they all implement certain methods and you can send messages to those methods without worry

8278949
superclass	subclassing
if one of the subclassing was able to not implement something from the abstract superclass then you couldn t be sure that sending a particular message to a subclassing would work or throw an exception

8278949
superclass	subclassing
if you really must remove functionality from a subclassing you can do it by overriding the superclass method and replacing it with an empty method one that does nothing

8278949
superclass	subclassing
generally if you run into situations where you have functionality in a superclass that you don t need in a subclassing it s a code smell that s telling you that you might need to rethink your design

the for-loop is what updates the new arrays

8282291

8282299
hash	md5
1 instead of the user calculating and submitting the hash herself the hash i ll use the much simpler md5 in my example is calculated via client side javascript

8282354
ssl	https
let s look a security - in case https http with ssl is used then another problem is introduced the content of every network connection is encrypted and you can t decrypt it unless you have the key and you haven t unless you provide your own but then the browser won t trust your key and issue a big warning unless you ve installed your key in the browser

children	parent
if a user selects one of these groups i need to make a list of all the sub-groups that are children to this parent

8282621

8282636
children	parent
if i am dragging the li that has the link top links i want to drag not only the words top links but also the div#admin ul and li that are children of that parent li

nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
nsurlconnection works in conjunction with the runloop â and the threads managed by nsoperationqueue don t necessarily use or even have

8282671
nsdata	nserror
bonus this is really flexible and eventually reusable throughout all your code â if you move the xml-parsing out of that class and make your handler simply take an nsdata an nserror and optionally an nsurlresponse

google-chrome	safari
works ok but when you make subtle movements back and forth between grid snaps sometimes the form element doesn t update at least in google-chrome and safari on a mac

8282745

post	get
for instance if your app need to post status update on the user s wall you ll need to get authorisation from him her first

8282818
mouseleave	mouseenter
everything that silverlight does is asyncronous and so most likely what is happening is that because you are moving quickly in and out of the box the mouseleave is being fired before the mouseenter has a chance to finish

8282860
sorting	grouping
second according to the documentation to enable sorting between lists one or more lists or id s must be passed using an array or a selector that means to move items between your sublists each ul must be passed into a sortables grouping different than the categories grouping

8283598
spock	easyb
it looks like easyb and spock both use when and then

8283633
range	max
the way computers generate random numbers is a set number of bits at a time so if the max weren t 2 n - 1 either not all numbers in the range could be returned or entropy would be wasted

8283683
post	get
you should probably post the smallest complete piece of code you can get which has the problem -- that way people can actually run your code and reproduce the issue for themselves

8283717
decltype	auto
i ve found auto decltype range based for work in a cross platform project llvm for macosx ios gcc linux msvc 10 windows

8283724

and every subview inside _myscrolview probably needs to be re-oriented as well their width and height may need to be set to the landscape width

8283787
profiling	instrumentation
you can use the xcode instrumentation to profiling your application and see why that happens instrumentation guide

8283803
hash	salt
a common technique is to transform the password using a one-way hash algorithm with a salt see wikipedia definition of salt for more info and then when users attempt to login to perform the same encryption and compare the hash

8283803
hash	salt
to make things even more complex try changing the salt on every hash

maven	pom.xml
you simply place your jar source pom.xml etc into the maven artefact directory structure

8283962
division	addition
if size is relatively small it doesn t surprise me at all that a call to a prng an integer division and a float division and addition would increase program execution that much

8283962
for-loop	arrays
also note that you never check if target is valid before using it as an arrays index if it ever makes it out of the for-loop still set to -1 all bets are off for your program

8283990
installation	upgrade
the installer works fine when it s a first time install but when it s an upgrade it appears that the installation remains incomplete until an application shortcut is clicked

even if you decide to run your application on single server you can start multiple rails process with passenger or unicorn

8284179
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen this issue in google-chrome for sure - don t know about firefox

8284184
hide	show
this will remove the subview and release it so if you only want to hide or show it make sure you retain the subview or if you are using arc maintain a strong reference to it that way you don t have to create destroy the subview just to show or hide it

8284227
many-to-one	one-to-many
where is a many-to-one relationship and is one-to-many

8284227
many-to-many	many-to-one
the diagram notation i show can illustrate the difference between a logical many-to-many relationship and the physical implementation of that relationship using an intersection table containing two many-to-one relationships

8284227
entity-relationship	diagram
fwiw the diagram above is my attempt to make a simple ascii format of an entity-relationship model

8284247
google-chrome	firefox
well on all my other browsers that i ve tested so far ie6â 9 firefox google-chrome everything works beautifully

8284253
division	multiplication
the operations required to created an oid like this are all multiplication and division which avoids all the gear grinding of text manipulation

8284289
ubuntu	debian
just use glxinfo in the package mesa-utils on ubuntu debian and check the extension list gl_ext arb_geometry_shader4 or opengl version 3.2 for geometry shader support

8284390
cpython	pypy
when python coders need speed-ups they tend to use c c++ libraries with python wrappers use numpy run pypy or construct fast extensions using cpython

8284424
fontfamily	font-size
i have a font-size selector and a fontfamily selector associated whit it

8284453
width	height
the image class has already a method getscaledinstance int width int height int hints designed for this purpose

8284453
width	height
which will render the image at the specified width and height by

8284453
width	height
the width or height is a negative number then a value is substituted

8284493
getter	setter
if you do not use any getter and setter it is just a matter of taste

8284493
getter	setter
if you do use getter and setter you can expicitely use the private field if you do not want to use the getter setter code in the constructor

8284493
getter	setter
if your getter and setter are virtual even if the default implementation is just an assignment you d have to check the solid principles and ensure that you follow at least liskov substitution and open close principles

8284538
awt	swing
since that s allowed from jdk1.6_0_12 i still highly recommend don t mixing awt with swing in the one swing container for any reasons what there exists

8284580
pop-up	dialog
when trying to access the service via visual studio we receive the pop-up dialog to enter credentials discovery credentials and it will not authenticate but we are able to retrieve the list of services

8284582
width	height
of note it seemed that when i reset the height of the sections i also had to set the width again too

8284622
datediff	difference
the datediff function allows to find out the dates difference between the two dates

8284762
mdpi	hdpi
this is consistent with the fact that the application takes the drawable resources in my mdpi folder and not in my hdpi folder

8284846
google-chrome	firefox
this works flawlessly on firefox but on google-chrome the background is just black

8284887
int	chars
for instance a string is a of seq chars if you map with a function from chars to chars you get a string but if you map from collection to say int the result cannot be a string and it will just be a seq

8284892
ceil	floor
also you are mixing array indices n i with the contents of the array ceil floor

8284931
width	height
the width of all images is correct - but the height of the imageview parent layout linearlayout is greater then the images

8284935
onkeyup	onkeydown
if you want an event that will be triggered as the user types in an input field you can use onkeypress onkeydown or onkeyup events

8284941
ceil	floor
you re recursively calling your binarysum method with it s third parameter as ceil 2 and floor 2 which will never change

8284941
ceil	floor
ceil 2 is 0 and floor 2 is 50000 neither of these is 1 so you re getting infinite recursion

8284979
for-loop	arrays
do a for-loop over the entire arrays and check if the name of one of the elements is equal with what you re trying to add

addition	multiplication
having just kinda run into this problem myself here s my solution for both multiplication and addition

8285044
profiling	instrumentation
in allocation profiling instrumentation i see that the cycle a- b- a- b makes the memory growing because first b was not really removed from the memory stack

8285052
free	malloc
so if you have an objc object that malloc s up some memory and points a char at it and the dealloc method calls free that memory will still get properly disposed of

8285064
fadein	fadeout
if you want the fadein and fadeout to happen at the same time you need to take the fadein out of the success callback and put it parallel to the fadout function

8285070
children	parent
children lists as it is typical for lists are opened and closed inside it s parent element

8285071
serializable	deserialization
the comparer associated with the dictionary is not part of the data serializable and deserialization

8285071
idictionary	iequalitycomparer
you can however easily recreate a dictionary with the same items and the appropriate comparer through the dictionary idictionary dictionary iequalitycomparer comparer constructor overload

8285093
cos	sin
1 cos and sin produce values between 0 and 1 so you should probably multiply it by some radius

8285096
width	height
i thought rollone.width would return the width but it only returns 0 the same goes for height

8285110
apache	nginx
apache nginx wsgi

8285214
width	height
in order to extract the resolution width x height you will have to identify pes start with pusi packet and then start parsing the es headers

8285224
range	minimum
assuming you ve got the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum value vmin and vmax and you d like to scale the whole range to 0

8285224
range	minimum
mod_add will move negative numbers values to the positive range where the absolute minimum will become 0 and mod_mul will scale the whole range from absolute minimum to absolute maximum to fit into 0

8285243
mamp	wamp
actually i have to access it on my localhost with wamp or mamp

8285243

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
i have already made a function of multiplication of long numbers addition of long numbers subtraction of long numbers and division of long numbers

8285534
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
concerning the getintrinsic height|width methods they return the actual size of your underlying bitmap which may be different if the system resized it it while loading it an hdpi image loaded on an mdpi screens for instance

8285559
google-chrome	firefox
the script works fine in google-chrome and firefox however the script is not actioned in explorer

8285560
division	modulo
because the digits have a larger range you will need fewer memory and fewer modulo and division operations

8285560
division	modulo
additionally with the base being a power of 2 the modulo and division operations are much faster than with your base-10 approach

8285575
inherited	properties
newly created instance inherited properties from the prototype properties of the constructor function object

8285592
division	subtraction
i estimated that my original division using repeated subtraction would have taken 100 years to complete

8285776
jobs	cron
i m trying to set up the cron jobs for my codigniter application however when i run the cron it throws me memcached errors

8285798
width	height
if you are talking about doing per-pixel manipulation on the image you need to use .getimagedata x y width height this gives you and object that contains the .data field which is an array of every pixel s rgba of the image so is the first pixel s r channel is the g channel the b the alpha channel and then is the r channel of the second pixel

8285810
keyevent	onkeydown
make sure onkeydown is used from the gallery after a time job for example gallery.onkeydown keyevent.keycode_dpad_right new keyevent 0 0

8285831
post	put
the thing is now that he is trying to send necessary attributes to me with a post request but without the use of a nested hash which means that that all attributes will be directly put in params and not in a subhash

8285841
free	malloc
you do not need to free memory which you did not allocate with malloc

8285841
free	malloc
in your example string is not allocated by malloc in your program so you do not need to free it

8285841
calloc	malloc
the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or

8285841
free	realloc
realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc

8285845
free	malloc
you only need to free what you ve allocated dynamically via malloc in c or via keyword new in c++

8285845
free	malloc
basically for any allocation call like malloc there should be a free somewhere

8285859
backgrounding	multitasking
maybe you opted out on the multitasking thing with the uiapplicationexitsonsuspend key in your plist or your app is crashing when going to the backgrounding using too much memory to be backgrounding

8285906
width	height
you can also make a class of your own that will ignore the original width and height

8285921
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the video works when clicked in safari but it doesn t work when clicked in firefox ie and google-chrome

8285979
addclass	removeclass
removeclass doesn t have a member named addclass so you can t write removeclass.addclass

8286031
width	height
width and height of the resulting stringâ s bounding box

8286056
post	put
and i had a further 3 columns which were labelled top3_1 top3_2 top3_3 to put each of their interests in from a post form

8286076
decoder	encoder
later on when decoder plays it it does two things - one ensures that decoder s own clock is enslaved with encoder s clock and two it ensures that every picture is presented on the screen and audio frame presented to speaker exactly when that respective time occurs

8286076
decoder	encoder
now the major concern remains is that decoder s clock needs to remain in control synchronization of encoder s clock

8286078
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
use a standard ios view controller manager like uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller to display your views

8286084
multiplying	multiplication
application note ap-930 streaming simd extensions - matrix multiplication describes in detail the algorithm for multiplying two 6ã 6 matrices

8286123
prepare	execute
both queries will return the same result so why using the prepare for me it looks like it s gonna be slower since you have to execute an extra step

8286137
mef	prism
i ve been comparing unity and mef to be used in prism and was going towards mef

8286178
charindex	substr
select left a11 a12 a13 3 + substr a11 a12 a13 charindex a11 a12 a13 10

8286201
mouseup	mousedown
but in some areas i have event listeners for mousedown mouseup events on some components

8286234
post	get
you can get list of post liked an user order by add_date desc easily

8286234
post	get
or vice versus to get list of users liked a post order by add_date desc

8286359
ant	maven
unfortunately the software is not build by maven but by ant so i can not find the stuff in an artifactory or something similar

8286360
post	get
i am trying to get an inline like button for each post on the homepage of tumblr s blogs like the one similar to

8286362
post	get
all request data url post get ... are stored in request variable

8286362
post	get
in this case none of controllers can access post get or other request variables directly

8286381
hash	md5
a simple solution would be not to include the address but a md5 hash of the address into the form

8286381
post	get
in fact my recently updated internal framework never passes any parameters as get or post parameters from request to request

8286389
google-chrome	firefox
the script works fine in google-chrome and firefox however the script is not actioned in explorer

8286425
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers only safari google-chrome

8286429
winpcap	pcap.net
there is a library called pcap.net that is a wrapper for a native library that allows you to do this called winpcap

8286458
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve only just started with storyboards and have found that i had to set string properties on the destination view controller instead then update the ui components in viewdidload or viewwillappear

8286459
getter	setter
you could even move the specializations to the container the getter setter becomes generically

8286502
margin	height
i found the general answer here css 100 height with padding margin

8286532
hide	show
i need to create specific tableviewcell which show a special subview on first touch and hide it on second touch that subview contains some labels or buttons

8286618
integer	unsigned
don t forget that a hashcode in java needs to return an integer anyways so the lack of an unsigned long should not make a difference - there will just be fewer possible values that the function takes on

8286675
children	parent
this selects all children of the top element that are named parent have only one child element except the name child and the string value of their name child is the same as the string value of the name child of their other non- name child

8286723
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
however if you are merely interested in the basic algorithm used rather than the details pypy s implementations could be a guide at a quick glance it looks to be doing basically the same thing as both cpython and jython

8286723
cpython	pypy
as a general resource though there s no reason to think that pypy s implementation of all string functions would mirror the algorithms used in cpython -- pypy is after all intended as an optimized version of python running in a jit and this may have significant impact on what the most reasonable implementation of a method is especially string functions which frequently can be performance bottlenecks and which the implementors of an optimized runtime therefore have incentive to optimize

8286726
implements	extends
the definition means that s is a type that extends or implements charsequence

8286726
implements	extends
this means that foo returns a type that either extends or implements charsequence and accepts an argument of the same type

8286741
hide	show
i want from a button push to show it and from a text change in the textbox to hide it

8286785
post	get
i have created an facebook application and i request post on wall permission from the user to post stories all users can post on wall and can easily use the application expect one user get popup with xd proxy on title

8286785
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the user tested the application with google-chrome firefox ie and safari in windows7

8286794
zoo	xts
then use an aggregation routine and e.g the zoo and xts packages have these for time-indexed structures or ddply does it more generally or you can use base r functions

8286858
public	protected
if not you have 3 alternatives recode the class set the vars public recode the class and add the methods or recode the class and set the variables protected then create a new class extending the parent one with those methods i recomend this one since it has less impact on the parent class

8286896
children	parent
your setlevel method is not correct since it relies on a particular enumeration order for its correctness - parent must be processed before their children

8286914
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

8286915
yacc	bison
also yacc or bison is the definitive way of building fsm parsers

8286921
next	except
the next example is very similar except now i bind to a list of type country where country is a class with an id possibly from a database and a name

8286983
width	margin
make vertical bar of inner scroll viewer visible and set right margin on header which is equal to width of vertical scroll bar

8286985
jtextfield	jtable
i already can filter the jtable using a jtextfield the problem is that is case sensitive

8287048
width	margin
a in an inline element give is display block so width margin padding etc can be applied

8287056
implements	extends
in your activity that extends tabactivity you could implements tab listener on change action like

8287093
move	drag
it has one big problem that need to be addressed it stores the x y coordinates are screen-based and not form based so if you drag once move the entire form and drag again it will get funky

8287114
subtract	add
when it got above the size of a tile we would reset it to zero and add or subtract to the corrosponding tile type

8287132
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to do this is to use a web development tool such as firebug in firefox or the ones that come bundled with ie 6 i think and google-chrome

8287135
strncpy	malloc	strdup	malloc	strdup	strncpy
i don t like using strdup being it is not standard c so i ll stick with malloc and strncpy

8287135
put	get
takes in a parameter so if i put a string literal in when calling it i would get an error

8287162
free	malloc
alternatively using the boehm s garbage collector is extremely useful you can use gc_malloc instead of malloc etc... and don t bother calling free or gc_free

8287186
client-side	server-side
in general your server-side c# code will respond to interactions initiated by your client-side code

8287227
ostringstream	std
the expression std ostringstream creates a temporary and which takes as argument is a free function but this free function cannot be called on a temporary as the type of the first parameter of the function is which cannot be bound to temporary object

8287227
ostringstream	std
that is std ostringstream .flush returns which means now the free function can called passing the returned reference as first argument

8287249
pop-up	dialog
whenever the application is run and closed windows pop-up a product compatibility assistant dialog saying the application may not have installed correctly

8287256
folder	directory
apparently windows 7 will just not show start folder after you get so many in your all users directory

8287269
fadein	fadeout
in snippet i used fadein fadeout which adds nice fade effect

8287300
getter	setter
simply have the form expose a property of type settings with a getter and a setter

8287323
stdout	fflush
as it receives the command it fflush and all the answers appears on the stdout just before exiting

8287343
versioning	upgrade
but i m not sure if i can do subscriptions model for a upgrade versioning on app store

8287352
post	get
how can i send the request to the server without posting the facebook id as a post get parameter

8287409
initializer	class-method
this code gets all the instance methods on nsobject and prints out each one named either retainweakreference or allowsweakreference and then gets all the class-method on nsobject and prints out each one named either initializer or load

8287438
required	placeholder
all this required is a placeholder for the url beginning

8287448
hash	md5
whenever i hash a name of a file with md5 the file was just uploaded and given a md5 hash name the hexadecimal representation of the hash always starts with a number

8287468
hash	md5
the md5 can only be hexadecimal 32 digits 0-9 a-f the hash is not part of it

8287594
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
i d also recommend using settimeout rather than setinterval clearinterval since it doesn t need to be run on a recurring basis

8287615
bindparam	bindvalue
or you could use bindvalue instead of bindparam if you re using pdo

8287641
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
for firefox and opera everything is perfect but google-chrome on safari still have one issue

8287643
ready	each
all the js files will be loaded on each page and every on ready

8287644
google-chrome	firefox
well for one there are several versions of jquery some plugins aren t compatible with newer versions also if lets say firefox did implement this they would have to download jquery each time there s an update there s no guarantee that google-chrome and other browsers would follow up on this for example internet explorer that doesnt seem to like anything new so you would still have to reference it for the browsers that does not support it

8287674
salt	md5
even storing the md5 of the password and a salt is not sufficient

8287703
integer	unsigned
the integer value in d is converted to an unsigned value which on a 2 s complement architecture ends up being 0xffffffff or similar

8287706
int	chars
if your class attributes were simple types int float chars â even arrays of such types you could save them in a compound datatype

8287706
boost	stl
if you have stl containers you d probably better use boost serialization

8287709
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
we have css3 transition support today in all popular versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari but not in any version of ie yet

8287719
mp4	h.264
ffmpeg can encode yuv to mp4 h.264 via libx264 encoder

8287741
oncreate	setcontentview
best place is probably in oncreate before setcontentview where you would otherwise request window features.

8287777
google-chrome	firefox
firefox correctly traces errors to offending code but sometimes google-chrome encounters errors that firefox does not and it is extremely hard to find what is broken in these instances as i m dealing with 5 different scripts and 3000 lines of code

8287787
bluetooth	usb
i ve built a buildroot linux image for my phidgetsbc and included bluetooth support unfortunately it appears my bluetooth usb dongle isn t working

8287821
disk	ram
the pasteboard uses ram the last time i checked but it theoretically could write to disk instead either now or in the future.

8287828
ubuntu	linux
i am experimenting noir web framework on a home machine running ubuntu linux

8287853
width	height
i want to keep the width fixed and only self adjust the height

8287887
calloc	malloc
alternatively you can just call calloc 3 instead of malloc which automatically zeroes out the returned memory for you upon success

8287904
int	double
you can not forward arbitrary type conversions forward an int as a double

8287988
width	height
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used

8288009
bower	npm
as of today 31 march 2017 there are a lot of different package managers and or tools you could use to manage front-end libraries npm bower rollup etc. but i currently found yarn and webpack 2 most interesting

8288011

8288190
stdout	stderr
it should be possible to redirect stdout and stderr to file

8288220
textarea	textbox
i want to replace a special entered character a with another one b when a user entering data in a textbox or textarea

8288235
children	parent
because i already know that i want the children of a list of parent thats what the human mind says at least...

8288242
freebsd	linux
i am trying to find out mac address and i managed to create working solution using sysctl in linux problem is that this solution is not working on freebsd version i am developing on

8288288
ant	maven
you could use an ant task to create this jar either before you run maven or as part of your maven build

8288288
ant	maven
note if you create the jar in maven via ant then you should create the jar in target so that it gets cleaned correctly

8288288
ant	maven
to use an ant build file from maven you can use the maven antrun plugin similarly to

8288307
uilabel	nsstring
for a single-line uitextfield you should be able to measure the size of the nsstring it has a measurement function in there somewhere and move a uilabel to the right position

8293230
width	height
otherwise if you don t care about expanding you can set a fixed width and height to that div

8293241

so you would have classical java objects with getter setter for dom and a -library which wraps around the dom objects to provide a fluent api

8293666

8293852
onresume	onpause
and pause or resume the thread on onpause or onresume event respectively

8293852
onresume	onpause
for that you need to override onpause - and onresume

8293852

i mean that you want to detect the onpause and onresume events in library class and let other user use it

8293863
width	height
i m not too sure about the size of the indicator setting the indicator bounds can affect the width of the indicator but not the height

8293879

you should test only public interface and ensure that it behaves as expected you should not care details of implementation like private protected

8294010
public	protected
sometimes when writing unit tests for legacy code which you not able to change you could be forced to access protected members in this case solution could be creating a wrapper which exposes internal public property method to access protected one

8294021

d somehow using some classes such as nsoperation nsblockoperation or nsoperationqueue though not sure how exactly to do it some example would be appreciated

8295017
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
update2 already had some experience with nsinvocationoperation and nsoperationqueue and imho it s quite convenient

8295017
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
nsoperationqueue determines how much parallel threads it need to perform the calls nsinvocationoperation and handles it for you

8295017
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
also if you want to perform your method calls each wrapped in separate nsinvocationoperation in a strict queue then you can add dependencies and so nsoperationqueue will preserve method call order

8295161
pop-up	dialog
as a potentially more elegant alternative or may be just in case your carrier is indeed crude enough to pop-up an actual modal dialog every time a text is sent it may be that your carrier is using a broadcast receiver to trigger those notifications or those dialog so if that s the case and hopefully the carrier isn t using 100 as a priority for its receiver it may be possible for you to register a receiver with 100 and then kill the broadcast before it propagates to the other receivers

8298631
prepare	execute
if you use your results will be first prepare as an sql statement using expression trees and then execute and would be processed out-of-process server side but if you use .tolist on the result or use return type - your results would be execute using linq to objects in-memory which is what count is doing

8298643

suppose i have a div element with height 150px and width 300px

8298647

you use a wrapper by specifying --passenger for your rvm command and tell apache or nginx to use the wrapper it generates

8298906
int	boolean
if your web service is returning a primitive object int boolean etc you can use

8298922
disk	ram
however from your question i understand that you want to optimise for number of disk operations rather than speed in which case a ram disk might make sense

8299004
int	chars
but there s no way to guarantee that you won t receive more than |i2 - i1| strings that fall between s1 and s2 at least not practically you d have to use int on the order of 26 100 for strings of a single case with up to 100 chars

8299007
for-loop	arrays
use an arrays and a for-loop and make a tab object containing those members

8299007
width	height
i m not sure of the specific javascript syntax but basically rather than tab1 tab2 tab3 etc you have an array or list of tabs tab names tab width tab height tab buttons

8299007
width	height
it s probably better design wise to make a tab object and store tab name width height and button inside this object rather than having separate arrays for each

8299013
put	get
i made a form from a tutorial in a blank php page as a test and it worked but when i put it inside the html code which is inside the php i get this error

you can use max and min

8299237
nsmutablestring	nsstring
while there is nothing critical about creating a nsmutablestring with the field1 utf8 string to then add to your array usually it is better practice to create a non mutable nsstring

8299272
getter	setter
the properties first and second have a private setter and a public getter

8299272
getter	setter
if you specify an access modifier on a getter or setter it must be more restrictive than the access modifier for the property and you can t specify an access modifier on both properties

8299272
getter	setter
additionally note that in idiomatics c# we write the getter first and setter second and we give properties pascalcase names like

8299272
getter	setter
this will achieve a property named first with a public getter and a private setter and it is written idiomatically

8299296
spaces	linefeed
s matches any white-space character including spaces tab and linefeed

8299323
put	get

google-chrome	firefox
however i found the google-chrome behaves different from firefox which highlight the with default blue color instead of the color i set for all the elements

8299366
getter	setter
as for the first question the private double first means that both the getter and setter will be private

8299366
getter	setter
really you want public double first and then control the accessibility of the getter and setter as you have done

8299367
dictionary	map
i want to use a dictionary map data structure in r similar to python s dictionary or c++ stl s std map or std hash_map

8299371

8299491
addclass	removeclass
use jquery removeclass and addclass method to remove the existing class and then add the renamed class

8299504
addclass	removeclass
juse use removeclass passing the required class to remove and then use addclass passing the required class to add to any element

8299514
mp3	ogg
obviously uploading files already in mp3 and ogg format would provide the least lossy conversion since you don t need to convert at all

8299545

i can t figure out how to pass a reference to a std ostream to the function that the thread will execute

8299551
google-chrome	firefox

8300008
innodb	myisam
note the engine must be innodb on mysql 5.1 or newer i assume using either mysql 5.0 or myisam even on 5.1 reproduces the issue

8300064
domxpath	domdocument
i tried to give you an alternative answer using php s domdocument and domxpath but it only supports xpath 1.0 and the replace function doesn t exist until 2.0

8300076
getter	setter
i d like to have a property with getter setter enumclass that allows the user to call setenumclass timezone

8300078
width	height
turns out the very minimum that i needed to do was set the width and height of the canvas to the pixelwidth and pixelheight of the bitmapimage instance

8300110
unsigned	short
i allocated a large chunk of continuous bytes in the ram using a vector of type unsigned short

8300118
keydown	keyup
the simple way to do this is to simply increase the animation speed every time you receive a keydown message and reset it whenever you get a keyup

8300119
filtering	grouping
i need to filtering the original results table so that i get no more than one package from each grouping for each customer each customer may have a package from one or more grouping but might not have a package from every grouping

8300124
range	minimum
from the interface designer select your uislider and change the value range minimum and maximum

8300135
client-side	server-side
but as others mention without knowing a bit more about what exactly you need to have happen you would probably want to look at either a regular expression validator and try to validate on the client-side instead of server-side unless you need to have it happen on the postback

8300208
prepare	execute
â i printed the prepare statements as they re execute and i noticed that the values are not enclosed in quotes

8300209
stdout	stderr
if i use a different file for stderr and stdout they are both created but the stdout is always empty

8300236
disk	ram
your times will never be the same because every single time you execute your program the conditions on the machine are different the os process thread scheduler ram assigned and freed again as well as other task the system might be doing like reading a heavy file from disk swapping

8300249
stdout	stderr
stderr is typically an unbuffered stream while stdout is buffered

8300286
hash	hmac
an hmac is a message authentication code mac constructed on top of a hash

8300286
hash	hmac
you would use an hmac is a hash were already present in the program ie it was handy

8300286
hash	hmac
when i have both a block cipher and hash present in the program i generally use an hmac because its faster

8300286
hash	whirlpool
use the sha-2 family of hash or use whirlpool

8300296
hash	hmac
while the most often used mac type hmac is based on hash functions there are also ones which are based on a block cipher like aes like cbc-mac this is like cbc but with zero initialization vector and using only the last block as output

8300311
dictionary	map
basically what i need is a dictionary where an arbitrary number of keys beside a primary key which map to the very same value

8300317

on windows that will give you a 400mb-ish file with each of the 204800000 pairs of bytes representing a little-endian unsigned short

8300379
post	get
i already spoke with you on irc but i believe that if you get the view and post a runnable to it that will call .setchecked this will in effect cause the setchecked call to occur at the proper time and thus avoiding having called setchecked before the view hierarchy was ready for it

8300415
post	get
i think you re going to get the same answers here as you got with your mailing list post

8300437
rss	feed
the best simplest method is to simply use blogger s rss feed

8300437
rss	feed
but trust me on the rss feed

8300438
folder	directory
i ve been reading online that you are supposed to place these files inside of the plugin or dropins folder inside of eclipse directory

8300455
freebsd	linux
i need to check for both linux and freebsd

8300503
post	get
httpclient should support post get methods that you need for client side

8300508
tabcontrol	tabitem
the problem is not to set the current tab index in the tabcontrol s viewmodel but it is that i need to have information about tabitem to know which one to set

8300517
xsb	yap
practically all current prolog systems offer constraints of some sort like b ciao eclipse gnu if sicstus swi yap xsb

8300524

i am using a filtering for my jqgrid grid and the data is in grouping defaulting first state of collapsed

8300524

8300643
nicedit	jwysiwyg
my solution was change the nicedit to jwysiwyg a jquery based rtf and all works fine now

8300663
put	get
you can put code in a block in any class and it will only get loaded once per classloader

8300818
onchange	onblur
my reason for this would be to show if the input was valid once you leave the input field using onchange or onblur and the i also wanted to check if the input field was ever empty to remove the message indicating that bad input was entered using onkeypress so that it would update without having to leave the field if the user were to delete what they had in response to the warning message.

8300823
gridview	objectdatasource
i want to use an objectdatasource with a gridview in asp.net

8300858
children	parent
i want these children to be clickable but the problem is that if they are clicked it registers the click as being for both the parent click and its children

8300864
portrait	landscape
you could use jquery mobile and bind a css class change acording to the change from portrait to landscape and back

8300868
free	malloc

8300895
postgresql	mysql
the unapproved scope works with sqlite and mysql but it doesn t work on heroku where it uses postgresql

8300917
for-loop	arrays
my guess is buffer over-run since the for-loop reads in 11 numbers and the 11th number gets stored outside the arrays probably overwriting i

8300918
subtract	add
my idea was to have a separate method that takes in parameters such as the specific edittext to increment decrement and another param for whether to add or subtract but i am not sure for the implementation since onclicklistener has to have the public void onclick view v method

8300923
hex	binary
the only real downside vs their solution is that they use 12 bytes while an int64 uses 8 guids uuids use 16 in binary or 32 in hex plus a few bytes of overhead

8300963
loops	while-loop
if i type in y he restart the while-loop but ignores the scanf the second time and end loops after that

8300971

width 100 height 100

8300995
ant	maven
there are ant tasks and maven plugins readily available for doing just this

8301066
prepare	execute
i plan to use pdo s prepare and execute mechanism to prevent sql injection attack

8301071
children	parent
the event listener is registered only to one object but it receives the click events from its children because mouseevents bubble up in the display list they are forwarded upwards in the hierarchy so each respective parent object will receive the event even the stage

8301089
free	malloc
that said glibc does have functions mcheck mprobe to find the malloc status of a pointer for heap consistency checking and one of them is to see if a pointer is free

8301089
free	malloc
just make sure you have paired malloc free

8301095
jar	manifest.mf
if you are building an executable jar and have other jars that you need to be available in the classpath there is a class-path line in the jar s manifest.mf file that lists entries including jars and directories to include in the classpath when the main class is run

8301095
jar	manifest.mf
by the way to make your jar executable set the main-class line in your manifest.mf file

8301136
put	get
basically i need something like old.fieldbyname x or old x to get value out of the id field to put into the record_id field in the new audit record

8301149
versioning	upgrade
php versioning on new box is 5.2 but i can upgrade to 5.3

8301170

8301207
vb.net	vb6
we have parsers for various microsoft languages vb6 vb.net c# ms dialects of c c++

8301245
deque	multimap
set multiset vector list map deque stack queue priority_queue multimap bitset are all implemented differently

8301255
put	get
it seems the best way to accomplish this is to run the query i want and get back the objects that i want limited out and put those into the arrayofexcludedobjects

8301258
pull	push
we want to be able to push and pull from the repo to our own dev computers smoothly

8301272
post	get
this timeout is actually in milliseconds and my webserver is local so if i sent no parameters no get or post to my local server it would work

8301288
for-loop	loops
you should include a while loops inside the for-loop which keeps generating new numbers until you find one that works

8301333
imagemagick	minimagick
i m using imagemagick through the minimagick ruby gem to crop an image i also add an annotation to the top of it but i want it to be mirrored

8301333
imagemagick	minimagick
this code uses minimagick but it translates pretty directly to actual imagemagick commands

8301432
serializable	deserialization
yes - use google protocol buffers for serializable deserialization

8301440
daemon	cron
you have two main options -- load your tweets every couple of minutes via cron or run a background daemon

8301456
int	chars
you d use the crystal function chrw to convert int to chars and an ascii table

8301457
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a fair bit stricter than sqlite and mysql and no orm can fully insulate you from the differences between databases

8301457
postgresql	mysql
the behavior of group by is another common problem when moving from sqlite mysql to postgresql so you might want to review all you grouping

8301457
postgresql	mysql
also check how you deal with strings that are too long for your varchar columns afaik sqlite ignores your size limits but postgresql will complain loudly if you try to exceed the column size and mysql will truncate your data with a mere warning unless you ve put your server in strict mode

8301850
submit	submission
so if i had 20 empty rows in the table because i stated in the spinner i wanted 20 questions then what happens is every time i submit a question it adds a new row every time so submission 20 questions from the textarea would mean the table would contain 20 blank rows and 20 rows with questions

8301893
screens	tablet
if you want to take advantage of the bigger screens of tablet in different layouts you can use fragments from the compatibility library

when we upgrade from versioning 2.5 of nservicebus to versioning 2.6 we discovered a change of behavior

8302074
post	get
if this doesn t help you get it right away copy the table html out of firebug before and after the row has been appended and post the code in your question as an edit

8302079
ontouchevent	ondraw
however if you just want to draw the circles over the image a better solution would be to subclass imageview so you can detect touches in its ontouchevent method directly instead of a listener and do custom drawing in its ondraw method guaranteeing everything is in the same adjusted coordinate plane

8302082
google-chrome	firefox
and it works in google-chrome and firefox but not on my iphone

8302087
profiling	debugging
i made a new app store distribution profiling and putted in code sign- debugging but still this error occours

8302150
serializable	deserialization
not because of differences in the http standards that they both hitch a ride on but because of the way the data itself is represented the compressions schemes used and serializable deserialization mechanisms make all the difference

8302165
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest requires a uniform interface which in http means limiting yourself to get put post delete head etc

8302174
accessor	properties
the only properties available specific to arrays are really .length and the index accessor

8302174
for-loop	arrays

8302233
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works fine in opera google-chrome firefox ie 6 7 8 9 but not safari

children	parent
a parent monitor app which forks off children and monitors their status

8302390
ienumerable	iqueryable
i know i can use linq syntax on collections that implement iqueryable or ienumerable

8302432
children	parent
if you re just using the win32 api you normally handle this by handling the wm_size message and respond by calling getclientrect on the parent window and movewindow on the children to move resize the children to fill the parent appropriately

8302448
ienumerable	iqueryable
both iqueryable and ienumerable have deferred execution

8302452
google-chrome	safari
schizoduckie s answer is very elegant and lightweight but due to webkit s lack of implementation for scrollheight see here does not work on webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome various and sundry mobile platforms

8302452
webkit	gecko
for this basic idea to work on webkit along with gecko and trident browsers one need only replace

8302459
int	double
just treat them as value types which they are like int double etc

8302465
ienumerable	iqueryable
linq on an ienumerable is using linq to objects - linq on an iqueryable is using whatever the query provider has implemented for the standard query operators

8302525
mouseup	mousedown
i have a weekly calendar where i want to highlight multiple hours with one mousedown + move over cells + mouseup

8302575

8302620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari this works fine

8302620
versioning	upgrade
from searching it seems that about a year ago others were experiencing the same issue and their solution was to upgrade jquery since a year has passed i have a much newer versioning

8302627
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie9 and firefox do set focus on first text input but when user press tab again it goes to address bar instead of the second text input

8302636
implements	extends
i know what it does it makes a concrete class for the mouselistener interface so you can just extends the class to avoid implements unnecessary patterns

8302690
int	double
the difference here is between a base type such as an int or double and an object

8302711

width	margin
the separator has a negative margin margin-left -5em so that its box shifts left half its width 10em from the middle left 50

8302844
post	get
thus they will not send post data for example in the initial connection until they re authenticated and get an http continue from the server which should also lessen the burdern

8302849
post	get
on my mac in chrome i get the keycode 91 but it will differ in the linked post these are mentioned

8302849

place this code into your viewdidload or viewwillappear method

8302950
post	get
try changing type post to type get

8302954

the only way to add custom headers is to perform the post request to the third party site from your asp.net mvc application using either a webclient or an httpwebrequest

8302968
super	self
you have super createsharedobjectform self

8303030
groupbox	panel
then you could have a panel or groupbox or other visual element that is centered within the maximized child form such that it would always stay in the center of the screen and the user could not resize that element or otherwise move it

8303031

i have a wordpress site and i m trying to get a checkbox with i agree to terms and services to come up when a user clicks the submit button

8303050
opera	firefox
i intend to use jquery ui sortable and i found out that using jspx only the first script loads in firefox and ie while in opera it works...

8303079
mouseup	mousedown
basically i ditched the active in favor of a custom class that is added on mousedown and removed on mouseup

8303087
int	double
you need to cast at least one side to double or decimal to avoid int division

8303130
pop-up	dialog
what was added is the bit which makes sure in addition to the validate method preceding it the user clicks yes in the pop-up dialog

8303231
division	modulo
since decimal is base 10 you d compute the modulo in c and division of num with 10

8303298
freeglut	glew
edit i m using the latest versions of freeglut 2.8.0 rc2 and glew 1.7.0 which may make a difference if you re relying on distro-supplied versions

8303316
google-chrome	firefox
this won t work for google-chrome same-origin policy but works for greasemonkey firefox

8303326
vim	gedit
the main text editors i work with are vim gvim and gedit

8303353
jboss	glassfish
can a similar objective be achieved by using only apache http web server and without a container like tomcat jboss glassfish

8303361
for-loop	arrays
instead you are storing that in the limit variable and using that to stop the calculation instead of the result of calling the length function on the arrays every iteration through the for-loop

8303377
crypt	salt
i was wondering if there is a python cognate to php s crypt function that performs in a similar way generating a random salt and embedding it within the saved string

8303377
hash	salt
i have a table of hash passwords that were created using the string key to setup a sha256 based salt cryptogram

8303392
xna	spritebatch
i m trying to draw text to the screen in c# with .net and xna so i m using xna s spritebatch

8303412
uiview	calayer
since i don t create calayer myself in this case it can only be the calayer of a uiview which might be anything from a uibutton to a uislider

8303412
profiling	instrumentation
jeff recommended hitting command + i to launch the profiling and then select the zombies instrumentation

8303412
uiview	calayer
every uiview has a calayer but the point is i don t create these calayer instances myself

8303412
uiview	calayer
so in this case the goal is to know to which uiview button slider whatever that calayer belongs to

8303428
int	chars
the switch statement in c c++ accepts only three case types int chars and enumerated data types which is effectively another way of saying int

8303428
int	chars
chars also reduce to int when evaluated as ascii codes

8303462
free	malloc
and it does nothing to guarantee that there s a free for every malloc

8303554
for-loop	loops
it is bad practice to place a function call or call a property that masks a function in the termination statement of a for-loop in any language which has the described loops mechanics

8303573
google-chrome	firefox
a programmable way to do fullscreen is working now in both firefox and google-chrome in their latest versions

8303599
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr into the stdout stream

8303609
getter	setter
so the reason why your code is crashing is because when you use dynamic you are telling the compiler i promise that an implementation for these getter and setter will be available at runtime

8303609
getter	setter
instead there are two things you could do use an nsnumber for both the bool and the float or implement your own getter and setter

8303609
getter	setter
implementing you own getter and setter

8303609
getter	setter
to implement the getter and setter you need to know a little about kvc kvo and core data

8303630
put	get
i can use the database expert to put both datasets and their datatables in to the report but i get this error

8303681
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i added a uisegmentedcontrol and a uitableview to the customview via ib by just dragging them onto the screen

8303697
firefox	safari
to do that i spoofed user-agent in firefox and added there a string corresponding to iphone s safari useragent string

8303697

i want the audio to keep playing if the user locks the screens but pause if they decide to switching to another app by pressing the home button

8303709
postgresql	mysql
as far as i know this works for postgresql and not mysql

8303713
int	double	int	chars
the compiler does do some implicit conversions such as promoting chars to int and float to double

8303752
post	put
the solution is very simple in routes change post to put

8303761
sorting	filtering
1 use a dataset to store the log entries and then use a dataview to apply filtering sorting

8303765
for-loop	arrays
well the only way i could think of was to store the column values in arrays and then using for-loop to spit each value out along with their percentage

8303780
client-side	server-side
while that doesn t allow dynamically loading dependencies in an asynchronous way as the amd specs does it does allow to nicely share the same javascript code on both the client-side and server-side which is a huge bonus for me mainly because i m working with nodejs on the server side too so i m not sure how important that might be for you and it handles packaging all of the dependencies together nicely for you so they can be synchronously require d by parsing your javascript code and looking for plain require calls to determine what a given script requires in order to run

8303785
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
everything works great on google-chrome 15.0.874.106 but is doesn t work on firefox 7.0.1 and opera 11.52

8303785
opera	firefox
again that just happens on firefox and opera

8303785
opera	firefox
i am getting mad and i don t know how to debug the problem effectively on firefox and opera

8303828
pop-up	dialog
even if i put in the correct password after the dialog the dialog just flashes as if the request was sent and then it pop-up again

8303841
queue	fifo
a fifo queue might be a better approach than recursion as suggested by the wikipedia article on breadth-first search

8303844
put	get
you may be able to get away with using it if you put back-ticks around it but i think you would be better off changing the name to a non-reserved word

8303862
min	max
my problem is that using this code the y-axis remains at a max and min based on the original view of the data

8303862
min	max
i want the y-axis to autoscale so that the max and min is only based on the data visible due to the x-axis zoom per graph pane of course

8303881
post	get
get more visitors and post content more frequently to get google to visit your site more often

8303890
children	parent
there supposed to be a 1 parent n children relationship between the tables meaning if i create a new entry in the parenttable a new user i get a clean datagrid in the child grid to type schedule data for the user

8303902
for-loop	arrays
create an arrays of imageicons and use the string arrays and a for-loop to create the icon arrays

8303926
glut	glui
i d take a look at both glut and glui as simple extensions to opengl that provide basic widgets

8303954
free	calloc
so it depends on what point you are not using calloc resources you can start free it

8304011
put	get
i would put a label text on the screen when you get a time

8304017
mouseleave	mouseenter
when you click on this it then initialises voting mode and mouseenter mouseleave event handlers are asigned to the individual stars

8304017
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently when you have clicked once to enter vote mode then hovered over the stars which adds highlight classes as you mouseenter then clicked to actually vote the original mouseenter mouseleave event handlers are still live on the individual stars

8304022
g++	gcc
when you write a command like g++ file_name.cpp you re telling gcc to compile and link that file into a complete program

8304031
ant	maven
have maven run ant task which runs schematron checks

8304032
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer

based on ofek shilon s blog post and tweaked to get all the device ids manufacturer id + product id strings

8304090
udp	tcp
digi now has a wifi xbee module which can plug-in directly where an old xbee was and can be accessed via tcp or udp directly from a iphone app

8304116
post	get
without the attribute the form automatically submits as a get request while your php code is trying to get post data

8304119
post	put
for security reasons you don t want to post a query to that page it s better to put the query in the code on that page and then send some information with your post to invoke the search

8304122
profiling	instrumentation
to do almost the same thing but without having to open instrumentation or profiling your app you can set nszombieenabled mallocstacklogging and guard malloc in the debugger

8304167
mouseleave	mouseenter
bind the mouseenter mouseleave click functions

8304180
google-chrome	firefox
the code has been tested in ie7 8 9 google-chrome and firefox

8304192
submit	submission
add a validation and a submission function to the validate and the submit stack of your quiz form and

8304214
min	max
apparently in vb 6.0 you were able to flip the min and max values and this achieved what i desire to do but they removed that feature in vb.net

8304227
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine except every now and then the url used to access one of the logs which sometimes gets around 700mb stops responding in google-chrome it says no data recieved in ie and firefox it just shows a blank page

8304233
onresume	onpause
you shouldn t need a wakelock stops power saving ensure you are releasing the camera resource in one of the lifecycle methods onpause or onstop then reacquire the camera resource in onresume

8304250
bottle	flask
flask and bottle are popular choices for this kind of lightweight http work

8304254
getter	setter
but mostly its also when you want to encapsulate other logic into the getter an setter to perform other functions

8304255
getter	setter
yes private properties can make sense particularly in cases where you have logic you want to implement in the getter setter

8304255
getter	setter
you may only want these accessible within the class hence they re private but you still want to encapsulate the getter setter logic in one place

8304255
getter	setter
someone reflecting over public properties won t see the first one but they will see the second even if they can t invoke the getter setter

8304265
getter	setter
i ve never created a private property with an auto getter setter

8304275
put	get
now i thought maybe changing the tabs programatically doesn t call viewdiddisappear so i put a breakpoint there but it does indeed get called

8304299
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox just not ie 9

8304387
pull	push
android widget design seems to work on the basis that your widget pull information when it wants it i think there are many sensible scenarios where an activity may wish to push data to a widget

8304402
pop-up	dialog
i launch an activity which in turn pop-up a dialog

8304402
pop-up	dialog
the dialog dismisses but a small modal dialog pop-up with the name of the application in it

8304420
post	get
i have currently found the way to get the location tags attached to post by accessing the place field that each entry of the feed connection has

8304420
width	height
the fields i can access for each photo through the graph api are id from tags name icon picture source height width images link created_time updated_time position

8304443
folder	directory
unfortunately the best approach is probably os dependent ie writing to the application data folder in windows and writing to a hidden folder in the home directory in nix systems

8304492
for-loop	loops
if you add a for-loop it will likely freeze all other computations which means your activity view won t show up until loops breaks

8304514
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to php 5.3.2 and according to phpversion that s the versioning that is getting used

8304538
ggplot2	lattice
therefore while i have code for what i ve been doing in r with the graphics library pointing me to relevant equivalent functions and usage examples for lattice or ggplot2 specifically would be appreciated

8304547
folder	directory
host the images from a sub directory of an images folder

8304606

it appears the server was in a state where the tcp echo application had crashed but udp echo was fine and the tcp layer was still capable of handling traffic

8304636
subtract	add
the same happens if i add it does the same if i subtract also to the cells text and switch pages and then go back to the table view

8304654
int	chars
convert each chars into an int and put it into a set

8304702
nstimer	nsblockoperation
i could have the nstimer fire on the main thread then use nsblockoperation to dispatch a background thread but i m wondering if there is a more efficient way of doing this

8304704
submit	submission
if you need to add the subscriber to the db or do other processing before submission the best way is to do all processing via ajax and once the processing is finished return true so the form will submit

8304711
pull	push
this is useful when direct push and pull are not

8304714
cos	sin
use sin and cos approximation functions instead of math.sin and math.cos

8304721
lan	localhost	wan	lan
i ve a simple jax-ws web service that on localhost works fine with the clients but now i want to publish the web service on a public ip so the clients can interact with it through wan network instead lan network

8304723
int	chars
if i have data that only really needs 1-10 i don t need a int 4 bytes a short 2 bytes or even a chars 1 byte

8304784
listview	gridview
one way to accomplish this is to bring up a small form with all the subitems of the listview item in textboxes or a gridview so they can be edited

8304794
union	distinct
use union all if you know the values will be distinct unique -- union removes duplicates and is slower for that reason

8304804
accessor	properties
minimize properties access - cache dom accessor objects in local variables before performing operations - especially before loops

8304807
jobs	cron
using cron jobs

8304807
jobs	cron
another idea is to use cron jobs which will call your script on constant interval and you won t need your browser to be running all the time

8304820
postgresql	mysql
mysql usually wants to use 3306 first but iâ ve had it try to use the postgresql port on one occasion but i feel like i need to account for strange configurations

8304848
post	get
i d suggest you start with what you do have the getting started snippets and the translated tutorial and then when you get stuck post a more specific question regarding ncrawler with your source code as you have implemented it

8304853
google-chrome	safari
today i noticed the registration redirect is no longer working in google-chrome and safari latest public release

8304854

as i note in my comment when using a list only a reference 1 or email or an int float string boolean or null literal are acceptable list entries

8304861
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
edit fyi this works fine in firefox google-chrome and opera

8304892
union	distinct
by partition of a list i mean a set of subsets of the list elements such that the intersection of any distinct pair of subsets is empty and the union of all subsets is equal to the original list

8304940
put	get
so all the sound files get put inside the jar and in the code i am creating the players using

8304977

if the data is hidden it needs to be added to the nspopupbutton as an nsmenuitem but the hidden flag needs to be set to yes so it does not normally appear in the nspopupbutton menu

8305239
nsmenuitem	nspopupbutton
i was wondering if there is a straight forward way of doing this using nsarraycontroller and an nspopupbutton but thus far i have not been able to find anything resembling a solution -- not when it comes to managing the hidden property of the nsmenuitem objects

8305280
onclick	onchange
ajax listener event valuechange seems to be firing onclick instead of onchange

8305280
button	checkbox
that s indeed the default valuechange event which is been used by the radio button and checkbox which are genreated by the respective jsf components

8305280
button	checkbox
the reason why jsf does that by default is clear for checkbox but at first sight not entirely clear for radio button as they cannot be unticked anyway

8305297

8305442
textview	imageview
looks like imageview is not scaling to fit textview

by using relativelayout you can set textview below the imageview so that imageview and textview can wrap

8305779
children	parent
the requirement is that the parent and their corresponding children need to be exported into a pdf document

8305779
children	parent
something as above will probably solve the problem but all of a sudden the requirements changes and now each of these parent and their corresponding children need to be in separate pdfs so the above given snippet is modified by changing the appendtoparentpdf to exporttopdf follows

8305795
width	height
they seem to be fixed to the iframe based off this fiddle note jsfiddle uses an iframe and my height s and width s were just to test scrolling

8305893
hash	salt
hash the users password + salt together

8305893
hash	salt
surely if they can read what the salt value is for that hash password they can work out what the hash password is without the salt and then use a rainbow table

8305899
implements	extends
there will be a server program that will implements your interface extends remote and it will have definitions or calls to other methods at server and it will bind an object

8305916
for-loop	loops
with an arraylist a hand-written counted loops is about 3x faster with or without jit but for other collections the enhanced for-loop syntax will be exactly equivalent to explicit iterator usage

8305932
hash	salt
the introduction of a salt invalidates these precomputed hash a rainbow table must be made for each unique salt

8305939
ddms	adb
update2 i found a resolution and i could use remote adb to connect the device after running the app in the device you can type following from pc command to make it connected to ddms

8305943
hash	salt
the point of the salt hash password process is to make it computationally infeasible to precompute possible password hash because the random salt screws up the precomputation process

8305943
hash	salt
it also means that if the same password is used at different sites it won t be obvious by simply looking at the salt hash password values - because the salt will be different at the different sites so the resulting hash value will be different

8305951
hash	salt
let s say you didn t use a salt and an attacker got your hash

8305951
hash	salt
now let s say the same attacker got your hash but they are salt

8305951
hash	salt
for each hash she wants to examine she ll need to take the candidate password apply the salt compute a new hash and compare it to the hash you have stored

8305967

post	get
and in your your_url_for_function_to_update_status in php you can get post value and updte accordingly

8306007
decoder	encoder
this way adding support for a new format or type is as simple as providing a decoder and or encoder for it adding an spi file to the manifest of the jar it is in then adding the jar to the run-time class-path of the application

8306007
decoder	encoder
so if you can provide the encoder decoder then yes

8306043

8306045
tinyint	boolean
i recommend using an boolean or tinyint and validating the radio input value by using intval

8306046
for-loop	loops
i would improve this function by removing the while loops for and replace with for-loop so that doesn t have to be evaluated every time in loops and also replace is_array with isset and move the values to keys isse t is quicker than in_array

8306070
folder	directory
the location unfortunetly seems to quite often contain n or n in it because the current directory is in the temp folder causing the line to either break or remove itself from the line entirely making the folder location invalid

128bit	64bit
in practice computer systems have been known to use 128bit or even 64bit numbers as supposedly unguessable tokens

8306346
128bit	64bit
another way to look at this is to consider how many guesses per second an attacker might be able to make and considering how long it would take them to guess a 64bit or 128bit number with whatever probability makes you feel threatened

8306370
width	height
you ll likely want to maintain the aspect ratio so you ll want to calculate max width or height and place in that frame centered or crop it to the square

8306610
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
sidenote arrays also implicitly implement icollection ilist and ienumerable the clr actually generates an array that inherits from the generic versions of those classes in addition to the non-generic at runtime so your above code would work with arrays as well

its not that clear from your question maybe some code would help but yes this seems like an acceptable approach in that the consumer does not care which subclassing is used as they all inherited from the same abstract base class

8314740

nsstring	nsdata
when dealing with utf8 and nsstring you should probably use to get the nsdata object you can send over the network

8314903
free	malloc
listen to everyone else saying to just use malloc efficiently first but if you really do need a region-based allocator that can free stuff in big lumps look to the apache portable runtime library

8314942

while the set accessor is accessible it doesn t do anything so in effect this is the same as a public getter private setter setup

8314942
serializable	deserialization
the whole serializable deserialization process would be like this

8314958
draggable	droppable
note that it doesn t use the accept option to specify which draggable the droppable will accept

8315636
phpstorm	aptana
btw i strongly encourage you to use an ide able to directly tell you basic syntax errors like aptana or phpstorm

width	height
use a function other than getbounds to determine the area of your mazecircle for example using the properties x y width and height instead

8315692
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
if i had to guess i would say that since your packaging type is jar configuration for the maven-jar-plugin gets inserted into your effective pom.xml

strdup	malloc	strdup	calloc	calloc	malloc
i m having an infuriating issue here where i m crashing on malloc calloc strdup and i m assuming currently that it s because of a buffer over run somewhere

8316229
quicksort	heapsort
i like heapsort but as well as the drawbacks noted above i have heard it said that it makes poor use of modern memories because it makes memory accesses all over the place whereas quicksort and even small radix sorts end up intermixing a relatively small number of streams of sequential reads and writes - so caches are more effective

8316270
for-loop	loops
it looks like you should be clearing alist inside of the while loops otherwise each run through the for-loop will append len newlist items to alist without removing previous elements of alist

when a program segfaults does stdout not fflush its buffer

8316330

8316516
for-loop	loops
some of the restrictions would have been either rather arbitrary or rather complicated especially on loops given that c++ doesn t have the concept of a native incrementing for-loop but both the end condition and the increment code have to be explicitly specified in the for statement making it possible to use arbitrary expressions for them

8316524

8317583
ubuntu	linux
example usage that works on ubuntu and other forms of linux but not on mac os x

8317601
put	get
it s technically possible to build this sort of system but managing the synonyms the privilege grants and the build process can get unwieldy very quickly in addition to making it more likely that data integrity problems are introduced when different applications put essentially the same data in different tables because they weren t aware that some other application already had a table for that entity

8317607
profiling	instrumentation
after profiling this code with instrumentation leaks it s telling me that the line with performrequestwithhandler is leaking

8317616
minimum	max
to find the minimum number of connections to handle your users so max concurrent users you would need to test against a datetime in a for-loop and .addminutes or .addhours depending on the resolution you want

8317618
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is because uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller and a self centered one at that

8317622
hash	md5
look at some md5 implementation to get a feeling of what hash functions can be

8317636

hide	show
i have my site built with jquery show hide divs and want to have a specific div show when the page is loaded from a specific link

8317850
onclick	preventdefault	onclick	onchange	onchange	preventdefault
i have tried every combination of preventdefault and return false i can think of both in the function and the onclick event and have tried using the onchange event etc etc but nothing seems to allow me to call a function that fires when the checkbox is clicked that allows the function to get the current value of the checkbox before it is changed by the click event

8317870

8317958
hide	show
i m trying to use this code to hide or show a div based on the url param direction i can t get this to work and wonder if there is a better way

8317992
hide	show
it s possible that your code isn t working as the divs haven t been loaded in to the dom when you re trying to show hide them

8318027
free	malloc
instead of using malloc to allocate on the heap and since there is no free which will lead to a memory leak it will be much easier if we allocate on the stack with a predetermined buffer size

8318039
google-chrome	firefox
but when the page is load i am not able to click the image it is not in clickable mode while when i open the same page in firefox or google-chrome i can click the image and item command event is also firing

8318046
inherited	properties
i am looking for a general way to make a project inherited it s properties from a parent solution in visual studio 2010

8318048
openssl	m2crypto
without knowing the m2crypto library but knowing a bit of cryptography it looks like the public_decrypt function is just a wrapper around openssl s rsa_public_decrypt function a low-level rsa operation

8318055
keydown	mousedown
i m not aware of any deselected event but there s probably only a couple events that will allow text to be deselected so you can probably listen for blur mousedown and keydown

8318060
firefox	safari
it completely disappears in the latest versions firefox and safari and i m completely stumped with what s causing it

8318069
firefox	safari
this just works for ie so i apply this hack and works fine on firefox safari and others

8318130

works fine in safari but google-chrome cries a little on the inside

8318220
clang	llvm
the llvm clang compiler is customizable it is in c++ and i don t know it very well

8318257
folder	directory
i can successfully run the batch file by changing the directory to that folder through command prompt

you also need a web application for the parent to view their children s record

8318307
put	get
i m looking for the most simple way to put in some german text and to get back tagged words

8318362
octal	binary	octal	decimal
the program converts a number in binary decimal octal hexadecimal

8318396
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you re able to edit your html the optimum solution would be to move the buttons inside #top-products positioning them as required and changing your javascript slightly to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

8318397
onmouseover	onclick
1 since there is no onmouseover event in mobile browsers iphone android i use onclick event to change the button color

8318412
width	margin
for widths greater than 401 the margin seems to be around 7.5 of the table view width

8318422
avurlasset	avmutablecomposition
i am trying to insert an avurlasset of a avplayeritem that states avplayeritemstatusreadytoplay into an avmutablecomposition like this

firefox	safari
it looks it was fixed in firefox and safari

8318549
comparator	comparable
to override the core comparable class s comparator method

8318558
comparator	comparable
your comparable interface has a method comparator element nodea element nodeb

8318576
width	height
the jqplot usage page says that you need to be sure to add width and height to the plot target

8318591
mouseleave	mouseenter
btw mouseenter and mouseleave do not work with this seemingly

8318593
tinyint	boolean
if you never need to use sql to filter out records based on these checkboxes i m guessing they are yes no boolean tinyint type values then serializing is a valid approach

8318596
firefox	safari
i did some testing and to my surprise experienced the same error myself on firefox and safari for windows

8318608
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
you can set width 100 and make it account for padding and borders by also setting box-sizing border-box - you ll need to use the vendor prefixes i believe -moz- and -webkit-

8318617
comparator	comparable
but for both cases you should use the standard java interfaces even though you are only using comparable also see comparator

8318630
google-chrome	firefox
onblur is disabled on google-chrome this will work on firefox and ie

8318646
mouseover	mouseout
unfortunately the event mouseover was poorly named - it would ve been better if it had been called mousein so that it was more obviously and intuitively the opposite of mouseout

8318646
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think mouseenter and mouseleave are ie things that other browsers may not support - though i think jquery supports those events too

8318670
calloc	malloc
or if you prefer malloc can be re-defined in terms of calloc

8318676
google-chrome	firefox
it seems fine in firefox however the button goes onto the next line in google-chrome

8318765
textview	imageview
a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

8318802
rss	feed
i need to add an image to my rss feed but cannot see it

8318811
x86	64bit
it is probably not possible at least not on linux because the instruction register sets are different on x86 32 bits and x86-64 64bit

8318827
post	put	post	get	put	get
this is also not a problem when using servicestack every result you return get s automatically converted in the response contenttype you want this is the full code of a simple web service that can be called via all http verbs get post put delete on all the supported formats no config required json xml html jsv csv soap even by a direct html form x-www-form-urlencoded or querystring request

8318838
multiplying	subtract
there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying

8318868
portrait	landscape
note that the image can be in either portrait or landscape

8318909
uitableview	reloaddata
just empty the array you re using as a data source bear in mind that your numberofrowsinsection data source method must use the array count and call reloaddata on the uitableview

8318933
width	height
divide the width of the image by the height that s your ratio

8318933
width	height
then find what s the largest dimension if it s the width set the width 50 ratio and height 50

8318933
width	height
if it s the height set it height 50 ratio and the width 50

8318957
post	get
and when you click tag1 we get only those 3 post who have been classified under culture category and that has been tagged as tag1

8318963
noexcept	throw
that is move constructors should really be noexcept but having a move constructor call a copy constructor could have it throw

8318974
free	malloc
arc knows nothing about core foundation nor about objects malloc free or anything other than objc memory management

8318974
free	malloc
and if you malloc memory you should continue to free it

8319040
strlen	strcpy
using strlen and strcpy on the cipher text in the c program may be part of the problem

8319053
bmp	png
i guess the only solution to this one is changing the input image format to something lossless like png or bmp stupid me not thinking about the file format in the first place

8319057
pull	push
i don t get any errors or warnings on commit only on push and not on pull

8319064
width	height
you can t constrain an image to a fixed width and height rectangle while maintaining aspect ratio in css alone

8319064
width	height
if you set just a width then the height will be set to maintain the aspect ratio likewise just a height but this will not force the image to fit into a box since you can t know which is greatest the width or the height

8319083
atomic	compare-and-swap
in a typical jdk implementation for a modern processor atomicreference.set simply uses a volatile write since atomicreference.compareandset uses a compare-and-swap operation that is atomic with respect to volatile writes

8319096
rss	feed
if so i believe that to show images in a feed you need the rss media extensions -

8319109
post	get
do not accept session identifiers from get post variables

8319109
post	get
session identifiers in url query string get variables or post variables are not recommended as it simplifies this attack

8319109
post	get
it is easy to make links on forms which set get post variables

8319122
dnf	yum
note dnf which replaced yum has the same helper script in dnf-plugins-core

8319185
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
what you can try is take that code in the viewwillappear or viewdidappear

8319190
width	height
this won t add the extra width and height

8319200
geany	gedit
if it is the first case then most if not all python ide i have ever used do have that functionality built in gedit eclipse geany spe just to mention a few

8319216
memcpy	malloc
essentially what the below does it dynamically allocate some memory if i goes over 256 then the array needs to be increased in size so i malloc a temp array with 2x the size memcpy etc

8319236
getter	setter
borrow parts of it the rest are just setter and getter

8319244
allocator	stl
they all allocate from the free store c++ parlance for the heap in some other languages see c++ stl question allocator

8319255
folder	directory
i ve noticed that in my project s eggs folder some projects are unzipped to directory and some are left in their zip files

8319312
tcplistener	tcpclient
this is a bit more complex than using wcf but you could simply use a tcpclient and a tcplistener in system.net.sockets which could be used to open up an actual tcp port and communicate that way make sure to listen on ipaddress.loopback not any or you might get a firewall warning

8319320
daemons	launchd
stop the postgres server launchd daemons

8319418
pull	push
since post-receive hooks do no affect the outcome of the push since they happen after the push the push itself has gone fine but the pull that the hook attempted as part of the post-receive has failed due to the local changes

8319425
postgresql	mysql
i ve looked at oracle db2 mysql postgresql and sybase and almost every resource has a different list

8319468
dbcontext	objectcontext
you still have all the bells and whistles that data or model first approach have and some since you can extend the dbcontext which is objectcontext under the hood

8319473
setinterval	settimeout
geoff has outlined one approach using setinterval and clearing it from the callback so i ll outline the other using settimeout from the callback

8319473
setinterval	settimeout
so if draw took 100ms say the chained settimeout would be equivalent to setinterval func 1100

8319473
setinterval	settimeout
that means that events you schedule with settimeout or setinterval or any other async function will never occur during a loop even if the loop is infinite

8319475
keydown	keyup
with this the keydown causes the button to appear pressed so long as the enter key is pressed and on release triggers the keyup handler changing the style of the button so as to appear un-clicked

8319484
execvp	fork
i can do that part fine using a fork in which the parent process waits on the child and the child execvp s the program

8319505
udp	tcp
actually my lsp supports tcp udp and raw protocols

8319509
accessor	properties
it allows you to override groovy s use of properties accessor

8319519
put	get
you can scale the x and z values you get if you want to put some distance between the objects

8319533
google-chrome	firefox
weird enough in google-chrome and firefox the window.location.hash is not changed after back

8319566
content-disposition	content-type
we set the content-disposition and content-type in the response header in the controller like so

8319571
curlpp	libcurl
to download a file via http in a c++ program you can use libcurl or the curlpp c++ wrapper

8319575
post	get
they can use curl functions to post the data to a script on your site fsockopen to manually perform the http request if curl is not available or if it is a simple get request file_get_contents of your url with parameters in the query string would work as well

8319647
getter	setter
the canonical way to do this is by using a combination of opaque pointers and public structs along with allocators getter and setter for the private elements

8319676
oncreate	ondestroy
i have two activities and both use oncreate and ondestroy methods only

8319687
hide	show
the only workaround i ve been able to find has been to catch the showevent function and to promptly hide the window but this still allows the qdialog object to be show for a split second

8319712
ssl	https
so viewing google maps behind ssl is still an issue unless someone knows of a work-a-round to get those location or building images removed or to be displayed behind https and not http such as the case below with the image itself

8319716
google-chrome	firefox
the website works fine woth google-chrome but slows down when opening in ie all versions or firefox

8319719
yacc	bison
i will take a moment to plug my own tool meta# which allows you to build a pattern matching grammar for exactly these types of scenarios but you could also use one of many others such as lexx yacc flexx bison or antlr

8319743
mongoose	mongojs
installed npm packages for mongodb mongojs and mongoose

8319743
mongodb	bson
bson.js appears under this directory for me opt node node_modules mongodb lib mongodb bson

8319748
for-loop	arrays
return a string then you can do the for-loop through the string arrays

8319771
hide	show
it s a one way street you can set your app to nsuielement to hide the dock icon then call to show it in the dock but once it s there you can t remove it

8319780
division	subtract
floored division has the additional step of subtract 1 from the quotient if the remainder is nonzero

8319785

i know this is possible with boolean with a few tricks but i cannot seem to adapt this to an int value

8319796
gentoo	linux
asking if anybody knows some options to install cloudera flume on the linux gentoo engineyard s instance through the portage emerge

8319810
public	protected
public protected or private

8319814
post	get
the format of the parameters will depend upon whether you are performing a get or a post operation

8319829
ubuntu	linux
trying to figure out a way so that when i have somebody putty into my linux ubuntu box they will have no terminal access

8319857
google-chrome	firefox
authentication works fine in firefox google-chrome but fails in internet explorer

8319857
google-chrome	firefox
if i do the same thing in firefox google-chrome it won t authenticate

8319939
profiler	shark
the argument i want to add is -agentlib shark on mac osx for running a profiler

8320031
oncreate	onstart
onstart and onstop are existing methods on an activity just like oncreate

8320031
oncreate	ondestroy
oncreate and ondestroy are not an appropriate pair of methods to use for flurry session tracking because ondestroy is not guaranteed to be called

8320036
gson	jackson
while there is a handful of java-to from-json apis that provide for easy basic binding between json and an arbitrary java data structure jackson and gson are by far the most sophisticated capable and feature-rich options

8320036
gson	jackson
back in july 2011 i posted a multi-part series on my blog comparing using gson versus jackson stepping through features as they were organized in the gson user guide including examples of comparable implementations in jackson and of implementations in gson where the gson user guide was incomplete or broken

8320036
gson	jackson
this is the most comprehensive comparison of using gson versus jackson for common json-to from-java tasks known

8320036
gson	jackson
the current release of gson 2.0 shows to be about 16 times slower than the current release of jackson 1.9.2 at serializing and deserializing a 500 byte json structure using very comparable implementation efforts just one or two lines of code

8320056
opera	safari
2013 -- only supported in android 4.4 meaning no ios safari opera mini mobile or widespread android browser support

8320096
int	chars
so you ll have to convert to hex yourself or find an existing function that does it by turning real int to hex chars representations

8320149
versioning	upgrade
you either need to upgrade ruby or use an older versioning of rubygems

8320159
hide	show
i would like it to toggle from show to hide and from hide back to show

8320159
hide	show
when show is displayed the div will be hidden but when show is clicked the label will switch to hide and the div will be displayed and when hide is clicked the label will go back to show and the div will be hidden

8320200
rss	feed
there is not much you can do to secure the feed itself against man in the middle unfortunately as ssl and or xml signature is not really defined for rss

8320201
int	chars
the int func usigned chars key 20 resides in headerthree.h

8320216
rss	feed
at the moment i m reading rss feed that may be encoded in any character type using simplexml_load_file

8320260
multiplying	subtract
now you can divide your offset by 5 to figure out how many full weeks are in your offset and then multiplying that by 7 and subtract this new value from your date

8320277
button	checkbox
this works perfectly on linux meaning users can tick or untick the checkbox or select radio button click okay and when the preference is opened again the latest selections are saved

8320335
int	double
in the following code that i simplified how could you debug to find out what type each t is depending on main that will initiate the a with int double or any other type

8320336
jobs	cron
edit if you really can t merge the two cron jobs you could use the technique described in this question to wait for the first process to finish

8320343
jobs	cron
one approach would be to make sure that if those two jobs are separate cron jobs - there is enough time inbetween to surely cover the run of job 1

8320346
appdata	uninstaller
the easiest clean soln to wipe your appdata is to uninstaller it using adb

8320375
post	get
i ve spend hours today trying to figure this out and have read countless post some here on stack overflow but can t get to grips with how to retrieve a cookie value and apply it to my site s body css

8320408
post	get
i had a on my app.yaml - which caused the redirects to trigger every time on post and resulted in get s with full loss of post parameters like signed_requests for fb apps for example

8320430
width	height
1.fix the imageview width and height and use

8320430
width	height
no promise this will work depends on the ratio of width and height of the image source

8320430
width	height
but if all your image source are landscape style width height this way should work

8320438
mouse	keyboard
unlike keyboard and mouse which i am able to use in remote computer i am unable to use my webcam and mic

8320458
lisp	scheme
in the dialects of lisp including common lisp scheme clojure the cons procedure is the basic building block for constructing a memory object which holds two values or pointers to values

8320478

8320657
post	get
when i try to post to feed i get the oauthexception #200 the user hasn t authorized the application to perform this action.

8320674
width	height
you can set inside the defaults the height and width if all of them will get the same values

8320674
width	height
or set to each item its height and width

8320696
integer	unsigned
uint32_t 32 bit unsigned integer type

8320705
width	height
you define objects and sencha in his turn will generate html with all the properties that you will define in your js files height width class id etc

8320708
post	get
you use the same renderer in the get and post but the one in the post is only used in case of invalid data otherwise you redirect

8320727
int	chars
the output is displayed as a list of int because it contains non-printable chars

8320738
jar	war
splitting up shared code and web.xml from war project to common jar project

8320781
width	height
otherwise uibarbuttonitem only has a width property that can be set but unfortunately not a height property

8320820
chown	chmod
on unix-ish systems it ll be chown chmod

8320899
screens	tablet
when i go into my phone and tablet instead of it loading the webview like it should it simply loads a white screens i guess failing to load the web site

8320914
salt	md5
i think the password is double md5 salt and encrypted but ssl would make me feel better.

8320956
subtract	add
i originally used the cell s textlabel to handle this but that didnt work so i added a uilabel to each cell programatically and i have two buttons a add button and a subtract button which basically counts up or down when pressed

8320978
iprincipal	iidentity
i also create my own custom iprincipal and iidentity because i want to store a bit more info in the cookie which forms auth creates when a person has been authenticated

8320995
implements	extends
so buttoninfo would be extends activity since it implements an activity

8321014
sorting	filtering
conceivably this is a more general question of what to do when you want to speed up an mdx query that involves complicated sorting and filtering which apparently doesn t sit 100 well with the ssas caching system

8321015
maven	pom.xml
maven configuration is done via the pom.xml

8321027
for-loop	loops
you can easily loops over all of the contained integers using a for-loop

8321037
for-loop	arrays
still working on the assumption that you re thinking about python. there s syntax in objc called fast enumeration for iterating over the contents of an nsarray that is pleasantly similar to a python for-loop but since literal and primitive numbers can t be put into an nsarray you can t go directly from an nsrange to a cocoa arrays

8321041
ontouch	ondraw
either use surfaceview to draw or create a custom view handling ondraw and ontouch

8321051

when implementing this rather than examining touchesended and touchesbegan to identify when a long touch occurred you should the ios-provided uilongpressgesturerecognizer

8321209
google-chrome	firefox
my test work correctly on firefox and google-chrome

8321227
profiling	benchmarking
once you know what you want to scale often you ll also need or want to figure out how much you want to scale to and if your tweaks offer any benefit at all by benchmarking and profiling

8321263
width	height
the values for width and height in this line are 0

8321263
width	height	inherited	properties
the reason being that they are referring to the width and height properties of the class you re working within main - properties inherited from displayobject which will be zero based on what i can see

8321291

onmousedown	onmousemove
4 on the tlayout previously mentioned with the name formheader give it onmousedown and onmousemove events to provide the ability to drag it around the master form

8330855
width	height
when you want to maximize the child form inside the master form you d just set the outer tlayout formcontainer align property to alclient remembering to store its original top left width and height values within the the form s instance so you can recall them when pressing the restore button

8330866
superclass	subclassing
the graphicseditor only needs to know that there is some superclass shape and that all of its subclassing implement the method draw

8330899
smartgwt	gwtp
this sounds like a bug in gwtp - it suggests that they are adding anchors to all elements anywhere on the page or adding event handlers to all such elements including ones rendered by smartgwt

8330916
int	double
date is not an int in vb a it is a double

8330917
width	margin
if the image width is fixed perhaps the easiest way is to put the image inside the content div and then push it back to the left with a negative margin

8330944
width	height
in code rather than via the layout xml you can create a bitmap of the right aspect ratio device height x width by cropping the image after scaling the bitmap to be big enough to crop

8330950
getter	setter
what i meant was if we d know ammount of class templete arguments n we could create n variables of difrent types one for each argument and n strings all private and so we could create n functions for setter and getter of that strings + variables which we would call in constructor

8330957
mouse	keyboard
also two or more fingers may be used to augment normal touching and dragging gestures though this is analogous to using a mouse with alternate buttons or keyboard modifiers

8330960
opera	safari
viewing this chart on font-face browser support webkit safari and opera browsers do not support the woff font format which is the format that particular font is in

8330961

8331173
hash	md5
i am trying to generate a unix-style password hash using md5

8331186
setinterval	settimeout
i think you should use setinterval instead of settimeout

8331213
hex	binary
the unix password hash is in hex format while you re writing it down in binary

8331241
hash	md5
because hash bytes may be in any range from 0 to 255 which is not like md5 hash is looking

8331259
width	height
that way all the pages occupy 100 width height of the viewport and no scrolling-to-the-top-before-transitions will occur

8331291
crypt	md5
unix md5 crypt doesn t use plain md5

8331291
hash	md5
that would be insecure because plain md5 is fast and password hash should be slow

8331318
charindex	substr
the problem with doing something like substr filepath 9 charindex filepath 9 - 9 is that when i have a path that looks like c root iwantthisstring it returns an error because the charindex never finds a last after root because there is no third in this case

8331323
put	get
on 1 i get the cross product of the two tables which is basically every combination of each entry in the two tables this is not what i want i just want to put them next to each other

nexus	artifactory
have an out-facing instance of nexus or artifactory

8331344
onclick	onsubmit
would work more consistently with onsubmit rather than onclick

8331344
put	get
in that case put a delay into your function to allow the get request for the image to be made before the page evaporates

8331348
decoder	encoder
for instance in the case of json encoder decoder we can try whether we have simplejson library available and use json library as a fallback as follows

8331374
google-chrome	firefox
ie9 firefox google-chrome is working

8331400
post	get
a different approach can be use a very useful php tool a class emulating browser behavior that do all the job to keep trace of all fields do the post get by clicking on links or buttons

8331449
put	get
if you ve put some field in your form it doesn t mean you ll always get it at all not to mention the right format

8331451
pull	push
dr do a git pull merge changes if needed then push again

8331471
pull	push
but what i want todo is push to local server to test and rather than push to github i would rather send github a pull request to pull from my server

8331471
pull	push
is this actually possible or so i need to push to a different github branch and then do a pull request between branches or setup a completely different github repo and then pull request from that one

8331473
google-chrome	firefox
i m on ubuntu using google-chrome and firefox trying to prevent browsers from caching css files on localhost .

8331487
put	get
but i don t think i can use javaobject or javamethod to work around it since i have to call a static method to create the object and i can t just throw it in an eval because i get a transparency violation error or if i put it in an anonymous function defined outside the spmd i get the same class is undefined error

8331507
min	max
i need to find in each proposal max word and min word. separated by dots

8331522

8331522
mouseevent	mouselistener
and in your code that is called from this mouselistener use a joptionpane to get the user s choice of tag name and add the resulting string to both the listdatamodel so that it is seen in the jlist and also in the stringpointmap together with the point obtained from the mouseevent so that you can map the string to the point and be able to retrieve it

8331567
ssl	https
i have a django site setup with lighttpd and ssl working but i can not seem to get a redirect to work from http to https

8331568

1. get the char length of the string and put it into

8331606
charindex	substr
select substr filepath 9 charindex filepath + 9 - 9

8331619
width	height
you ll probably want to use setmaximumsize new dimension width height

8331622
hide	show
seems there was a caching issue but where many new browsers we try don t show this error while all our old browsers still show it if i don t hide the errors.

8331631
jython	pypy
it runs on python2.0 and later or pypy or jython or python3.x

8331633
post	get
i am being incredible dim but i cannot seem to get my head around or find any examples of using the facebook c# api to get a list of wall post

8331633
post	get
now initially for testing i just want to get my own this will be replaced with the clients wall post but in essence the procedure will be the same

8331727
width	height
when i run this code it returns width java.awt.dimension width 0 height 0 like i placed in the comments

8331737
width	height
if i use the width and height of a pot 512 1024 etc.. a texture renders but a it s not the string i want to display b it gets corrupted after a few renders and then blanks out eventually c the texture that renders is not cropped and is stretched very oddly

8331745
post	get
now that you can get information on your page you need to ask permission to the user to request the wall post you will find all request permissions in facebook

8331749
punctuation	words
a words character is any letter decimal digit or punctuation connector such as an underscore

8331764

that will likely be the bin folder in your tomcat directory

8331941
mp3	ogg
example ogg audio for firefox and mp3 for ie

8331959
inherited	properties
rather than trying to attribute the properties i would suggest adding a collection of error warning properties to a base class that your business objects inherited from

8332002
inherited	subclassing
then any subclassing of that will inherited the behaviour

8332004
profiling	instrumentation
after launching the performance wizard selecting instrumentation choosing one web project and a few c# library projects and enabling tier interaction profiling i get this weird leading off with

8332028

failing that print everything before you use it using fflush stdout between them so that if you don t get a print you know that that is the piece that is initialized poorly

8332051
post	get
i want to get a number from post and check it against the id column in my table and get the name of this row

8332056
google-chrome	firefox
i checked it out in ie google-chrome and firefox all the same

8332059
int	chars
you ll note the applications x int and x chars inside the lambda

8332059
int	chars
this forces the caller to provide a polymorphic function so a term like g length is not valid because length does not apply to int or chars

8332075
pull	push
after i push to svn hgsubversion pull the changeset back from svn and strips the original changeset

8332079
boost	stl
if performance is not extremely sensitive in your app try stl or boost library which will free you from the old-fashion issues

8332119
spaces	delimiter
you want to explicitly set datatype to xldelimited else excel assumes you data is arranged in fixed-width columns and excel s initial guess at how wide those columns are is where the spaces are -- ignoring whatever delimiter you choose in the argument list

8332170
hash	salt
you have to add a salt value to the password you want to hash to make it unbreakable

8332196
getter	setter
i think apple realized that declaring ivars was redundant when you re gonna declare property so why not let the synthesize take care of it when it creates the setter and getter

8332221
emacs	aquamacs
i m a new emacs user and i m trying to get gnus working with mi gmail account with aquamacs

8332223
width	height
the idea is that the display class takes in a set of fairly lightweight objects that extend gameobject and contain information about their location size and appearance on the screen and then draws them pixel-by-pixel onto the applet stretching and positioning them proportionally depending on the specified display height and width

8332223
width	height
in testing this i set the width and height of the display to 128 and pass two objects to the display which are both 32-pixel squares both return 32 for getwidth and getheight one is red and returns 24 for getx and gety and the other is blue and returns 16 for getx and gety

8332225
getter	setter
you should also think about making them private and provide getter and setter methods

8332235
converter	multibinding
you can bind the width to the tabcontrol.actualwidth and tabcontrol.items.count using a multibinding and add a converter to calculate the appropriate fraction

8332245
google-chrome	safari
iâ m writing a simple wysiwyg editor with the ability to apply css classes to text i have encountered the following problem in google-chrome and safari

8332371
put	get
i m using a method to generate xml files dynamically for a research project they get put into a loader that reads from a file path i don t have any control over how the loader handles things otherwise i d pass the internal xml representation instead of monkeying with temp files i m using this code to save the file

8332375
cassini	iis
i ve had windows authentication working in the cassini visual studio web server for some time now but when i changed to run my site in iis 7 the site no longer works properly

nsmatrix	nscell
given an nsmatrix and an nscell is there a quick way to query the matrix to know at which row and column in the matrix the cell is placed

8332451
width	height
since the .sit class has to have a fixed width and height because its an image you can use the following method

8332455
implements	extends
i am extends the above class to implements it using a static hashmap

8332467
width	height
1 2 height of overitem height width of sit

since you are using your repos as gates where you perform some valiadation i would suggest having another repo on github to which you push to and setup a pull request from that one to your live repo

8332538
jobs	cron
cron jobs could really screw stuff up if you re not careful so a lot of shared hosts don t allow it

8332568
vsto	add-in
i m writing a vsto outlook add in and i need to save some settings the add-in gets from a web service

8332568
vsto	add-in
does the vsto add-in have full access to do something like that

8332573
google-chrome	firefox
a firefox or google-chrome extension that works on linux or mac would be ideal as i m trying to track in the context of normal everyday browsing

8332583
versioning	upgrade
this method has a few performance drawbacks that the other methods do not see the api docs for specific details if you re interested and it s also deprecated so only use it if you have to if you re using jquery versioning 1.3 and can t upgrade

8332604
implements	extends
i have implements this exact type of layout using a view extends slidingdrawer for further customizations

8332613
width	height
if i ask the view its frame.size it will answer correctly 320 width and 460 height

8332621
width	height
i tried adding the minheight and minwidth arguments to the js and the width and height attributes to the image tag and even this css

8332621
width	height
i rather have the modal lightbox show the original image height and width but scroll bars if its too big to fit in the modal

8332622
put	get
i m creating a mobile app and it requires a api service backend to get put information for each user

8332657
g++	gcc
afaik it uses g++ to be more precise it uses gcc with language set to c++ and of course g++ for final linking

8332678
setinterval	settimeout
neither settimeout nor setinterval are guaranteed or can be used for accurately counting time

8332683
setinterval	settimeout
i prefer using setinterval over settimeout

8332686
implements	extends
i have a separate class which implements the registration process and which receives the data and extends broadcastreceiver

8332692
postgresql	mysql
benchmarks that attempt to model actual usage conditions with many concurrent queries put postgresql on par with or ahead of mysql in performance especially as you scale up in cpus cores

8332730
hash	salt
this method takes in some salt preferably one of the unique keys in the dll or a datetime appends it to a secret string stored in the client hash the result and returns this hash to the dll

8332754
puts	fflush
fflush actually puts the buffer into the file

8332770

8332775
width	height
i am trying to replace the height and width on an html iframe src upon being saved to a database

8332789
rspec	capybara
you can use the have_selector method of capybara instead of webrat at least in rspec request tests

8332789
rspec	capybara
there are certain difficulties with rspec2 and capybara page.should have_selector only works if you use capybara s visit method and not the rspec method get some path but basically it works

8332911
nsstring	nsdata
i m getting strange behavior writing nsstring and nsdata objects to relative file paths

8332963
nsbutton	nsmatrix
i have a nsmatrix with a couple of nsbutton in it which have no text but are only images

8333011
serializable	deserialization
look at it this way - the function being performed here is serializable and deserialization

8333095
children	parent
i ve tried looping using an array to hold the ids or names and using the parent container which is the row to get the children but since i have the name id it seems it should be easier than this

8333106
post	get
ryan fitzgerald was kind enough to post a gist of his javascript asset helpers which get precompiled with erb

8333109
disk	ram
3 since redis operates predominantly in memory the most important resource is that you have enough ram to hold your entire dataset in memory + a buffer for when it snapshots to disk

8333145
for-loop	loops
i read somewhere that someone got around the problem by using a for-loop for the second one but i want to get down to why exactly the second while loops is not running in my code

8333224
aggregate-functions	sum
when you drag a field onto a blank area of the report bids creates a textbox and then inserts an aggregate-functions sum or first depending on field type i think.

8333240
put	get
however when i put a namespaced name utils write.csv in the as.name call i get an error

8333333
ubuntu	debian
i believe i know what s wrong and it looks like a debian-specific problem at least verified on ubuntu 11.04 and debian squeeze

8333363
getter	setter
will generate a getter and a setter for this instance variable

8333365
children	parent
when i ve tried nesting treeviewitems the results were not positive only the parent level treeviewitem in the itemtemplate is displayed and space for it s children is created but nothing is output

8333385
draggable	droppable
i know that i can set these up as draggable and droppable as follows

8333394
client-side	server-side
unfortunatly client-side techniques like the conditional comments used do not mix with server-side techniques

8333430
hide	show
wrap the imagebutton in a div and tie jquery handlers to show or hide the link

8333463
google-chrome	firefox
is there a client side method javascript+html no flash to change this behavior to send just the name like google-chrome firefox do

8333464
post	get
if we apply the rules in turn from the blog post we get the following

8333487
sorting	filtering
set multiselect true always before refreshing the grid before paging sorting filtering reloading and so on

8333549
draggable	droppable
in this event handler points to the droppable element where as ui.draggable points to the draggable element

8333554
post	get
if that doesn t solve your problem or in general for future questions i would suggest you post the output that you get

8333561
oncreate	setcontentview
the error is that when you have used new layout setcontentview resource.layout.secondry you have lost all attached event handlers that was initialized in oncreate bundle bundle

8333659
folder	dir
i found i had to use the ftp from my webhost and go into my publish dir and delete the files in the bin folder deleting them locally did nothing when i published

8333677
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

i ve tested this on google-chrome 13+ firefox 3.6+ ie7 8 and 9 on xp and w7 safari on osx and w7

feedback	review
instead i built a workaround that makes it really easy for companies to collect feedback and get their own customers to submit the review

8333741
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome 13+ firefox 3.6+ ie7 8 and 9 on xp and w7 safari on osx and w7

google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
but not in google-chrome safari ie 8 7 and opera

8333983
accessor	ivar
i use the _ivar construct to make sure that i don t access the ivar directly by mistake when i really intend to go through the accessor

8334000
put	get
put an alert and a settimeout in your code to test whether they all execute at the same time or get separated

8334018
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both seem to ignore this and still put the scrollbar on the right side

8334041
setinterval	settimeout
long example short you can track whether or not it s time to play a beat by checking the value of new date .getmilliseconds and seeing if the equivalent of one beat in milliseconds has passed instead of relying on the not-so-accurate settimeout or setinterval functions

8334050
post	get
for instance when i click on a story posted by the washington post on someone s timeline i get this screen - when i expected it to just bring me straight to the article

8334125
getter	setter
basically you can declare property s in a class extension to still give you the benefits of the synthesize d getter setter but without making your public api look ugly

8334130
accessor	properties
there are a couple benefits to differentiating ivars from properties accessor

8334134
getter	setter	accessor	properties
remember the properties and synthesize is there to replace boilerplate code - without it you d have to code getter and setter accessor

8334151
serializable	deserialization
please take a look at gson that is a great library to work on json serializable and deserialization even into objects easily and fast

8334152
.htaccess	httpd.conf
start with a fresh zf project or remove all of your zend routes and any special configuration in .htaccess or httpd.conf httpd-vhosts.conf that you created

8334195
getter	setter
i have a weird situation where the getter in a class returns a primitive int type and the setter takes a integer class

8334195
getter	setter
to the getter and the setter to change the type of the field in schema but that does not help

8334195
getter	setter
during unmarshalling i get this error the property has a getter public int com.example.getbar but no setter

8334197
hide	show
i m converting an virtual earth app where i could just show or hide a layer with the polygon on it but i can t find something to do the trick for the google api version 3 using javascript

8334209
google-chrome	firefox
everything s fine in google-chrome firefox and even ie9 but after opening the page in ie8 an information toolbar appears with question if i really want to download those files

8334238
inherited	subclassing
the part is ill-advised because it is doesn t allow you to insert new classes in the hierarchy and it precludes subclassing from using multiple inherited with other classes that may have incompatible positional arguments

8334304
hide	show
i hide each content_div and show another one so i can keep the header static because other solutions didn t work so well

8334323
folder	directory
zend studio will see the .project file in the folder and tell you that a project already exists in the specified directory

8334338
sudo	passwd
it d also be ideal for them to enter their sudo passwd to run the script

8334348
mamp	wamp
it sounds like you are using mamp or wamp on your dev box which will load a default vhost showing phpinfo for any page that does not exist

8334362
width	height
there are some trivial caveats however since texture objects do not carry width or height getters you are dealing with a source rectangle in texel space 0...1

8334372
post	get
i tried to do it but it seems i got it messed up that first i didn t get the right result and second when i post the code here on stackoverflow you can go to my page and see it for yourself the answers i got are not enough to solve my problem

8334408
g++	gcc
commands such as gcc and g++ work but make does not

8334408

they can hide delete or remove access to the page and it completely changes how it show or if it show on their wall

8334563

if they have to have sudo access to run this script maybe it s possible to remove the passwd out of the file and into a file that has 600 permissions set

8334582
disk	ram
you say heroku say your db fits in ram so you shouldn t see disk i o issues when you measure

i am developing a node.js app using express

8334766
google-chrome	firefox
referring to both the button element and the input element with a type of button i ran across a behavior i think is a bug in recent releases of both firefox and google-chrome

8334775

mousedown	routedevent
one solution would be to have a custom image class perhaps called myimage which will detect when a mousedown event happens and in response fire a very custom routedevent say myimageroutedevent

8334835
multiplying	subtract
the functions he asked us to write are to subtract divide multiplying exponentiation x n and a lessthan function

8334861
int	chars
should be relatively safe provided that foo is passing valid chars pointers to func1 or valid int pointers to func2

8334880
maven	pom.xml
the fix for me using a maven project was to add the following dependencies in the pom.xml file

8334882
post	get
the matched groups from the regexes get passed into the requesthandler s get or post method as arguments

8334882
post	get
the problem is i want to read the values of these matched groups before the get or post is called

8334889
min	max
the results of this method will commonly be a list of max values and min values with maybe 1 or 2 values inbetween

8334889
min	max
because of this there is a slight optimisation in there using abs which will prevent the iterator constantly trying to find min values counting down from max and vice versa

8334889
min	max
for this code s example it will basically always take away either max or min depending on which bound the value is closer to untill some non min or max value is left over as remainder

8334934
children	parent
scenario i have a parent checkbox that is all of the children are unchecked the parent should be

8334941

i need the constructor in my subclassing to call the inherited constructor in my superclass

8335319

addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

8335361
onresume	onpause
the most common way to register unregister broadcastreceivers is to use the onresume and onpause methods of your activity

8335365
multiplying	addition
due to the formalized and predictable nature of 2d arrays indexing into only requires a single multiplying operation and a single addition operation

8335389
src	attr
problem is everytime i use img attr src new_path its downloading new image not from cache

8335402
free	malloc
i am likely to be using more than 1 byte of memory because malloc is likely to be using some memory on its own to keep track of free blocks in the heap and it may effectively cost me some memory by always aligning allocations along certain boundaries

8335420
post	get
additionally the other post that i have read mentioned that a simple get request ought not to be preflighted

8335701
hide	show
stuff that in to a sub with a param that lets you say if you want to hide or show

8335736
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
it looks like you re using the single_table inherited strategy but explicitly splitting off some properties in the subclassing into separate tables rather than using the joined-subclass strategy

8335762
put	get
to get all of them you should put this in a loop

8335766
sudo	passwd
it d also be ideal for them to enter their sudo passwd

8335766
sudo	passwd
this in turn uses sudo to call the real script which will prompt auser for their passwd

8335789
versioning	upgrade
specify the newest versioning that is out at the time you start your project but upgrade them only with care

8335813
superclass	subclassing
only those subclassing were ever serialized before - never the superclass

8335813
superclass	subclassing
the superclass nor any of the subclassing however implements readobject or writeobject and none of the subclassing had an explicitly defined serialversionuid

8335813
superclass	subclassing
despite all this things were fine as far as reading back previously serialized objects until a new instance variable a list arraylist along with a new method was added to the superclass and some private instance variables were added to one of its subclassing

8335813
superclass	subclassing
i m assuming this is caused because the default serialversionuid which was used because i didn t declare one in any of the subclassing has now changed due to the changes in the superclass and one subclassing

8335813
superclass	subclassing
nor do i know if i need to add serialverisonuids to all of the subclassing or if readobject and writeobject need to be implemented by each subclassing or if i can just implement them once assuming i need to at all in the superclass

8335837
pop-up	dialog
this dialog will pop-up

8335861

8335883
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
try this code to apply all uinavigationitem uinavigationbar

8335895
post	get
the basic answer is to look into post redirect get but since it is easier to see by example just check the link above

8335912
width	height
they should match however depending on the padding the actual font character has you might have to use a div and set the height width so that it clips

8335958
getter	setter
encapsulation protects member variables from classes by defining getter and setter methods now i was reading that setter must be void but in that case how can i know if the function really set the value passed by argument

8336006
cos	sin
it seems to work fine most of the time but if i try to enter a function cos sin etc. with a value outside of -9 9 the program freezes

8336031
pop-up	dialog
if you have windows uac enabled this will give you the familiar windows pop-up dialog that requests admin privileges

8336087
for-loop	arrays
the reason that the problem goes away when the size of your arrays is changed from 10 to 11 has to do with arraysize being incremented up to 10 in the for-loop above the one causing the problems

8336092
for-loop	loops
your first for-loop should loops through numbers so it makes sense to use the length of numbers in loops constraint

8336092
for-loop	arrays
for the second for-loop you need to traverse the entire tracker arrays so might as well use the length for that tracker.length

8336127
width	height
canvas width height etc

8336191
cpu	affinity
i have a server process that forks many child processes server process has affinity to cpu core i don t want that affinity to be inherited by child process rather os should handle where to run these processes

width	height
swing components have no width or height until they ve been rendered

8336424
mp4	h.264
these days you should be good if you use h.264 for the video and aac for the audio and use an mp4 container

8336424
ffmpeg	libavformat
as far as libraries i think libavcodec and libavformat from the ffmpeg project are the most complete

8336424
mp4	h.264
with these libs you can encode h.264 aac mp4 files assuming the licensing problem doesn t affect you

8336448
width	height
for now i m using the following css declaration which scales the width correctly but tends to blow out the height of larger images in the ios webview

8336462

hide	show
then i used some simple jquery to show and hide each page and set up some simple javascript functions to show each individual page

8336720
for-loop	loops
overall tip for browser applications is do not use console.log in production for-loop based applications specially the ones that need to update a graphical interface within loops

8336726
boost	stl
the reason you never see this in stuff like stl or boost is because you are not modifying those files

8336783
getter	setter
it is however laborious since i have to create uicomponent properties getter and setter and bind them in the form with binding attributes

8336807
post	get
i have seen some post in stackoverflow saying sending list of items in the get method is not allowed

8336815
post	get
joomla and your php might get upset if jquery is appending the post url with extra stuff because that is there

8336836

am thinking about build all my app for a certain device with a fixed dimensions like motorola droid say that the button will be 50 width 50 height

8336854
width	height
error jcarousel no width height set for items

8336854
width	height
this is usually fixed by either explicitly defining the width or height of the item in html or css whichever is appropriate for the element or using the init option itemfallbackdimension when initializing jcarousel in your javascript file

8336854
width	height
the itemfallbackdimension will be the width if your carousel is horizontal or height if it is vertical iirc

8336873
width	height
in the attribute inspector set the x y width and height which you would like to set for your view

8336903

maven	pom.xml
a little bit deeper explanation is that in previous versions of guava jsr305 was included in the guava jar but this release they took it out and dependency on it does appear in the maven pom.xml of the lib but was not well documented on the web site

8337158
getter	setter
i am trying to automatize the getter and setter methods in my javabean

8337158
getter	setter
since method and field naming conventions are described for beans naming convention there has to be a way to use this conventions in-order to avoid the boiler plate code such as writing getter and setter methods for every bean

8337158
getter	setter
though eclipse do provides a way to generate getter and setter methods without explicitly writing them using annotations would make the code much more cleaner and readable

mouse	keyboard
specifically while your code is in a loop processing doevents you should be actively suppressing user input reading and discarding mouse and keyboard events otherwise the user of your application will be able to interact with your application to invoke menu commands etc but your application will not be processing these commands while waiting

8337926

8337926
profiling	debugging
you can debugging this further with dependency walker running in profiling mode

8337936
cpu	processors
parallel processing is by far a more strict mode of execution of the code-units tasks threads... than just a concurrent run of code-execution simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually absolutely independent computational units

8340110
width	height
i have horizontal scrollview size of 320 width and 40 pixel height

8340115
width	height
i wouldn t think there would be a performance issue in the same way as not specifying height and width on a img tag since that forces the browser to repaint the whole page and that s where the performance issue is

8340126
width	height
you shouldn t care unless you work for google about the performance penalty you d get from not specifing a width height but more about the layout flickering you might get

8340126
width	height
not specifing a width and height will make the browser display an initial box as it doesn t know beforehand how much space the image will take and after the image is loaded it will do a reflow - which means it will have to recalculate the layout of some elements which will be affected by the size change

8340149
google-chrome	firefox
the solution works fine in ie9 firefox and google-chrome but it ie8 still does the browser s default selection highlighting the text

uiswipegesturerecognizer is for detecting a discrete swipe gesture - it only fires your action one time after a swipe has completed - so if youre asking about the offset or distance the finger moved you d probably want to look at creating a subclass of uigesturerecognizer or using uipangesturerecognizer to get continuous gesture info

width	height
i m suspecting that you read maximum width and height as maximum size which it isn t

8343892
width	height
for a resize_to_min implementation that would only enforce minimum dimensions for your width and height you can take resize_to_limit as base and just modify the geometry setting to minimumgeometry to create a custom processor

8344269
getter	setter
if you re using so-called dot-syntax self.myvariable it means you re calling a getter or setter of the property which is actually a selector sending to an object instance which is pretty heavy within objective-c run-time

8344269
getter	setter
call for getter setter when you really need them

8344278
put	get
i need to get url from webview and put it to webadress and from webview2 and put it to webadress2

8344281
getter	setter
i would create an abstract class called baseieexporter or something and then provide a couple or more instance variables and their getter and setter methods within like name filename

8344288
getter	setter
the idea with getter setter is so that you can change the internal workings of the class without breaking other code that depends on it

8344296
implements	extends
extends the built-in observable class is a rather bad choice to implements the observer pattern as it disrupts your class hierarchy but you know that already

8344343
hash	hmac
to crack an hmac you have to brute force secret using the the authentication code the hash part of the message

8344351

nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring thus any method called on nsmutablestring can be expected to work appropriately and return an nsmutablestring when it makes sense

8344363
initializer	class-method
this is why your initializer methods return id rather than a concrete instance and why all class-method should use instead of

rpyc	pyro
vpy has native python capabilities similar to pyro and rpyc via a general native objects layer code example

8344518
setinterval	settimeout
one thing i will note is that you have used a settimeout and really just engineered it to behave like setinterval

8344518
setinterval	settimeout
i m no js engine guru but i would like to think the constant reuse of settimeout has to have some effect on performance that would not be present using setinterval which you only need to set once

8344518
setinterval	settimeout
related stack question - settimeout vs setinterval

8344549
innodb	myisam
make sure you know what is innodb myisam memory and other engines

8344579
width	height
i want all the menus to be the same height or within a wrapper of fixed height width

8344586
stdout	stderr
if it fails silently try redirecting stdout and stderr to a file from your crontab call and post the result

8344587
children	parent
a safe solution is to store the children as boost shared_ptr and store the parent as a raw pointer

8344590
width	height
the width of the site must be relative to the screen resolution and the height as well

8344606
oncreate	ondestroy
i want that my application adds all the fragments when my activity is created oncreate and remove it when my activity die ondestroy but if i try to do this when i rotate my device my app crash and log tells me

8344781
primefaces	richfaces
2 you can look at the log in primefaces if you re not running richfaces or a heavy jquery implementation

8344813
children	parent
i can see why children cannot be allowed to delete a parent node but i don t understand why you would want to disallow deletion of a child

8344849
terminate	timeout
there should also be a timeout on the whole process of two hours and a timeout of 2 minutes on the killed event in case it gets stuck at which point i would like to be able to unload it forcing any threads to terminate which is what kill should do anyway

8344898
getter	setter
i have tried to make those two action classes extend the same base class unfortunately struts 2 seem to ignore setter getter of parent classes and you can t use generic types either because again struts 2 won t know which class to instantiate and give to the setter in action classes

8344898
getter	setter
this is why i say struts 2 ignores setter getter in parent class

8344913
ssl	https
in addition iâ ve been told that if i had an ssl certificate then i wouldnâ t need to do this but instead create and set an http header with cache-control no-cache which would ultimately make all my https pages not cached

8344917
integer	fractions
i have a dictionary with integer values and want to replace each value with the fractions of the total of all values eg.

8344926
equals	tostring
you might consider adding delegating equals hashcode and tostring

knowing this you should be able to search for that square pattern within the pixel data of the image you are parsing to figure out the top left width and height of the qr code with a bit of simple logic parsing

8344972
width	height
q1- i want to create an overlay between the myresult content and the current page with a div with a width 100 and height 100

8344991

objectoutputstream	printwriter
read the javadoc about buffering and use flush on printwriter and objectoutputstream when you want to get sure that the bytes get written on the socket

8345134
cos	sin
why use sin instead of cos or tan

check out unit circle on wikipedia for more information about information about why sin cos

8345140
ant	jdepend
i am currently using a jdepend task in ant to achieve this but i m thinking there must be a better tool for that sort of thing

8345141
pull	push
the server-side clone needs to have the same history as the the local repository or it will pull and push all of the change sets and be a time consuming mess of resolving non-existent conflicts

hide	show
this code helped me to show only two rows and hide all other rows

8345190

x86	64bit
as an alternative to putting the 64bit dll in windows system32 and the 32-bit one in windows syswow64 i have found that it also works if you put the 32-bit one in a subdirectory of program files x86 and the 64bit one in the corresponding subdirectory of program files with both of those subdirectories included in path

8345394
versioning	upgrade
the only thing i can recall that i changed recently was upgrade my git versioning

8345399
postgresql	mysql
is there any situation when this pattern will fail in a mysql postgresql environment

8345455

8345460
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great when i m on the page tab in ie firefox and google-chrome

8345460

pull	push
essentially i want to pull data from a website and upon the date of the event execute a push notification that lets the user know an event is going on that day

8345585
min	max
a possible workaround would be to wire the itemdatabound event of radchart and keep track of the min and max value plotted available through e.seriesitem.yvalue

8345585
min	max	range	min	range	max
then depending on their values compared to the baselinevalue you can decide whether to keep the autoscale feature that would be if baselinevalue is between min and max or set autoscale to false and manually define the axis range so that the marked zone is visible.

8345587
google-chrome	firefox
i found a bug with google-chrome and ie that doesn t exist in firefox

8345587
google-chrome	firefox
the first space is not ignored in firefox but it is in google-chrome

8345615

it means that for every property you should have getter and setter so in gridbagconstraint we don t have getter for values that you need

8345661
wordpress	joomla	magento	joomla
a correct answer would say no magento is not an unusual php mysql application scaling it to 10 000 users is only trivially different from scaling drupal wordpress or joomla

16-bit	64bit
8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit signed two s-complement integers

8345735
width	height
simply set the height to auto that should fix the problem because div are block elements so they stretch out to full width and height of any element contained in it

8345802
for-loop	arrays
now about the storing the department information problem- if you have a limited number of departments there s a pretty easy way to do that- you can store each department s employees in a different string arrays all of them can be stored in the same xml file and then simply go throw each arrays and for-loop within a for-loop and save each employee with its department key

8345857
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
solution has to be reasonably cross-browser compatible ie9+ safari google-chrome firefox

8345863
getter	setter
this way you re actually using the getter setter methods defined by attr_accessor within your class

8345902

8346086
children	parent
profiles do not own their e-mails as such and to implement logic either in your repository or attached to the nhibernate session that will remove all references of the child emails to their parent profile then save all the children as orphan records before deleting the profile

hide	show
i need to be able to show hide these lists using javascript

8346152
hide	show

just query the width and height of the device

8346573
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy instead of strcpy

8346579
mouse	keyboard
basically behind the scenes of the windows gui is a message loop which is a two-way communication between the windows os which knows about the mouse keyboard and other input hardware and your program which doesn t need to know the specifics but does need to be responsive to user input within your app based on these input devices

8346581
folder	dir
the dependency will not appear in the lib dir of the web-inf folder in the target build dir

8346729
put	get
if what you are trying to accomplish is to get your parameters activated before the script shows the widget - the default one looks like a sidebar whereas your parameters make it more of a banner then just make sure you put your parameters above the stuff

8346798
put	get
if this logic is not critical you d better put the template into resources and get it using staticresource

8346819
post	get
i m looking for the solution once i get it i will try not to forget to post it in here

8346863
hide	show
i need a code that show and hide a text when you click on a certain sentence

8346872
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox and ie it looks perfect but i ve noticed that on google-chrome and opera when you resize the browser window the widths get broken and the larger images sometimes get a larger width than the 6 element grid

8346872
opera	google-chrome
i know opera and google-chrome don t get along well calculating decimal values on percentage widths but i was expecting that the box-sizing parameter would fix all of that

8346876
post	get
so for example when you type in an answer in stackoverflow don t post it but press something else you ll get a dialog saying this page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved

unistd.h	dirent.h
in main.c i have included unistd.h dirent.h sys stat.h and list.h

8346960
width	height
however i think if you want to get something like what you are describing then you need to set explicit width and height to the svg element

8346960

i want it to filter my table according to 2 parameters min and max but i want to be able to specify one parameter both or even none

8360202
int	boolean
bool to int is not a problem so the existing code that passes boolean will continue to work

8360253
scikit-learn	libsvm
clarification when i say this is far too slow... i mean that even the libsvm under-the-hood code that scikit-learn uses is too slow

8360257

width	height
both height and width of the red box is dynamic and different from box to box

8360394
vbscript	jscript
it only has an implicit dependency on the installed jscript or vbscript engine dll

8360401
width	margin
to account for variable width in the red box add another wrapper div around the the red box width position absolute and bottom 0 and width 100 - then remove the position absolute from the red box letting it center itself with the margin 0 auto

8360501
implements	extends
your object is a you car which extends bmwcars implements lexus interface

8360506

when i put the user input part above the create a new movie part like it is right now i get this

8360537
maven	m2e
the maven eclipse plugin is not the same thing as the m2e plugin for eclipse which i m assuming you are trying to use

8360537
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
m2e works very differently and instead uses the pom.xml files when you import projects as maven plugins

8360592
cvs	svn
i want to migrate from cvs to svn by using cvs2svn tool

8360592
cvs	svn

8360626
nsuinteger	nsmutablearray
try using an nsmutablearray and - void replaceobjectatindex nsuinteger index withobject id anobject

8360640
post	get
most of the communication between the two can be accomplished with http requests using the standard get and post methods

8360645
post	get
if you are passing back json or xml then the client just needs to make the appropriate http call most likely get perhaps post to actually retrieve the information

8360654
dbcontext	objectcontext
create a new class that inherits from objectcontext - instanciate it along side the dbcontext using the same entityconnection

8360667
min	max
max min will not work

8360676

i read some other forums and they reinstalled pigeonhole but i m trying to avoid this as i installed through iredmail which requires a clean install without apache mysql dovecot postfix ldap etc

8360678
hide	show
when calling my datatrigger i would like to run a predicate on the list and return a value true false so i can hide show text

8360688
min	max
min and max work fine with dates

8360697
min	max
of course the min and max works

8360704
mouseover	mouseout
i am adding classes and manipulating the css with mouseover and mouseout

8360704
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari everything works fine but in ie8 it seems to flicker between the classes

8360709
screens	tablet
keep in mind that a lot of modern desktop pcs these days have touch screens so even detecting touch support does not guarantee that it is a mobile device or tablet

8360769
children	parent
you were close with your first example you need to specify that you are hiding all of the children of the parent div except for the .donthide one like this

8360777
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however the text placement is different between firefox and safari google-chrome

8360790
dependencyobject	uielement
so you should have the above accept a dependencyobject or uielement instead of a dataclass

8360808
children	parent	mouseover	mouseout
when the mouse goes over an element nested within the top level li it s not actually over the parent element anymore its over the children so it sends the mouseout but the mouse over bubbles up from the child element to the parent li which makes it flicker back into it s mouseover state

8360808
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
try looking into mouseenter and mouseleave as opposed to mouseover and mouseout

8360812
post	get
the blog gets a decent amount of traffic and most post get 10-30 likes 5-10 shares and any number of comments on facebook

8360830
fseek	ftell
it is tantamount to determining the size of a file by reading the whole thing in and counting the bytes one by one one should use stat fstat or fseek and ftell instead

8360830
disk	ram
one more thing on systems with virtual memory the free store that you are trying to measure may be closer to the size of the system swap file on disk than the amount of physical ram installed and the state of other processes on the system will also affect the value measured by successive allocations

8360853
min	max	range	min	range	max
now it s a simple select with min and max to turn it back into range

8360910
button	checkbox
the view displays a home button for going back to the main menu a checkbox for marking a problem for later a math problem in a uilabel and a get answer button

8360910
button	checkbox
the marked button with not text that sits on top of two .pngs that i switch between via .hidden depending on the state of the checkbox i hide one then display the other and vice versa

8360956
google-chrome	safari
this issue is not specific to google-chrome as i could reproduce it in google-chrome 15.0.874.121 for macintosh as well as safari 5.1.2

8360972
fast-forward	merge
results in a merge commit with its first parent set to the commit referenced by master and the second parent set to the commit referenced by some-branch i don t take into account fast-forward and conflicted merge here

8360995
jboss	weblogic
i haven t dealt with weblogic much or jboss at all so i don t know how it deals with unzipped war stuff

8361027
client-side	server-side
php is server-side and javascript is client-side

8361076
width	height
as you can see pixels are drawn with different width and height

8361087
stdout	stderr
now both will work normally but if you try to redirect only one of the stderr or stdout ansiterm will output ansi codes to screen and redirected output

8361130
post	get
post the results of free -m and ulimit -a on the remote machine to get more data

8361130
free	malloc
if you distrust yout your provider to be using some troyanized htop free and ulimit you can test the real available memory with a simple c progran where you allocate with malloc 70 80 of your available ram and assigning random bytes on it in no more than 10 lines of ansi c code

8361139
google-chrome	firefox
i have been able to code a css sprite menu that renders well in firefox and google-chrome but does not even display in ie

8361158
sqoop	hadoop
you can use sqoop to import data from rdbms to hadoop

8361168
pbkdf2	hash
then use bcrypt with a cost factor of 16 or more or pbkdf2 with 64k iterations or more to hash the password at the server

8361189
domxpath	domdocument
you can use domdocument with domxpath

8361191

it is optimized for mobile 300 tablet 748 web 978 and 1218 and big screens 1378

8361262
plot	heatmap
i made a plot using matplotlib similar to a heatmap

8361278
google-chrome	firefox
i assume firefox google-chrome would have better performance than other browsers for innerhtml tag

8361285
for-loop	arrays
that means you have an arrays with ten spaces and for the last part of your for-loop you were trying to access which doesn t exist

8361288
children	parent
i think that will only show the details for one parent and its children

8361302
google-chrome	safari
also set translatez 0px for all elements you want to move as translate3d is only used for safari and google-chrome enables hardware acceleration

8361303
png	ico
-- disclaimer ico to png not working right now --

8361326
hash	salt
the additional security to prevent this would require that you first hash the password to match how the server has it hash so including the salt and then hash that with a server provided randomly generated token that the server also remembers in the session

8361326
hash	salt
regardless of how the password is transmitted you should only store a salt hash version of the password in your database

8361326
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
ideally using a per user salt that you store as well and a secure hash function sha-2 for instance instead of sha-1 or md5

8361349
initializer	class-method
services and daos which have dependency requirements can now be initializer with no parameters which would break the initializer class-method but i had to do it to be able to use it as a type parameter

8361420
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
one of the more common reasons for works on simulator but not device is that you are reading from a file and use the wrong case -- device has case-sensitive file systems but macs have case-insensitive typically

8361541
stdout	fflush
so you need to either fflush theâ output stream using hflush after executing putstr or you need to change stdout s buffering mode using hsetbuffering to not use line buffering

8361555
width	height
i want to measure the height of the text given a certain width of available canvas

8361647
tcplistener	tcpclient
this functionality is introduced by the tcpclient and server-side the corresponding tcplistener classes

8361716
children	parent
the says to select only the children of parent

8361769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and firefox have their own implementations of the css flexible box module which allows this sort of layout

8361817
int	chars
the expression z + 100 is an addition with arithmetic operands of type chars and int the numeric literal 100 is considered an int in c

8361826
put	get
get the arraylist based on the string key do add to the arraylist and then put it back into the hashmap optional since the map already holds the reference to it

8361871
mouse	keyboard
an element can gain focus via keyboard commands such as the tab key or by mouse clicks on the element

8361882
sorting	filtering
glazedlists sorting and filtering features are much more flexible than the one on jxtable

8361895
int	chars
since you have an expression with chars and int compiler converts chars into int by integral promotion thus sizeof operator will give you size of type int which in your case is 4 bytes

8361928
profiling	debugging
however you should probably use aop-style profiling code instead of baking debugging code into your source

8361929
rss	feed
i have an app that reads about 3-5 rss feed and present the headlines on the ui

8361929
rss	feed
but my code reads the feed one at a time and i would like to read the 3 rss feed at the same to see if i can speed up the parsing process and present the headlines faster on the ui

8361929
rss	feed
and then i repeat this process for the other rss feed

8361964
mapply	grepl
in this case you could use mapply and grepl like this provided you re matching single characters

8362004
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i m using the methods touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended

8362008

i am trying to use some show hide functions in my js file

8362017
awt	swing
i will assume that you are talking about a awt swing application

8362017
awt	swing
swing awt have standardized look and feels but also some that are heavily platform-dependent

8362070
g++	gcc
variable-length arrays are an extension in gcc and g++ .

post	get
post redirect get prg is a common design pattern for web developers

8362187
post	get
using scipy.signal will get the same result as using the method in the original post

8362194
post	get
the activities get handled by the usual multiplechoicefield i used i customized widget to get the checkboxes to display on a table pretty simple but can post it if somebody needs that

8362215
folder	directory
the problem is every time i run tomcat it first unpacks all the wars in its webapps directory into folder thus mywebapp.war gets unpacked to a directory called mywebapp before tomcat finishes starting up

8362242
stdout	stderr
your syntax for directing stdout to one file and stderr to another is correct

8362247
sorting	filtering
the easiest way is adding paging sorting filtering parameters to the method arguments list and adding corresponding linq query operators to your data context query in the service method

8362254
client-side	server-side
however nicolas s answer shows how you can add client-side validation to block typical users from submitting the form and server-side validation to block everything else

8362260
portrait	landscape
i have one table view that is filled from rss i am trying to scroll it to position 9 when the device is in portrait and position 1 when the device is in landscape but i get this error

int	double
i have a programming project that needs to read each line of a tab delimited text file and extract a string double values and int values

8362301
children	parent
typically there is one applicationcontext parent and 0..n dispatcherservlets children

8362317
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie opera google-chrome runs animations well but in firefox animation is too slow i tried with different computers and still same

8362317
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i might have had some errors about positioning divs with jquery codes or changing a lot of margins at the same may be reason for some lag but as i said it was happening only in firefox not ie opera or google-chrome

8362324
min	max
that gives you o log n operations for both delete min and delete max which should help you achieve your goal

8362333
rss	feed
i m trying to pull user answers from quora s rss feed using the google feed api

8362412
put	get
to put text on a specific row you can use getlinestartoffset to get the position of the beginning of the desired row and then pass that value into insert string int

8362430
factors	matrix
a common factors of 10 9 was factored out of every entry in your matrix

8362470

children	parent
a component is valid when it is correctly sized and positioned within its parent container and all its children are also valid

8362551
children	parent
a component is valid when it is correctly sized and positioned within its parent container and all its children are also valid

8362570
width	height
have a jframe that would display multiple mypanel in a vertical stack and have its height change accordingly depending on the number of mypanel s added to it width of the jframe width of mypanel

8362637
client-side	server-side
our solution was to serialize everything into json client-side then send just a single json object back up and handle the heavy lifting server-side

8362652
tpagecontrol	ttabsheet
using the example provided here how to implement a close button for a ttabsheet of a tpagecontrol combined with setting a forms parent to a tab sheet with matching caption i was able to take my pagecontrol with forms attached as ttabsheet and add a close button and image from an image list much like you see on today s web browsers

8362686
opera	google-chrome
the client output is identical on opera and google-chrome and is

8362705
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
select your groupcontroller from the dropdownlistfor and check the checkbox to bind personscontroller to groupcontroller

8362705
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
i think you can replace the groupcontroller - which is a plain nsarraycontroller - with an nstreecontroller

8362708
width	height
the body should also be width 100 and height 100

8362733
onresize	onload
when i call the function using onload it works fine it just doesn t fire when using the onresize event

8362765
http	spdy
amazon kindle fire may be using spdy for http traffic through their silk proxy

8362798
crypt	salt
you could just as easily use php s crypt function and pass the appropriate salt to force the function to use blowfish

8362798
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
as you can see the salt is included in the output from the call to crypt so when you need to check something against the hash you need to retrieve the hash first from the file or database where it s stored to pull out the salt

8362874
folder	directory
uses system.io s directory and directoryinfo classes to create folder delete folder and recursively copy folder from one location to the next

8362882
int	boolean
the + 0 will just convert from boolean back to int

8362896
post	get
2 post the list of invitees over to my server which would make the call to fb to get the friends and construct and return the list of user names

8362918
vcard	vcalendar
my app generates the codes that contain a link to a well known type file either vcard or vcalendar that are at variable directories on the server for example

8362918
vcard	vcalendar
most qr readers android i-nigma qrreader etc will correctly deal with a vcard or vcalendar download

8362918
vcard	vcalendar
while i can embed the data of the vcard or vcalendar into the qr code directly it would be better to have the file on a web server with a url to that file in the qr code

8362936
post	get
check out this post for an example of how to get the invoice ids

8362939
post	put	post	get	put	get
unfortunately you can t send put request with xhr from browser environment only get and post methods are valid across browsers

8362939
post	put
key here is _method put in data object this way you can override actual http method in this case post

8362941
post	get
i would like this var impressions get all impressions related to these 6 last post i show in my page

8362955
nsexpression	nspredicate
cocoa defines predicate classes nspredicate nsexpression etc. which provide a general means of specifying queries in cocoa predicate programming

8362996
crash	exc-bad-access
while for the most part everything still runs perfectly well all web pages load correctly and when i purposefully turn-off my airport to test things reachability catches it gracefully - i do now get inexplicable crash at odd times with the dreaded exc-bad-access error..

8363078
firefox	safari
there was absolutely no perceptual difference in the rendering in either safari 5 for mac or firefox 8 for mac

8363090
rss	feed
come back to your topic you can always pre-analyse your problem set and split scale them into sub-set for example total 100 rss feed can be split into 5 chunks with each perform 20 rss feed in sequence then feed these pre-processed sub-sets into 5 asynctask

8363090
rss	feed
this will gives you 5 asynctask running asynchronously and probably get 5 times faster than using 1 aysnctask download 100 rss feed

8363090
rss	feed
note that it is also possible create asynctask per each rss feed which imo is a very bad practice as if your problem set is big it will eat up you memory and kill system quickly

8363126
jtextfield	jlabel
2nd frame contains two jtextfield for input two values and one jbutton will sum the given values and return it to first frame or print it to jlabel of 1st frame

8363133
getter	setter
item should just be a domain type object with a few auto getter and setter properties

8363176

8363185
children	parent
i have 2 parent classes a c and 2 children b d

8363206
hash	md5
forgot to hash inside function also changed to sha1 instead of md5

8363210
gdk	cairo
you have gtkmm-2.4 friends for windows but you lack gtk+-2.0 no gtk+-2.0.pc file and all its dependencies pango cairo gdk atk glib...

8363246
joptionpane	jdialog
instead that second frame should be a modal dialog such as a jdialog or a joptionpane

8363315
hash	hmac
we would like to use an hmac authentication scheme as described here and here but both examples seem to fall apart when describing how to validate the hash

8363327
folder	directory
when you attempt to do cross-repository movement of files moving a directory from the old working copy into the new working copy will place .svn folder of one working copy into the other working copy

8363327
folder	directory
since these folder contain bits of the subversion working copy configuration for the directory you effectively mix up configurations in one working copy

8363352
cpu	processors
however when you write a mex-file you compile it directly in the cpu language such that it can be run directly by the processors

8363398
width	height
no or - just pure tag with given width and height attributes

8363447
button	checkbox
first of all you should better use radio button instead of checkbox

8363461
single-quotes	double-quotes
and use single-quotes for string literals not double-quotes

8363464
width	height
however i would like to know how to increase the height width on the file input field tried basic css on the file but it only increases the browse button size and not the actual field where you can drop the file into

8363468
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and newer versions of ie have inspectors that could help you without the need to write any code of your own

8363471
gif	png
image_type type of image png jpg gif .....

8363505
boost	allocator
boost format uses allocator as far as i know so it could suffer from this

8363509
prepare	execute
you can do what you want in a stored procedure if you concatenate the parts of the sql query together as a string and then prepare and execute that string as an sql statement

8363515
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome or firefox press f12 this will bring up the inspector

8363532
bash	zsh
that s a normal standard shell zsh bash younameit prompt one that tramp will understand

8363606
lwjgl	slick2d
i ve been delving into game programming with slick2d and i ve began to wonder if in the long run knowing lwjgl would be more helpful

8363606
lwjgl	slick2d
on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities

8363630
strsplit	substr
you ll want to parse the file path that file.choose spits back using string manipulation functions like substr or strsplit

8363686
salt	md5
and unless your required to use unsalted md5 it may be wise to add a salt

8363691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it ignores the file path and works correctly on ie and google-chrome but i get an incorrect file alert regardless when using this in firefox or safari

8363692
loops	while-loop
another and better in this case is the while-loop that works the same but checks the while-part before the first loops

8363804
post	get
the method attribute specifies the submission type get or post but you ve used the type attribute...and this is incorrect

8363959
org.json	jackson
and surprise surprise if you go with some more modern classes like jackson or just the latest sources from org.json you will be able to get around both these constraints without a problem a later android runtime also seems to have some utility classes for json pull-parsing

8363972
chunked	transfer-encoding
it seems i can click on the request on the left panel then choose on fiddler right bottom panel click on transformer tab uncheck chunked transfer-encoding and click no compression

8363974
free	strdup
note that you must free all the pointers you get back from strdup

8364024
xslt	xquery
is there any good reason why you can t do it in xslt or xquery

8364038
subtract	add
the reason why i add or subtract the width rather than setting the x coordinate directly to 0 or width is that the character may be moving faster than 1 pixel per frame

8364043
maven	cargo
rest api that tools like maven s cargo plug-in can leverage to

8364076
glut	glfw
i m switching from glut to glfw to find that when i re-size my glfw window the rendering region does not change

8364104
post	get
reading through several post i understand that gallery does not recycle but i don t think that it should be creating every single item from the get go

8364130
google-chrome	firefox
it does the same thing in both firefox and google-chrome

8364212
post	get
from the research that i ve done i think this would be possible using alarmmanager but i ve read in another post android alarmmanager not being very reliable that it s not very reliable and the events could potentially get cancelled

8364225
versioning	upgrade
there is a versioning available in later versioning and online with minimal compatibility upgrade

8364227
addclass	removeclass
instead of setting the class directly to those strings it s better to construct your own addclass and removeclass functions

8364245
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m somewhat surprised that works in safari firefox and google-chrome

8364247
min	max
the sequence will begin and end at an arbitrary point each day so min and max would differ upon each run

8364313
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i made it work successfully on firefox and safari but on google-chrome buffered event behaves strange.

8364332

8367832
children	parent
line 14 is reached by 4 processes the original parent its both children and the first child of the first child of the original parent

8367832
children	parent
this means that some of the fork s will be executed not only by the original parent but also by its children creating a cascade of new processes

you could also call getsystemmetrics with sm_cxscreen and sm_cyscreen to get the width and the full height of the screen but in this case the bottom edge of your window would be hidden by the taskbar.

8368245
int	chars
im trying to start at the back of the chars array navigating using pointers and output each chars as an int up to the first element

hide	show
which as you can guess hide and show div boxes

8368420
post	get
second analyze the packet trace in detail and collect every http header and every http payload from every get and post message sent by the browser

8368428
wxpython	textctrl
i am currently developing an application in wxpython one of its main parts is to accept c code through multiline textctrl and it would be good if entered c code could be syntax highlighted

8368473
folder	dir
if they are requesting giraffesinafrica.domain.com the dir should be set to system a folder in base path

8368512
getter	setter
in c# there is a nice syntax sugar for fields with getter and setter

8368523
getter	setter
whenever you find your interface just passing through member elements getter and setter think again

8368531
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it with firefox 8 google-chrome 15.0 and ie9

8368546
width	height
you can instead use the panel s width and height

8368563
ubuntu	linux
it should run on ubuntu linux as well as on windows too

8368606
post	get
when i try the same thing on google chrome it did not sent it as post instead as a get so the parameter did not sent to the server

8368621
ontouchevent	ondraw
i override only ontouchevent and ondraw function

8368627
getter	setter
you can emulate getter and setter to some extent by having a member of dedicated type and overriding operator type and for it

8368665
postgresql	mysql
from postgresql na mysql

8368665
postgresql	mysql
replace the mysql jdbc driver in the classpath with the postgresql jdbc driver

8368665
postgresql	mysql
update the jdbc connection url to point to postgresql db instead of mysql db

8368665
getter	setter
if necessary also update the entity the custom javabean class which you have to represent one row of the db to remove the property and getter setter

8368686
cpu	hyperthreading
i just run the executable on a quad-core intel cpu with hyperthreading and i obtain the following output

8368687
cpu	processors
to put it simply i think it s because openmp looks for the number of cpu s cores rather than the number of processors threads

8368824
migrate	upgrade
when a 1.7 compatible release of xcode becomes available it should then be safe to upgrade your client to 1.7 and migrate your working copy again

8368849

8368966
sudo	passwd
i have used sudo apt-get install for that and i want to pass the user supplied passwd to sudo like this

8368966
sudo	passwd
the input passwd is not being passed to sudo

8368998
sudo	passwd
but sudo provides an optione -s which read the passwd from standard input and not from the terminal

8368998
sudo	passwd
sudo will ask for the passwd itself if it requires one

8368998
sudo	passwd
and since sudo keeps a timestamp for that input it will not ask for the passwd the next 15 minutes by default configurable

8369067
width	height
the height of each absolutely positioned div is half the height of the circle and the width of each div is half the width of the circle

is the controller only evaluating the get or post to call the correct method of the model

8369087
versioning	upgrade
so i upgrade jquery to versioning 1.7.1

8369088
width	height
what you did there is having a textview which is set to fill_parent in both the width and the height

8369088
width	height
you can change the width and height of the textview to wrap_content for starters which should make the button visible

8369220
subtract	add
you could add or subtract the countifs in one line of code and avoid the intermediate step

8369220
addition	multiplication
note that in the formula above multiplication creates an and operation and addition creates and or operation

8369252
google-chrome	safari
i ve tried google-chrome safari and mobile safari

8369256
for-loop	loops
on the second loops instead of using a c-style for-loop use a foreach loops

8369258
width	height
i know how to override a setter such as width or height but can t find any info on overriding a specific property

8369308
sat	np-complete
and encode it as a substitution problem such that a solution to the substitution problem would produce an assignment of t f to the variables making the equation produce true if you could solve the substitution problem you could solve sat it is np-complete

8369328
free	malloc
the only features of c++ i m using is classes to encapsulate data and methods but that can be done as well with structs and functions i m using new and delete but could as well use malloc and free and i m using inheritance just for callbacks which could be achieved with pointers to functions

8369362
inherited	properties
since all default inherited properties are not plain arrays mostly host objects or functions the array.isarray check is sufficient

8369374
post	get
if using the method in this post override int getitemposition object object to return position_none i ll get

8369382
folder	directory
now add the files to the appropriate folder and then add the main directory to your project by dragging it in to xcode

that makes it possible to access the storage allocated for the double as int

8369456
int	boolean
in mysql false is not a boolean value it s an int more specifically zero

8369456

in fact mysql does not have boolean column types it has bool and boolean but they re mere aliases for tinyint

8369468
super	abstract	super	extends
as info all those sort class extends a super abstract class sorting

8369491
hide	show
you can access that view from sharedapplication of appdelegate and you can show and hide that view

8369491
hide	show
you can use that as to show and hide your view with specific time given

8369541
setinterval	settimeout
javascript provides the settimeout and setinterval functions to run actions at a set time in milliseconds

8369550
boost	stl
i think it may be a boost issue because stl works fine in my objc class

8369552
mouseover	mouseout
for one thing you only have one function in the hover meaning it will executed whatever is in it for both mouseover and mouseout actions

8369611
google-chrome	firefox
this now works in firefox and google-chrome but ie9 returns a no transport error like it didn t try to make the request

8369615
width	height
it was a very stupid mistake which led to use of wrongly initialized values for width and height of the texture

8369623
mouse	keyboard
or visibility hidden can t receive mouse or keyboard event

8369647
maven	pom.xml
the servers that maven contacts must be configured in your maven project pom.xml file under a section like

if your ide know about maven it will parse the pom.xml and either download the dependencies itself or ask maven to do so

8369662
folder	directory
my index.html file is in a folder called documentation html in the resources directory

8369678

it works but the problem when i leave the page and stay out for maybe 40 sec in google-chrome and 1-2 min in firefox it make s all img visible

8369708
int	double
double and int to a fixed-width size that is hard-coded in the code

8369708
int	double
cast the double and int to a string so i can enforce the maximum width

8369710
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
in ie opera google-chrome safari the background of the some text cell does not fill the containing cell

8369723
post	put
there is absolutely no difference between post and put except different name used in request

8369746
int	double
if you want your int and double to have a certain length then i suggest you use numberformat to format your numbers instead of cutting off their string representation

8369747
ubuntu	debian
the profile module is part of standard python and is different from cprofile as it is implemented purely in python but ubuntu doesn t install it by default likely because of its debian lineage

8369775
ubuntu	debian
python says profile should always exist in a python installation but there are some license problems that kept it from being included in debian s and thus in ubuntu s main universe repositories

8369775
ubuntu	debian
it s probably best to tell your debian ubuntu users to install python-profiler manually

8369808
opera	firefox
this should work in firefox and opera at least

8369821
subtract	add
you say that when updating the state you add four rather than two and subtract the output of the neuron itself

realloc	malloc
to use realloc you must either use a null pointer or a pointer that points to memory that was assigned by malloc

8370034
post	get
i did not want to post this question since there are so many post already about json parsing in jquery but i cannot seem to get it work

8370043
jar	war
in a .ear file my ejbs are copied in several jar and war for some technical constraints

8370043
jar	war
the problem is jboss cannot find the persistence configuration for the classes within the jar myjar2 and the war

8370075
setinterval	settimeout
for what it s worth it s generally advisable to use a recursive settimeout instead of a setinterval

8370213
google-chrome	firefox
this works when the canvas is using a 2d context but not when it uses a webgl context in both firefox and google-chrome

8370221
google-chrome	safari
when i view it in ie google-chrome and safari there s only the regular gap that a p and br tag would make

8370229
i2c	spi
which gets into how do i interface a spi or i2c adc

8370229
i2c	spi
if it is just an inductor then you have to add more circuitry if it is a full sensor package with a serial or parallel interface spi i2c rs323 then that is a programming question but you still have to then decide on what microcontroller you want and ask how do i do i2c in an arduino for example of which there are many web pages

8370255
post	get
a controller will be responsible for preparing data to display for rendering and sometimes handle get and post requests that originating from your client

8370255
post	get
often controllers will also be responsible for handling get and post requests that originate from your html client and applying some sort of manipulation back on your database

8370255
post	get
instead of listening traditional events from the ui it can instead react in different ways to future get and post requests

8370306
google-chrome	firefox
the corners are still rounded in firefox and google-chrome

8370339
addition	multiplication
my vector class has functions for addition and scalar multiplication

8370360
google-chrome	firefox
removing this width attribute shows the same behavior in firefox and google-chrome

8370360
google-chrome	firefox
firefox tries to honor the width of this whilst maintaining the float but it seems google-chrome wants to move the fieldset onto a new line due to being block and 95 width

8370372
onfocus	onblur
i m not sure if this is because the code as i have written is not calling the form correctly or if using onblur onfocus values in the form changes the way the jquery should be written

8370387
gif	png
i have had this problem myself here is what i did i hope it will help you as well first determine the biggest image size you would use for example 200x200 then use png or gif images all 200x200 with transparent backgrounds

8370400
width	height
given the code below how is it possible to use a percentage to get width and height

8370424
int	double
my assignment is to write a program that stores an array of five int values 1 2 3 4 and 5 a date object for current time and a double value 5.5

8370447
int	chars
i m trying to make 128 and 256 bit int in c++ and noticed casting to and to int and backwards can be used to convert chars arrays to int and int to chars arrays

8370566
post	get
post events . format action create controller events new_event get

8370595
ciimage	nsimage
i tried to find it in apple docs but there are cgimage nsimage ciimage and more

8370703
hide	show
1 hide content - than make ajax call - on completed ajax show content again

8370703
hide	show
2 hide content with css and show it after ajax call

8370705
post	put	post	get	put	get
this contoller only shows get but put post and delete are fully implemented

8370709
oncreate	setcontentview
setcontentview is designed to be called only once at the beginning of the oncreate method

8370722
int	chars
works all as expected error on emptylist maximum on int and chars as well only the last one is unexpected as it is one of the oddities of working with floating point numbers and rounding errors

8370749
int	double
you are using the union to convert your pair of int into a double with the same bit pattern

8370774
width	height
have a div that covers the width and height of the entire page

8370814
portrait	landscape
i was able to just orient the nib for landscape rather than portrait and that solved the problem

8370863
ubuntu	linux
which is the same for fedora and ubuntu and all other gnu linux distributions

8370877
perl	tcl
komodo edit has support for php python ruby javascript perl tcl xml html css and more

8370878
perl	tcl
komodo edit is a multi-platform free and open-source code editor with support for php python ruby javascript perl tcl xml html css and more

8370924
rss	feed
it sounds like perhaps an rss feed may accomplish what you need if that is an option for publishing content you can provide some authentication requirements for your feed

8370924
post	get
it will be easiest for your ios application to simply send a get post request to your server asking for an update

8370932
post	put
can you try to put your input into and post the results in your question

8370936
for-loop	arrays
i have done most of it and am confused as to how to make the arrays and if any one could take a look at my code to let me know if i have my for-loop set up correctly

8370977
maven	m2e
i am using m2e plugin to work in maven

8371066
udp	tcp
for reliability you would typically build on top of tcp but depending on what you need to do you could design a protocol on udp which will run faster

8371102
post	get
i think the ajax set of methods can speak http get and post so you need to tell it to get the file from a server giving it the url for the server the path part in the error message

8371177
post	put
i ve put 20 because is url is encoded and when i try to perform the post operation with firebug these are the variables sent

8371201
int	double
this is similar logic to the parse vs tryparse methods on int double etc

8371209
put	get
however the result is wrong the elements get all put together instead of being distributed the way i need them to be

8371210
hash	md5
as key you can use a md5 hash of the image file plus the users ip

8371241
actionlink	redirecttoaction
it only works on standard methods like redirecttoaction or actionlink though

8371313
hide	show
then whenever you want the to show and hide the progress just set the visibility to gone visible.i m fairly certain that you can have a transparent background for the progress bar so it will give you just the wheel

8371327
post	get
i need to get with a query a list with all the users in user and for each user the date of the latest post they made and the number of followers they have

8371330
maven	m2e
my last advice is that you should probably check out the maven documentation and start with cli instead of m2e to get a good understanding on what s going on

8371382
minimum	max
2 determine the max personal amount separately then take the minimum of the max personal amount and the max property amount

8371383
jar	war
that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit

8371469
ubuntu	linux
i am using the gcc compiler on ubuntu linux

8371492
nhibernate	automapper
the problem is that even though the destination objects called projectcontract does not contain a list of branches automapper still invokes this collection and a lot of queries are made to the database because nhibernate fires the lazy - loading and loads the branches collection for each project

8371503
hide	show
for my profile type i use a show hide piece of coding to display another div if value 2 is selected in profile type

8371510
gif	png
png gif non-compression-files rises up the size

8371520
hide	show
i ve read previous questions asked about using jquery to show hide multiple elements individually but i haven t been able to modify the code that worked for those users so that it works for my case

8371522
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you want to read object into your program then you have to use objectinputstream not objectoutputstream

8371522
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you may also want to read api docs on objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

8371545
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but it works perfectly in firefox opera and google-chrome

8371570
google-chrome	firefox
neither google-chrome nor firefox indicate any errors

8371587
antialiasing	transparent
this is where it got tough i can t get the directwrite text to render on an alpha-including background without the antialiasing going wrong as foreground text pixels should fade to transparent they instead fade to black

8371587
antialiasing	transparent
explain what grayscale antialiasing is supposed to do and whether it works with transparent bitmap render targets

8371623
google-chrome	firefox
this should show you the error in the console window of firefox or google-chrome console.log will not work in ie and break the script

8371623
google-chrome	firefox
to bring up the console window in firefox or google-chrome press f12

8371668
fts4	fts3
i have noticed that the .jar driver doesn t seem to support fts4 but it does support fts3 and doesn t show indexes in the data structure

8371670
printf	strtok
most likely problem is that your first input line doesn t begin with a lower case letter so you never call strtok in the first place and never assign to either svar or fvar but you still pass those uninitialized values to printf which then gives a segfault.

8371706
post	get
since you android client appears to be getting an article you might consider using a get request as opposed to a post request however the differences are trivial

8371711
pop-up	dialog
then hover over the semi-transparent manage button which you can barely see hidden behind the word extensions perhaps and wait for the pop-up dialog and then click create new module

8371735
inherited	subclassing
unless a subclassing b and i wouldn t do that just for the sake of inherited there s basically no special relationship between a and b so there s no way of doing this i m afraid

8371759
rvm	bundler
it would be even better if you could migrate this application to run with bundler then you don t need to uninstall rails 3.x gem but if it s not possible you can take a look at rvm s gemsets

8371773
width	height
you can add width and height to the drawimage call if you want the user to be able to resize the image just provide some kind of control the change them

8371774
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in google-chrome firefox and shows the selected value correctly

8371798
uiview	subviews
in my app i have added a uiview as a new subviews however it covers up a uisegmentedcontrol

8371828
mouseover	mouseout
unfortunately it captures all events like mouseover and mouseout which my underlying graph usually responds to

8371832
post	put
there was a bug in prestashop version to whose web service i was trying to put post

8371854
post	get
i just found this works for me now but only after changing my requests to get requests instead of post

8371854
post	get
for reasons unknown google returns request_denied for post requests but allows the same request via get

8371854
post	get
if that works then just rewrite your android code to use get instead of post and you should be all set

8371863
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i guess you are talking about serialization using the classes objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

8371867
width	height
but raphael js manually set a width and height directly on your svg elements which kills this technique

8371875
rspec	capybara
i m trying to match a class attribute using capybara with rspec

8371898
pull	push
i also ran into some problems with entering passwords when doing push pull or fetch

8371923
csv	tsv
therefore mathematica s export in the csv tsv and xls formats should work as well

8371956
antlr	parser-generator
i m working on a fairly standard compiler project for which i picked antlr as the parser-generator

8371964
fileoutputstream	filewriter
if you want a text file use a filewriter or an outputstreamwriter wrapping a fileoutputstream if you want to use an encoding different from the default platform encoding

8371973
gif	png
i had issues in the past with showing png s i changed it to a gif or jpg and it worked

8371982
pecl	pear
this should work with any pear or pecl extension

8371985
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
code not working in firefox google-chrome safari

8371993
min	max	range	min	range	max
one item from each pair is a single value the other one is supposed to show a range of values my idea was to plot the mean value with error bars to indicate the range s max and min but i m open to better ideas

8371996
put	get
i want to skip to a record in the access database that the user wants by inputting the id number in a textbox and then the correct row will get put in the textboxes

8372007
getter	setter
if you need to serialize your object and need a empty constructor + setter getter use memento design pattern and make the serialization by using memento of this object

8372019
temp	tmp
you could write to a temp file perhaps in tmp let the libsnd seek to modify the .wav riff header of the temp file and then after libsnd has closed the file stream the temp file out to stdout

8372025
indexof	replaceall
if you want to parse their textual bodies which are essentially string s then you d need to grab string based methods instead such as substring indexof replaceall etc

8372040
int	chars
the former is an array of chars but the latter is just an int

8372045
width	height
the createimage function creates a qgraphicsscene of a given width and height draws at coordinates 0 0 a solid red rectangle of the same width and height as the scene renders this scene to an image and writes the image out to a file

8372045
width	height
i believe that this function should always write out an image that is solid red regardless of the width and height it is given

8372058
put	get
you get the idea you can put them in weatherworker

8372103
ati	nvidia
i have heard of a few solutions such as programing directly on the hardware but while from what i understand ati has released the specifications of there low level api nvidia keeps theirs secret so that wouldn t work too well not to mention the added development time of making different profiles

8372111
tablet	galaxy	tablet	hdpi
my situation is that i have put an image in res drawable hdpi which will be picked up when running on my samsung infuse 4g as well as on my galaxy 10.1 tablet

8372123
getter	setter
a regular objective c property normally causes the compiler to generate code for getter and setter

8372133
put	get
i ve put together some code that shows as close as i can get to the answer

8372149
textarea	textbox
you click an edit button and the values are presented in textarea textbox lovs etc

8372170
width	margin
to centre a div which is display block by default you need to give it a width then margin 0 auto

8372205
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch supports inheritance with exception-handling classes

8372216
client-side	server-side
if you already have a non-js version you can think about if you still need the enhanced version and if you do if you want to re-use the server-side templating you already have coded and tested and need to maintain anyway or duplicate the effort client-side which adds development cost but as you say may provide a superior experience and lower the load on the server although i cannot imagine that fetching rendered data versus fetching xml data makes that much of a difference

8372246
put	get
if you design for the client-side approach it s easy to get carried away and put the processing in the wrong place

8372253
tablet	hdpi
tablet are usually xhdpi not hdpi

8372260
mdpi	hdpi
the samsung infuse is hdpi the galaxy tab 10.1 is mdpi

8372260
screens	tablet
generally games will have resources that are independent of density and just have their game playfield fill the screens and are happy with the result being something larger on a tablet

8372264
min	max
the possible args for min and max are either one iterable or 2 or more scalars

8372276
int	chars
the chars has been explained but i think the most important thing to remember in the int example is that

8372305
int	chars
that is float all flavours of chars and of short int and also .

8372327
calloc	malloc
not using calloc malloc or

8372388
getter	setter
skipping many getter and setter they may not be needed anyway use package access

8372484
stdout	stderr
edit fprintf stdout fmt... and fprintf stderr fmt... don t work either

8372518
concave	convex
box2d does not support concave polygons so in order to create any concave polygons you will have to split it up into a series of convex polygons

8372541
carrierwave	fog
i am using carrierwave with fog to store images on amazon s s3

8372547
int	chars
but get ordered comparison between pointer and int chars and int

8372548
hash	md5
a javascript will get the sha256 hash from the file it s more accurate then the md5 hash before it get s uploaded

8372560
width	height
the center cell should have a fixed width and height and centered horizontally and vertically

8372572
google-chrome	firefox
i think both google-chrome and firefox supports the reading of files on the client and ie supports it with the help of activex controls but to get a solution that works in all browsers you have to use a plugin like flash or silverlight

8372575
sequence	permutation
the cycle-type of a permutation of n is a partition of n that is a weakly decreasing sequence of positive integers that sums to n

8372578
serializable	deserialization
i m not familiar with python libraries for doing this with json so i can t recommend endorse any but a search using terms like python deserialization json object and graph seems to reveal some django documentation for serializable and the library jsonpickle on github

8372582
strncmp	strcmp
use strcmp 3 or strncmp 3 or strcasecmp 3 or strncasecmp 3 to compare your strings

8372613
strcpy	strncpy
if not please replace strcpy with strncpy

8372615
post	get
i apologize for posting so much code i couldn t get the behavior to repeat on an abstracted simplified program so i had to post the actual code

8372621
uilabel	uitextview
for anyone else having this same issue i ended-up solving it by using a uitextview instead of a uilabel

8372646
octal	binary
since there are format specifiers for octal o and x for hexadecimal is it that octal and hexadecimal are somewhat more important than the binary representation

8372693
width	height
stackpanel gives its children whatever height width they ask for and that makes the inner listbox miscalculates its actual height and then its scrollviewer won t work properly

8372696
octal	binary	octal	decimal
the original implementers of printf et al at at t did not have a need for binary but did need octal and hexadecimal as well as decimal so that is what was implemented

8372744
jlist	jfilechooser
every time i open some txt file via jfilechooser i would like to add this file to the jlist

8372745
xdebug	xhprof
if you actually want to benchmark real world code use tools like xdebug and xhprof

8372745
xdebug	xhprof
xdebug is great for when you re working in dev staging and xhprof is a great tool for production and it s safe to run it there as long as you read the instructions

8372745
apache	nginx
as an example i can make nginx + php-fpm seriously out perform mod_php + apache which in turn gets trounced for serving static content by using a good cdn

8372762
punctuation	words
basically the b means a words delimiter matched the beginning and end of a words excluding punctuation

8372766
width	height
rectangles or squares it sounds like you are asking how to represent jagged arrays arrays that are not rectangular but have a fixed height with a variable width per-row

8372773
queue	fifo
note that here it is a lifo queue instead of the expected fifo queue so allocate enough workers

8372791
width	height
getsize defined as void _stdcall getsize int width int height and makecurrent defined as void _stdcall makecurrent void are callback functions for the buffer

8372817
xdebug	xhprof
xdebug has an impact on performance and xhprof i wouldn t say there is none manages a lot better

8372826
octal	decimal
it doesn t make any difference whether you express the number literal in your source code as 0 decimal or 00 octal or 0x0

8372835
ubuntu	debian
this sounds a bit like ubuntu or debian on the server

8372835
ubuntu	debian
assuming you are on ubuntu or debian this should show you the location of all installed files

8372841
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as a test i open the uiviewcontroller within a uinavigationcontroller do some things which trigger the notifications and then pop it off the stack by tapping the back button

8372910
width	height
setpreviewsize width height but you want to do it before camera preview starts

8372941
folder	directory
when i browse the created folder using oi file manager or file expert i can enter the first level directory and see the names of second-level directory but they are indicated as 0 byte files

8372941
folder	directory
the second level directory mnt storage flac artist_1 etc have the same permissions on the album folder

8372985
implements	extends
have your tab activities extends that baseactivity and the activity with your imageview implements it

8372998
firefox	safari
but firefox and safari give me the same error above

8372998
firefox	safari
update #3 i was able to get the video to autoplay when the shadowbox opens but now you can t pause or go fullscreen in firefox or safari on mac

8372999
swt	swing	awt	swing
for that you need to resort of the usual awt swt swing etc routines

8373039
nsstring	nsdata
if you don t want to do that for some reason and if it s all valid property list objects nsarray nsdictionary nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsdata the simplest approach is to use property list serialization

8373062
hash	md5
ideally the compilation must happen via the asset pipeline so that content-based asset names ones that include an md5 hash of the content are generated

8373087
postgresql	mysql
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

8373108
profiling	debugging
as well flash builder includes extensive debugging and profiling functionality far beyond flash professional

8373131
implements	extends
i have a couple of checkboxpreferences set up my preference class extends preferenceactivity and implements onsharedpreferencechangelistener

8373133
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

8373142
post	get
also for a more generic answer that can be used on other themes you can search your theme files for references to get_the_time or the_time which are the built in functions in wp to get the post time for a post

8373146
filtering	grouping
instead of special-casing values with the if else equivalent of a switch statement it is more linq-friendly to grouping and filtering your values

8373152
post	get
now i want to get a second custom post type and nest its menu items with the existing events items

8373177
flask	cheetah
i am no cheetah or flask expert but i don t think you need any special support to make it work

8373239
implements	extends
then after i started working on another activity implements listactivity and providing a custom view per row by extends an arrayadapter i start getting the runtimeexception

8373251
bmp	png
i am using assetmanager to load images form assets image and the loading process went well as i can see all images have been loaded in the gallery but the gallery only shows the frame but not the pictures i tried different mime types png jpg and bmp and didn t work out

8373281
rtsp	rtmp
rtsp for 2.1 and embedded flash player playing video from rtmp stream you can also play local file from the server

8373281
rtsp	rtmp
edit i used h.264 on rtsp streams and vp6 on rtmp

8373327
int	chars
the case statements for a switch must be compile-time constants of type sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or an enum-type including implicit conversions and that s not what you have with the type objects

8373331
int	chars
according to the specification only sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or enum-types can be used in a switch statement so basically you can not switch on a type object

8373334
atexit	main
also glibc can register some functions to be run after main via atexit

8373355
disk	ram
similarly you need to pay close attention to your disk subsystem have as much ram as possible etc

8373382
width	height
the reason why the star images are referenced as a bitmap is to prevent android from scaling them to the container s full width and height

8373384
min	max
it s also been noted that using an aggregate like min or max would work

8373384
sorting	grouping
while this is true - and will lead to reliable and predictable results unlike using distinct on or an ambigious grouping by - it has a performance cost due to the need for extra sorting or aggregation and it only works for ordinal data types

8373454
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i want to display this entry on the original view after this but i m not sure how to update the previous view since the method viewwillappear and viewdidappear are not called

8373469
free	realloc
ensures that result is initialized so that the realloc call won t do something strange like try to extend or free random memory

8373485
hex	binary
while there is only one meaningful hex representation --- the abstract one the number -0x79 can be represented in binary as

8373485
hex	binary
the concepts of endianness and binary representation don t apply to hex numbers as there is no way they could be considered the actual bits-in-memory representation

8373485
hex	binary
if you are trying to use this to debug bitwise operations which i see as the only compelling reason to use binary over hex you want to use something close what the hardware uses which makes it impossible to standardise so you want implementation defined

8373521
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and ie but it wont work with safari and google-chrome so i assume it s a webkit problem

8373521
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and ie but as i said google-chrome and safari wont echo into the iframe

8373572
implements	extends
in the text.java comparator subclass extends writablecomparator and implements compare method which does compare in lexicographic order dictionary or alphabetical order

8373705
implements	extends
for example jtable uses the tablemodel interface which can be implements from scratch or by extends abstracttablemodel or defaulttablemodel

8373715
width	height
i am building a website in which the main content frame should span the entire width of the page and as much height as necessary with a minimum height in order to contain a floating sidebar of sorts

8373735
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome but it doesn t work in ie and safari

8373760
width	margin
the width of an element does not include border margin and padding

8373779
cassini	iis
so the result is common regardless of whether i use iis 7 or cassini

8373813
put	get
i thought that to get this to work i have to put all myclass.myclass but that didn t work

8373823
post	get
you have to contact the admin if your trying to do basic things you could try to use javascript to get the data you need then thru a post url send it to the php script but your probably better off contacting the admin

8373852
onresume	onpause
put a log statement in your onpause and onresume methods and check the sequence of execution

8373882
128bit	64bit
it s at least theoretically possible that int64_t might not exist say if the compiler has a 128bit type but no 64bit type or if signed integers aren t represented using 2 s-complement

8373885
post	get
there are no get or post parameters

8373912
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve got easy access to firefox google-chrome konqueror opera full-blown and mini surf emacs w3m links links2 lynx elinks epiphany and writing http traffic by hand

8373940
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i have subclassed the uiimageview with a new class and added the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

8373948
accessor	properties
in the former case simply use the real properties accessor - if you decide to change this the refactoring tools make that trivial

8373997
maven	m2e
if you have m2e installed you should create maven run configurations for it like this

8373997
maven	cargo
you can run the cargo plugin from eclipse by creating a maven build run or debug configuration in eclipse

8374010
children	parent
for example when setting the children of a parent i say

8374010
children	parent
i want my tree to be doubly linked so i can crawl both ways downwards from the root to his children or upwards from a leaf to his parent

8374024
portrait	landscape
the image dimensions are 768 x 1024 portrait and 1024 x 768 landscape

8374063
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
when i view this page in any browser ie google-chrome opera safari and embed a youtube video link it previews just fine but the preview doesn t show up in firefox

8374078
post	put
it s based on the post by frank flynn on october 6 2006 11 05pm where he said if you wish to use outfile or dumpfile with a variable for the file name you cannot simply put it in place - mysql will not resolve the name.

8374085
put	get
i am working with ruby and i m going to make a pure-rack app to get the headers and put them into a queue for further calculations

8374128
submit	submission
i m not sure if my error comes from submission the form to itself via php but it is just not hitting my function and submit anyway no matter what is returned

8374140
freemarker	velocity
in wicket you can use templating built-in velocity panel or find or build freemarker panel

8374175
factors	mean
for a set of data that looks fairly normal you can use the correction factors method as outlined by dirk-eddelbuettel but with your custom values used to generate a set of data around your mean

8374224
int	boolean
boolean getrow int rownumber int nitems

8374226
portrait	landscape
if you rotate the device portrait and return to landscape it begins to work

8374279
sigkill	multitasking
sigkill is not an error on your part and is not a simulator bug it s what happens when you press the home button and kill the app in the multitasking drawer or press the stop button on xcode

8374283
google-chrome	firefox
basically the css below displays as expected in firefox google-chrome ie8 but not in ie6 and who knows about other ie versions

8374333
ssl	https
i have a java application that i m adding a jax-ws interface to and i ve gotten it to run over https but i want to be able to do two-way ssl authentication

8374343
gesturedetector	motionevent
you should override the ontouchevent motionevent event of the imageview to call the ontouchevent event of the gesturedetector and implement your own onsingletapconfirmed motionevent event in the attached listener to get the coordinates of the tap using event.getx and event.gety methods to determine the coordinates of the click

8374351
codeigniter	cakephp
some examples are ruby on rails codeigniter cakephp expression engine django to name some of the best

8374371
min	max
the php code will also store the max finishing time current time + 15 min or whatever the allotted time is in a session variable

8374405
spaces	delimiter
first of all delimiter must be a spaces instead of usual comma

8374405
post	get
on the server side if we still have # in get post request remove it and proceed to do db select

8374421
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
this is how i would like the ui to behave you click a button and it shows a qgraphicsview with a qgraphicsscene done and then i would like to show all of my qpixmaps in a grid view

8374421
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
spritescene extends qgraphicsscene and is being added to a qgraphicsview like this

8374436
std	ostream
in this particular case since the lhs is std ostream and you cannot modify it you are left with the only option of using a free function

8374440
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a problem with a form being displayed peculiarly in google-chrome only in google-chrome works in firefox and safari

8374459
codeigniter	cakephp
i m pretty much torn between cakephp zend symfony reccess codeigniter and agile toolkit

8374486
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine on google-chrome but on firefox and ie it shows a save dialog for the pdf file as soon as the page is loaded

8374507
jboss	glassfish
i guess ejb works for non-jee6 tomcat or jetty in jee6 cdi jboss or glassfish you need to use inject

8374508
for-loop	loops
then again you could replace the while loops with a fast-enumeration-style for-loop

8374520
ubuntu	linux
linux distro ubuntu

8374521
min	max
however if you keep a reference to the min and max value and update the values on every insert append replace operation the amortized cost of min max lookups can be very cheap

8374521
min	max
sorting the array is very expensive compared to a simple linear scan to find the min and max so only sort if there is some other benefit

8374521
min	max
of course insertion sort can provide very similar properties to updating the min and max values on every insert append replace operation so it might be acceptable enough.

8374529
min	max
for unsorted array min max complexity is o n

8374529
min	max
and if you need to search for min max only ones or near it sort is not useful

8374573
getter	setter
because i don t know your classes you maybe need to add some getter or setter or just make the properties public so smarty can access them

8374587
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
another option is to use dispatchertimer with creating backgroundworker class instance on each timer iteration

8374638
int	double
i would still rather have int since i have already built my other matrixops classes using this type but double shouldn t be an issue i guess

8374665
pull	push
i would use a server and then push pull web service data the location data

8374673
maven	pom.xml
when work in sts springsource tool suite open pom.xml file and check dependencies in dependencies tab add select maven dependency will give 0 result found

8374679
portrait	landscape
i am doing a app for ipad in which we have added two images one for landscape and the other for portrait mode i have written code for

8374689
min	max
when adding a value to an empty list set min and max to that value

8374689
min	max
when adding a value to a non-empty list set min or max to that value if appropriate

8374689
min	max
when deleting a value from the list set min or max to unknown if the value being deleted is equal to the current min or max

8374689
min	max
you can also make this more efficient if you store both the min max and the counts of them

8374689
min	max
by doing it that way probably the vast majority of retrieving min max are constant time

8374689
min	max
it s only when you ve removed a value which was the min or max does the next retrieval require linear time for one retrieval

8374689
min	max
the next retrieval after that will again be constant time since you ve calculated and stored them assuming you don t remove the min max value in the interim again

8374692
firefox	safari
in internet explorer firefox and safari my second drop down menu appears straight away when i click on it after selecting something on the first dropdown menu for the first time

8374692
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and opera i have to select options from the first dropdown menu twice to be able to get the second dropdown menu working

8374706
innodb	myisam
i ve ran two separate batch of tests one that used a myisam table and another that used innodb

8374706
innodb	myisam
so basically you replace myisam with innodb in the above snippet.

8374706
innodb	myisam
here is the output of explain for the query above for each indices on a myisam top and an innodb bottom table

8374706
innodb	myisam
based on these i ve decided to use the endtime_only index for my tests because i had to run queries against a myisam and an innodb table too

8374706
innodb	myisam
for testing the efficiency of the query regarding the generated i o activity with a myisam and innodb table i ve written the following simple java program

8374706
innodb	myisam
i ve captured the state of the mysqld process before and after running my tests against the table using myisam and innodb using process explorer

8374706
innodb	myisam
the cpu s maximum load in case of the myisam engine was around 42 percent while using innodb it was around 38

8374707
intersect	contains
your code should print match on the intersect strings between the two vectors it should work fine for the intersection you may need to check the string value itself it may contains spaces or so

8374717
int	chars
please note that java has the chars data type which is a 16bit unsigned int holding a utf-16 code point

8374725
backgroundworker	dispatchertimer
if you use a dispatchertimer to start a backgroundworker you re circumventing its main purpose

8374739
inherited	properties
when i use this bindinglist in bindings only properties from t are visible while properties from inherited a interface are not

8374776
range	infinity
when there are no such keys either side the range lock extends to infinity

8374782
portrait	landscape
as per your question all you need to do is to return yes for supported orientation in shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation and you can call to a function to set the background image two different images for portrait and landscape orientation as follows

8374785
int	chars
the x specifier by itself prints the value as an unsigned int but you pass in a chars promoted to signed int

8374785
int	chars
the hh modifier changes it to unsigned chars instead of unsigned int

8374803
google-chrome	firefox
second of all this jsfiddle example works properly in google-chrome and firefox

8374875
opera	firefox
i m using javax.mail 1.4.4 and what happens is that firefox and opera both browsers react in the same way hang and after about 20 seconds they work normally again but mail is not sent

8374894
width	margin
when two or more margins collapse the resulting margin width is the maximum of the collapsing margins widths.

8374974
ssl	https
i am still working in sandbox mode and have not yet bought an ssl certificate which is why i am still referring everywhere to http instead of https

8375003
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven add this dependency to your pom.xml

8375012
python-daemon	daemons
rather than writing your own daemons use python-daemon instead

8375012
python-daemon	daemons
python-daemon implements the well-behaved daemons specification of pep 3143 standard daemons process library

8375019
super	extends
by default all pom.xml will automatically extends the super pom which is located in the maven_installation_folder lib maven-x.x.x-uber.jar package org.apache.maven.project pom-4.0.0.xml

8375019
maven	pom.xml
that means if you specify a in your pom.xml maven will try to download this dependency in the following orders

8375019
maven	pom.xml
maven central repository specifed in the super pom.xml i.e

8375019
maven	pom.xml
maven remote repository defined in the section of your pom.xml

8375019
maven	pom.xml
normally i will use some maven repository search engines such as this to find out the of the libraries frameworks tools that i want to use and then paste them in the pom.xml

8375019
maven	pom.xml
however if some of the eg hibernate cannot be found and downloaded from the maven central repository you can try to visit its official site to find out its repository link and paste them in the section of your pom.xml .for example hibernate require to define the jboss repository in the pom.xml like this

8375025
gnupg	gpgme
installing gnupg or gpgme would probably be far easier than trying to get a php implementation working debugged and keep it secure as problems are found and fixed in the real gnupg implementation

8375046
joptionpane	jcomponent
you can add any jcomponent s to joptionpane including jscrollpane contains jlist

8375069
tcpclient	networkstream	tcpclient	sslstream	networkstream	sslstream
you can wrap the networkstream provided by tcpclient with an sslstream

8375127
concave	convex
i am looking for some algorithms to add a convex mirror effect and concave mirror effect to an image

8375137
tcpclient	sslstream
you have to use the sslstream along with the tcpclient then use the sslstream to read the data rather than the tcpclient

8375155
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome work like a charm.but all ie fail

8375194
width	height
represent each rectangle by x1 x2 h where h is height and x2-x1 is width

8375194
min	max
for i min l 1 .x r 1 .x to max l size of l .x r size of r .x choose max l i .h r i .h

8375203
hide	show
show hide

8375233
put	get
when i put the resulting framework in a 5.0 project it works great but when i put it in a 4.3 project arc or non-arc doesnt matter i get the following which i can t really understand .

8375240
xslt	xquery
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks

8375247
ssl	https
https means that you tunnel the http protocol over tls ssl which encrypts the http payload

8375256
getter	setter
also an new nsmutablearray was declared with setter and getter methods

8375283
post	get
now it uses oauth instead of changing the method from post to get which i never understodd why it had to do anyway

8375320
int	boolean
in terms of size an int is a 32-bit signed int while the boolean data type doesn t really have a defined size

8375320
int	boolean
however it also depends on the context from where you ve read about using int over boolean

8375320
int	boolean
int allow more flexibility while boolean offer limitation and simplicity

8375323
int	chars
i am trying to make a compiler and if the compiler is given the token int real or chars i would like it to generate code to make int float or chars instead

8375327
versioning	upgrade
and then tried to upgrade the mamp versioning of pear with

8375378
margin	height
i tried relativelayout multiple layouts within each other padding margin changing height nothing seem to affect it in any way

8375397
haskell	scheme
i can think of a lot of languages that use it in the source code the language user writes haskell ml scheme sbcl arc ... so not sure how you didn t see it yet.

8375420
int	double
plenty of int vector to double vector arraylist to vector etc

8375424
stdout	stderr
you may also redirect stdout and stderr to a log file

8375425
stdout	stderr
refer for more info viewing stdout and stderr

8375430
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
since the if statement is nested inside the for-loop i wouldn t expect anything less than getting an inaccurate output as the for-loop will continue to loops until all elements in the student arrays have been passed

8375442

8375637
maven	pom.xml
that means if i remove the ejb project from workspace without deleting contents on disk such that only the hierarchal parent maven project pom.xml packaged is existing in the workspace which contains the ejb project but ejb project is then not known to eclipse then everything works fine

8375641
inherited	properties
thus static members do not follow the same rules of inherited and remain properties of the class that defines them

finally figured it out guys it was a rogue bracket instead of a curly brace higher up in my css stylesheet which meant everything underneath was not getting seen by firefox or opera

8375803
oncreate	setcontentview
if you are calling setcontentview r.layout.some_custom_layout from the activity s oncreate method you should be good as long as your app compiles and i assume it does

8375843

the origin can be cloned again and again can pull commit push as much as they want and everything works smoothly

8376091
pull	push
the older repositories still cannot push pull

8376129
put	get
it is probably easier if you put the suckerfish code on your site get it working then adjust accordingly for your template

8376133
put	get
you can put a limit on the results to get back only 1 row if that s what you need

8376194
httpresponse	request
i am using the low level api to get an httpresponse object as the response to my get request to a url an api function

8376227
do-while	break
break ends execution of the current for foreach while do-while or switch structure

8376235
margin	height
instead of animating margin which means the box height needs to be recalculated so rounding errors on partial pixels causes movement use transforms

8376244
opera	firefox
during development you might have had it broken but firefox and opera are clutching their old manifest files to the death

8376244
opera	firefox
i bet you also tried clearing the browser cache in firefox and opera which probably did nothing - you need to change the text content of the file and double-refresh before either firefox and opera will finally give up their broken versions of the manifest file and start using the one which works which you probably uploaded ages ago

8376247
width	height
think about our world for instance it has three readily-apparent dimensions width height depth

8376257

rss	feed
for example for a web application you can have an rss feed and a html page both using the same controller

8376533
dbcontext	objectcontext
if query performance is your main concern and you need to use compiled queries then don t use dbcontext api and write your whole application with objectcontext api

8376533
dbcontext	objectcontext
using objectcontext for one half of the application and dbcontext for second half of the application must result in code duplication

8376629
division	modulo
so the question is when you set the test_num constant to non-zero say 5 both the conditions modulo and division are perfoming approximately at the same time but when you set test_num to 0 the second condition performs slower up to 3 times

8376629
division	modulo
in case of 0 the test instruction is used instead of cmp x 0 but even if you patch cmp x 5 in case of 5 to cmp x 0 you ll see that it wouldn t affect the modulo but would affect the division operation

8376673
hash	md5
i cannot just trim extra characters of an md5 hash because i think the problem of collisions will come up at some time then

8376835
mouseover	mouseout
when an element moves over the element you re mousing over it blocks the mouse from the element with the mouseover event triggering a mouseout event

8376835

8377052
realloc	malloc
with malloc i can use realloc for the same part of memory but what about new operator

8377096
nsurlconnection	nsoperation

8377110
longlistselector	silverlight
use the longlistselector from the silverlight toolkit

8377122
sorting	filtering
however there are some minor points - firstly it may be a good idea to perform filtering before sorting because then your sorting function will need to sort fewer elements

8377123
super	self
although you have to remember to call the super class self .get ... function so i guess it s not so different after all

8377125
public	protected

8377233
button	checkbox
in my case i was dealing a software-generated pdf which always produced the same graphic paths for checkbox and radio button

8377656
typedef	typename
is the problem related to the scope of typedef typename

8377726
spaces	delimiter
cin is delimiter on spaces so if you try to cin 1 2 3 4 5 into a single integer your only going to be assigning 1 to the integer a better option is to wrap your input and push_back in a loop and have it test for a sentinel value and on that sentinel value call your write function

8377835
config	ini
because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

jxtable	jtable
although we do not yet know whether the jtable is the actual problem i had performance problems with jxtable s note the swingx version of jtable in combination with large tablemodel s where the table would iterate over all elements to determine the column size before painting it

8378398
jxtable	jtable
i am not sure whether a regular jtable contains this logic as well but it might be worth a try to replace your jtable by a jxtable and set the prototype

8378414
post	put
if you pass in the _method post parameter set to delete or put then you can use app.delete and app.put in express instead of using app.post all the time thus more descriptive verbose

8378447
rsa	dsa
so it looks like you are trying to do an rsa signature with a dsa key which will not work or spit out nonsense

while thinking about the go programming language how it cleaning separates the data from the interfaces effectively turning all objects into structs and pods in c++ i like memset memcpy when allocating a gazillion small struct-like objects i was wondering about the c++ compiler convention of attaching a vptr directly to an instance of an object messing up the layout

if you do the md5 hash of the bytes representing the strings will be the same

8382118

hibernate can only delete the children when deleting the parent if the parent knows about its children

8384830
children	parent
the only solution is to have the parentdao s delete method to search for all the children of the parent delete them and then delete the parent itself

8384830
children	parent
if your concern is that the parentdao shouldn t know about the children you could make it decoupled and have the parentdao have a list of registered parentdeletionlisteners which would be invoked before deleting the parent itself

you can do it using css but it will only work in webkit browsers google-chrome and safari

width	height
by default when you add a view to a layout in java code like you have done without explicitly setting any layoutparams it will set your view to be laid out using wrap_content for both height and width

8387242
width	height
since as far as we can see you are not overriding any of view s measurement methods to tell the layout system how big the content inside your custom view is the view will be added to the hierarchy with a height and width of zero

newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

8388091
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
as i know it has never shown the percentage i use firefox opera and google-chrome

8388105
setinterval	settimeout
if you only want the effect to happen once you should use settimeout not setinterval

8388150
setinterval	settimeout
in addition it is better to use settimeout instead of setinterval as the latter can cause performance issues

8388171
setinterval	settimeout
this uses settimeout instead of setinterval to reduce bubbling of the timeout events

8388190
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox safari google-chrome .

8388279
children	parent
here parent can see there children report card and can sign on it

8388288
int	boolean
it seems you want to associate an int attribute to each boolean variable

8388288
int	boolean
so each variable is a pair a boolean value and an int attribute

8388301
google-chrome	firefox
this does not appear to work in my google-chrome 14.0.835.202 but does work in my firefox 8.0 and ie 8

8388371
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox google-chrome there are no problems

8388387
ubuntu	linux
i am looking to install java on linux ubuntu 64-bit

8388404
hide	show
here is a sample of the html table and the jquery code i am using to hide show rows

8388439
post	get
in html when we have something like passwd pass we call the part user uname passwd pass after the question mark form data .the form data can be attached to the end of the url after a question mark as above for get requests or sent to the server on a separate line for post requests.the form data are split to parameters

8388439
implements	extends
in our case the httppost and httpget classes extends the abstracthttpmessage which implements the setparams method

8388439
post	get
this method is same for get and post but does the job only for get

8388439
put	get
in the case of get the parameters are put in the url

8388439
post	get
on the server side when using servlets the getparameters is clever enough to find the parameters for get and post

8388440
int	double
in javascript however the only way of converting a double to an int that i m aware of is by using math.round floor tofixed etc

8388532
implements	extends
hopefully you can extends this to implements the 1 second delay

8388536
hash	md5
password of administrator is stored as a md5 hash in

8388551
accessor	properties
second way properties get accessor

8388568
int	double
you don t need to worry about precision issues since double correctly represent any int up to 2 53 but you really are stuck with using math.floor or other equivalent tricks if you want to round to the nearest int

8388568
int	double
most js engines use native int when they can but all in all js numbers must still have double semantics

8388589
actionscript	mxml
you can either use actionscript 3 and mxml and compile it with the flex sdk

8388616
sorting	filtering
but you can see the pattern for that functionality by looking at the basic sorting filtering model example

8388616
put	get
news is that how those widgets you put in the column headers get populated is up to you

8388620
getter	setter
you could workaround this by introducing lazy loading in a getter or lazy executing in a setter

8388661
int	double
only string double and int values no methods or references pointers

8388674
innodb	myisam
imho this is one of the terrible things about mysql that it makes you choose between speed and full-text indices myisam and referential integrity and transactions innodb

8388675
hide	show
it may be that the code for this in ie8 is clashing with show hide

8388677
folder	directory
to find the folder directory where one of your classes is assuming they are not in a jar and then to create a subfolder there

8388693
hide	fadeout
popup div should hide fadeout and the image can be dropped elsewhere

8388708
gson	jackson
if you have not already invested too much time into jackson may i recommend you looking at gson here is a tutorial that should have you started

8388711
post	get
post is not any more secure than get

8388735
debian	linux
we were encountering a very grave slowdown in our web server machine which is running on debian linux

8388767
unix	aix
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk

8388768
hide	show
i m not sure why your code is having trouble but i have many times done projects that do a hide and show on a table row without any problems at all in ie8

8388772
folder	directory
looking into this folder is somewhat misleading as explorer will show the file in this directory but when you run ls cygdrive c windows system32 en-us there is no qwinsta.exe.mui file

8388820
innodb	myisam
you don t say what db you are using but in case you are using mysql note that mysql myisam tables the most common type do not support transactions--you need to use innodb with mysql

8388846
portrait	landscape
so what i want to do is figure out what the current orientation landscape reverse landscape portrait reverse portrait is change the orientation to that one orientation and then later change it back to what it was originally

8388846
portrait	landscape
it does return landscape or portrait

8388846
portrait	landscape
it wasn t until gingerbread 2.3 api 9 that reverse landscape and reverse portrait were added

8388886
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream and outputstream

8388905
width	height
if by the dimensions you mean the width and height you can use yourtabhostinstance.getwidth and yourtabhostinstance.getheight to retrieve them

8388905
inherited	properties
there are other methods available for finding out more specific view properties as well see tabhost for more information particularly the methods inherited from android.view.view

8388907
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it just work on firefox both on mac and windows platforms ie google-chrome safari don t like this

8388924
strcpy	strncpy
use strcpy to copy the contents of the string but in new code don t use strcpy use strncpy instead

8388959
freebsd	debian	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian
i m not really sure on debian ubuntu but in freebsd you need to add a -x to use simple authentication instead of sasl

8388993
udp	tcp
this only works with direct tcp udp connections

8389006
dictionary	map
but the keys to the dictionary you should populate from the headers and somehow you have to map the data to the respective value in the empty slot s of the dictionary

8389012
pop-up	dialog
my issue is that this same og data is not being pulled into the like button pop-up when it pop-up a dialog to post a comment with the like - whereas this functionality exists and works elsewhere

8389025
inline	inlining
will that extra indirection be removed if the call can be inline either via explicit inlining or whole program optimization at linker level

8389059
google-chrome	firefox
this might not be an answer but i have made this jsfiddle and it works in all browsers ie7- 9 firefox google-chrome

8389083
opera	safari
provided you don t care about really old browsers opera 6 and safari 1 most notably you can just save the image without any gamma information

8389129
filtering	grouping
the idea is that you can add a grouping search filtering for the parent grouping and the uid of the user in your spring security config

8389155
stdout	stderr
usually isatty tells you if a stream is a tty and is the common way to determine if the stdout or stderr is a console

8389171
fadein	fadeout
this will ensure that fadein is only run after both the ajax request and the fadeout have finished while running both simultaneously

8389193
uiview	subviews
not the background color but the entire uiview with all its subviews

8389215
put	get
you should rather just put it in the classpath and get it from the classpath

8389245
junit	testng
with testng i dont even get the stack trace with junit i see the below

8389261
opera	firefox
if i open the page in another browser i tried opera firefox everything works as expected -- no errors

8389287
sudo	passwd
also sudo will by default prompt for a passwd which monit won t be able to provide

8389290
google-chrome	firefox
this improved the problem to an extent but we were still left with different borders in firefox ie and google-chrome

8389313
keydown	keyup
the keydown keyup listener should be on the input not the submit button

8389324
division	addition
the objective of jacobian coordinates is to avoid the division during addition

8389393
ubuntu	linux
gnu linux red hat enterprise 5 + ubuntu 10.04 if it matters

8389411
post	get
get rid of it - that s skipping the first post

8389439
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
four values for background-position is only supported in a couple of them firefox google-chrome and safari do not support it

8389486
pbkdf2	hash
this project was set up to use sha-1 hash as the algorithm but i am thinking about switching to something like bcrypt or pbkdf2 and was wondering how people usually make a transition like this

8389492
hash	md5
i wouldn t personally use md5 to hash passwords but that s a different conversation.

8389500
hash	md5
since this is the result of an md5 hash you can assume the input data is equal

8389505
portrait	landscape
son now i m somehow forced to adapt all the views for both portrait and landscape mode which i ve never did before

8389578
postgresql	mysql
you need to lookup mysql or postgresql full text search

8389603
scatter	graphing
like the others have said to get the true time difference between your points to show up you have to use a scatter plot instead of the excel line graphing

8389610
pop-up	dialog
however you may be able to make it seem instantaneous for the user by doing the call to download the file through ajax what you re doing now provide response cache headers when sending the contents and then pop-up the download dialog through an iframe for example for the exact same url as the one in the ajax call

8389617
pull	push
git supposedly has the ability to push pull via ftp natively

8389634
gif	png
i currently have an image upload input that only accepts png jpg jpeg gif images

8389638
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass named message with the field string msgtype and a subclassing named connectmessage that extends it which contains the field string pos_x

8389689
jlist	jtable
in the example below i have a jtable a jlist and two jbutton s add and remove

8389704
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in inherited subclassing child derived class call it whatever you are comfortable with will extends inherited properties from superclass parent class

8389737
qobject	qnetworkaccessmanager	qobject	qwidget
now one way that i use to ensure requests are made in separate threads is to create an entire qobject qwidget for my qnetworkaccessmanager like this

8389770
actualheight	actualwidth
doing the same without the viewbox and the bindings to actualwidth and actualheight will help a lot if it is feasible to replace with an lighter alternative

8389772
folder	directory
it should be possible to specify the targetpath as above but i think it would be cleaner to reproduce the wanted directory structure inside your source folder

8389783
nspredicate	nsmanagedobject
i m using an nspredicate to search an array of nsmanagedobject instances

8389809
udp	tcp
low level access to c socket api exposes features such as socket options to use protocols beyond vanilla tcp ip and udp

8389825
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
i am aware of the build-helper-maven-plugin that allows users to augment their pom.xml to specify new source folders for a build but using this plugin is not ideal since it requires more than 20 lines of extra configuration in the pom.xml

8389845
post	put	post	get	put	get
the response in case of get put post should contain the location to the requested created updated resource

8389856
min	max
passing a parameter to an oracle group by will be difficult because the grouped columns are the only ones which can appear directly in the select clause anything not in the group by can only appear inside a group function such as sum min max count etc. so you would need to modify the sql on the fly to add remove columns in the select clause

8389905
post	get
i am trying to post into a database table 3 different bits of information but i get an error of column count doesn t match value count at row 1

8389914
width	height
since your div#content is absolutely positioned within div#container the container will ignore the height and width of the content when determining its own dimensions

8389916
children	parent
as for reaping children of a parent whose sigchld handler is explicitely set to ignore will be reaped automatically by the system

8389945
activemq	rabbitmq
as far as my experience the queue capacity depends on the machine and not that large compared to activemq or rabbitmq

8389960
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian
amazon elastic compute cloud ec2 basically is your virtual operative system you can install whatever so you want debian ubuntu fedora centos windows server suse enterprise

8390041
spaces	delimiter
assuming that the white spaces is a delimiter you can use the following mechanism

8390053
post	get
only problem is on my new php page when i get the variables using post they come us as empty

8390082
unsigned	short
in short srand unsigned int seed is correct if you re using older versions of c++ or if you just want one rng in your program

8390084
post	get
you need to create a before_filter to get the user and the form post to create not new

8390128
rss	feed
i ve previously used yahoo weather rss feed

8390144
strsplit	substr
or you can use substr or strsplit as others have suggested

8390146
submit	submission
the submit button is deliberately a clickable div and submission is done by jquery thus

8390149
width	height
padding is never the same in firefox and ie while ie adds padding to the height and width firefox just ignores it

8390186
versioning	upgrade
i guess technically the answer here is to upgrade to a newer versioning of visual studio 2010 or later

8390198
google-chrome	firefox	slideup	slidedown
i have a jquery slidedown slideup animation that runs smoothly in ie9 and firefox but is very choppy in google-chrome

8390206
int	boolean
the value that goes after the keyword case is an identifier or something that evaluates to a constant value such as an int enum or boolean value

8390208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it does this in internet explorer and opera but it does not do this for safari firefox and google-chrome as in those browsers it displays the tables inline but inline by bottom of the table and not top of the table

8390222
width	height
one additional wrinkle is that some browsers require some content to be in a container say table cell or div before applying width height to it

8390253
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this appears to work in the latest release versions of firefox safari and google-chrome if i widen the jsfiddle result view enough so that both tables can fit next to each other

8390288
carrierwave	paperclip
also consider using carrierwave instead of paperclip for your uploads

8390292
google-chrome	firefox
however i tested the following code in firefox and google-chrome and it works

8390320
maven	pom.xml
it is unclear to me how to alter my maven pom.xml to accomplish this

8390324
post	put	post	get	put	get
the main aspect is that get put post should be used appropriately against the same url for respective api

8390337
prepare	execute
i would also consider a few things like switching to prepare statements or using something like sprintf to store your query then execute the query

8390353
width	height
then change your #container #dropdown #button hover #menu selector to #container #dropdown #button hover and give it the following properties width auto height auto overflow visible

8390404
getter	setter
the combination of a magic setter and getter essentially provides dynamic class properties via property overloading

8390406
put	get
so this brings up a window for me to put in the user and password but after accepting it i get an error of nil class for an instance variable that works perfectly without the authentication

8390409
pop-up	dialog
for instance it s impossible to close opened pop-up of combobox located on qt widget by pressing enter or esc key - dialog is closed instead cdialog onok or cdialog oncancel is called

8390426
versioning	upgrade
as with older versioning they use the ie rendering engine if you upgrade the server machine which is running abcpdf to ie8 or higher abc pdf no longer have access to the rendering engine and will produce some very very odd results

8390467
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
in such model neither margin nor padding are part of the content dimensions width and height as this figure illustrates

8390471
portrait	landscape
and yes you ll need a landscape and a portrait value for your constant

8390503
for-loop	loops
now that you have two answers about the while loops i ll suggest using for-loop instead

8390568
csv	tsv
since c# is compiled and can t do evals like scripted languages can not that you should be doing that anyway you should probably use streamreader to read the data from file formatted perhaps as delimited text csv or tsv

8390585
folder	directory
the ngram folder is in the same directory as the file

8390595
width	height
i ve tried to create a div through javascript setting its background-color position width and height and adding an onmouseover event to it

but in v5 there are no such things and i have searched and searched and found nothing that could help me even put a post on thier forum and no responses yet

8390604
passenger	webrick
when i run the webrick server on port 3000 my app runs perfectly but when attempting to access it through the virtual host i continue to get passenger errors

8390636
folder	directory
when i add this file it always shows my path as being the file in my projectfiles directory not my binary folder

8390722
mouse	keyboard
use mouse messages to determine which tab is being clicked on directly look at the tpagecontrol.indexoftabat method and use keyboard messages to detect left right arrow presses to determine which tab is adjacent to the active tab look at the tpagecontrol.findnextpage method

8390729
interpreted-language	compiled-language
this question is more about interpreted-language vs compiled-language which has actually no other answer that the usual it depends of your need

8390762
decoder	encoder
does not have any depending on any 3rd party encoder decoder library unless you use gzip encryption libraries

8390814
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux ubuntu 3.0.0-13-generic x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux and gnu - 4.6.1

it wouldn t build into the project s debug folder so when i ran debug f5 it failed and said no such app or directory

8390976
nssearchfield	nstextfield
i would like to have a default value for a nstextfield or nssearchfield and have this default value removed when the user clicks on it and set back when the text view loses the focus and the text field is empty

8391005
width	height
you must specify a units designator for height and width

8391021
bazaar	git
i m new to bazaar coming to it from a background of subversion and git

8391021
bazaar	git
in addition although rebase is commonly used in git it appears it s not generally approved of in the bazaar world

edit 1 get post are synchronous no asynchronous

8391094
freebsd	linux
i am looking for the equivalent methods in freebsd linux of the following winapi

since nssearchfield and nssearchfieldcell inherit from nstextfield and nstextfieldcell respectively the process is the same for them

8391125
width	height
the objective is to have the text area uilabel frame reduce it s width and increase the height to accommodate all the text when editing starts b

8391153
width	height
to get your div to appear which has no relation to the validation of your html see gilly3 s answer about specifying a unit for your width and height properties

8391155
width	margin
for example if you want the cell to stay a fixed distance from the left and right margins but grow or shrink in width then you change the margin and width bars so that the preview shows the label growing and shrinking as opposed to staying the same size but moving around

8391156
next	except
all nodes in the list would have a next node except for the tail

8391157

coreldraw	fireworks
i have the layout of a website in coreldraw x4 and i need to move it to fireworks cs5 for many reasons

8391257
mvp	presenter
in mvp the view should defer that kind of behavior to the presenter which ideally would defer it to some server-side handler

8391320
width	height
this is what i have used in the past setting the default height and width then trying to calculate it by trying to retrieve the various viewport dimensions

8391328
onresume	onpause
the egl and gles state are completely destroyed and re-created between onpause and onresume

8391372
min	max
i m trying to find the min and max value yet when i run the function i get

8391374
width	height
theoretically it should be possible to change the width and height of the screen using positive values

8391398
equals	gethashcode
your point3d class should provide an appropriate implementation of equals gethashcode yes you do have to implement it throwing a notimplementedexception won t work or implement more explicit for this to work or alternatively you can pass a custom iequalitycomparer as second parameter to except

8391414
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
there are also case-sensitive and case-insensitive collations

8391434
gitolite	gitosis
apache http server with git-http-backend gitlab gitosis gitolite supported out of the box

you want to get the correct list of colors though and this is most easily done using a color map as is explained in the answer to this question create a color generator from given colormap in matplotlib

8391464
versioning	upgrade
when i try to upgrade to new versioning there s what i ve got

8391466
pwd	chdir
otherwise gmake calls chdir which changes working directory and sets pwd without sh s tricks

client-side	server-side
found those articles providing a server-side and client-side solution to achieve what you are looking for

8391601
multiplying	add
in order to achieve peak flops on intel haswell and amd bulldozer processors and later fma fused multiplying add instructions will be needed

8391601

mouseover	mouseout
in order to avoid a sort of flickering effect on the screen due to rollover effects on my page i want to activate a function from mouseout of a thumbnail only if a mouseover state on a different thumbnail is not currently happening

8391726
width	height
try setting some fixed numbers for width and height of your view - i.e 300x200

8391726
width	height
there s a good chance that since you re setting the width and height to wrap_content and your view basically has no content nothing added in it the canvas you re getting in ondraw is empty

8391765
gif	png
this code works fine when i am saving a jpg or png file but whenever i save a gif i get an internal server error

the editor will run on all major browsers firefox google-chrome internet explorer opera safari

8391783
factors	matrix
because i have found interaction between those two factors i decided to look at differences between the means for all the characters for all levels of motion which resulted in this massive matrix as an output of posthoc tukey

8391788
queue	fifo
since apcs are run in fifo order the new apc will definitely run after the apc that writefileex has already queue

8391800
post	get
there are seldom more than a few hundred comments on a given post and usually you want to get the whole tree of comments for a given post starting at the top of the comment thread

8391858
versioning	upgrade
sql server 2008 r2 express and sql server 2008 r2 with advanced services are technically different versioning but an upgrade path is supported

8391865
mxmlc	compc
my real problem my swf is not being compiled directly by flash builder but rather by ant using the mxmlc and compc compilers found in the 4.1 sdk

8392018
post	put	post	get	put	get
the third is if it is a get put post or delete call

8392084

8392111
multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo	division	modulo	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
in the simplest case we have a prime field integers modulo a prime number and you ll have to do addition subtraction multiplication and division and probably exponentiation in this field

8392114
division	modulo
division modulo by a power of two will be optimized to bitwise operations anyway

8392125
division	addition
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

8392126
children	parent
if a parent has position relative it indirectly determines the maximum width of its children

8392129
uilabel	uibutton
usually when i do an application i set my view up as part of the controller and add uibutton uilabel etc

super	abstract	super	implements
so since getsystemresource is the same for all three printers so this can be pushed up to the super class to be implements in java this can be done via making this abstract in the super class and in making a method abstract in a super class the class itself needs to be abstract as well

8394338
getter	setter
so if you are pretty sure that any reasonable implementation would have a string named uniqueid you could declare it plus relevant getter setter in the abstract class saving some typing later

8394477
put	get
when i get to second column each number would be put in twp times and then repeated until the end of the array is reached

8394480
getter	setter
in c++ getter and setter are just methods and functions invokation always requires

8394483
post	get
therefore the authors of tornado were correct to ignore the post data for get head and delete

8394489
getter	setter
you can actually implement a getter and setter to a field like

8394507
getter	setter
finally you have to add getter and setter methods to the class which implement the get set logic and have member_t aggregate pointers to these functions as members so that it can call the getter inside the implicit conversion to prop_t and call the setter inside the overridden assignment operator

objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i would use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream and just write objects

8394576
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the constructor of objectinputstream blocks until it receives the header that is written by the constructor of objectoutputstream so if you are constructing both you must construct the objectoutputstream first

8394587
post	put
then you can instead of relying on urlconnection#setdooutput true to implicitly set the request method to post instead do httpurlconnection.setrequestmethod post which some might find more natural and which also allows you to specify other request methods such as put delete ...

codeigniter	yii
there is codeigniter 1.7.0 and yii 1.0.2

8396571
codeigniter	yii
there is codeigniter 2.0 and yii 1.1.6

8396571
codeigniter	yii
so latest codeigniter 2.0 is better than yii according to this benchmarks

8396585

8397100
nsexception	nserror
2 you cannot convert an nsexception into an nserror directly because an nsexception does not have all the properties an nserror has - it is a different data representation

8397100
nsexception	nserror
the best you can do is to create an error code and domain then use the properties you need from the nsexception and store that in an nserror

8397179
boost	stl
i am working on a layer of standardized interfaces which you can among other things use to pass binary safe managed references to instances of stl boost or other c++ types across component boundaries

8397802
mouse	keyboard
use a python gui library to interact with keyboard and mouse events

8397831
opencv	emgucv
from my personal experience i was doing some stereoscopic vision stuff the best way to talk to opencv is through own wrapper you could put your method in c++ and call it from c# that would give you 1 call to native faster code and because under the hood emgucv s keeping opencv data it s also possible to create an image with emgucv process it natively and enjoy processed image in c# again

8397846
uilabel	nsstring
where display is a uilabel and digit is an nsstring

8397846

8397865
hide	show
it hide if the element is currently visible otherwise it show the hidden element

8397869
for-loop	arrays
if you read out the value of your i-iterator in the for-loop from within the scope of the listener you defined it will have the value of the length of the eles arrays this is probably because your listener code is evaluated in a different scope

8397889
getter	setter
to solve the real problem you should take a look at public properties or private ones with getter and setter if you want to control the incoming and outgoing data

8397971
google-chrome	firefox
i am specifying in my capabilities that i want a firefox driver not a google-chrome one

8398325
rss	feed
so what i did is echo the exact same rss feed that i succeeded to receive from another website earlier from my php page ..and it still refuses to read it ..and it gives me the same 76 code error

8398328
getter	setter
as the other answers indicate the self.property construct is much more than simple syntax it invokes setter and getter methods

8398328
getter	setter
personally i prefer to use the same style of access of both left hand side and right hand side expressions so once i use setter i also try to use getter throughout

8398351
post	get
i want to get the data from post or network with developer tools

8398393

you can configure sudo to be usable with no passwd as described here

8398478
sudo	passwd
be sure to let sudo only run specific commands without passwd not all

8398511
post	get
suppose there are 2000 post for blade keyword from 2nd dec so your query is returning the first 300 results starting from 2nd dec lets say there are 500 results from 2nd december so in first page you are getting 300 and in previous page you will get rest of the 200 and another 100 result from 3rd december

margin	height	width	height	width	margin
i need some explanation of how to calculate runtime height width including excluding padding margin border etc and how to set it correctly so that i dont run into problems

8398839
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
problem is there is no way to set outerheight when we set height width of an element the height width is actually inner height width without taking margin into consideration while when we want to resize parent we need outerheight but we cannot set back the outerheight that easily

8398839
children	parent
my calculatesize and layoutchildren are two separate methods and two separate algorithms because parent will be resized to sum of all children s height

8398850

stdout	stderr
encodings exit site stdin stdout stderr and traceback features

8398850

width	height
using this code block you can set the custom width and height of the page but if the width exceeds 520px the page will show the scroll bar at the bottom

8399000
min	max
another way to reduce excessive memory usage would be to find the min and max values used o n and then create the array to suite that number of values remember to offset the array position by the min value

8399008
gmail	hotmail
if gmail in sender_address or hotmail in sender_address or yahoo in sender_address or aol.com in sender_address

dlsym	dlopen
compile your own python with a dynload patch that prefer to not dlopen your module but use directly dlsym to check if the module is already in memory

8399048
width	height
unfortunately the 100 only works for the width for the height my contents are vertically squeezed if i don t set a value in pixels..

8399095
width	height
all i want is to be able to create this structure from blank page using only 6 sizes of width resizable height and sortable items

8399104
width	height
you have to change height and width of widget in appwidget provider file as per below

8399107
margin	height
this means that the iframe cannot generate height on its own so you have to set the height of the and tags to 100 also set their margin and padding to 0

8399110
google-chrome	firefox
i can t manage to resize the windows neither in google-chrome or firefox

8399120

strlen	strstr	atoi	strlen	atoi	strstr
you can use strstr to find the spot in str then move the char pointer forward strlen content-length positions then read the value using atoi

8399264
ubuntu	debian
if this is an ubuntu or a debian based system a simple sudo apt-get install icecast2 should install the server for you without polluting your system

8399399
google-chrome	firefox
10x faster in google-chrome and 2x faster in firefox for me

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
what i do is only execute the mouseover mouseout functions when the two elements target and related target do not share a parent

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
solved my problem a-ok because what i want to fire for mouseover and mouseout events will only happen when the elements don t share a parent - exactly how i intended on displaying the popups anyhow

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
this ensures that if i mouseover the popup it keeps it alive because the divcreator mouseout will fire and when i mouseout of the popup it disappears

8399408
mouseover	mouseout
however with this method whenever i mouseover a child element it detects a mouseout event from the parent element divpopup and closes the div

8399421
width	height
trying to set width and height for an empty movieclip will always returns 0

8399437

8399643
gtk	cairo
like bezies scaling rotating and shearing the coordinate system and so on the way to go is to use cairo + python + some display library which might be pygame gtk or qt

multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo
all operations are meant in that field you should do every single addition multiplication or inversion modulo p

8399795
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
this implies computing one division and two multiplication and a few subtractions all operations being done on integers modulo p as explained above

8399795
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
division and inversion modulo p are relatively expensive a modular division has typically the same cost as about 80 multiplication so in some situations we use projective or jacobian coordinate systems

8399795
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
with jacobian coordinates the addition of two points is done in a dozen field multiplication and no division at all

uiview	subviews
those subviews could be uiimageviews or standard uiview that you then continue to draw by subclassing the subviews s drawrect

8400014
uiview	subviews
then it would be trivial to animate those subviews using uiview s animation methods

8400061

together with each image is a link with a width and height of 16px and a background image of a cross

8400077
folder	directory
the stylesheet is in the webcontent folder so in exactly the same directory as the index.jsp

post	put
it is a good idea to not to accept requests with the payload if they are not post or put

8400120
portrait	landscape
build two interfaces one for portrait and one for landscape but i found it awfully tiresome to devise some methods that enable one view controller to keep up with the other so when the device is rotated the second view controller knows where to pick up the story

8400141
equals	gethashcode
you can also just override the equals object method from system.object if you do this you should also override gethashcode see here

8400143
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as you can see in the picture below my uiviewcontroller is not a uinavigationcontroller it s a common uiviewcontroller

8401553
cvs	svn
this shows a workflow different from the classic centralized server such as cvs or svn

8401553
pull	push
superficially it looks similar as you pull the source from a central git server but you push your commits to the gerrit server that can compile and test the code to make sure it works before eventually pushing the changes to the central git server

8401561
jboss	glassfish
java servlets run in some kind of container tomcat jboss glassfish jetty etc which needs to be running to serve request

i have upgrade to versioning 2 and it seems the registries have been broken

8402264
portrait	landscape
after reading a few articles about android configuration i still don t know how to not launch an async task when i change the view from portrait to landscape

8402345
hide	show
option one instead of a clone generate serverside and then hide until needed - change the display to show them when you need them

8402358
post	get
that post will get you some html formatting that you could guess at

8402368
stdout	stderr
the operator redirects both stdout and stderr

8402369
pdfbox	itext
that s something a lot a libraries do quite fine such as itext and apache s pdfbox

8402369
pdfbox	itext
we tried several pdf libraries pdfbox itext pdfjet and more but all need at least those libraries and fail to encrypt our in-memory byte of a pdf

8402424
packets	multicast
for instance multicast requires that you send an igmp join packets that contains the multicast group you want to receive

packets	multicast
on the multicast sender server use this command to send test multicast packets to 239.255.0.1

8402424
packets	multicast
on the multicast receiver client use this command to listen to test multicast packets sent to 239.255.0.1 on eth0

8402453
folder	directory
the folder of my dev repo actually represent different areas on the live site which are not in the same directory structure

8402453
folder	directory
i would have just made the post-receive hook checkout to the parent folder whose child is the server s documentroot but my dev repo s directory structure does not map one-to-one to the live server s directory structure

8402453
folder	directory
where each folder of the tree should map to in the live site directory file structure

8402460
spaces	delimiter
french by default uses spaces as thousands delimiter for some reason - thus the if statement

8402496
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout	hide	show
just use fadeout and fadein instead of show and hide

8402500
int	double
putting the compilable code into a nested loop one would expect result to increment by 1 with each iteration because math.random always returns a double whose value is less than 1 and when added to an int the fractions part would be lost due to precision loss

8402581
int	double
1.999999 will be rounded to 1 but 1.9999999999999999 will be rounded to 2 but the double + operator rather than the cast to int

8402592
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	debugging
i can tell from debugging that the bodies goes back to sleep but chipmunks timestep solver query initially takes 25 of the running time and 50 after playing a level according to instrumentation time profiling

8402609
post	get
the http spec only states get post cookie and header

8402622
ienumerable	ienumerator
the issue you are seeing is likely not because of the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces but rather with the underlying resources you are using to produce values

8402627
textview	simplecursoradapter
i am using a simplecursoradapter called adapter and i want the textview to bold and the background to change when an item is clicked

8402683
int	double
the details of an ieee math implementation point out the loss of precision and unreliable results from double float to int conversion

8402688
int	double
the operation math.random + 1 creates double result that is then assigned to int variable that produces int result

8402699
ireport	subreports
so i accidentally those times i were a novice user of the ireport tried to generate the subreports from scratch

8402741

i tried to write some code in reply to eulerfx s reply but i couldn t get it to work so i ll put it here

8402831
textblock	itemscontrol
the default itemscontrol displays a vertical stackpanel containing a textblock for each item in a collection

8402861
implements	sealed
c# allows any explicit cast from any reference type s to any interface t provided s is not sealed and provided s does not implements t. this behavior is specified in section 6.2.4 of the language spec

8402864
button	checkbox
and then i just called the following javascript to create the jquery checkbox button

8402890
subtract	add
...but it should always add or subtract relative to the original value if that makes sense

8402925
getter	setter
my approach so far was to extend jaxwsproxyfactorybean and override the create method and provide setter and getter for parameters like timeout

8402936
nunit	moq
and then using nunit i d guess the moq version would work just like you have it .

8403114
min	max
amount of entries in result set equals amount of months between min value from both open_date and close_date columns of table from db and max value from same columns

8403114
min	max
the problem is how to find min and max value from two date columns then generate dates from min to max and then use this temporary table or what it would be to count number of open and closed entries for every date from temporary table

8403157
post	get
i m using jquery to get value from a select box so i can than post it to a php script via ajax

8403205

8403250
versioning	upgrade
the best option is probably to upgrade to a newer versioning of pelops

8403261
int	double
i believe that casting a double as an int causes them to be rounded with bankers rounding

8403310
post	get
i have read the documentation about using the http post on the app_id tabs but i couldn t get my head around it

8403329
integer	fractions
q is the integer part of y without its fractions digits

8403342
int	double
get rid of the int cast to see more closely what the double representation of your literal is going to be before it s casted to int

8403353
put	get
but in short the double value is store as few parts that are put togather to get final result image something like -1.23 10 -15

8403358
easymock	powermockito	mockito	easymock
this probably won t help you but if you were using mockito or easymock you could add powermockito which allows you to mock the construction of new objects in your code under test

8403378
mpfr	mpc
the mpc mpfr ppl and cloog libraries don t vary the header files depending on the architecture word length

8403385
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the solution should work in the latest versions of safari google-chrome and firefox and if possible also in ie9 although there is probably little hope

8403386
floating-point	integer
the new radix-16 floating-point divider with variable latency radix-16 integer divide capability replaces the merom radix-4 floating point divide and radix-2 square root and integer divide hardware

8403386
integer	radix
a google search on radix 16 integer divide gives some very good information

8403423
hide	show
i was thinking of having an option menu to hide and show it

8403428
disk	ram
edit rather what you want is a ssd solid-state-disk for your build workspace to get a 10x improvement-in-speed or a ram disk for a 100x improvement-in-speed for builds not kidding 64mb ram on an lga2011 socket gives you a 32mb ram disk which is what we use.

8403508
folder	directory
i m trying to get a list of files from a folder in the src main resources directory of my webapp

8403520

are tests are run using testng not junit and we are running the surefire plugin maven-surefire-plugin

8403612
d3.js	protovis
note d3.js is actually a rewrite of protovis

8403662
remoteview	chronometer
i also know how to use chronometer and progressbar inside of remoteview

8403680
width	height
if you want to get the width and height before your activity has added it to its view hierarchy measured and layed it out you will have to call measure on the view yourself before calling getmeasuredwidth or getmeasuredheight

8403680
width	height
as the measured width and height are set after measure has been called which in turn calls onmeasure they will return 0 before this point

8403705
getter	setter
so it wasn t until i had added and began testing the new custom methods not setter getter that i started to get the error

8403769
int	chars
since there is no chars type in python you should store your chars as int not as one-character strings

8403771
ssl	https
you need to configure these options in the https virtual hosts too where you have configured your ssl settings

8403825
entities	entitymanager
manager - as the name suggest which manages things in your code like entitymanager it manages entities transactionmanager - it manages transaction

8404047
oncreate	ondestroy
these dbadapter are typically allocated in activity oncreate and released in ondestroy

8404196
ready	each
if you load inline images each event.function like ready load and so on will make the images available

8404247
gridview	objectdatasource
so i have a page that contains a gridview the girdview obtains it s data from an objectdatasource via web service

8404326

8404425
pushviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
i am trying pushviewcontroller and modalviewcontroller not able to render other view

8404437
queue	fifo
the only effects you might notice are for example if you change the queue from fifo to priority or vice versa

8404437
put	get
in this case the get put and trigger attributes are considered run-time and are only set when the queue is first defined

8404437
put	get
so once you enable get and put on the queue these attributes and the function of the app are never disturbed by subsequent script runs

8404487
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
this works perfectly in vba and vb6 but vb.net doesn t accept nulls

8404614
width	height
if the form is minimized when you add the product everything works as normal but if you open the cart so it is showing the content then you add a product so as to update the content shown the whole form disappears i assume it loses its created width and height

8404622
metaphone	soundex
as starters i have tried levenshtein soundex metaphone similar_text but none of them looks promising to me

8404624
inline-functions	inlining

for my windows settings the scrollbar width height is 17px

8407403

this is why you see the div width and height 378px 361 + 17 and 117px 100 + 17

8407415
public	protected
if so then maybe you could just have public protected methods to set clickhandler s for each button

8407579
websphere	ibm
i don t know of a server implementation in either of those languages at this time but ibm provides websphere mq which supports mqtt clients and ships both java and c clients - since you mention a c# server i assume you are looking for a windows-based server and wmq can certainly run on windows

8407589

if i try to print out the strings stored in input before fork everything seems to be in order but after fork input doesn t longer contain the strings it should have and therefore execvp doesn t execute properly

8407681
google-chrome	firefox
all of that works fine in firefox but in google-chrome when the user clicks on the dropdown the call is made but the dropdown does not populate

8407711
width	height
if you delete those and correctly set the height width and alignment properties the divider and splitter should show up properly

8407716
google-chrome	firefox
so far as i can see this is a legitimate program but although ie9 runs it firefox emits some text then hangs infinitely loops whatever while google-chrome shows only the h1 firefox declined to do so and the last string

8407732
strdup	malloc
an alternative is to use strdup on tok_inline which uses malloc to make a duplicate of the string

8407831
width	height
there you can set the scroll width and height of your webview as needed

8407834
postgresql	mysql
there are several good free databases out there like mysql and postgresql so you can relatively easily grab one and play with it

8407840
translation	localization
i incorporated a gettext-like localization system in my app but my translation function looks like this

8407867
translation	localization
implementing a general scheme for handling expressions of the type â œn itemsâ is not simpleâ cldr gives you sets of rules but you would need to code them and in translation you would need to request for all the relevant inclined forms of a noun like â œitem.â if such expressions occur in some specific context s only it might be feasible to reformulate things so that you donâ t say â œn tickets leftâ but â œnumber of tickets left n.â this would be much easier to implement just string localization and number localization

8408098
children	parent
at that point since the parent has closed all of its pipes any further children will have nothing to write to or read from

children	parent
then after all children have been created your parent can wait

8408115

8412266
user-controls	tabcontrol
the problem is when i downsize the tabcontrol back to some where between current 700 and minimum 500 say 600px it does not downsize the user-controls

8412278
uiview	subviews	width	height
add uiview and uitableview as subviews of uiview and then position their height width and x y position from the size inspector in interface builder or use cgrectmake in objective-c

scikit-learn	nltk
jacob perkins did a a bridge for training nltk classifiers using scikit-learn classifiers that does exactly that here is the source

8412466
dbcontext	objectcontext
because you are using dbcontext api and these methods are from objectcontext api

rss	feed
i am reading and store rss xml feed data in my database with images url and images and showing in my site url .for this i creat a function and its working well

8412517
mktime	strftime
since the functions mktime time gmtime strftime i m using to manipulate the struct tm don t seem to even look at the last two fields in the struct tm structure i simply use integers as place holders in their positions so that the size will always be the same

8412529
profiler	visualvm	profiler	yourkit	visualvm	yourkit
if you want to see what your server spends its time doing i would try a profiler like visualvm or a commercial profiler like yourkit

8412671
google-chrome	firefox
this css works as expected in firefox but google-chrome renders the text color several shades too light

put	get
since is an rvalue of type i figured that i should be able to put it in a const reference but i get this error from g++ 4.6

8412697
uiview	subviews
the likely case is that the developer created a uiviewcontroller or uiview and added it as a subviews to the scrollview s content area and set it s position accordingly so it sits in the 6th position

8412697
uiview	subviews
try not to confuse yourself too much and just realize that the uiscrollview is just a very large view that doesn t fit in the viewport you can add whatever subviews you want to that view just like you normally would on any other uiview that is entirely visible

8412771
ada	pascal
in computer programming a switch case select or inspect statement is a type of selection control mechanism that exists in most imperative programming languages such as pascal ada c c++ c# java and so on

im using teamcity with gallio xunit.net specflow and trying to display our unit acceptance test results

8412845

i have created a drawing tool where the user drag and move the mouse

8412881
mousemove	mouseup
i tried another method that when mousemove fires it only uses lineto and stroke when mouseup fires

8412970
inherited	properties
if you now set the content outside it is transferred to the label you can do the same for the image you may run out of properties though so if you want to do things that way you could inherited from comboboxitem and create more properties

8413084
for-loop	arrays
and kicks you out of the method without going back through the for-loop to check if there are any other null values in the arrays

8413150
width	margin
margin auto 0 will work only only you give width to your div

8413163
coalesce	nullif
you can use a combination of nullif and coalesce eg

8413185
screens	mdpi
according to these specifications it is a normal screens mdpi

8413185
screens	mdpi
however as its screens is set in the landscape mode wide mobile screens android does not recognize it as normal mdpi but as something else and then it tries to pull xml layout from layout dir

8413185
screens	hdpi
the main.xml layout in this directory does not envisage such unusual screens and the layout gets broken layout icons too big and probably pulled from hdpi drawable directory

8413300
sorting	grouping
any ordering grouping or sorting should be done in your controller preferably with the help of a helper method which is re-usable for different actions across the application

8413329
screens	tablet
i understand that by default pre ics to distinguish between a tablet smartphone a developer can use the sdk version in the android manifest apart from screens size and opengl filters

8413334
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-image	background-color	background-image	background-position
when you use the background shorthand property it always sets values for background-color background-image background-position and background-repeat

background-color	transparency
any values you leave out of the rule will be set to their default values which for background-color is transparency anyway

8413335

screens	tablet
the only significant differences between tablet and phones are in general screens size and the presence of telephony capabilities plus the fact that phones will generally have mobile data while tablet may be wifi-only

8413440
screens	tablet
it s not phone version and tablet version so much as little screens and big screens

8413449
screens	hdpi	screens	tablet	tablet	galaxy	tablet	hdpi
for instance the original samsung galaxy tab released before honeycomb therefore not technically tablet ready reports itself as hdpi so that graphics and layouts are selected to make it use the screens more like a phone

8413449
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

8413468
client-side	server-side
correctly you mean you wish to call a server-side routine from client-side code.

8414660
google-chrome	firefox
that code is working fine when i run it in google-chrome or in ie but when running it in firefox i get the following error

8414706

what should be done to get titles eg abc.jpg of images from a folder directory using php and storing them in an array

8414764
cpu	processors
under windows 7 on present generation processors this is a reliable high precision nanosecond timer inside the cpu hpet

8414806
getter	setter
you can replace a public val with getter and setter without changing the client code therefore you don t need the extra layer of getter and setter just in case you need it

8414806
getter	setter
the java anti pattern of private field + public setter and getter doesn t encapsulate much anyway

8414820
serializable	deserialization
if you re sending xml then you should be able to use xml serializable deserialization to perform the work for you and create a request class object

8414821
int	double
i know i can write the float or double by replacing the int in the union as a double or float set the double or float and serial.write the matching byte array

8414822
button	checkbox
when click on the edit button the checkbox will be appeared and we can make a multiple selection

8414898
put	get
i suppose you could loop and put together all of the -dxxx parameters with the next parameter and put those without a leading -d but if you have other -style parameters it can get really messy.

8414906
hide	show
simply call the hide function on dialog1 before calling show or exec on dialog2

8415258
folder	directory
all source folder will be copied to the bin directory by eclipse

8415272
folder	directory
if the files are within your project set the folder to be a source directory as suggested by the other posters

8415274
gridview	rowdatabound
just remove rowdatabound from the html page.no need of mentioning it in the gridview tag.it will work fine as it will be fired once

i ve noticed that this behaviour doesn t exist in firefox but does in safari and google-chrome

8415554
postgresql	mysql
see this wiki about migrating from mysql to postgresql

8415565
profiling	instrumentation
use the time profiling instrumentation and attach it to the finder

8415603
put	get
i can put an object-listener on it for statechanged to completion and then open another listener and try and bodge this way but it will get very messy and unreliable

8415603
udp	tcp
as a workaround i would love a tcp udp listener which doesn t hang the application for a response an event to pull on hasmoredata or a way of updatign the textbox in the main script from within the job

8415607
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox google-chrome and even ie6 but doesn t appear to clip on ie8 or 8

8415682
getter	setter
as the data1 member is private you need getter setter method to access those

8415689
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu etc. packages that contain the files needed to install some other program from source usually end in -dev libyaml-dev so try installing that

8415701

now my idea is to store the bits into a container a chars or int variable and then to output them to a file

8415701
int	chars
i know how to pack unpack bits into a chars or int using bitwise operations

8415709
mp4	h.264
all videos are mp4 encoded with h.264 720w 480h 25fps

8415715
integer	unsigned
i made some searches with google and saw a lot of table structures most of date dimension where the primary key is a simple unsigned integer

8415722
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if it has a mutable immutable pair like nsstring nsmutablestring then your getter method can return the immutable version

8415722
accessor	properties
a further note - declaring a properties as read only simply means that no setter accessor will be generated - will result in a compiler error

8415747
free	malloc
write my own malloc and free

8415749
daemon	cron
try searching for online cronjob hosted cron or similar a cronjob is one job executed by the cron daemon

8415772
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in addition your fileinputstream and fileoutputstream refer to the same file

8415792
integer	unsigned
you see a lot of examples where the primary key is a simple unsigned integer because there are many cases where there is no perfect candidate for primary key

8415812
put	get
for put and get operations openhashmap outperform hashmap by about 5 times

8415882
free	malloc
this suppose that your pattern usage of malloc free is deterministic

8415899
sum	floor
i think the best way to do this is to calculate floor sum array len array and then assess the differential required to get to this position

8415900
min	max
if you want to avoid complicated stuff like ffts you might be able to do something with min and max values over small time periods

8415959
jms	jta
i need synchronize jta transaction with send jms message - mdb should be activated after client jta transaction commit

8416056

if i put an openglview into a standard cocoa window with titlebar the bottom edges are rounded

8416059

8416076
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie and firefox but google-chrome display undefined

8416130
webkit	gecko
i can only guess on this but my assumption is that gecko and webkit use different scaling algorithms for images

8416185
speex	ogg
i checked out the fllowing pages that they all decoded ogg vorbis but no speex

8416213
pull	push
you can now push pull from your server

8416225
hash	salt
also mind that this must be a random salt not a salt derived from the password with a hash function if you do not see why then think again about what a precomputed table is about

8416240
rtp	sip	rtp	rtsp
apparently with rtp you need something like sip or rtsp to initiate a session

8416247
devise	cancan
i ve got a site which i created in rails 3.0 with devise cancan installed

8416252
profiling	debugging
don t use ad-hoc distribution provisioning profiling at debugging

8416254
getter	setter
furthermore as the ominous package name org.codehaus.jackson.map.introspect suggests jackson performs introspection on parsed classes to find getter and setter

8416259
src	attr
what i ll do is first get all those image tag s src attr into an array

8416343
put	get
but now i get this error on this bit of code from a header file i ve put it on pastebin

8416345
jar	war
this way you can use the same build to produce jar or war files for test and production servers the differences will be in the presumably already deployed configuration files

8416355
jobs	cron
to avoid the need of cron jobs

8416357
put	get
get rid of the code above put in your code and see if it prints the +

8416359
implements	extends
rather than have a generic observer looking at all module installs you should implements your own resource setup class which extends from mage_core_model_resource_setup - several core modules do this

8416412
vsts	tfs
i dont want to use vsts as my code is not in tfs

8416473
button	checkbox
when this button is clicked i am checking for the checked checkbox inside the table and then inserting data into the database corresponding to checked checkbox

8416473
button	checkbox
the problem is that it is not storing the checked state of the checkbox when the button is clicked as the button click also calls page load which calls the function below and hence all of the elements in the table are recreated

8416510
super	extends
for me this works and workoutdbopenhelper extends sqliteopenhelper and its constructor simply calls super for sqliteopenhelper

8416515
for-loop	arrays
using enumerable is slow see this for comparison of enumerable.repeat and for-loop for initialization of an arrays

8416519
pop-up	dialog
i suggest to rather do that something more specific in a javascript pop-up overlay dialog which is opened while the parent page is still kept open

8416642
min	max
min and max are for decimal types

8416649
rss	feed
but maybe there is a atom or rss feed and you can parse this one

8416649
rss	feed
this will be much more easier and you are not depending on the website layout because the rss atom feed is just about the data

8416674
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have the following tabcontrol definition with a single tabitem definition

8416674
tabcontrol	tabitem
im my app my tabcontrol will have at least a dozen tabitem like this

8416689
portrait	landscape
i would like that when an ipad or other tablet views my website it is only in landscape mode and can t rotate when ipad is in portrait mode

8416696
lme4	nlme
i feel it is due to interferences between lme4 and nlme but i don t know how to remove nlme

8416701
public	protected
finally even if scope modifiers are not mandatory public protected private because public is the default it is a good convention to always specify one

8416713
postgresql	mysql
instead of writing anything to sqlite3 postgresql or mysql etc

8416733
width	height	subtract	add
this way i do not have to subtract the width and add the height of the element

8416787
pop-up	dialog
i would hook my click event to a jqueryui dialog pop-up and then on confirm fire the delete function

8416843
lme4	nlme
it is true that there are two slightly different versions of lmlist in the lme4 and nlme packages

8416843
lme4	nlme
vice versa obviously if you want to use the lme4 version lme4 lmlist detach package nlme

8416846
apache	nginx
this alone would be easy just use .htaccess nginx or apache modules

8416898
width	height	width	font-size
i want to increase or decrease the width and height of dropdown by increasing or decreasing the size of font inside dropdown but when i increase the font-size dropdown doesn t scale accordingly

i m experementing with jackson serializable deserialization

8416915
processors	hyperthreading
1 ephemeral gc heap soh for each logical processors this includes hyperthreading 1 loh gc heap for each logical processors this includes hyperthreading

8416936
width	height
but a workaround could be to detect the size of the viewport if the width is greater than the height display normally

8416938
hide	show
just hide select and after one millisecond show it

8417017
width	height	portrait	landscape
i d like the fancybox to automatically resize the width to the size of the pdf which i should note may vary because the pdf contains landscape or portrait pages and about 90 the height of the window

8417017
width	height
unfortunately the best i ve come up with so far is a hard-coded width and setting the embed height

8417017
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome 15 and ideally i d like a solution that works across recent versions of google-chrome safari and firefox

8417023
google-chrome	firefox
it is working well on ie and firefox but it is not firing the window.open on google-chrome noting that if i open the flash without iframe the window.open works on google-chrome

8417024
stdio	fflush
how the stdio buffers are fflush is depending on the standard c library you use

8417088
cpu	hyperthreading
what hyperthreading gives one is free context switching between tasks but the cpu has only so many execution units

8419890
jobs	cron

8419983
min	max
for a step-by-step of how map reduce works please see the extras section of the mongodb cookbook recipe titled finding max and min values with versioned documents this should provide a better understanding of how map reduce works and why the output must be in the format _id some_id value some_value

8420070

from this in the calling code i can then get the actual instance put it in a map for later retrieval and use as normal

8420082

8420094
google-chrome	firefox
i did a test of displaying multiples of the same icons and zoom it it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

8420094
google-chrome	firefox
i think there is something to do with the custom zoom because in google-chrome and firefox you can only zoom it by 10 each time

8420158
gtk	gdk
in this case using ipython s tab-completion to search the gtk gdk and gobject namespaces was invaluable

8420159

8420166

for-loop	arrays
and kicks you out of the method without going back through the for-loop to check if there are any other null values in the arrays

8420240
for-loop	loops
break will cause the for-loop to break while continue will cause the code in loops to be read from top to bottom with i incremented by 1 in this case

8420249
disk	ram
however if your documents and or time spans are large it might still be better to add the compound index loading a lot of large documents from disk since your ram is already full will take some time

8420394
plot	heatmap
if you just want to compare 2 heatmap side by side on the screen then rather than combine them into one single plot you can open 2 plotting devices and arrange them side by side to compare much simpler than creating a single graph

8420394
plot	heatmap
if you need them in one file you can still save the 2 heatmap or other plot as 2 files then use tools such as imagemagick gimp or inkscape to combine the 2 files into 1 with the graphs side by side

8420410
rss	feed
whereas the tutorial from ibm s developerworks used an rss feed and localname worked perfectly for him

8420458
pop-up	dialog
in this case a status code of 403 makes a lot of sense and is homologous to the 401 case with the caveat that the browser won t pop-up a dialog asking the user to authenticate -- the form is in the page itself

8420458
pop-up	dialog
there s the un-stylable cryptic pop-up dialog lack of an elegant solution for logging out etc

8420479
daemons	systemd
i used to use sbin service start but i recently came across a systemd where sbin service did not exist so starting the daemons would fail

8420482
iboutlet	ibaction
no you can have the same ibaction and iboutlet in a uiviewcontroller dealing with textfields in two different nibs one for iphone and one for ipad

8420482
iboutlet	ibaction
just use the same uiviewcontroller as file s owner in both the nibs and make all the appropriate iboutlet and ibaction connections and everything will work

8420484
uilabel	uitextview
i think a uilabel could be fine for title and date uiimage for the image and a uitextview for the text

maven	pom.xml
how do i add this part to the maven build so that when the pom.xml file builds it generates either txt or xml report in some specific directory

i ve tried using a while do and for-loop each of which i can t get to work without getting stuck in an infinite loops

8420679

measure the browser page load time first the browser makes lots of requests ab is only telling you about one of them and usually your main page request is not the issue get page load baseline numbers from tools like www.webpagetest.org or www.gtmetrix.com for the public facing pages or browser tools yslow pagespeed or dynatrace for the private pages

8420679
google-chrome	firefox
if you look at the page load waterfall diagram the net panel in google-chrome firefox it usually shows that your html loads quickly under a sec but then everything else takes 1-3 sec to load

i can t tell from the documentation if i can specify the post or get

8421162
ienumerable	iqueryable
i started to implement iqueryable on simplifiedpodlinqbuilder as that seemed more logical than implementing ienumerable and thought i would be clever by doing this

8421212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

8421394
avr	microcontroller
you ve gotten decent generic c++ advice but for the special case of arduino on an 8-bit avr microcontroller i think you need platform-specific advice

8421466
setinterval	settimeout
initialize needs to be recursively called and you need settimeout instead of setinterval

8421485
mouseout	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousedown
my button class is very basic it provides the obligatory events like mouseover mouseout mousedown etc.

8421506

8421510
implements	extends
it also means you never have to extends surfaceview just implements renderer

8421511
width	height
if this is not exactly what you are looking for i think at least it will show you how to center an absolutely positioned div that has a width and height set on it

8421515
width	height
you need to check the height and width of the element you re centering on and set the top and left accordingly

8421515
width	height
basically we re setting the top corner at the midpoint of the target div minus half the height of the dialog and the left at the midpoint minus half the width of the dialog

actionscript	mxml

considering it works when in portrait and not landscape it probably has to do with a table being taller than one page

8423306

the objects themselves keep a parent relationship and have a hashset children collection that s lazy loaded

8423306
children	parent
this allows you to easily get the collection of parent or children for any object at any level of the tree

versioning	upgrade
in that case you ll have to convert the repo to the older versioning or upgrade your client to the server versioning in order to fix the issue

8423521
maven	pom.xml

8423576
rspec	capybara
i m using rspec capybara as my test suite

8423587
int	boolean
i think boolean are actually treated as tiny int 0 or 1

8423592
pop-up	dialog
using such an approach a routine which accepted a structure by reference and was supposed to pop-up a modal dialog and fill in the structure from it could create a pass that to the form and then copy the data from that holder back to the passed-in reference

8423600
cassini	iis
some prefer cassini over iis or want certain projects to be hosted

8423610
int	boolean
in mysql boolean is just an int 0 or 1

8423610
int	boolean
most do not implement boolean in a way that is compatible with int arithmetic so the above query would and should per ansi sql generate an error

8423668
init.d	pid	freebsd	linux
really this wrapper should take care of locking to avoid launching abc.sh multiple times and should maintain its own pid file so it can be killed by a handler in etc init.d linux or usr local etc rc.d freebsd

8423670
superclass	subclassing
proper way to do abstract ui binder classes is to define a superclass that will contain logic that is common to all subclassing widgets

8423730
google-chrome	firefox
it work s fine for me on ie9 firefox and google-chrome as well

8423732
domcontentloaded	onload
an alternative is to use domcontentloaded as opposed to onload as the latter waits for all the images to load

8423736
dbcontext	objectcontext
entityobject derived types are not supported by the dbcontext api to use these entity types you must use the objectcontext api

8423761

i want to trigger the mouseenter hover mousemove anything which can bring the popup from code without any manual action

8423803
google-chrome	firefox
i was tasked by my company to research a solution for this that could function in ie7+ firefox and google-chrome

8423803

for the most part in order to gain the fixed header you need to implement fixed height width columns because most solutions involve using two separate tables one for the header which will float and stay in place over the second table that contains the data

8423860
children	parent
in this case you can put your linearlayouts into a relativelayout then add the other two layouts accordingly as children of the parent relativelayout

8423882
getter	setter
it seems like all the hibernate documentation glosses over where exactly the getter and setter should go

8423920
min	max
i think your problem boils down to this given n and k find numbers r1 r2 ... rk such that and max r1 r2 ... rk - min r1 r2 ... rk is as small as possible

8423934
post	get
i need to get multiple post in wordpress by id

8424143
put	get
you can get this same dialog box if you put the following somewhere in your code

8424148
hash	salt
also you normally don t want to use a rather short password directly as a key but instead use a longer passphrase and hash it with a salt included with in the message to derive the key

8424148
pbkdf2	hash
to avoid brute-forcing your password from the encrypted file use a slow hash function here pbkdf2 or bcrypt

8424157
int	chars
and quickly on right...right column int gives you the chars from the right of the string i used a 4 so it ll take the 4 right chars of the column specified

8424326
hash	md5
i m trying to have 3 matches of md5 hash on this string

8424339
hash	salt
you could of course also store it using a salt hash and iteration count instead if access to the full text of the password is not required

8424340
ontouch	ondraw
if the logcat stops outputting from the app and there is no anr i would hazard a guess that the problem is that the ondraw function is failing to be called and so the canvas isn t being redrawn and ontouch isn t being called when you touch the screen

8424372
put	get
i tried to put a timeout before the function to allow time to get info

8424375
stdout	stderr
are you expecting to read stdout or stderr or write to stdin

8424375
stdout	stderr
so to test this you can try the same command but with stdin stdout and stderr redirected to dev null

8424444
portrait	landscape
i have a web page that works no matter what size the viewport is so it shows up well on ipad in either landscape or portrait mode

pygtk	pycairo
right i coded this one in python with pycairo and pygtk

8424478
unsigned	short
moreover the caveat is that this fails if i change size_t to say short unsigned i guess the compiler pads the class

8424509
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
for example a jpg image will have the string jfif at offset 6 png files have png at offset 1 gif files have either gif89 or gif87 at offset 0 bmp files have bm at offset 0 and so forth

8424548
reentrantlock	reentrantreadwritelock
i implemented a reentrantreadwritelock and saw a great speedup i knew there was some lock contention in one my class and using a reentrantlock did help speed things up

8424623
children	parent
in this instance the children although contained by the parent will not be aligned with it as they aren t in the same positioning hierarchy

8424628
ssl	https
it is important as ssl part of https works way before mod_rewrite will have a chance to do anything it only kicks in when secure connection is already properly established

8424644
google-chrome	firefox
once i got it working in firefox having verified that the server-side configuration was correct applying it to ie and google-chrome was a cinch

larger web apps being built today are moving towards using an mvc framework for both client-side and server-side application code

8424788
puts	gets
the reason is because all the images are going to be different sizes so i need some jquery that gets the size of the image and then puts it in to the style of the div

8424864
google-chrome	firefox
if you have control over the browser of the user you could use greasemonkey s cross-domain ajax to get the contents of the iframe assuming firefox google-chrome

8424897
width	height
this way you ll have your play button always centered as you are absolute positioning it s top left corner in the exact half of the parent and then adjusting its position by defining negative margins by subtracting half the width and height of the button in order to correct it s position

8424908
portrait	landscape
it loads correctly in portrait mode but in landscape mode it shows class cast exception

8424952
textview	simplecursoradapter
if you read the doc for simplecursoradapter the constructor which by the way is deprecated gets as 5th parameter the ids of textview from the doc

8424961
children	parent
it may also because that what i terminated is only the parent main process but not the children process

8424961
terminate	timeout
the python program i want to call may hang for very long time so i want to check timeout and terminate it

8424965

8425042

8425116
daemons	launchd
i m trying to build a python daemons that launchd other fully independent processes

8425116
children	parent
the child processes also need to be fully independent so that if the parent process dies the children won t be killed

8425116
daemons	launchd
the original parent process can t exit because we need the launchd daemons to persist indefinitely

8425116
children	parent
after 650 spawns not concurrently the children have finished the parent process chokes with the error

8425135
filtering	grouping
i removed the where clause on inner query and instead added a grouping by dateadd dd datediff dd 0 t.ticketstart 0 so i could expose date for filtering in my outer query

8425137
put	get
after your feedback i put together this jquery which i have no idea if it works or not but should get you started

8425155
int	chars
in my program the first struct has a unsigned int and the second struct has chars array of 81 elements

8425155
int	chars
the larger scale model based on this program idea will have two unions consisting of many structs as members as each struct will have many members of various data types short int chars arrays and etc which will be passed as a argument to a function

8425160
children	parent
find the parent and then its children

8425173

going deeper a std ostream uses the locale facet put function to print an integer â 27.7.3.6.2 ostream.inserters.arithmetic 1 and its implementation locale facet do_put

8425199
libstdc++	libc++
so far we see that showpos and showbase are not exclusive in c++ and the actual formatting behavior is defined by printf though the implementation doesn t need to use printf libc++ uses sprintf while libstdc++ does not which we have to check the c standard

8425272
int	double
it sounds like your field type is not actually a double but an int

8425272
int	double
your query tries to implicitly unbox an int as a double causing the cast error

8425275
post	get
you can try to get your first blog and use the blog id to filter post like that

your second children are being properly handled by init 8 -- their parent is dead so they are re-parented to init 8 and init 8 will clean up after them wait 2 when they die

8425446

for-loop	loops
you could use a while loops instead of a for-loop

8425724
calloc	malloc
if you would like to increase the chance that memory can be returned to the os try allocating your entire array with a single malloc or calloc call and dividing it up into all the sub-arrays yourself - large single allocations often get special handling that as a side effect makes them easy to return to the os

8425724
boost	allocator
i would recommend just using a library that does this kind of contiguous multidimensional array allocator and lookup for you such as the boost multidimensional array library

8425751

children	parent
i almost have this working except i cannot seem to remove the arrow icon when a parent no longer has children

8426159
children	parent
to create the arrow icon i add the class arrowopen to any parent that has children and use the jquery ui change event to remove all instances of the class and then re-apply the class each time the list is sorted or changed

8426183
children	parent
the best you can do is determine a way to limit selection only to these p elements with the same parent and then select the p children that are not .green_guys

8426183
children	parent
this will not match anything if none of the children of the parent element have the class

8426211
jobs	cron
usually cron jobs aren t run from the same directory where your php lives so it s possible that it is running but the output file is being created elsewhere

8426264
gridview	detailsview
however instead of going this route i would rather design a user control that would probably show edit ui by capturing gridview edit event - for example you may use gridview and detailsview together

8426296
width	height
this custom control only works in a fixed height width

8426296
width	height
i try to specify the width height for this custom control the windowsformhost but since wpf size is resolution-independent the control got scaled and ruined the position

stdout	stderr
now when i run this one-liner on my laptop i get nohup ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout

8426392

progressive enhacement see link means that you code for the old browser first ie6 7 with without javascript is a good starting point using tried-and-tested technologies such as html4 and css1 then add enhacement as you progress through testing on more modern browsers down to google-chrome and safari on mobile devices which support css3 and most of html5

8434998
comparator	comparable
and if you make the class comparable you can implement the int comparator citytemperatureinfo other method which would allow you to simple call sort on your list

8435031
width	height
notice that when in landscape orientation the device width and height do not change this was at least to me a bit counter-intuitive so it might be that the ios devices give unexpected info sometimes

8435048
min	rank
assuming that it is the latter situation you will need to join to a subquery or view that returns the min rank for each user category

8435062

8435177
put	get
the same table is getting a tablockx put on it in both cases but with variation 2 i get a deadlock when multiple sessions concurrently execute this code

8435529
put	get
but when i put all these in a single project i get lots of error

8435546
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals

8435571

supports addition subtraction with other money object

8435695
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller relationship uiviewcontroller push segue uitableviewcontroller

post	get
in general we would seperate our get actions from our post actions in mvc

8435804
modifiers	sealed
as sealed when applied to a class the sealed modifiers prevents other classes from inheriting from it

8435804
public	protected
it gives you warning because practically it make no sense because after declaring a class as sealed you can t inherits it and as your method is protected so you can t access it outside the class using it s object and keep also in mind that you can t create a child class of this so you can t use this method by that trick also .so practically it makes no sense to making it protected so compiler gives you a warning but if you make it as public or internal then it will not gives you error because it s useful in that case

8435822
int	double
the simplest being using an int float double or if you are feeling extra precise bigdecimal

8435828

8436137
button	checkbox
i have an if statement that neds to check if the control passed is a checkbox or a radio button

8436137
button	checkbox
this fails as the checkbox and redio button derive from the same class so how would i check if the control is a checkbox or a radio button

8436184
min	max
since you say the digits are a min of 4 and a max of 5 here m 4 n 5

8436224
put	get
in this case only a get is allowed on the file content and file metadata and to update either one a new file has to be put

8436227
maya	blender
i use blender for cutscenes for personal projects since it s free at my work place we use maya and 3ds max but the idea is the same

sorting	filtering
i need it to have multi-column sorting predicate filtering and a priority on performance

8436348
hash	md5
it s been a while since i messed with oauth but i think you just need to include a randomly-generated string i think i used the system clock time concatenated onto the requested username and md5 hash the result as the nonce for each request you make

8436372
google-chrome	safari
i ve tried setting the new location with the hash tag in javascript and it works in google-chrome but doesn t work in safari

8436508
portrait	landscape
it displays the portrait perfect but in landscape it is too small

8436512

however annotating the scala val with scala.reflect.beanproperty will produce java-style getter and setter methods

8436513
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the application works perfecty in firefox google-chrome opera and ie9

8436566
onclick	clicklistener

8436587
range	max
memory addresses just start from zero to its max range

8436587
calloc	malloc
sbrk in linux virtualalloc in windows but you will be accessing them usually through c s malloc or calloc

8436589
folder	directory
because you say the default directory for files is your documents folder i m assuming you are using the second method because idle.app sets documents as its current working directory which becomes the default directory for open s and save s and is automatically added as the first directory on python s sys.path the list of directory that python uses to search for modules when import ing

8436602
int	chars
limit - optional int to limit the max chars

8436623
getter	setter
also if defining a class make sure to provide a no-argument constructor and getter setter methods if data elements are not publicly accessible

8436636
google-chrome	safari
this works for me in google-chrome v16b and safari v5.1 on windows

8436636
google-chrome	safari
again verified to work in google-chrome and safari

8436642
set	bag
since you stated in your comments that the array is a result of a db query you can simply include the bag value in your result set by adding select bag as type to your sql statement

8436649
versioning	upgrade
the end goal for me is to upgrade from 2.2.2 that i have no to the latest versioning

8436666
ssl	https
i have enabled the ssl piggyback -option and can connect to it via https

8436799
children	parent
example 1 if i select a parent range of 1 10 and child ranges of 1 2 and 2 10 i would have a gap of 0 meaning the range in the parent range has been completely filled by it s children

8436814
put	get
i create with my code text file called test.txt then i get text from system file with cat command and this text put to my test.txt but i don t know how to read the text from this file

8436854
int	double
int string double

8436855
post	get
as you get stuck feel free to post more questions

8436875
post	get
when you submit a page your browser will just perform a get or post request to the page listed under the action attribute of the form unless there is javascript going on

8436875
post	get
you can just write a php script that will successively make get or post requests to the action url with the email as data

8436903
children	parent
example parent 1-10 children 1 2 5 8 gap 3 4 9 10 because of this i would just suggest you write a thing which can subtract one range from another then apply it to the parent for each child

8436917
hide	fadeout
when i was doing fadeout tests for another question it seemed to hide and collapse the element

8436934
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i would use homebrew macports fink or a manual installation

8436941
hide	show
what s left is you ll have to add stying for .morereleases so that it show using display block or something when .backcat is hidden and hide display none when .backcat is show

8436963
prepare	execute
the problem is that the prepare sql statement is not binding in values parameters or even passing them through the execute function

8436963
bindparam	bindvalue
as i said i have tried bindparam bindvalue and this method all without result

8436987
subtract	add
finally subtract the second number of the last range from the second number of the parent range add to running total

8437051
client-side	server-side
i wouldn t have thought so as php is server-side and xmlhttprequests are client-side

8437054
submit	submission
alex is right your submit button is submission the form

8437056
fflush	gets
call fclose fp or fflush fp to make sure content of file buffer gets fflush to the file

8437087
public	protected
for example with this you can list all public and protected properties

8437087
inherited	properties
you can use reflectionclass getparentclass to get the parent class and then compare the properties of your class with the properties of the parent class to see what was inherited

8437089
piston	tastypie
having implemented api s with piston tastypie and django webmachine django tastypie rocks

8437089
piston	tastypie
so that leaves piston which is picking up some activity and tastypie that has a lot of momentum and activity

8437089
piston	tastypie
piston is a bit more flexible but tastypie is moving very fast and in my opinion has a really easy api

8437095
inherited	properties
it appears you ll have to look at all the parents manually to get the inherited properties

8437137
terminate	timeout
the call itself must terminate at some time implementing its own timeout but blocking calls are usually trouble gethostbyname because then it s up to their or system timeout not yours

8437149
post	get
my problem is that i don t know how to get the system call parameters from the data that i have in the post handler the struct pt_regs

8437190
config	ini
below is a c# example piece of code that describes how to access the config data from the ini file from the file above

8437194
hide	show
instead of removing fragments when i add new ones i just hide them then show them when i want to display them again

8437199
post	get
if it was restful you d also have extensive use of http get for doing reading of things with content negotiation to determine the format â the representation â to deliver the values as proper use of http verbs for the true meaning not everything is a post

8437271
put	get
i quickly put this together but if you can combine the two queries you will get exactly what you were looking for

8437322
post	put
i struggled with this as well so put together the following blog post when i finally got it working

8437338
int	double
i have an abstract base class dataobject which just provides type information currently double int bool and is inherited by the specific data containers like

8437373
post	put	post	get	put	get
i put together a blog post outlining the steps i took to get diagnostics working with sdk 1.6

8437467
slackware	suse	redhat	fedora	postgresql	mysql	freebsd	opensuse	freebsd	debian	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
i can use debian fedora freebsd mandrake opensuse redhat slackware suse or ubuntu with firebird mysql or postgresql

8437474
width	height
what i want to do is use javascript or jquery to detect the height of the images in the slideshow which changes depending on the width of the browser and then set the header s height to that value thus eliminating my crappy css bandaids that aren t really working in the way i need them to

8437485
width	height
one option is to make derive from a non-generic interface idrawing that has height and width properties then change your actions to be of type

8437494
width	height
then use a setbounds xpos ypos width height

8437496
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you need to do what you do in viewdidload in viewwillappear

8437497
min	max
the idea is that any number less than min or more than max is removed

8437529
min	max
in chrome 15 when using the element as a text field leading zeros 011 are removed even if the number entered does not break the validation rules min max

8437594
pop-up	dialog
in the pop-up dialog set caps lock key to no action

8437655
rubygems	bundler
since i am not using a bundler i had to add require rubygems at the beginning of my list of requires

8437667
zoo	xts
for this type of data you d be better off using the packages xts extensible time series or zoo z s ordered observations - where z is the initial of one of the package authors

8437671
children	parent
then a call to save in the controller runs saves on the parent object and all of its associated children

8437755
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
within this lone record the return value of count will always be a non-null integer while the return values of the other aggregate-functions such as min max and sum may be null

8437755
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
so whether you re calling count min max or sum it is important to understand not only the return values of individual aggregate-functions but also the return value of the query itself and what that result set contains

8437767
int	double
things get hairier when you start allowing int + double though

8437833

i m trying to post some of the work i ve done in an eportfolio thus trying to put code online

8437872
fadein	fadeout
it also comes with extras like fadein and fadeout effects

8437913
calloc	malloc
the code as edited is essentially correct though i have several stylistic differences with you such as not doing a typedef to hide the pointerness of an object not using the size of the allocated object in the malloc calloc call and a few other things

8437925
hide	show
this will hide the status bar until the user clicks along the lower edge of the screen in which case the status bar will get show it ll get hidden again after a few seconds

8437930
rss	feed
i m having some troubles with the rss feed parser i made based on saxparser

8437932

you have to put mail.jar in the common lib folder usr share tomcat6 lib get rid of the mail.jar in the web-inf lib folder restart tomcat6 and it ll start working

8437947
int	double
i am not sure i got your problem right but if you have m parametric types ... and n simple types int double ... you would need m n actual implementations if you want to support all combinations

8437959
int	double
zeros work in this case because they re convertible to each of the numeric formats int double float etc

8438081
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
then in the uitableview i am handling the gestures through touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

8438112
post	get
this is called post redirect get pattern and here goes a short example of it

8438133
sorting	grouping
you need to select with a max to get the latest time rather than sorting do a left join to compare data in the other table and a having as an argument to grouping by to only select the appropriate data

8438138
opengl-es	glkview
glkit aims to simplify some of the setup required for displaying opengl-es material by providing helper classes like glkview

pull	push
problem after setting this up the push and pull works fine it presents no errors but i don t actually see the changes show up either on my local machine or on the server

8438190
idictionary	ilist
if you intend to call a method without knowing the exact generic types for the generic ilist or idictionary then you ll have to use methodinfo.invoke

8438193

8438331
post	get
for example i want to get all the post that are about nike

8438340

8438360
outputstream	inputstream
these are implementations of the interfaces inputstream and outputstream that read from and write to a byte array in memory

8438372
nsdata	nsoutputstream
next convert it to read from your nsdata and write to an nsmutabledata possibly using nsinputstream and nsoutputstream as suggested in my comment below

8438413
bmp	png
it can read most common image formats bmp jpg png etc

8438418
google-chrome	safari
i m not sure if it s a webkit or google-chrome issue since i can t use safari on linux.

8438424
google-chrome	firefox

8438483
google-chrome	firefox
the situation is that there are two browsers firefox and google-chrome

i am working on a wordpress blog and i need to be able to put blog post into a tree structure underneath categories

8438765
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so to start off each tab i assume you re talking about a uitabbarcontroller will have it s own uinavigationcontroller- uiviewcontroller

8438807
screens	tablet
for tablet sized screens you tend to end up with one or some small number of activities and more fragments and you swap out part of the ui with different fragments

8438807
screens	tablet
traditionally you d use a different activity for each screens but does that still make sense seems annoying and tedious to have if tablet swapfragments else startactivity logic everywhere

8438816
sum	coalesce
coalesce table2.count 0 avoids the value passed to sum from nulling out if that s what you re asking

8438841

inherited	properties
normally - dependency properties are not inherited in silverlight they often are in wpf

8441365
inherited	properties
this is likely why these are not mentioned in the silverlight msdn article on dependency properties value precedence but the wpf version of the article mentions inherited value as lower priority than the local value or style setters

inherited	properties
background dependency properties unfortunately is not inherited so your background will remain as is

8443541
mouse	keyboard	opera	firefox
firefox and opera have no such event and all you can do is detect selection changes made via keyboard and mouse events which is unsatisfactory there is no way of detecting select all from context or edit menus for example

8443541

also as mentioned in answer by inu ienumerable is not supported - at least lazy loading proxies demand icollection and i m almost sure that it is global requirement as mentioned in linked answer

opera	google-chrome
see this example in google-chrome or opera or ipad

because httpwebrequest and webclient don t render pages so i can t redirect to the page i want i need to use a webbrowser

8444797

where you have to decide whether you allow nulls for these columns then you need to use coalesce or nvl or whatever function your database provides for dealing with comparisons with nulls or set boundary values for these columns where you can be sure age will always fall in between

8444815
int	chars
chars in the chars array buf and return in the int

whenever i have to add some component a to the ajaxrequesttarget of another component b usualy both children of the same parent i face the same decision

8445268

only rest uses get as well as various other http methods including post

8445268
post	get
thanks for this i was using get because an empty web-service call was was made when i use post

8445355
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to the current versioning 1.7.1 i think you will find this error message no longer exists

8445363
subnet	packets
maybe you can send a udp packets with some hello request to all ips in your subnet and when the server receives it he responses with an ack paket

8445388
maven	pom.xml
btw intellij has built in support for maven so just open pom.xml from it - and everything will be ok

8445405
width	height
i already tried to use joe blow s code but it really works for objects that have the same width and height

8445432
width	height
the reason i think for that is because i am recreating datagridview after each resize to have cells stay the same width height and fill all the space

8445494
folder	directory
the more efficient way i found in dealing with millions of folder and files is to capture directory listing through dos command in some file and parse it

8445547
nsstring	nsdata
ensure that you have the json in an nsstring not an nsdata

8445556
coalesce	isnull
the exact clause for your statements may be different - you may be able to replace the case statement with an isnull or coalesce to make it easier to manage

8445578
opera	firefox
opera and firefox for android do support svg so that s something you could investigate if it s acceptable to require your android users to download a browser

8445578
svg	vml
i m looking into dojo s dojox.gfx which provides an abstraction across svg vml silverlight and canvas

8445651
rss	feed
i am trying to parse the following rss feed

8445674
implements	extends
if your array is null 0 terminated it would be reasonably easy to use extends to implements the java iterable interface too rough untested example

also when i add in there it doesn t get removed even if i add a function as the second parameter of show it still doesn t hide the button

8445789
int	chars
the console.read method returns only a single chars wrapped in an int so that is only applicable if you are reading a number that is only one digit long otherwise you ll always get only the first digit

8445789
int	chars
since the return value of read is actually a chars you cannot use it directly as an int you would need to parse it from chars to int

8445822
for-loop	loops
the natural approach for the first requirement is to use a dict so i can loops over keys values or items with a for-loop but for the second requirement it seems more appropriate to use a class hierarchy and let the attribute lookup mechanism to do the work plus i get other goodies like being able to use properties for some values

8445866
gson	jackson
you tagged your question with gson but i would recommend you the jackson library instead because i saw your last two questions and seems like gson is not flexible enough for you

8445867

i often verified if the alarm is set as intended using adb shell dumpsys alarm which it is

8445890
dictionary	map
map character set string - maps chars a to z which each have a set containing all the words from dictionary that contain that letter

8445890

if the user selects a the set of a is removed from the dictionary and the map is rebuilt awaiting the user to remove another letter

8445929
hash	md5
you could use a hash like sha-1 md5 etc and crop it to the correct size 128 192 or 256 bits or use pbekeyspec instead of secretkeyspec

8445952
children	parent
where the properties for the parent and child are called parent and children respectively

8445957

if sqrt is implemented as a special case of pow that will save you a multiplication

8446089
sorting	filtering
provides the general table functionality like - filtering sorting copy paste

8446140
children	parent
the only problem with this approach is that i d need to save the path even for branches that don t have a parent children of root

8446223
children	parent
if you want to move an item relative to its siblings but remain under the same parent you can use treeview_sortchildrencb and pass a custom sort function that orders the children the way you want

8446333
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
2. use css properties which are limited to some browsers firefox use a set safari some others not sure if google-chrome use yet another set

8446341
post	get
some hints and functions to get you started as i won t post my entire script it does not fully do the trick but not far away

8446354
implements	extends
this all works as expected so we set up a class called hangoutmanager that extends a baseadapter we have implements several methods in there such as add remove and exists

8446373
hide	show
show hide

8446389
floor	sqrt
high floor element sqrt |u| floor 3 sqrt 9 floor 1 1

8446395
getter	setter
there are some cases when public makes no difference or having a getter and setter is unnecessary

8446396
width	height
you could in theory always use cgrectintersection ball platform instead and check the width and height of the resulting rect to be 0

8446420
outputstream	inputstream
you should realize that transferring bytes is after all just a matter of reading an arbitrary inputstream and writing it to an arbitratry outputstream

8446456
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in firefox not in google-chrome

8446476
google-chrome	safari
use webkit s safari google-chrome inspect element

8446486
getter	setter
jpa 2.0 doesn t provide a general way to do it except for creating separate getter setter for different representations of the same field

8446491
namedtuple	dictionary
also namedtuple have a number of useful methods such as _fields to get the names of the used and an _asdict method which returns an ordered dictionary of the namedtuple contents

8446503
profiler	shark
until os x 10.7 i used the shark profiler to profile my implementation which worked rather nicely

8446503
profiling	instrumentation
apparantly the time profiling in instrumentation doesn t use dtrace anyhow so the only option left is to write our own dtrace script or instrumentation

8446503
profiling	instrumentation
despite what people say online instrumentation does not use dtrace for everything specifically time profiling so i can t offer you a quick fix in the instrumentation ui

8446506
post	get
the post does not get added to the post count for the new category

8446513

8446524
websphere	ibm
the place i works is an ibm shop and tends to bleed blue pretty heavy so i only know of the ibm stack which may help you with websphere but i m sure there are other products and or free open source projects you can use

8446524
websphere	ibm
an example with ibm tooling is the ibm websphere datapower appliance

8446524
websphere	ibm
ibm does not let you generate the tokens if you are not running in the container ie a websphere box

8446645
getter	setter
some other oo languages actionscript3 c# etc support true properties where adding a getter setter does not affect the signature

8446645
getter	setter
in this case if you have a getter or setter it replaces the public property with the same signature so you can easily switch back and forth without breaking code

8446647
clang	llvm
however when compiled with llvm clang i get bar nfoo n

8446656
public	protected
myclass2 needs to derive from myclass1 then it is a more specialised type of myclass1 and can access all public and protected members as if they were defined on it

8446764
stdout	stderr
since perl doesn t have a log like php you can create your own log file by redirecting perl s stdout and stderr to a file

8446785
superclass	subclassing
or converts it from superclass qstyleoption to the given subclassing

8446787

8446788
onkeydown	onblur
of course in this case we have two tests onblur and onkeydown event

8446806
inherited	properties
each of those segments will have the same custom properties however the values could come from an inherited segment a segment up the tree instead of from the segment itself

8446806
inherited	properties
if a value of a particular properties is inherited from a segment up the tree then its value is set to null

8446821
equals	compareto
as a good practice yes since equals hashcode and compareto has close meanings

8446846
zoo	xts	zoo	chron	xts	chron
somewhere in the conversion from zoo to xts the chron class information gets destroyed

8446846
zoo	xts	zoo	chron	xts	chron
if xts is supposed to handle chron objects when importing from zoo you have probably found a bug in the function xts xts

8446846
zoo	xts
so somehow in the conversion between zoo and xts the conversion code should adjust for the locale of the user

8446884
.htaccess	httpd.conf
entry can be set in php.ini .htaccess or httpd.conf

8446934
getter	setter
i have complied with all the naming convention of java and have all the setter and getter with lower case s and g

it works fine in firefox 8 and google-chrome but doesn t function as expected in ie9

8447019
pull	push
if you want modify an item inside an array i suggest to use conditional pull first and push updated item then

8447019
pull	push
thus you may need tou use operator on it and then pull push on items array

8447034
public	protected
just to illustrate that i have one private property one protected property and one public property

8447107
width	height
you need to calculate the ratio of the width to height of the original image and make sure to scale the output image so that it s dimensions have the same ratio

8447294
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
i had a similar case and solved it by splitting up the mouseover event into separate mouseenter and mouseleave events

8447306
viewmodel	caliburn
caliburn micro as an example gives you a way to access your view getview from within your viewmodel then you could get a reference to your grid and call beginedit

8447307
apache	nginx
the second block of messages means that you re running the php interpreter and most likely that is through your web server like apache or nginx as a priviliged user which is in most cases the root user

8447313
getter	setter
because i know that all the dynamic names will at least start with rec_ but then the problem with this is i do not have specific getter setter for each field because i don t know what their full names will be

8447332
pull	push
they have the ability to pull a remote branch which says it is all up to date but they cannot push to that remote branch

postgresql	mysql
on the production server i m using mysql and i m using postgresql locally so i m not sure if that s the cause of the problem

8447468

8447478
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop does not run with hadoop 0.20.2

8447505
nscoder	nsdata
you can use nscoder like nskeyedarchiver to archive the data then send the resulting nsdata

8447546
implements	extends
so the solution is extends contextloader and implements both spring s applicationcontextaware and the servletcontextlistener interface

8447565
folder	directory
it s in the hooks directory in my application folder

8447568
folder	directory
if by any chance you need to change the language instead of the error statement itself create your own form_validation_lang.php and put it into the proper language folder inside your system language directory

8447570
subtraction	addition
floating-point addition and subtraction are not associative

8447613
implements	extends
i didn t quite understand the problem but you should probably make a class mainfile extends file implements constraints there and require the user to pass a mainfile instance to zipholder factory

8447620
min	max
in sqlite this is the standard use of min max avg group_by etc

8447669
udp	tcp
on client you re using socket.sock_dgram which is udp yet you are using tcp server which would be socket.sock_stream

8447696
stdout	stderr
alternatively you could try redirecting stdout and stderr to a file iirc this will work but i don t have my phone with me to test it

8447767
min	max
personally i d stay with coredata as long as most of the app doesn t use min max avg.

8447790

uiview with uitableview as a subviews and corner radius

8447868
queue	fifo
i m currently thinking of implementing a set of fifo queue using nsmutablearray and popping the leading value every time i add a new one at the end once the array has the requisite number of entries

8447879
put	get
as soon as we put the site back up we get this error again

8447880
implements	modifiers
i would suggest you using abstract property rather than trhowing notimplemented exception in getter abstact modifiers will force all derived classes to implements this property so you ll end up with compile-time safe solution

8447937
addition	multiplication
however when i switch from multiplication to addition it looks much better

8447944
post	get
i d like to override the get and post methods in rspec

8447944
post	get
my next bsest approach is therefore to overrride get and post which are in the correct scope

8447972
getter	setter
after reading all those articles i am convinced that getter and setter are evil

8447972
getter	setter
this is the another example of getter setter in qt4

8447998
post	get
i can utilize my http interface to post string values at least 4 times as large and can get them via the telnet socket client.

8448009
subtract	add
i know i can use not to add exclussion rules when referencing a group of items but that is not the same question since i want to know if it is possible to subtract a group of elements from a different group of elements already referenced

8448049
folder	directory
the tools directory in the folder where the package is installed

8448091
hide	show
ie if the state is hidden and then you click to show the event would bubble and trigger the body handler that would then hide the .context-switch-menu again.

8448117
folder	directory
i have had this issue before and deleting the debug release folder within the obj directory of my project fixed this for me

8448173
google-chrome	firefox
if you use firefox with firebug or google-chrome and look at the console you might be able to find out more precisely what s going wrong

8448194
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox this works ok

8448218
post	get
i m throwing together some test code now i ll post it if when i get it working seems like a very interesting way to get around any such situation generically

8448219
stringstream	ifstream
either use a stringstream or read token by token from your ifstream

8448249
setinterval	clearinterval
the parameter for the clearinterval is an id created by setinterval and you are putting the function used by setinterval

8448252
chown	chmod
so i tried chown chmod etc

8448261
folder	directory
to truly clean visual studio of all the cr p you need to hit build then cleans solution then go and find the obj folder in your project directory and delete everything in there

8448269
jquery	jqmodal
one possible way to do this is with jqmodal but that would require you to load jquery into your project

8448304
maven	pom.xml
that said the definition of central is in the maven super pom.xml that is part of the maven installation

8448308
setinterval	clearinterval
you are trying to stop the blink toggle function while you actually should save the interval in a variable and call clearinterval on that variable as clearinterval expects an instance of the setinterval object as parameter

8448318
children	parent
the parent nodes will wait for the children nodes to pass up data before doing any merging back

8448349
setcontentview	findviewbyid
i think it should work you have to reinitialize references for example every findviewbyid needs to be called again after calling setcontentview

8448351
jtabbedpane	jtextfield
my jtextfield is on a jtabbedpane

8448370
put	get
let me know if you get stuck and i can put more effort into this

8448414
put	get
the issue is that after putting a few objects into the map and trying to retrieve with the same key used to put on the map i get a null

8448414
equals	compareto
so it seems like the issue lies with the use of compareto and equals

8448414
equals	compareto
i think the algorithm used by the treemap is sorting the map in an inconsistent manner because of the way i m using compareto and equals

8448445
int	double
as i understand check double invokes template instantiation mechanism so int check int function is really created the type of template parameter doesn t have any influence

8448471
hide	show
i m trying to combine a chained drop down list with the ability for the last selection to show hide a div

8448471
hide	show
here s the javascript i m using to show hide a div

8448502
width	height
cudamemcpy2d d_ref ref_pitch h_ref width sizeof float width sizeof float height sizeof float cudamemcpyhosttodevice

8448509
equals	compareto
i think your equals hashcode and compareto methods should only use the field that is always populated

8448510
accessor	properties
create and add the custom button label view to the cell s contentview in your init method or create and add it lazily via an accessor properties

8448511
devise	cancan
but i ve set up similar systems using the devise and cancan gems

8448585
post	get
this is the problem i am running into i post something say a photo upload to the server and get back a 301 because it is time to get a new auth token

8448594
versioning	upgrade
this allows you to make whatever changes you want install whatever modules you want and whatever versioning of perl you want without risking messing up your operating system or having your upgrade blown over in the next os upgrade

8448605
slideup	slidedown
there s no such facility for .slidetoggle so we do this manually using an basic if else clause to choose between a slideup or slidedown

8448621
int	chars
in particular it s worth dumping the exact chars values of the text by casting each chars to int before it goes into the database and after you ve fetched it

8448626
bindparam	bindvalue
use bindvalue not bindparam

8448685
adplus	procdump
tools like adplus and procdump allow you to create a dump for various conditions exception work load etc

8448685
adplus	procdump
for other situations you need to use adplus or procdump

8448705
aptana	rubymine
also i have tried if some ides rubymine aptana and netbeans and no one has a proper graphical interface to profile code

8448749
width	height
you can clearly set a height and width there

8448750
unsigned	short
i need to use void to point to unsigned short values

8448843
put	get
the problem that i have is that if i put the menu and content in different cells of one grid the menu is cropped to within its grid cell so that the drop-down menu is not shown when clicked but if i add a canvas with 2 grids having different z-indexes i can get the menu to display properly overlapping the content but the application does not resize to fit the browser window

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
there is no reason sqoop should only run with cdh and not hadoop

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
the sqoop documentation says sqoop is compatible with hadoop 0.21 and cloudera s distribution of hadoop version 3

8448861
sqoop	hadoop
fyi sqoop was made part of the hadoop 0.21 branch and has been removed from hadoop after moving it to apache incubator

8448874
unsigned	short
then you cast res to an unsigned short

8448915
width	height
for example to open the window with height set to 400px and width set to 300px

8448988
qpainter	qimage
i would start with qimage and qpainter and see if the graphics speed is the limiting step before starting to optomise

8449012
unsigned	short
is a cast on a pointer res is a memory address by casting it to an unsigned short you get the address value as an unsigned short instead of hexadecimal value to be sure that you are going to get a correct value you can print

8449012
unsigned	short
the first cast makes a cast on pointer to a pointer on unsigned short

8449013
windows	wow64
part of the windows wow64 layer is to emulate a 32-bit environment as perfectly as possible

8449020
post	get
i have set the form submit to use the post method and even if i use the get method i can see that my form data is being passed

8449043
put	get
note in c++ it is very rare to use raw pointers you normally put a pointer into a smart pointer so that it will get correctly deleted

8449075
persistent	transient
the only thing it complicates is editing persistent entities or transient entities with persistent properties you aren t allowed to serialize dirty edited modified objects

8449117
hide	show
use jquery s effects to show hide and animate the text

8449139
hide	show
to show or hide a div when the user selects from dropdownlist 2 you can use the jquery change method

8449156
squash	merge
my argument is that the merge has the same effect as a squash but includes marking the commits that were included

8449156
pull	push
if you rebase from svn push to the remote branch have colleague2 push some commits to the remote branch and then later on colleague1 does a pull merge from remote branch will the resulting merge commit mention the svn commits and therefore cause a problem on subsequent rebases

8449158
post	get
in my mvc app i have an upload view with get and post actions

8449195
width	height
the only problem i am facing is that i cannot update the height and width of these path elements

8449259
google-chrome	firefox
i already have it those pages load ok in firefox and google-chrome

8449277
pop-up	dialog
i want my main window to show up first and if the application can t find an application configuration file i want it to pop-up a dialog box to get some necessary values from the user

8449277
pop-up	dialog
if i put it in onactivated it seems to work but when i close the dialog or somehow click on the main window it pop-up another copy of the dialog

8449281
min	max
ie if you could calculate a min and max long and lat that were worth bothering to calculate

8449318
hide	show
you could hide or show whole panels or placeholders this way to swap out the whole content for specific menu items

8449360
subtraction	addition
and conveniently addition and subtraction are the same so x 8 -r x r x

8449376
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this could be websockets if you re running your server on windows 8 server with asp.net 4.5 probably a future consideration or server sent events if the client is google-chrome firefox or opera or forever frame if the client is ie

8449405
width	height
as in don t bother trying to resize it inside the .flv file simply set the height and width of the embedded .swf using css on your page and i would image in it should scale fine

8449443
width	height
you are casting the height and width properties instead of the path objects

8449448
width	height
you have to specify the width and height of the image so it covers your button and yes check the path of the image

8449475
post	get
i would like to ask you about best practise in sending data post get variable between two web services where between them is esb

8449507
firefox	safari
seems fine in firefox safari etc

8449574
post	get
esb reads post get data formats data to meet web service 2 demands

8449579
maven	pom.xml	maven-release-plugin	pom.xml
my project pom.xml is containing -snapshot dependencies so in order to perform the release automatically i want to use the following maven command based on the maven-release-plugin goals mvn release prepare-with-pom in order to prepare the project s pom.xml for releasing and resolve dependencies -snapshot versions automatically without edit them by hand

8449588
cocos2d-x	corona
in cocos2d-x i was able to just create a custom action with corona i m puzzled

8449598
int	boolean
this uses an int and an array of boolean to implement a mutex without requiring any platform support for synchronisation atomic operations

8449608
children	parent
my understanding would be that i need to implement the swipegesture across the parent uiview which contains all these children uiview

8449656
hide	show
in jquery i m doing this to show hide by using filter

8449656
hide	show
basically what s happening as far as i can see is when you select one element it works to show hide the element

8449656
hide	show
when selecting more than one it show hide properly as long as you select it in the proper order

8449662
range	max
i can t just take the max and randomize over the range

8449662
range	max
one idea i had maybe was to grab the max randomize a limit based on the max and then grab a range of 10 records from random_limit_1 to random_limit_2 and then taking the first record found in that range

8449738
hide	show
instead hide everything and then show the ones for selected colors

8449782
min	max
and add a max and min lat and long to the query as mentioned in another answer

8449804
for-loop	loops
it some times happen when i use floating point numbers in c++ and only use numbers as multiples of say 0.1 as an increment in a for-loop the actual number which is loops iterators is not exactly multiples of 0.1 but has unpredictably other added or subtracted tiny numbers of the order of 1 -17

8449856
activiti	drools	bpmn	jbpm
there are also native bpmn 2.0 solutions like activiti jbpm and drools flow but they don t really support web service messaging

8449863
inline-functions	inlining	inline	inlining
you can also disable set the compiler flag inline-functions expansion to only __inline ob1 to prevent inlining in the current module assuming you re not marking it as inline

8449924
prepare	execute
unfortunately variables can t be used in limit clause so you d have to use a dynamic query either writing the query string in code or using prepare and execute

8449960
min	max	range	min	range	max
now i have around 4k+ ids in the file and each id would have different range of distinct col1 max 165 million min 2k

8449965
maven	pom.xml
i do not have lots of experience with maven but as far as i understand i can create a pom.xml file that the user can use for downloading the last version of my project and its dependencies

8449975
std	ostream
for example to accommodate you will need to store a reference to std cout in the resulting functional object because the std ios_base copy constructor is private and it is impossible to copy construct objects of any class derived from std ios_base including std ostream

8450025
implements	extends
a useful feature of the recommended idisposable pattern is that it allows a consistent pattern for derived types extends types that implements idisposable independent of whether the base type exposes a public parameterless method called dispose

8450057
jqplot	flot
i use flot or jqplot

8450067
csv	tsv
i generally ask for the data in tsv csv or xml format

8450143
gif	png
for example to force the user to submit an image of type gif jpg png

8450209
public	protected
that s exactly why in a constructor you should never call a method which can be overridden non-final public and protected

8450223
textview	listactivity
i have a listactivity with custom rows icons textview etc

8450236
ienumerable	ilist
where you take a ilist or ienumerable of type string and return ilist

8450255
ssl	https
in most instances web sites requiring form submitted passwords use https to encrypt the posted data including the username and password back up to the server if the site doesn t use ssl then the password would be sent up in cleartext

8450255
ssl	https
afaik https is just http working on top of an ssl connection

8450255
post	get
secure forms method should be post method get would appear on the querystring

8450259
jgit	egit
i don t use jgit myself but i ve seen reports of various bugs that exist in jgit which is the backend to nbgit and egit

8450274
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing constructor method s first task is to call its superclass constructor method

8450274
inherited	subclassing
this ensures that the creation of the subclassing object starts with the initialization of the classes above it in the inherited chain

8450278
client-side	server-side
you don t really send values to javascript from asp.net. the former is client-side code the latter is server-side code

8450287
primefaces	icefaces
primefaces for mobile icefaces for mobile and others are good but the generated code is unnecessarily huge

8450294
rss	feed
i want to include my site rss feed to the page in the fbml tab

8450324
implements	extends
so the final class will extends one class and implements specified interfaces

8450324
implements	extends
and in the end i would like to have instance of class that extends iproxy and implements all interfaces that mi did implements

8450371
ssl	https
google ajax api cdn also supports ssl via https

8450371
ssl	https
microsoft cdn also supports ssl via https

8450382
onmouseover	onclick
the situation is i have a tooltip div which sits at the top of the page and is populated onmouseover or onclick by jquery based upon the trigger element

8450410
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
what i ended up doing was to change the background color of the active uiviewcontroller s view instead of the uiwindow

8450410
inherited	subclassing
apparently the simplest way to accomplish that is to have all uiviewcontroller s in the app inherited from a uiviewcontroller subclassing that implements -didrotatefrominterfaceorientation

8450510
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
this won t work if viewcontroller accesses the ivar directly but it will if it accesses the ivar through the accessor self.webview which is generally how you should access properties

8450539
width	height
someone on another question suggested comparing height and width but when getting these they are properly switched based on orientation another mystery

8450600
x86	64bit
64bit system represents the varchar 2 the same way as an x86 system

8450757
subclass	abstract-class
i also know that overriding static methods is useless because when i am dealing with say and my object has an abstract-class with a static method that gets overridden in it s subclasses t doesn t exist at runtime so objectwithid s static method would be called instead of the subclass

8450771
uilabel	uitextview
if you want to show some text in the app directly i suggest using uilabel or uitextview

8450849
uitextfield	accessoryview
i am trying to add a uiview as an accessoryview to a uitextfield but the alpha property doesnt seem to be respected

8450853
serializable	deserialization
then i could write classes that wrap the protobuf-generated classes and automatically convert these identifiers to real pointers on deserialization and back to ids on serializable

8450871
post	get
i found a post on codeplex talking about a different issue but at the bottom of the post they have a class autocompleteboxex that supports scrollintoview so you can hook up the selectionchanged even and this should get you the behavior you want

8450879
client-side	server-side
jim rush provides a pretty good overview of the pros and cons of server side versus client side logic and is pretty consistent with my discussion on this topic in my blog post client-side versus server-side development of voicexml applications

8450899
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine on ie8 and google-chrome but on firefox upto version 8 i am having a problem

8450913
qpainter	qwidget
i could set icons instead of label but now i want to wear it with some better and my teacher told me to choose from qgraphicscene + item + view or qpainter + qwidget paintevent

8450915
nsnull	nsdata	nsnull	nsstring	nsstring	nsdata
so you can see that nsnull nsnumber nsstring nsarray nsdictionary and nsdata are all serializable to json and that any class that implements -jsondatarepresentation is also serializable

8450949
post	get
use encoded either in url get or as data in urllib2.request post not both i.e

8450953
post	get
you re likely doing a get in your browser but in your code you re actually doing a post to a url with the query data and with your query data as the post data

8450953
post	get
the http request will be a post instead of a get when the data parameter is provided

8451005
post	get
i need an url to download date time information from on client s machine inside desktop application another worlds to send request to post get and get response from with current date and time in some comfort to parse format .txt or .csv for example like for example we download stocks data some intersting stuff

8451006
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit-based browser e.g google-chrome safari will always return the string auto and element.style.zindex will never return anything unless the selected element also has an explicit position css style

8451035
hide	show
so what i m trying to do is break a form into different sections and show hide using jquery

8451056
bluetooth	usb
i m trying bring up bluetooth over usb support on a new arm-based android device

8451100
put	get
when you install rvm you should get instructions to put this

8451129
google-chrome	firefox
i ve set my textbox autocompletetype property to autocompletetype.email it works fine in ie but nothing append in google-chrome or firefox

8451145
hex	binary
hi i am reading in a binary file formatted in hex

8451164
width	height
find the exact height and width of the viewport in a cross-browser way no prototype jquery

8451170
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the components cross-browser support internet explorer firefox google-chrome opera safari

8451216
onmousedown	onmouseup
two events are used onmousedown and onmouseup

8451221
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome and safari will ignore is and firefox won t and it then refused to load the rest of the stylesheet creating the idea that the body styles were loading but not others

8451269
atoi	strtok
of course i can write a simple code with strtok and atoi

8451284
post	get
i was wondering what is a proper official name for the kind of route where the part of path is the parameter rather than an actual http parameter get or post

8451313
hudson	bamboo
if what you want is compatibility with continuous integration the ci_reporter gem can be used to convert test results from both test unit and rspec to the junit xml format which will make it work with jenkins hudson bamboo and other junit-aware ci servers

8451379
put	get
there are sample programs that come with mq such as amqsget and amsqput and their client-based equivalents amqsgetc or amqsputc which connect and get or put a message

8451398
internationalization	translation
i m trying to implement internationalization on my project but the pages only get translation with the language from settings.language_code

8451400
required	placeholder
one thing i ve done in the past there may be better ways is to define a placeholder in the head section of the layout and then use that to inject scripts that are only required on a small number of pages

8451404
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
i think you ll get the results you want if you change the declare the instance variable adapter the one at the top as a simplecursoradapter instead of a listadapter and then change this line from

8451476
getter	setter
if the class implements an interface with the id property you could wrap that class into yours and provide a getter and a setter

8451481
collabnet	svn
if you do not want to mess around with your ubuntu packages while you wait for them to update to svn 1.7.x one thing you can do is install the collabnet client rpm

8451538
min	max	range	min	range	max
as it just tests to see if the min max values fall within the defined range

8451551
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

8451551
put	get
this implementation provides guaranteed log n time cost for the containskey get put and remove operations

8451578
filtering	grouping
the reason i want to do this is to grouping a bunch of given stack traces by similarity and use it as a filtering to sort stuff this grouping is important for a higher level reason which i can t exactly share publicly

8451616
submit	submission
there s no indicator resulting from the submit that allows the view to notify the user that there s an issue nor is there anything there to prevent the second from blindly submission if the first one fails

8451655
min	max
one thing that might be worthwhile is to first check if the touch point is inside the bounding box defined by the min x max x min y and max y values of the each polygon vertex array

8451656
post	get
back in the old days php had a setting called register_globals now depricated that automatically converted get and post variables into php variables

8451666
bash	tcsh
the real problem though is that bash and tcsh syntax are mostly incompatible

8451666
bash	tcsh
or source from either tcsh or bash but it would be difficult and ugly

8451689
stdout	fflush
i believe the problem is that when you run sys.stdout.write it writes to the stdout buffer but the buffer is not fflush until done so manually or closed stdout is a file object which you can confirm yourself with type sys.stdout

8451712
cos	sin
it is a sin or cos curve

8451739
post	get
symfony always disable cache when post or get or other http headers are sent with a page

8451739
post	put	post	get	put	get
so disable post and get or other header put del from ajax call and cache will work fine

8451739
post	get
to disable get post

8451742
queue	fifo
this will create a fifo ordering based on the queue access of the threads

8451789
min	max	range	min	range	max
i d create an array with all the values in the min max range then do an intersect with all the existing range

8451850
post	get
but this fails also with get and post

8451850
post	get
edit i tried this but it did not help cant get jquery ajax post to work

8451895
autocomplete	autosuggest
i am trying to implement ebay autosuggest in an opera extension using jquery autocomplete

8451909
width	height
i m not sure if this is possible but i thought it would be cool using css transforms to create an effect where a div expands from its center to a predetermined height and width rather than just from the upper left corner

8451930
width	height
somehow though you need to actually move the div as well as animating the height width

8451937
uiview	subviews
when i drag the cell all uiview subviews are hidden

8451943
dumpsys	adb
use adb shell dumpsys activity to see what the current activity stack looks like

8451943
dumpsys	adb
the relevant log statements at the different steps the state of the activity stack shown by adb shell dumpsys activity etc

8451944
ant	maven
also how well will this integrate with the various build tools out there maven ant gradle etc

8451971
width	height
the basic idea is cgrectmake cgfloat x cgfloat y cgfloat width cgfloat height

8451977
uiview	subviews
it is worth mentioning that saving the contents of the uiview does not capture any other views or components that are not subviews of that component

8451990
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
you could use either a click handler or mouseover mouseout combo but the javascript event handler would simply show hide the sub-menu

8452011
memcpy	strcpy
try using strcpy or memcpy

8452030
jquery	touchswipe
i loaded the jquery touchswipe plugin

8452060
postgresql	mysql
the data layer relies on mysql postgresql microsoft sql server or sqlite

8452089
postgresql	mysql
a database mysql postgresql oracle etc. setup with the schemas you want a user table

8452160
postgresql	mysql
mono evolves regularly as of today linq to sql works fine with mono and mysql and i use it successfully with postgresql

8452167

8456491
boost	allocator
as these functions don t receive the alignment requirement as an argument on practice it means that the alignment for all allocator is the same and is the alignment of a standard type with the largest alignment requirement which often is long double and or long long see boost max_align union

8456491
sse	avx
vector instructions such as sse and avx have stronger alignment requirements 16-byte aligned for 128-bit access and 32-byte aligned for 256-bit access than that provided by the standard c++ allocation functions

8457450
client-side	server-side
what matters is serializing your object from the server-side to the client-side php to as3 which means matching the objects on both ends or finding a way to convert them json-encoded objects in a rest-based web service can be de-serialized quite smoothly using the as3core library as an example

i am working on a game with some friends and to make life easier i decided all out 3d models are going to be made using .obj files exported in programs like 3dsmax maya and blender3d

8457646
equals	gethashcode
if you haven t over-ridden equals and gethashcode on your paramid type and it s a class rather than a struct then the default equality meaning will be in effect and each paramid will only be equals to itself

8457646
equals	gethashcode
try to compile at this point and you will get a warning that you have overriden equals but not gethashcode the same is true if you d done it the other way around

8457646
int	chars
if the values where int chars or bytes we would have worked with the values themselves but here we build on the work done in implementing the same logic for those parts

8457646
equals	gethashcode
the first is that hash-based collections such as dictionary all use them it s just that unless passed an instance of one to their constructor they will use defaultequalitycomparer which calls into the equals and gethashcode methods we ve described above

8457646
equals	gethashcode
the other is that it allows us to ignore the equals and gethashcode mentioned above and provide them from another class

8457646
equals	gethashcode
we can change the concept of equality for our classes in either case but this must involve both equals and gethashcode

8458676
soql	apex
from apex not in a trigger you need to specifically call this field out from your soql like this

clpfd	yap
another possibility might be to use another implementation for example library clpfd of yap or swi

8459866
width	height
i had the idea to at click wrap your div with image into a absolute positioned element that will dynamically set it s width and height depending on the window height and girl image width but with overflow hidden

8459882
set	bag
your table can now be a set instead of a bag and you can do this type of thing

8459964
hash	salt
right now i have a salt column and a password column in the database the user table both varchar 64 and take sha-256 hash as values

8459972

8460018
rss	feed
i decided to check out something that would help my application consume rss feed

8460065
width	height
i only want it to fit the width 100 and wish to become bigger than the height but not leave the certain container

8460086
margin	height
if you want to keep source order independence give the floated div a negative margin equal to the height of the first div

8460096
width	height
your question is a bit vauge if you meant you wanted an img to stretch to the full width off a container but the height too get cut off then you want something like this

8460119
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
are there any alternatives to achieving this without dealing with touchesbegan touchesmoved .

8460144
google-chrome	firefox
that code is only for firefox 8 and google-chrome 15 and greater

8460150
atoi	atof
functions like atoi atol atof do not work because it is not a string of numbers but more like a string of 0 s and 1 s that need to be interpreted as numbers

8460150
int	double	int	chars
in a broad sense you can think of it as the following format chars long int chars unsigned int double now if i were to want this first line i am doing something like

8460150
int	double	int	chars
my values for long int unsigned int and double are all incorrect but both chars s are correct

8460150
int	double
i do not understand how to correctly typecast a string of binary data to the types long int unsigned int and double

8460196
integer	fractions
.25 0 is integer below fractions part is .25

8460196
integer	fractions
-.25 -1 is integer below fractions part is .75

8460196
integer	fractions
with the other solutions you will repeat 0 as integer below and worse you will get reversed fractions values for all negative numbers

8460203
piston	tastypie
an api exposed to external clients then frameworks like piston or tastypie might be overkill compared to writing one or two views and using simplejson

8460213
visualvm	oql
i am interested in knowing why visualvm oql has a problem with the following statement

8460213
visualvm	oql
in contrast visualvm oql does not have a problem with any of the following examples

8460219
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown
public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

8460232
google-chrome	firefox
there are many things that slow down math.min but none of it really explains the performance on google-chrome versus firefox or ie9

8460244
put	get
i put some header files in the project when i compile i get this error

8460264

8460277
debian	linux
i am using a debian distribution of linux so little-endian form is maintained

8460294

8460305
post	get
my code is based off sample code from the microsoft website on how to do a list services operation which uses get however swap deployment uses post

8460309
mouseleave	mouseenter
that means that function will be executed on mouseenter and mouseleave

8460309
mouseout	mouseleave
using hover this way means you don t need a mouseout mouseleave event listener either

8460318
mouse	keyboard
i suppose the best workaround is to roll out my own implementation of a gridsplitter - just a custom control that handles mouse and keyboard events and updates properties of the hosting grid.

8460331
mamp	wamp
i ve had this code work flawlessly on windows with wamp but not on mac with mamp

8460538
viewdidload	viewwillappear
based on your new code if you are keeping the 2nd view controller around you may need to put your code in viewwillappear rather than viewdidload

8460540
jdom	dom4j
there s two fairly popular alternative dom-style apis that are more java-like jdom and dom4j

8460584
free	malloc
very often malloc and free are using lower-level virtual memory allocation services and allocating several pages or even megabytes at once using system calls like mmap and munmap and perhaps sbrk

8460584
free	malloc
often malloc prefers to reuse previously free d memory space when relevant

8460584
free	malloc
i strongly believe that the c standard is very vague about malloc and free

8460616
inherited	properties
we are correcting the constructor properties because we had to overwrite child.prototype in order to set up the inherited

8460628
textview	imageview
i have an xml file that has 2 textview and an imageview and here is my attempt at the code to get the image into the imageview

8460659
free	malloc
you can also use alternate implementation for malloc and free if you use a different memory allocator

8460681
mouseleave	mouseenter
when you call hover with just one argument it runs the handler function you pass in on both mouseenter and mouseleave events

8460681
mouseover	mouseleave
is it slidetoggling .the_menu twice - once when you mouseover once when you mouseleave

8460692
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of hover you can switch to mouseenter and mouseleave and change the markup a bit

8460744

8460810
post	get
i have the same route for both post and get requests and use the following code

8460876
floating-point	integer
as the other answers have said to get a result close to 0.00833 which can t be represented exactly btw you need to do a floating-point division rather than an integer division by making one or both of the operands floating-point

8460876
floating-point	integer
if one operand is floating-point and the other is an integer the integer operand is converted to floating-point first

8460876
floating-point	integer
there is no direct floating-point by integer division operation

8460876
floating-point	integer
there are languages in which integer division yields a floating-point result

opera	google-chrome
it shows up in ie9 and opera but for some reason isn t accessible on google-chrome

8461075

the problem is that in ie and firefox nested divs are being resized correctly but not in google-chrome

8461114

try-catch	exception-handling
try surrounding the code that generates the exception-handling with a try-catch statement like

8461347

8461382
turbogears	cherrypy
after doing some research on my own i found out that turbogears does not use routes by default but uses cherrypy dispatching scheme

8461407
postgresql	mysql
far easier than getting mysql or postgresql installed on a system.

8461439
profiling	instrumentation
you could also try profiling with instrumentation to see what is eating up your processor cycles

8461449
qmainwindow	qwidget
i actually tried putting a qmainwindow inside a qwidget and display the phonon player from there but since i want to apply a framelesswindowhint to that subwindow aswell it dissapears

8461494
int	boolean
i asked a related question here c# boolean int conversion issue finally after viewing the exception has been thrown i know that it is about casting

8461496
public	protected
i understand what public private and protected do

8461503
rss	feed
display is a partial class which is used to display the rss feed and it looks like this

8461508
public	protected
if i have a private protected instance variable for example i may have a public setter method that checks for validity preconditions and performs other activities - all which would be bypassed if anyone was freely able to modify the instance variable directly

8461608
jruby	mri
works in both mri and jruby

8461668
children	parent
a commit only knows about its parent and hence all the way up but has no clue about its children descendants

8461740
hash	salt
how can one come up with the final hash 772beqinetnjkuntlm0xt if he is aware of salt and password and uses md5sum

8461743
getter	setter
you can use groovy works perfectly well in a java project mixed with java classes you won t have to worry about declaring getter and setter anymore

8461749
getter	setter
have a look at project lombok which generates getter and setter at compile time

8461749
getter	setter
getter setter

8461749
getter	setter	tostring	getter
all together now a shortcut for tostring equalsandhashcode getter on all fields and setter on all non-final fields and requiredargsconstructor

8461761
getter	setter
java doesn t have this feature but if you use eclipse you can automatically generate setter and getter for your class members

8461770
post	get
there are no input tags getting dynamically generated since when i step through the code using breakpoints none ever get added and when i tell google chrome to break on all subtree modifications the site still sends off the post with the added parameters before anything gets modified

8461786
stdout	stderr
it will go to a different device stderr instead of stdout and it won t be redirected

8461830
post	get
i m not sure of your requirements but just looking at your remove statement at the end of your post you could get the same effect with a linq expression

8461877
google-chrome	firefox
using innerhtml is faster in ie but slower in google-chrome + firefox

8461884
freebsd	linux
i m on linux and i am not sure whether freebsd actually uses the same algorithm but you can take a look at these sources of information hope the same is on freebsd

8461897
profiling	instrumentation
instead of having direct instrumentation in the menu you start the app using the profiling option and it asks you which instrumentation you want to use - there are the instrumentation you used to see including object alloc and leaks

8461902
getter	setter
i m trying to find getter setter selector name of a declared property

8461902

8461941
button	checkbox
i have a gui form with a checkbox button for start stop

8461993
curb	libcurl	hpricot	curb
there is no reason to run a php script for this -- you can look at the sharrre.php file in the download and just redo it in ruby it looks like its using json libcurl try the curb gem and some xpath traversal try nokogiri or hpricot

8461999
getter	setter
i think you can get the selector names only if the property is declared with explicit setter xxx and or getter xxx

8461999
getter	setter
so to get the getter and setter selector names for some property furtype of the class cat

8462000

should i somehow split the actions into get and the data into post

8462006
accessor	properties
instead of a properties i would make that just an accessor method like mutablecopyofmydata something that is clearer as to intent for the user to modify the result as they will

8462018
public	protected
one potential security issue i would like to mention is that if you have an array declared protected final even public final the array reference is final cannot be modified but the objects held in the array are not final an intruder could change the array contents

8462022
addclass	removeclass
using addclass and removeclass makes it very clear what you are doing

carrierwave	fog
you could use something like carrierwave -- it makes uploading to s3 extremely easy with the fog library

min	max
a min max heap is never sorted and hence you can never traverse it the way you can traverse binary search tree

i want to implement setter and getter on local

8463254
getter	setter
your last example of what you don t want to do won t work it has syntax errors it s been fixed but i think you may have meant the usual way of doing this which is to make the getter and setter closures within the constructor function below

8463284
content-disposition	content-type
the way to do this is to use response.transmitfile to explicitly send the file from your asp.net application and then add the content-type and content-disposition headers

8463284
pop-up	dialog
this will cause a open save as dialog box to pop-up with the filename of somefile.xls as the default filename preset

if you want to encapsulate properties of an object it s often better to use getter and setter

8463832
put	get
if you need to have #content absolutely positioned as you state in your question then the best way to get the background you desire is to either put the background-color #292929 on the #content itself you will probably need to adjust some positioning and padding to eliminate any black

fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i m outputting my camera image to my sdcard using fileoutputstream then i want to populate an imageview in a listview using fileinputstream

8463840

in my opinion the using of the setter getter and public variables of course should be avoided in any type of application because setter and getter may broke the valid state of the object

8463845
postgresql	mysql
could be mysql postgresql etc.

8463852
getter	setter
you can t annotate both the getter setter and the field you need to decide on one of them

getter	setter
and have getter and setter in the public interface but within a

8463970
getter	setter
i realise now that the best way to do this may well be to simply use strings for all fields but encapsulate that fact and still provide type specific method setter and getter

8463988
capistrano	rvm
the problem is that given that i am trying to deploy in a rvm environment capistrano is trying to fetch rvm environment variables from my development machine but it can t find them as rvm works only on unix-based os

my suggestion is to include another member datatype in sqlelement if you have change permission or create another class with a properties name datatype and then inherited from sqlelement and then save data type name into it for later use and use below query for all information thanks

8464362
button	checkbox
the only field values that are not sent are the values of unchecked checkbox and unchecked radio button

8464421

implements	extends
alternatively extends runnable with your interface which has a cancel method or whatever which your anonymous classes have to implements which does a similar sort of thing with the loop check flag

8464485
put	get
therefore you can also put a long vector of your single cell characters into the function and get back a splitted list of that vector

8464494
division	modulo
in other words it s the fact that integer division throws away the modulo divided by the divisor

8464505

the response from any web request get post put will vary depending on the remote service you are talking to

8464864
hex	binary
if you aren t using java 7 there is no binary literal syntax so you can do this integer.parseint 1010 2 as a work around or use hex literal notation

8464880
fadein	fadeout
the problem is that you are doing the fadeout before the decreasing height animation and the fadein after increasing the height

8464893
rss	feed
if you want your rss reader to work for both feed you could for example change the following line

8464909
subtract	add
i m aware i need to add or subtract 32 from it but something is amiss

8464916
min	max
each type have some facets that you can apply to the type element - ranging from simple min max length to regular expressions

8464968
downcasting	upcasting
the cast is a higher-level semantic i think it is actually higher than syntax it is denotational semantics at least in case of upcasting and downcasting that says at that level of semantics that we want to cast the type

8465009
inherited	properties
if your control inherited from webcontrol it will have a properties called attributes

8465009
width	height
remember that the width or height attributes in html do not contain unit information it s just a simple integer

8465021
memcpy	memset
essentially it closely follows your c++ example only you don t need to mess around with sizeof and you use a copy loop instep of memset memcpy

8465029
implements	extends
your workflow would be simple to implements i would tackle resource uploads inside a separate controller since you may want to extends it later and you don t want the upload logic cluttering up your posts controller

8465034
floating-point	integer
now integer and floating-point literals are decimal by default in java

8465082
post	get
you could try clearing your cookies however somehow the locale was set to another value you can try forcing it to spanish by adding a get prarmeter to your url however other post parameters may override it

then code your view controller to use the hidden property to show it and again to hide

8465127
free	malloc
see malloc free and asprintf for more details

superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing that has an extra method from the superclass so when i need to use that method i need to cast the superclass

8465230
post	get
if you use post you can be sure that the data came in via a post request and not a get

8465230
post	get
use post get via https instead of http to prevent this

8465234
move	drag
i am trying to add drag n drop funcionality to images galleries to the user to be able to move his images from one gallery to another

8465234
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found that it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome when i try to drag an image it turns blue as if it where selected and to drop it i have to click again before release the mouse button or it still go following the mouse

8465260
superclass	subclassing
if a method is meaningful in the superclass and it should reasonably take no action there then you should put the method in the superclass and override it in the subclassing

8465260
superclass	subclassing
if the functionality of the added method does not belong in a superclass at all add and implement a second interface in your subclassing and program to that interface instead when you need the additional functionality

8465292
getter	setter
and these two classes i am assuming setter getter etc.

8465296
google-chrome	firefox
yes clickonce can still be installed through firefox and google-chrome however they will have to go and search for a plug-in or extension and install that first before installing your software

8465325
for-loop	loops
first of all since you re working with an index running a loops a given ammount of time a for-loop is more sutable here it manages the scoping of the index variable and makes for more readable code

8465340
xna	spritebatch
if you want spritebatch in silverlight 5 try the silverlight toolkit which adds an implementation of xna s spritebatch and other handy things on top of the subset of the xna api that silverlight 5 provides

8465347
slideup	slidedown
create a div with red background and animate it using toggle or slideup slidedown if you prefer

8465410
webclient	webrequest
unless you have very specific requirements i strongly suggest you to use webclient over webrequest

8465460
chown	chmod
the point is ctime is altered not only by create but also by chmod chown maybe even by ln not sure

8465473
getter	setter	accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
if only subclassing need to access member attributes of its superclass define the attributes themselves as private and create protected accessor methods getter and setter

8465485
implements	extends
you ll have to extends the functionality for auto-complete by implements custom logic to perform substring searches to populate the match list

8465488
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
as per the interfaces i m referring to that of idbconnection sqlconnection vs oledbconnection idbcommand sqlcommand vs oledbcommand etc and has worked well for me connecting to sql mysql access sqlite and visual foxpro databases

created a imageview textview and linearlayout that will contain the content by using addview

8465882
freebsd	linux
is there a difference with the non blocking mode between linux and mac os x freebsd

8465895
width	height
now inside that there is another view called v2 at 10 10 50 50 which means that 10 10 is the point in v1 s coordinate system where the top left corner of v2 should be located and 50 50 is the width and height of v2

8465950
width	height
but i want to pass a width height array to an existing c library that expects a single plane of this data

8465962
gitolite	gitosis
in contrast to the already mentioned gitosis gitolite is still maintained and supports a more fine-grained control over the repository access

8466005
folder	directory
delete the .idea folder and the projectname.iml file both in the project directory

8466009
opera	safari
i loads without any noticable delay in opera and safari

8466010
loops	if-statement
i need to stop it from doing that so in the if-statement in the method i need to break that specific iteration of loops the method is in and make it go on to a new iteration of the same loops asking for a new number

8466033
maven	pom.xml
in our projects we have about 25 maven projects and each one of them contains at least 3 module projects and one parent pom.xml

8466033
maven	pom.xml
we have 25 maven projects and each one have on each other via parent pom.xml but not cyclic dependency dependency between them

8466101
profiler	visualvm
visualvm does not show me cpu usage in the monitor s tab says not supported for this jvm. the threads tab is missing and i cannot use the sampler or profiler

8466204
ssl	https
if you plan to write all the clients for the service yourself iphone android etc then sending email and password is a decent alternative as long as the provider communicates over a secure transport layer e.g ssl https

8466246
min	max
you can recenter the view so that all annotations are visible by creating and setting a new region that spans the max and min longitude and latitude of all the annotations

8466255
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
ie safari opera and google-chrome dont have this problem

8466293

if i use a tabpanel the tabs aren t clickable and on forms inputs won t focus or bring up the keyboard and don t seem to respond to input at all

8466307
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
while the qgraphicsscene does get the events my qgraphicsitem s or ...objects don t

8466342
jqmodal	simplemodal
if you want to open new modals from existing modals look at jqmodal not simplemodal

8466346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in safari and google-chrome but not in firefox

8466366
ant	maven
yes there are maven ant tasks available

8466421
opera	firefox
neither firefox nor opera support the mp3 format in html 5 audio only webma and oga

8466425
pylons	pyramid
pyramid is my first choice but if you strongly suggest against it or in favor of something else like django or pylons i am definitely wiling to consider it

8466450
move	drag
the helper option accepts the values original the draggable object move with the cursor clone a duplicate of the draggable move with the cursor or a function that returns a dom element that element is shown near the cursor during drag

8466463
awt	swing
for swing that means using swingutilities.invokelater somerunnable and i suspect it can be done similarly with awt

8466532
inherited	subclassing
on the instances of the subclassing you can call the this- gettablename method because it is inherited from the base class

8466535
stdout	stderr
in it scurrent state the script i have calls three bash functions and a python script that sends email with stderr and stdout for each share of which there are several 4 now and maybe up to 6-8 and it looks like this

8466541
int	double
this is why uint has an implicit cast to double but not to int

8466585
width	height
but i d like to bind the width and height to the current width and height of a control

8466609
division	addition
in addition when a user hovers over the division i display a link displaying delete.

8466699
for-loop	arrays
then in a for-loop of the same method i add objects to the arrays

8466743
free	malloc
address of the malloc a was incremented and then free a+1

8466743
free	malloc
its how exactly the malloc and free function work with each other

8466755
g++	gcc
perhaps i need to update gcc or use g++

8466760
free	malloc
all that can be said the free a+1 call is that it leads to undefined behaviour since a+1 has never been returned by malloc et al

8466764
width	height
my original intent is to use a bit vector of size width height which gives overhead of width height 8

8466764
width	height
the bit vector may be of size width or height or any desirable value even 0

8466764
next	except
after it is all 1s it is moved to next position then all the algorithm steps are performed except actual data movement

8466764
put	get
prefitch optimization is not difficult to implement just calculate indexes invoke prefetch and put indexes to a queue ringbuffer then get indexes from the queue and move data

8466770
free	malloc
free must be passed a pointer returned by malloc as per the standard

8466770
calloc	malloc
not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or

8466770
free	realloc
free or realloc the behavior is undefined

8466773
g++	gcc
edit after further inspection it seems that the missing link is the standard library which isn t surprising seeing as you are using gcc rather than g++ which will automatically link with the stdlib

8466794
mouseleave	mouseenter
thus i m using mouseenter and mouseleave together with settimeout for hovering behavior

8466794
mouseover	mouseout
everything works as intended except the following when i mouseout of one navigation header and mouseover another header quickly the submenu associated with the new header briefly appears then disappears

8466802
g++	gcc
you should use g++ because gcc is c compiler not c++

8466803
getter	setter
getter and setter are mandatory for others classes to access instance variables of a class to not violate the encapsulation principle which is quite important in oo programming

8466823
implements	extends
printwriter extends the class writer a class thinked to write characters while printstream implements outputstream an interface for more generic outputs

8466831
rss	feed
a few weeks ago i noticed that the rss feed on my live site was broken - i get a white screen of death

8466831
rss	feed
the only major difference i could see in the response headers was that my non-working production rss feed has this response header accept-ranges none

8466836
getter	setter
one of the motivations for getter setter is that the underlying data storage can change and things that implement the class won t need to be changed since it is encapsulated

8466836
getter	setter
so keeping that in mind using getter setter within the class makes future changes easier

8466836
getter	setter
instead of having to find all the places that alter the member directly you just have to change the getter setter

8466836
getter	setter
the more complicated the class the more useful it is to use getter setter within it

8466841
public	protected
you can access any variables private public or protected from within the class

8466849
free	malloc
how free and malloc are implemented depend on the implementation not on the c standard

8466849
free	malloc
the c standard explains what the functions do and it is up to each individual c implementation to provide conforming versions of free and malloc based on the descriptions of these functions in the c standard

8466858
int	double	int	chars
the scanf function on the other hand extracts primitive types int chars double etc. and explicitly delimited strings from the input stream

8466867
getter	setter
getter and setter provide a convenient place to convert values between the form in which they are stored in the objectâ s instance members and the form in which the outside world sees them

8466867
getter	setter
using getter and setter internally would muck that up because they d be getting used by both the inside and outside

8466886
getter	setter
it makes debugging more annoying because you have to follow the getter setter

8466886
inherited	subclassing
also if you design your class for inherited it may be better to go via an accessor if you want the subclassing to be able to alter the behavior

8466906
folder	directory
it seems that it is the application.css in the public directory that is being served on subsequent requests instead of the ones in the asset folder that you are working on

8466923
versioning	upgrade
i m writing a new versioning of my android app and upon upgrade i need to perform a certain task

8466931
width	margin
the point is you have to either set the width of the element and use margin 0 auto or set the margins of the element equal

8467012
strtol	strtod
to that end you can run strtol or strtod on the tokens and see if you succeed

8467024
alloca	malloc
malloc and alloca return void pointers

8467025
post	get
im trying to get my head around the sequence of events that happen between when rails receives a get post command and the page is served

8467040
serializable	deserialization
all the examples i can find for custom serializable involve implementing a constructor that will be called upon deserialization which is exactly what i want except that i don t want the function to be a constructor

8467044
alloca	malloc
i am not sure of alloca but malloc return s void and c++ unlike c doesn t support implicit conversion from void to any other pointer type

8467047
mouse	keyboard
you could also run a browser on your machine and simulate mouse and keyboard input like a regular input

8467048
punctuation	words
it will read strings separated by blanks which may be part of its attraction but it will include any punctuation that is included in the words

8467048
int	chars
it also safely changes the type of ch from int necessary for i o to chars

8467076
postgresql	mysql
at least mysql and postgresql do this i guess every backend does this

8467144
google-chrome	safari
for the record while both pochang and chris are correct that you need the content-range header to fix this problem in safari google-chrome requires one extra header that must be included for setting currenttime to work properly

8467172
post	get
the button to get to the list of pages to manage from the list of albums sends the id via post to hide the albumid and other parameters

8467178
audiotrack	audiorecord
my idea is to use android s audiorecord and audiotrack classes which according to my understanding read audio input from the mic and push audio output to the speaker

8467212
implements	extends
since hand is an abstract class it doesn t have to actually implements those interfaces but any non-abstract class that extends hand must do so

8467216
mouseup	mousedown
what i am trying to achieve is a scrolling loop on mousedown stopping on mouseup

8467241
int	chars
i m working on assignment here part of which requires me to parse int from a string that has groups of digits separated by any other chars

8467270
twig	smarty
twig or smarty would be perfect choice

8467279
comparator	comparable
so in case of comparable it tells that class must have method comparator to compare itself with another instance of the class

8467314

wordpress	joomla
i am trying to modify a script that was developed to import article records from a joomla 1.5.x database into a wordpress 3.2.1 table for posts

8467349
wordpress	joomla
it is a script that migrates content from joomla to wordpress

8467349
wordpress	joomla
the issue i had with the script is that it did not maintain the unique identifier id in joomla and id in wordpress

8467349
wordpress	joomla
based on my understanding this makes it a lot more complicated much more work to deal with redirecting all the joomla permalinks over to the new and obviously different wordpress permalinks

8467349
wordpress	joomla
if the id was the same in wordpress as it was in joomla then some basic rewrite rules in htaccess would be enough to perform the redirections

8467349
wordpress	joomla
even though i ve used that messy method for my own site it is my wish to make this process work cleanly for other users who are on joomla 1.5.x and are switching to wordpress instead of upgrading to a newer joomla release which is a big process so many are just jumping ot wordpress like me

8467363
octal	binary
i am having difficulty understanding why this is as an octal digit consists of 3 binary bits

on linux distributions the package manager dpkg on debian does a good job for upgrading programs even for daemons

8467450
post	get
as you can see from the logs below the post does succeed as it should but for some reason the app executes a get to the exact same url at the same time

8467450
post	get
the problem does sound similar in scope to jquery ajax post causes an immediate get to the same url but this is using jquery_ujs and i don t believe i ve left any custom jquery code sitting around

8467450
post	get	submit	submission
and discovered that the post now did not go through but the get did confirming that problem seems to be that the ajax handler is picking up the link and submission it as a post properly but is not intercepting the get that the browser submit

8467450
post	get
now in restoring the script tag to its previous form and then disabling jquery-mobile i have tried the link again and it now does not submit the get but does submit the post

8467468
post	get
you can use this for get and post requests

8467469
int	double
i have structure that have 3 member s first is int second is pointer to that int and third is double pointer which point to second member to pointer

8467474

everything works fine on my local machine in safari doesn t work in google-chrome or firefox the xml file loads i grab all of the information i need and create the markers successfully

8467662
folder	directory
if i run this command in it s own file called for example test.php in my wordpress directory then it works fine resizes the image and saves it into the scripts folder as newtemp.jpg

8467688
width	height
the problem occurs because in the display the disk used in the mask has a diameter equal to the height of the image whereas the stand-alone disk has a diameter equal to the width of the image

8467691
folder	directory
files in a directory and then ultimately create softlinks in another folder to act as a video playlist

8467728
width	height
another option would be to wrap the images in a pane with automatic width and fixed height

8467738
width	height
modalbox.show .. b-gal-scripts ajaxgal.php title title overlayopacity .1 width width height height method post params src next dir dir img img ssimg next

8467741
boost	allocator
boost make_shared does some magic to allocate the reference count and the object in contiguous memory which saves on calls to the allocator and improves locality of reference

8467751
int	chars
if you want raw binary data first let me tell you that instead of unsigned chars you are better off using bigger containers such as long int or long long

8467770
content-length	content-type
but like mattias said you d probably want some data in the body as well so you d want the content-type and the data as well plus content-length would be larger

8467797
nsexception	nserror
slightly related not nsexception but nserror

8467818
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian or ubuntu this is as easy as apt-get install apc

width	height
i have a div that is 100 width to it s container which is floating left and has a set pixel width and has a set pixel height

8467877
hash	salt
a bcrypt hash includes salt and as a result this algorithm returns different hash for the same input

8467889
put	get
note that you ll need a get put api for the queue with mutex protection to prevent threads 2 and 3 from stepping on each other

8467894
ccscene	cclayer
other than that ccscene cclayer and ccnode are virtually identical to each other

8467894
ccscene	cclayer
the reason why many examples instantiate the ccscene object inside the cclayer class is simply because of that requirement of cocos2d having to have a scene

8467898
cifs	afp	cifs	smb	afp	smb	ftp	smb
i know that these apps use a combination of the cifs smb afp ftp sftp and webdav protocols

8467975
versioning	upgrade
http upgrade is used to indicate a preference or requirement to switch to a different versioning of http or to another protocol if possible

8467975
starttls	smtps	ssl	https
this upgrade allows for a similar mechanism to starttls in other protocols ldap smtps ... so as to be able to switch to tls on the same port as the plain connection after exchanging some of the application protocol messages as opposed to having the entire http exchange on top of ssl tls without it needing to know it s on top of tls the way https works

8467998
google-chrome	firefox
the offline storage of the webapp is definately working as it works fine in the desktop version of firefox and google-chrome

inherited	properties
and if i do so i can t change their properties redefining them in the p css tag inherited seems forced

8468086
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that could be a bug in jcrop but you can write your code in a fashion that works on google-chrome firefox ie and safari

8468087
floating-point	integer
however both of these techniques will push your parser towards a point where it can t easily evolve if you want to expand the language later on for example to distinguish between integer and floating-point numbers to add strings or lists etc.

8468114
implements	extends
if you re interested in composing doctrine_cache_memcache for example suppose you d like to extends whatever provides the real work for _getdomain you would implements doctrine_class_interface instead

children	parent	google-chrome	safari	inherited	properties
this is a reported webkit google-chrome safari bug children of parent with min-height can t inherited the height properties

8468131
put	get
if i put a min-height on my container i m not explicitly specifying its height - so my element should get an auto height

8468171
google-chrome	firefox
dragging an image from a web page gets complicated because firefox google-chrome and ie9 all give you a different set of formats

8468186
datarow	dataview
the datatable datarow dataview and dataviewmanager objects cannot be serialized and cannot be returned from an xml web service

8468208
distance	mercator
this gives the relative distance as if the world really were a rectangle like the mercator projection suggests

8468245

8468401
pop-up	dialog
with onresume in the code i cant go back at all i get stuck in an endless loop that continually pop-up the dialog that asks me if i want to use the internet or google maps

8468419
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop below attempts to dynamically call the method valueindollars for each element in the arrays as follows

8468422
int	chars
if i were you i ll use some array list of small int short or chars to store the values

8468431
puts	gets
the second gets the process id and the third matching on the end of a line puts it all together

8468454
int	boolean
it typically is composed from a number of boolean floats and int possibly arrays list between 5 and 100 different variables

8468475
filtering	grouping
i usually disable the filtering and put files where i want them so that the two structures remain in sync by default indeed any other way seems like madness if you want to have any kind of organisation of source code - i always grouping files for components inot separate folders

8468476
hide	show
i have sort of an imagemap which is basically a lot of absolutely positioned divs which when clicked will show or hide a tooltip

8468541
next	except
my next guess is this your config above says everyone is forbidden access except when they re coming from 127.0.0.1

8468564
addition	multiplication
i m not sure whether you want to write a high-level library for working with long numbers for calculating primes or something or just implement the low-level operations addition multiplication for learning purposes

8468593
folder	directory
put your example1.txt file in that folder or change the working directory to the location of example1.txt and your code should output something

8468608
folder	directory
i would ve expected a glassfish logs folder but having searched the glassfish directory i don t see them

8468633
portrait	landscape
the list works exactly right except that when i rotate the screen from landscape to portrait the list repeats each element like 3 times

8468636
public	protected
if you make run protected or public in abstractinner and thus in inner as well instead of using the default visibility it will work as intended

8468638
int	chars
i tried casting each individual chars as a int performing the calculations and casting it back as a chars but i seem to get the same chars after encryption for different chars

8468640
hide	show
i created a script that hide show the menu and i added a image icon down.png

8468662
profiling	instrumentation
when profiling my app with instrumentation looking for memory leaks i get extremely different results with the ios 5 iphone simulator from those i get with my iphone 4 running ios 5

8468662
profiling	instrumentation
as i am relatively new to using instrumentation and profiling i m not exactly sure if this is normal

8468662
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
also i found that when a second uiviewcontroller is pushed onto the uinavigationcontroller stack allocated memory jumps to about 8.5-9 mb on the real device but only about 4.5 to maybe 4.5 megabytes tops on the simulator

8468692
min	max
the larger program uses dates input by the user to create the framework for the min max of the progress bar

8468710

the problem is i cannot install anything on that machine it s a corporate box but i am allowed ftp telnet ssh login etc

8468762
width	height
jquery provides several ways to find width and height depending on what you want to do

8468762
width	height
the plain width height methods get the css values

8468791
serializable	deserialization
serializable on the other hand is used if you want to construct a binary representation of your object and then recreate the object instance using deserialization process

8468791
serializable	deserialization
however in this case only this given field in your entity is using serializable deserialization to put binary data into database column

8468814
accessor	properties
instead use the properties accessor which will handle the release and retain for you

8468890
for-loop	loops
edit op clarified that r changes each loops and they want to avoid using a for-loop

8468898
children	parent
if your parent process has exited the children should get reassigned to init which periodically reaps its children

8468931
int	double
i d recommend int if that number does not contain a decimal point float or double if it does

8468949
children	parent
an easy way to list the children of a user and display the parent of each children would be

8468951
comparator	comparable
the easiest way would probably be to create a class that encapsulates the four values make the class implement comparable and define its comparator method via the integer

8468960
hide	show
you could use the approach i provided to find the other label and hide it but you would also need to override the success callback to show the original label again

8468976
sum	coalesce
though you may also need to wrap your sum s in coalesce ... 0 mdash

8468988
setinterval	settimeout
this is because the dom interface only accepts integers for the delay in settimeout setinterval -- yup these are defined in the dom not in ecmascript

8469013
hex	binary
means that the string you are giving represents hexadecimal notation so it will convert the bytes ab and cd from hex into binary 1010 1011 1100 1101 which is two bytes

i ve been developing in java using vim or notepad++ editors and my java code is on remote linux machine

8469328
memcached	apc
i understand that memcached should be used for distributed caching but i think having the apc cache on each machine cache things like application configurations and other objects that will not be different across any of the servers would yield even better performance

8469378
maven	pom.xml
actually to do it properly it will require you to include the new version with a separate version suffix in the internal repository and to update the in your pom.xml . the only better way around this is to have someone else manage the dependency - either in the maven central repository or another repository location that you reference from your pom.xml

8469379

8469559
explode	substr
if it doesn t you can use substr in combination with strpos and strrpos instead of explode

8469602

because when you are passing argument like int double chars etc

8469605
internationalization	localization
i use google app engine python and jinja2 and i d like to take advantage of webapp2 s feature for currency internationalization and localization ie store prices as a number and make the correct formatting using the builtin i18n method of webapp2

8469667
stdout	stderr
unless you re wrapping everything in giant begin rescue s and catching errors that way the best way to log errors is to catch all output from stderr and stdout with something like

8469673
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
then use a for-loop not a for-each loops and use the for-loop index to get the string for the first column and the arrays index the length of the arrays and just very simple math to get the index of the string for the second column

8469723
ddms	adb
adb does not show the emulator listed when i use adb devices the ddms perspective in eclipse does not detect any device either

for-loop	arrays
what happens when i run this is when the for-loop starts an error message saying that the i indexes into the arrays _files uploaded i are not valid

8469902
for-loop	arrays
if every input asks the same question you should use a for-loop and an arrays of inputs

it could be any element on the page meaning that mouseover mouseout mouseenter and mouseleave do not apply here as they would relate to a specific element

8480329

that is how you properly make the canvas full width and height of the browser

8486325

how can i check for height and width before uploading image using php

8486435
nsurl	nsstring
i have an nsstring containing a url and when i allocate nsurl with the nsstring nsurl outputs null

nsurl	nsstring
it s because there are some illegal characters in the url which nsurl can t read without encoding the nsstring containing the url

8486436
jscrollpane	jviewport
1 to extract jviewport from jscrollpane

8486483
width	height
also when incrementing decrementing x or y to calculate neighbor pixel you need to make sure that you dont t overflow underflow the boundary of the image i.e decrementing should not cause the value of x y to be 0 and increment should not cause the x to go beyond width of image and y to go beyond height of image

8486484
folder	directory
this will prevent others accessing the whole directory listing in _userfile folder

8486522
tax	shipping
the reason is that assuming that your adjustments are things like sales tax shipping costs or customer discounts then report users are very likely to be interested in them individually as well as in the final adjustedsales value

onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
instead of setting an onitemclicklistener you should set an onclicklistener on each view inside the getview -method of your adapter

8486690
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
everything works in ie9 firefox google-chrome opera but not in ie8

8486702
google-chrome	firefox
really wish there was a way of using google-chrome or firefox i have to say

8486753
getter	setter
i should also make sure that the properties names or getter and setter are equal to the java object properties names

8486778
post	get
takes over the control and hits a web service http post to get some info from the internet

8486785
vim	emacs
let s not make this a general vim emacs debate

8486798
rar	zip
i have to check the content of a zip rar file before uploading to the server

8486798
rar	zip
here one of us suggested a feature that to upload the theme as theme pack compressed in zip rar file

8486801
put	get
consider to put to good use the builtins when you sort a list all elements get grouped then check for a sequence become easy

8486812
plone	buildout
we are deploying plone add-ons as development eggs with buildout

8486826
accessor	properties
because the custom accessor are stored as an attribute of the properties i think it s easily possible to support them in key-value coding

8486830
des	aes
for example use des or aes implementations for both languages

8486835
integer	unsigned
you can not check for unsigned integer types because there are no unsigned integer types

8486844
put	get
on a rmmapview i put on the detailviewcontroller of a splitviewcontroller i get a weird behavior

8486873
lisp	smalltalk
some languages smalltalk common lisp and even melt are reifying their classes by having classes instances of meta-classes

8486917
hide	show
my solution has been to hide the parent node before loading then adding in a slight delay before showing it again with a callback placed on the show method

8486937
post	get
i never used sendgrid but after a quick look it seems like they are just sending you a standard post request with parameters so you best bet is to define a simple action like the following and see what you get

8486954
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
an addition to the list multiplication we cannot multiplying two lists

8486957
int	chars
hello is there a different way to convert a int back to a chars see comment about half way down the code

8486983
post	get
i know the differences between http get and post methods as expalined in big details in this question

8486983
post	get
is there is reason to prefer get then post

8487034
children	parent
add each children to the children list of the parent with parentid

8487056
width	height
since ex refers to height rather than width using it to set a width seems to be simply an error imho

8487062
width	height
the height and width of elements are usually best specified considering both at the same time to achieve pleasing ratios 16 9 or the golden ratio

8487062
width	height
so just because ex is specified in terms of a height it doesn t make it less useful for specifying a particular width

8487101
width	height
if image is not in proportion then extra width height will get cropped

8487108
ienumerable	iqueryable
well i fixed it by adding .tolist to every statement so that temp is now an ienumerable rather than an iqueryable

8487113
width	height
i want to construct a jpeg with given width and height out of it and send it to some server

8487166
post	get
i was reading the yahoo best practices for speeding up your websites some day back and they have very well explained why we should prefer get over post and here is the post snippet for your reference

8487166
post	get
an interesting side affect is that post without actually posting any data behaves like get

8487189
jar	war
build a war archive where you put the servlet and the standalone application packaged as a jar

8487207
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t happen in google-chrome firefox and even in ie it seems to be dependent on the location from which i am connected

8487223
nvda	voiceover
i m not 100 sure but as it seams nvda jaws and voiceover for ios this works â â on mac os x unfortunately not â

8487277
google-chrome	firefox
this style works fine in google-chrome but in firefox and later ie i want to use a different style

8487280
width	height
you can use following in all your activity to show at specific gravity left right top bottom and layout height width of the activity in oncreate method

8487287
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
getwritabledatabase does not create a transaction for your code the quoted line from the docs is referring to transactions being used for the oncreate and onupgrade methods meaning that you don t need to add transaction code in those methods

8487325
nginx	lighttpd
web server will probably be nginx and lighttpd or node.js as support for long-polling tasks chat

8487325
memcached	apc
caching will be done with memcached plus apc for things strictly related to the php code as it can be used outside php

8487339
put	get
to get 4 buttons underneath each other put them in a single column gridlayout

8487339
put	get
to get then to move relative to the rhs of the frame put the panel with the gridlayout into the east constraint of a borderlayout

8487367
int	chars
it works as-is but because the addition promotes the expression to int you want to cast it back to chars again so that your iostream renders it as a chars rather than a number

8487447
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox in short i can t seem to find a way to tell firefox 8.0 to not enlarge the last column of the table and instead let the text span multiple lines

8487475
google-chrome	firefox
however the browser firefox google-chrome never caches the file and always download the whole thing

8487506
min	max
then when the user clicks the box a random number is generated between the min and max id s of the table look up the db row with that id and check if there are any available if there are print out the details for the prize

8487521
opera	firefox
this is working fine in ie but giving error in firefox opera etc.like

8487524
width	height
place your image in a div with the same width and height as your pic and give that div a background color

8487542
post	get
i send a post request from iphone to django and get csrf verification failed which i can t perfectly understand

8487547
youtube	vimeo
i applyed z-index to all elements and it works great but i need to embed videos from youtube vimeo or other.

8487561
width	height
add rows and columns and change the height and width properties of these object to resize as you want fixed value auto

8487578
vim	emacs
i suggest you pick one of them vim emacs mixing them with a plugin isn t something that great since i wouldn t expect all the functionality to be there

8487578
vim	emacs
vim or emacs are pretty fast without one emulating the other so you wouldn t need such a plugin

8487587
expander	itemscontrol
my xaml code assumes that you have a limited amount of space for the expander and you are showing that expander within an itemscontrol which gives its items as much space as they want

8487610
disk	ram
16gb of ram will be enough to serve the data if your hot set will all fit in ram or if serving rate can be served off disk

8487618
public	protected
now if i make the constructor of protectedconstructor class as public or protected then the code compiles fine with no error

8487645
highstock	dygraphs
i see that highstock is nice too but you shouldn t have any problems in adapting dygraphs to what you describe

8487659
getter	setter
i have a class in which i have 30 getter and setter method

8487678
public	protected
if you want to extends a class outside its package it must have a constructor that is public or protected because in java every constructor must call a constructor from its superclass

8487696
post	get
when you call this function you can use the static get and post properties of urlrequestmethod rather than just passing strings for a little bit of extra safety

8487737
versioning	upgrade
phpunit doesn t include selenium extension since versioning 3.6 and you have to install upgrade it manually

8487765
public	protected
you can have constructors which are public protected for internal used and even private

8487765
public	protected
the objectoutputstream class has a public constructor which takes an outputstream and a protected constructor which can only be used by a sub-class

8487811
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to the latest versioning of firebird then you could use execute block and or execute statement to do it all in one statement and server side but with firebird 1.5 you have to settle for the long way one statement to get the current max then another one update the generator

8487812
puts	gets
i m making a program that gets information from a database and puts in a grid in an agenda-like way

8487820
folder	directory
if you use blue folder references for your resources these folder will also be created inside your application bundle while resource files in groups will simply be copied to your mainbundle s root directory

8487844
hide	show
also can i update the parent layout show or hide a button of the listview based on checking a radiobutton in the listview row

8487857
implements	extends
i managed to realize it on a 320x480 resolution by creating a class which extends a surfaceview and implements runnable

8487865
mouse	keyboard
it seems your xaml did not provide a place for interaction with the keyboard mouse

8487897
hide	show
another idea to solve the issue is getting the browser type by using code then you can show or hide the background images based on the type

8488013
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488049
lambda	first-class-functions
moreover java will get lambda in it version 8 and this will solve the problem of first-class-functions in java so i suppose library writers prefer waiting for java 8 than using some kind of workaround

8488069
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488090
portrait	landscape
now if user touches the imageview then set the frame of uiview in landscape mode otherwise in portrait mode

8488094
public	protected
the class adapter will derive from the legacy classes and expose public interface methods which will internally call your protected methods

8488109
titlebar	window
to allow these items to have their own representation the designers of msaa picked a two-level structure where objid_window represents the entire window and it has children that then represent things like scrollbars menubar titlebar and so on - if they are present

8488127
vim	emacs
you ll have the vim keys if you prefer that and you ll also have the power of emacs at your disposal

8488135
int	chars
here s what happens when fails to read an int when you type a dot and press enter whatever you typed stays in the stream including the newline chars

8488162
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488183
udp	tcp
for video or sound or gaming project over udp is the best way but for my project i need it over tcp

8488183
udp	tcp
why over tcp p2p topology different then udp

8488191
apache	nginx
another option would be to use the diazo standalone proxy see diazo.org for development and then use diazocompiler to generate an xsl and deploy that into nginx apache for production

8488198
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
on debian-based systems debian ubuntu and such that s aptitude or apt-get

8488211
folder	directory
when folder structure is managed outside of xcode for example a cross-platform project which has project files for different versions of xcode visual studio and other ides all using mostly the same directory tree you normally want folder references

8488235
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu debian you can use

8488296
post	get
read more on my blog post - hopefully the blog will get some good comments about it too

8488335
nsstring	nsdata
i am sending an image to the server by converting the nsdata object into an nsstring object using base64 scheme by using..

8488357
for-loop	loops
a for-loop evaluates loops bounds once at the beginning of loops so you run off the end which explains your index out of bounds errors

8488363
folder	directory
my next task is to create another batch file which moves each file in a directory into the relevant date folder based on their date modified

8488364
width	height
there is also an overlay div class fondo height and width 100 so i can dectect when the background has been clicked i can not use directly the background div because the transition makes it have negative z-index

8488413
post	get
make the form submit a get request rather than a post

8488426
post	put	post	get	put	get
the requests might be get post put or delete and the response that comes back could be any type of content - it might be html json xml or an images document binary content or whatever

8488426
post	put	post	get	put	get
i ve no problem doing what i need with get and post - it s put and delete that are awkward since i can t support them directly with html

8488426
post	put
at the moment the implementation uses some server-side trickery and a hidden _method field on the form that allows post requests to be overloaded into put delete options whatever but ideally i d like to take that logic out of the server side and do the equivalent using javascript

8488441
lisp	scheme
one of the differences between scheme one lisp dialect so to speak and common lisp is that in scheme there is one namespace for variables and functions whereas in cl there are two separate namespaces

8488452
for-loop	loops
you may change the for-loop into a while loops that reevaluates count and don t increment index on the delete iteration

8488488
public	protected
have these public methods delegate to protected methods of the legacy classes

8488508
uiview	subviews
after that inside the scroll view add uiview as subviews

8488594
mouseup	mousedown
i do not get correct coordinates of the mousedown or mouseup events

8488594
mouseup	mousedown
no matter where i click inside the view the coordinate of left mousedown is always 0.000000 -1.996910 and left mouseup is always 0.000000 0.000000

8488594
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown and mouseup together makes one click

8488595
post	get
what you want to do is called prg or post redirect get

8488595
post	get
obviously it also works without post but using get for an action that modifies things is not really a good idea anyway

8488631
udp	tcp
difference between tcp and udp

does anybody know if there s a way in java to set the value of an instance variable in a subclassing before calling the superclass constructor

8493432
superclass	subclassing
i have a brief schematic below of what i m trying to accomplish -- i need to set up the instance variables defined in the superclass differently depending on the subclassing type but i still want to be able to share common non-constructor code among different instances of the subclassing

8493462
width	height
apparently setting the mapview s width and height equal to the diagonal of the containing view solves this issue

8493474
range	max
max abs sum range i k +abs sum range m n

8493475

post	get
i know this sound like a question for serverfault but i know that developers often get the blame when servers are struggling so i thought a post here might be useful to people who still use perl on the web

8493559
width	height
update per jimmy s recommendation i verified that calling pdfreader.getstreambytes returns a byte length equal to width height 8 since getstreambytes should be calling flatedecode

8493559
width	height
manually calling flatedecode and calling pdfreader.getstreambytes both produced a byte length of 1049401 while the width height 8 is 2544 3300 8 or 1049400 so there is a difference of 1

8493559
width	height
the fact that the width height 8 as stated earlier is off by 1 in comparison to the byte length when calling flatedecode makes me think these are all one in the same

8493562
google-chrome	firefox
there are also browser-specific plugins such as this for google-chrome and a few others for firefox

8493581
super	abstract
what you could do is make an abstract init method in your super class and call it in your super constructor before you call the setup method

8493581
superclass	subclassing
this way subclassing will be forced to implement init and you would know that that is the place to initialize any subclassing s members before they are used in your superclass

8493601
folder	directory
code explanation this is basically a recursive listing of directory so a dirlister objects lists files under the given root and if some variable is accessed with dotted notation it returns a dirlister assuming that that attribute is a folder under the root

8493613
width	height
so in the main.xaml the submain.xaml is allotted a certain width and height and the imagedisplay elements re-size and fit themselves perfectly without the help of code

itâ s also nice to create a class in groovy and have variables be public by default with getter and setter added at runtime saving a lot of boilerplate code

8497795
touchesmoved	touchesended
this also only seems to be a problem when taking touches directly from a touchesmoved or touchesended event object since my buttons respond to touches correctly

i d say that if the objects are easily copiable basic types then std vector will be more efficient as removing elements will not alloc realloc free any memory

8498170
pull	push
this way you get a push scenario rather than a pull scenario thus you don t have to poll your endpoints for potential updates

8498220
hex	binary
when querying and reading such binary values the mysql functions hex and unhex will be very helpful as will writing your query values in hex notation preceded by 0x

8498220
hex	binary
reading data out is slightly slower - you have to call hex on all binary data read out of a query to get it in a useful format if your client api doesn t deal well with binary data php in paricular will usually determine that binary strings and will break them if manipulated without first calling bin2hex base64_encode or similar - but this overhead is about as minimal as character collation and more importantly is only being called on the actual cells select ed not all cells involved in the internal computations of a query result

just set them as position absolute with top and left having the value of coordinates and width height with the value of size as it s only 13 pixels i don t thing rectangle and circle will be that different

8506205
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox should render the same generally

8506215
getter	setter
therefore i use the statehelper within setter getter of the attribute

8506270
rss	feed
i want to open rss feed url like yahoo in android webview

8506297
google-chrome	firefox
i have a one line function that works great in google-chrome and firefox to shorten a string but throws an exception in ie

filtering	grouping
i am trying to filtering out users already in a grouping so the same user can not be added twice to the same grouping

edit the inverse c++ max is the same as the min value in c#

8506724
swt	swing
the main issue is that existing engines are too tight to user interface ie you need swing or swt

8506767
createfile	deviceiocontrol	pascal	delphi
there are lots of c and c++ examples of using createfile in the documentation and especially an example of calling deviceiocontrol but i can t find any for free pascal or delphi and i am not good enough yet to work out how to do it

8506811
put	get
yes thats exactly the problem the channelbuffer is put in a queue to get written

8506849
min	max
it seems that min and max are both 3d vectors as well as functions or macros

8506849
min	max
in the c# version you have min and max for the vectors and math.min and math.max for the function

8506849
min	max
my guess is that your vector class has an operator with two args so that you don t get compilation errors but this is not the same as the usual min .. max .. function

8506862
decoder	encoder
you just need to define the protocol write the encoder decoder and add them with the sslhandler in the pipeline

8506874
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome behave correctly

8506953
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and safari you can test out of the box and a huge percentage of users already have the latest and greatest version

8507095
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
and this works on firefox safari opera google-chrome it doesn t work on ie8 and the problem is not the innerhtml

8507128
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
as pointed out here example multiplying an integer by the reciprocal of a constant you could re-implement your division by multiplication with the reciprocal

8507168
hide	show
if you did all of the code you showed would disappear altogether and you would hide show elements like this

8507209
getter	setter
properties are a pair of setter getter methods which can set get an instance variable if they like but don t have to

8507209
getter	setter
if you synthesize the property have the compiler automatically create the setter and getter and an instance variable doesn t exist the compiler will create that too

8507256
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol with 9 tabitem in it

8507320
profiling	instrumentation
when i try to profiling my application with instrumentation when it launches it displays this annoying message

8507329
client-side	server-side
while lig offers a server-side solution that requires writing a custom script you can always do a client-side configuration that ll work out of the box

8507329
pull	push
this should work when you push pull via git so long as your git s remote exactly matches the host in your ssh config file

8507341
int	chars
so in the same way that a string can refer to chars a delegate can refer to a method for instance that takes an int as input and returns an int as output

8507361
division	modulo
your compiler might be smart enough to convert divide modulo into bit masks but if it doesn t you ll have deplorable performance division is slow

8507374
put	get
but if i put it in the xshd-definition i get the error

8507439
hash	md5
i was thinking of perhaps building a string when the customer purchases the product and use something like md5 to create a hash

8507452
versioning	upgrade
jplayer requires flash versioning 10.3 at the minimum to work you will need to ask your users with playback issues to upgrade flash

8507467
hide	show
if you want immediate hide show you can change your code to this

8507479
websphere	ibm
alternatively i think you should also be able to write something that uses jmx to read specific things about websphere state and there is at least one sophisticated monitoring tool you could purchase ibm tivoli composite application manager itcam for application diagnostics which can monitor websphere internals

8507487
google-chrome	firefox
and it is in google-chrome but it has 245px value in firefox 8.0.1 and ie 9.0.3

this is the jquery i m using for each div show that div when link is clicked and hide all the others

8507736

i have tried both running it through the debugger and passing a request through fiddler and running it in iis and doing the same as well as using a simple console application to fake the post but i always get the 400 bad request error and i have no idea why

on another note if you are ready to go poking around in vms android kernels and hals you could follow this article which tells you how to setup android x86 under vmware or virtualbox as an adb device

8507992
put	get
if you have particular complex controller actions that are doing lots of db activity and you want them to be in a transaction my advice is to get this business logic and persistence into a model method and put your transaction there

8508003
versioning	upgrade
we use versioning 10 of the dragon software i understand that there s an upgrade and i am wondering if that would fix our issues or if perhaps anything can be done in my code to assist the application

8508004
folder	directory
there are 32 files and 3 directory in that folder

8508013
button	checkbox
what i think is happening is that when you click the button the page is reloaded and the repeater gets filled with your data overwriting the checkbox choices you have made

8508013
button	checkbox
now when you read out the repeater items after the button click you should see the actual value of the checkbox instead of it always being false

8508015
implements	extends
i have created a custom view extends imageview and implements valueanimator.animatorupdatelistener

8508022
accessor	ivar
you should release the ivar directly rather than going through the accessor

8508174
fiddler	charles
use charles or fiddler to inspect what is actually sent in the http request body

8508290
openjpa	datanucleus
some implementations e.g datanucleus openjpa use bytecode enhancement and are able to efficiently manage what fields are dirty since loading and have no need of keeping a snapshot of the original field values

8508308
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
note that getelementbyid as the name says just get the element with matched id so your table have to be like and getelementsbytagname gets by the tag

8508321
translation	localization
in order to minimize the localization efforts i would like to be able to re-use the same translation for all the projects within the company

for that you can use rvm and gemsets to group your rubygems in convenient packages

8508355
folder	directory
the report server requires an active directory account with content manager role assigned in the report folder where it is being published

8508369
superclass	subclassing
your description is a bit confusing but it sounds like your superclass is setting a title button information after you set it in the subclassing

8508369
superclass	subclassing
is first in the function any subclassing changes will then be applied after the superclass sets it

8508375
put	get

i want to use method .split string regex in java so that i can get and put it into a string variable

8508413
try-catch	exception-handling
if the trycode contains a try-finally block that s nested within a try-catch block an exception-handling which occurs in the try part of that try-finally block is not handled by the trycatchwhenfamily nor any nested scope but is handled by an outer block and the processing of the inner try-finally block throws an exception-handling which the inner try-catch block handles the exception-handling which the outer block had decided it was going to catch might disappear without ever being caught

8508441
tabs	tabpanel
i use the gwt tabpanel and want to use a dialogbox in one of these tabs

8508473
firefox	safari
as to why it s 245 in safari and firefox it s probably down to the default css presumed by different browsers especially the border-spacing since you re using lots of tables

8508496
phpstorm	webstorm
as pycharm webstorm phpstorm and intellij idea share the same javascript plug-in this issue also applies to the product that you are using

my setup linux ubuntu 11.10 openjdk 1.6.0_23 google app engine sdk 1.6.1 maven 3.0.3 spring roo 1.1.5 - here is how i create and upload the project

8508590
stdout	stderr
i ve heard writing to stderr for example used to be with 5 the unit for stderr and i know the way to write to stdout is to use

8508628
post	get	rss	feed
now if you really want to do rss instead of atom you ll need to change the format of the feed template the post template and the content_type but i think that is the essence of what you need to do to get a feed generated from an appengine python application

8508637
put	get
ok i can get this to run and put the file on the remote server

8508647
width	height
i m using zend_pdf and at one point i am reading my source page s width and height using and

8508647
width	height
sometimes however zend pdf returns are the opposite - it shows 11in as width and 8.5in as height for a standard letter-sized pdf

8508745
post	get
now the users if they come on the website they can post an activity just like twitter they type in what they are doing and all their friends get with a realtime update

8508754
put	get
if you need it in a dom put it with the raw resources and get your reader for your inputsource from openrawresource

8508757
stdout	stderr
as noted in other answers 0 5 and 6 are usually stderr stdin and stdout this is true for ifort on linux but this is not defined by the fortran standard

8508760
int	chars
one effect of this is that chars arguments are converted to int

8508760
int	chars
use unsigned chars rather than chars this gets promoted to unsigned int so no leading ones

8508760
int	chars
explicitly convert each of your chars s to int and then mask

8508772
apache	nginx
say on a sub-domain using a more traditional server such as apache nginx etc

8508816
stdout	stderr
the usual convention followed by gfortran is that stderr 0 stdin 5 stdout 6

8508851
int	chars
you re passing chars s and having them read as unsigned int s you re lucky it works at all

8508861
pull	push
i got the whole pull and push system down somewhat now i have a question

8508873
int	chars
string literals are just chars arrays and chars are just 8-bit int so it s completely legal to perform arithmetic with them

8508873
int	chars
if the o8 th chars in this string literal has int value then .

8509021
int	chars
also performing addition here has the side effect of changing the expression s type to int but it doesn t matter whether 130 is inside the range of chars

8509026
many-to-one	one-to-many
consider a structure where you have a many-to-one or one-to-many relationship with a condition where order by etc. on both tables

8509068
gridview	sqldatasource
the scenario is an aspx page with a gridview displaying data from a sqldatasource configured to select rows from a database view that is based on a sub-optimal query which i don t have time to fix at the current moment

8509082
int	double
you d probably be fine except for the trailing .0 of course in this case because you d have 52 bits of mantissa and that means that the double would act like a 52 bit int until your values got large enough to require the exponent

8509104
erlang	ocaml
i love both ocaml and erlang and use them regularly

8509104
erlang	ocaml
by the time i started using erlang i had years of experience with ocaml

8509169
unsigned	short
to make a pointer to an array use which is a pointer to array of size 3 to unsigned short

8509180
multiplying	modulo
i considered multiplying the input by a big prime number and taking the modulo 2 64 something like a linear congruent generator but there are obvious dependencies between the outputs in the lower bits

8509187
inherited	properties
because your class implements idbtransaction you would successfully be able to assign to any properties that expects this interface but because it does not inherited sqltransaction you may not assign it to any properties or parameter that expects sqltransaction

8509190
unsigned	short
your constructor on the other hand expects which is array of three pointers to unsigned short

8509190
unsigned	short
as a matter of fact as a function parameter type it s a pointer to pointer to unsigned short - the dimension is ignored completely

8509190
unsigned	short
i think what you meant was for your constructor to take just a pointer to unsigned short and pass layercolor

8509194
unsigned	short
unsigned short displaycolor 3 is saying an array of unsigned short pointers or unsigned short essentially

8509194
unsigned	short
unsigned short layercolor 3 is an array of unsigned shorts not an array of unsigned short pointers

8509290
identifier	ambiguous
i m not really an expert with th but what you want is pretty simple with one catch neither ambiguous identifier nor module names can be captured or quoted in any way as far as i know so you ll have to put them in strings given as arguments to the th function

versioning	upgrade
upgrade it to a newer versioning

8509316
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is that the hover event over the icons and headers of the datatable only works in firefox in google-chrome or ie the event is not triggered

8509352
hide	show
i have a drop down menu that is a simple show and hide on hover

8509395
hide	show
if you want to only show this dialogbox when a specific tab is selected you need to hide the dialog box when another tab is selected

8509395
hide	show
you can do this by adding a tablistener on the tabpanel and implement the onbeforetabselected method and check which tab is selected and hide or show the dialogbox

8509421

if you want to write an wrapper function over an free function like say malloc without modifying each and every instance in your code where the function is called then a simple macro shall suffice

free	malloc
though the example is for malloc it can be re-used for any free standing function really

8510042
post	get
you only get updates post facto

8510054
tolower	toupper
even though this assumes that the code behind the datatable is doing a toupper instead of tolower for case-insensitive comparison it seemed unlikely that this code will change its behavior which would break all the code that uses datatable with case-insensitive comparison

8510064
nexus	artifactory
i ve tried using both nexus and artifactory as repository managers

so the solution then is to hide the real upload and show the user some other element that looks how you want

8510587
division	subtract
you find the precision after division by subtract the precision of the numerator from the denominator so a straight divide would give 4.28 - 4.28 0 -- no significant bits

as you may guess i am new to melt cast reshape

8510911

8510932
width	height
have a figure window with a given position x y width and height with a plot inside

8510932
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
make the plot as height and width to have the tightinset plus a margin in each direction of a certain px-size tightinset + 10px as big as the figure window

8510939
inherited	properties
i know there are several way to avoid this situation not using inherited using a stored procedure to insert a new derived entity calling the id-generating db-function before inserting and set the id properties myself on the entity but at the moment the above-described behavior would be the most preferable so i want to make sure not to overlook something before deciding for any plan b

8510949
udp	tcp
udp and jms are different in many ways and fundamentally since jms typically relies on the features inherent to tcp see this comparison of udp and tcp to get an idea of the differences of the two underlying protocols

8510955

i figured this out when declaring get put post etcc.

8511046
ivar	subclassing
you make a subclassing and you muck about with the ivar there

8511046
ivar	subclassing
when the compiler processes the subclassing it cannot see the synthesize line so it would have no idea that you just changed the name of the ivar

8511046
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
in fact it cannot even tell if the properties is backed by an ivar at all or if it s implemented with custom-written accessor methods

8511046
ivar	subclassing
i hope it s obvious why this means that the subclassing cannot possibly access the ivar and neither can any other class

8511062
post	get
but when i would try to create edit or update post i would get the errors

8511064

8511367
getter	setter
use the following to get a basic entity class definition from your mapping complete with getter setter functions for each property

8511367
getter	setter
you re still responsible for modifying each getter setter to ensure that they are the proper datatype as the getter setter methods generated for the entity don t do any type casting converting

8511368
getter	setter
property creates the getter and setter for your variable but is often confused for a variable itself

8511372
for-loop	loops
you need to remove that from the for-loop and make it an if statement inside loops

8511392
for-loop	loops
the conditional in the for-loop indicates when loops should stop

8511414
folder	directory
common part will be stored in src main resources and other configs will be in appropriate folder in config directory

8511438

but it seems that the sortable property is not taken and in addition once i move a blue box i can t drag it anymore

8511452

well it should loops once you see in a your for-loop works like this it checks the conditions 1 and 2 and if this condition is true it steps inside the for-loop braces

8511472
dictionary	map
you are usually better to use a dictionary to map keys to values that s what they are for and you avoid the use of exec and eval

hash	md5
if you are looking at the file contents you can use the md5 hash to determine if the file contents match or don t match

8511541
hash	md5
this way files that have matching md5 hash and thus matching contents would be in the same hash list

8511564
java.util.calendar	java.util.date

8511848
switching	screens
when you switching to a different tab you get a smaller photo artifact for a couple of seconds in the right corner of the slideshow screens i have a feeling this will go away when #1 is resolved

profiling	benchmarking
the good news is i think that your problems are common and shouldn t be too hard to fix once you ve done some benchmarking and profiling

8511856
rational-numbers	base
additionally rational-numbers that are exactly representable as floating point numbers in base 10 like 0.1 or 0.7 do not have an exact representation as floating point numbers in base 2 which is used internally no matter the size of the mantissa

8512051
cdr	cons
push cons cdr x car x res

8512061
public	protected
and nsgod is right that normal instance variables are protected by default rather than public fixed that

8512106
octal	hex
hex 0x1b6 is octal 0666

8512122

public	protected
protected ivars differ from public ivars in that you can t access them using

8512167

other classes know only about the property a property means a getter and a setter method but they don t know anything about the inner implementation of its methods

8512238
public	protected

hide	show
i am trying to figure out how to show hide a navigation link based on the users role

8512276
post	get
when i tried this in a sample code what i was able to see was that query parameters get are given precedence than the post body

8512276
post	get
so according to the code for params the get parameters should get overridden by post parameters in case of identical keys

8512276
post	get
note that get method and post method were also overridden mainly to convert the hash returned to an object of hashwithindifferentaccess

8512276
post	get
so looking at the code here it becomes evident that post parameters are overridden by get parameters in case of identical keys in rails

8512276
post	get
or in other words get parameters are given precedence over post parameters

8512641
hide	show
changing the visibility of bottom linearlayout will show hide it

8512641

8512860
width	height
after i show the div i am placing an iframe at exact same coordinates as the personalizeflyout div with same width and height

8513731
folder	directory
just thought i d answer this for anyone coming along - as far as i can make out the answer to the question is no not really - unless i m doing it the wrong way - and i think not then the best method of backing up a custom theme is to first compress the entire app skin and media if relevant directory into one archive file move this and expand it in an empty directory then carefully delete all the other theme folder leaving just the files which you are using and the directory trees which you have created - this preserves any files you have in your custom theme and also the necessary directory structure

8518586
width	height
what i am doing is i just display webpage in webview and disable scroll then i can find the max height of webview and device screen size height and width now i have put two buttons for next and previous pages which just scroll page according to height of device size

8518589
width	height
so you need to double triple your width and height to receive a better resolution

8518608
glassfish	weblogic
for example lets say we have a web project which needs a specific jar a to run on glassfish server while the same project needs additional jar b to run on weblogic in its web-inf lib folder

8518620

the viewbox controls the coordinate system of the objects it contains and the height and width attributes control how big it looks

8518722
fflush	gets
without more code i d say you need to fflush your dao so the instance gets persisted

8518722
fflush	gets
refresh is only object level while fflush does an actual transaction on database level hence the so it gets rolled back after the test

8518758
int	chars
now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int

8518758
int	chars
int is 32 bits and chars is 16 bits

8518788
for-loop	loops
if you just want to have a single loops you can use a for-loop and use the same index value for both collections

8518797
free	malloc
the c standard mandates that the same address returned by malloc be passed to free to deallocate the dynamic memory so it is clear that malloc maintains some kind of table or mapping for each allocated address mind you exact details are unspecefied where it stores the size of the allocated memory against the address and so it knows exactly how much memory was allocated for every address it returned back to its callers

8518805
portrait	landscape
we have disabled user zooming and have used a media query to tell users to keep their device landscape for the best experience it s a web based presentation but if they have the device portrait at all it messes up the scaling when it switches back to landscape and they can t get back to the original state

8518823
ienumerable	ienumerator
instead of the foreach you can access the ienumerator from the ienumerable of both collections using the getenumerator method and then call movenext on the collection when you need to move on to the next element in that collection

8518827
int	chars
what you can do is to first cast the chars to int - this cast is okay since both are primitive types - and then the int can be boxed

8518827
int	chars
of course chars - int boxing could have been made working

8518907

8519518
button	checkbox
when designing say a windows form application it is possible to drag controls directly onto the form button checkbox etc

8519526
persistent	transient
if the variable is declared as transient then it will not be persistent

8519526
persistent	transient
so all those variables which you do not need to store in the persistent state of the object can be declared as transient

8519529
put	get
in the code above if first thread tries to get data and queue is empty i put in wait via wait 0 until other thread add data to queue an release from waiting via notify

superclass	subclassing
define equality for superclass in terms of a and b and don t override it in subclassing

8522737
superclass	subclassing
always treat instances of superclass and subclassing as not equal

8522737
superclass	subclassing
it allows you to define equality differently in superclass based on a and b and subclassing based on a b and c

8522737
superclass	subclassing
note that overriding equals and hashcode in subclassing is not enough in this case - you also need a special trick when implementing equals method of superclass see part about canequals method in how to write an equality method in java

backbone.js	javascriptmvc
this is a common pattern in the javascriptmvc framework that i m more used to that backbone.js

8526515
width	height
width 100 height 57 p r n p br p r n p br p

8526556
mouseleave	mouseenter
your problem is that hover is not a javascript event it is jquery shorthand for the mouseenter and mouseleave events so it can t be used in the live method like that

8526616
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in ie using ie9 and not in firefox or google-chrome

8526616
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome handled the error but ie9 is much harder on bad programmers

8526632
int	chars
f2py is complaining about my variable declarations trying to change chars to int and appending

8526674
folder	directory
if you just want to move the physical directory where your domain is located to the primarydomain.com folder the rules below should work

8526678
junit	mockito
i need to do some junit mock preferably using mockito testing in my managed beans

8526689
mouseleave	mouseenter
you need to explicitly check for the mouseenter and mouseleave events using the event.type

8526800
int	chars
what s probably happening is that scanf treats the address of the int object i as if it were a pointer to a chars

8526800
int	chars
if you had called your chars variable c and your int variable i rather than vice versa it would have been easier to keep track of which is which

8526800
int	chars
but c is a reasonable name for an int variable used to hold input chars values -- not for scanf but for getchar as in

8526804
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
now what s weird is that the uiviewcontroller which houses the uiwebview is in a uitabbarcontroller and when i click on another tab the uiwebview finally gets its shouldstartloadwithrequest called

8526814
google-chrome	firefox
the code i m using works great in firefox and google-chrome but in ie7 8 i get the error message unable to get value of the property appendchild object is null or undefined and the script tag cannot be seen in the dom

8526833
trie	tree
as suggested a trie would be more efficient than a binary tree but you can use a hashmap and hash each word

8526853
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the image creation works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari but using the images in three.js as a texture doesn t show up in firefox

8526853
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine for me in google-chrome and safari but just doesn t show up in firefox

8526859
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each

8526859
equals	gethashcode
compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not

8526895
hide	show
click a report and the jquery hide contmain and show contreports now a new sql query runs to display the report based on the id

8526951
rss	feed
you can also get the content of the page that you need and parse it with regexp or as above was said nate b write some type of code for example rss feed pass content with json create some web service and etc

8527026
yacc	bison
i m trying to create a lalr 1 parser in yacc bison that can accept commands with flexible grammar

8527060
ienumerable	iqueryable
as long as mycollection implements ienumerable or iqueryable the where method will work and will return a subset of matching elements

8527062
d3.js	protovis
d3.js is the successor of protovis today

8527082
width	height
the outer div has a starting width height of 0px slowly increases in width height which creates the effect of slowly revealing the inner div from the centre outwards

8527093
google-chrome	firefox
there are actually no problems in the cshtml files as they all run perfectly in firefox google-chrome with no errors

8527101
textview	imageview
each item in the listview has sub items such as imageview and textview

8527202
textview	imageview
since you have only an imageview and a textview you can change your imageview to imagebutton

8527206
jar	war
project is compiled built using ant with various targets one target to generate classes from xsd another to generate client jar another to generate server war ear

8527206
jar	war
so my main question really is - how do i approach this project architecture using maven so that i only use single instance of any source file xsd java etc and i am able to conveniently generate classes from xsd build client jar and server war ear

8527222
int	double
arrays are always passed by reference in c so passing the address of an array of int to a function in main is like passing a double pointer

8527263
ienumerable	iqueryable
note that if you do this with linq to entities instead of linq to objects this might not work as well or you ll at least have to return iqueryable instead of ienumerable

8527265
submit	submission
when i press the submit button nothing happens no submission no error messages nothing at all the page gets stuck

8527305
post	get
i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post

8527315
settings.bundle	plist
im trying to open the url i saved in the iphone settings settings.bundle plist and it saves but now i m trying to open the url in safari with the url i saved in the key

8527344
move	drag
if i have a a number of elements in one table column and i drag them one at a time to another column utilizing jquery ui how do i make remaining items in the first column move up fill the gap left by the items that were move

8527347
getter	setter
you will need to create getter and setter for page

8527354
yacc	bison
you can simulate them with extra actions but unfortunately yacc and bison don t give you a way to do them more directly btyacc provides syntacic sugar to make this much easier.

8527354
yacc	bison
in yacc or bison this becomes something like

8527360
pop-up	dialog
i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window

8527360
pop-up	dialog
use firebug and track the html changes and you should see the pop-up being created just behind the dialog

8527366
ready	each
they are used to ensure each element has fully loaded and is ready for manipulation use

8527372
gdal	ogr
i would recommend looking at gdal ogr as a starting point

8527410
recvfrom	datagram
i send datagram client - server via sendto and reply from server to client using the ip and port obtained from recvfrom function

8527458
client-side	server-side
i d rather get it server-side than client-side then passing it to the server

8527459
datamapper	activerecord
i have an existing rails 3 application using activerecord and i want to switch to datamapper

8527520
move	drag
the problem is whenever the user drag the cell up so that it move out of view and then it falls back down again the text field resigns its first responder status because the cell is being reloaded

8527549
subtraction	addition
one way to translate bitshift and addition operations from javascript to java is to isolate the operands of a bit shift operation with int casts and isolate operands of an addition subtraction operation with long casts since java will cast an addition operation exceeding 2 bil to an int without them and javascript automatically casts longs in bitshifts to ints while java doesn t

8527559
post	get
you send it as a form field called access_token your data can be set by either get or post

8527566
terminate	timeout
when the query is killed if you ve set your while loop to check for a timeout response it can then terminate the loop and you ll have an array with all of the records returned in 5 minutes

8527573
for-loop	loops
instead of using a foreach loops in your second loops can you instead use a for-loop like so to iterate over all cells

8527598
children	parent
instead of using .closest you could use the parent function to find the owner then use the other tree traversal functions to find the children that match certain selectors

8527609
integer	unsigned
java s int type is 32-bit signed whereas javascript s operator returns a 32-bit unsigned integer value so the following

8527625
filtering	grouping
the only way i can get it to filtering by date of checkdate is to grouping by empchecks.checkdate and use having checkdate whatever

8527661
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout or setinterval instead of your while loop

8527678
src	attr
so i would set the attr data-src and at the end set it to the src

8527694
post	put
some of my backbone models should always use post instead of post for create and put for update

8527698
ssl	https
first i ll show how to force ssl in current and earlier versions of rails then at the end i ve posted how to use http and https in parallel with each other which is what i think your looking for

8527698
ssl	https
the following code enables rack ssl and all its filters only in case the request comes from a https connection

8527713
pop-up	dialog
here s a snippet of code where i pop-up a simple dialog chooser

8527720
folder	directory
i run that command and when i go to lib directory there is no model folder

8527745
width	height
2 never use bitmap.createbitmap width height config.argb_8888

8527745
width	height
so what you should use instead is bitmap.createscaledbitmap srcbitmap width height false

8527754
profiling	benchmarking
you ll have to benchmarking profiling to find out but it s entirely possible that secret.exe just wastes time

8527763
versioning	upgrade
if you re able to upgrade to versioning 3 you ll find some other nice improvements as well

8527774
integer	unsigned
if you want to treat that as a number the safest is to chose an unsigned integer of fixed width most probably uint32_t

8527825
libc	newlib
when i run nm usr arm-elf lib thumb libc.a which i believe is the newlib version of libc it shows

8527872
mouseover	mouseout
you should move your buttons into a different hierarchy level than the graphics you are changing - even if the buttons disappear or are covered with graphics for just a very short moment both mouseover and mouseout events will be fired the mouse has left and reentered the button - and that probably causes your loop

8527879
width	height
mask width and height should be your mouseover region and give it alpha 0

8527899
post	get
uhm first of all i m seeing your form action is post instead of get so it s natural you don t appen the service input to the url.

8527941
pop-up	dialog
i don t really care what the ant script or eclipse fails for -- that s what logging is for -- but the dialog box that pop-up along with it is unacceptable because it hangs our continuous integration system while it waits for the invisible user to come click on it

8528029
post	get
override mymodule_user to get access to post update call-backs

8528032
google-chrome	firefox
so i create the following html document in notepad save it as test.html and run it through google-chrome ie and firefox and all three are returning a strip of 20px high and 100 width with a red background

8528070
subtract	add
have the function calculate only the number of roaches that migrate and add subtract in the main loop

8528085
cos	sin
i am pretty sure that i have to use sin or cos here but i am unsure were

8528109
accessor	properties
rather than sending -release to the object returned by the properties accessor method set the properties itself to nil

8528109
accessor	properties
synthesizing a properties declared with retain semantics is effectively equivalent to writing the following accessor methods

8528122
opera	google-chrome
4 - it s not browser-specific - seen in f f opera google-chrome

8528156
post	get
i am using redis brukva pub sub mesaaging for realtime chat but i cant decide which mesaaging queue system should i use for private messaging part since its not realistic to send and process messages in a single post get request

8528170
maven	pom.xml
the idea is that users would be able to install the application using the pom.xml and a single maven command

8528183
lme4	nlme
some of the other answers are workable but i claim that the best answer is to use the accessor method that is designed for this -- varcorr this is the same as in lme4 s predecessor the nlme package

8528239
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing inherited from the superclass extends and also overrides the 2 superclass methods to add improved functionality that was lacking in the superclass.the subclassing has 1 instance variable that is a unique id

8528239
superclass	subclassing
i wanted to show the overriding of the equals and hashcode method for both the superclass and subclassing

8528239
superclass	subclassing
i did not want to use the default memory reference check but wanted to show equality or uniqueness using my 2 mutable int variables superclass and 1 unique id subclassing

8528255
onresume	onpause
yes by using a combination of lifecycles see onpause and onresume methods and startactivityforresult and onactivityresult ..

8528289
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
activity a will have onpause called and activity b will have oncreate onresume and onstart called

8528293
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m building a client-server app for iphone the server is written with c# and uses tcplistener to listen for incoming connections and tcpclient to handle each connection

8528300
g++	gcc
the c code does not compile using g++ so i need to use gcc

8528300
g++	gcc
using does not work because that s just to tell the compiler how to handle the function names i want g++ to behave like gcc entirely for one portion of the code and like g++ for another

8528323
for-loop	arrays
or using a for-loop over the arrays

8528324
post	get
just changing post type in ajax type of sending turning on get it works fine

8528344
getter	setter
while resources have the attributes with setter and getter id that is an object property with attibutes name and value

8528345
filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	hfs+	ntfs	fat	hfs+
for a file itself it s easy but for a directory you can t as far as i know do it through java because it s dependent on the filesystems fat ntfs hfs+ ext4 etc.

8528352
post	get
now my plan is to write a service or a batch file that will get the wall post of the page for my company on facebook and store the results in the sql database

8528372
kindle	nook
samsung galaxy tab 7 samsung galaxy player acer iconia a500 nook color lg optimus kindle fire

8528392
ubuntu	linux
i need to remotely shutdown and reboot linux ubuntu machines without logging into them otherwise simple commands can do the job

8528409
g++	gcc
make 2 copies of the same source one to be compiled by g++ the other gcc

8528414
opera	firefox
graphic files have there own headers with caching information witch in your case tells opera it s ok to use cached files - you can check headers using for example firebug for firefox

8528440
pthreads	epoll
it is meant to replace the older pthreads select 2 and poll 2 system calls to achieve better performance in more demanding applications where the number of watched file descriptors is large unlike the older system calls which operate at o n epoll operates in o 1 2

8528463
for-loop	loops
my algorithm would be a for-loop that loops through each index of the abs fft to look for a peak

8528465
typhoeus	curb
i d recommend and typhoeus curb for starting points

8528479
super	extends
a sub extends super so sub.equals and sub.hashcode both delegate to super.equals and super.hashcode

8528495
loops	if-statement
just write it all out and you don t need any loops or if-statement

8528544
keydown	keyup
i tried using commands as well as attaching events to keyup to the window but commands intercept keys before the textbox gets a chance to view them keydown bubbles to the window level even if textbox used the key

8528552
hash	md5
this will internally take an md5 hash of the path add a potential prefix and also take the current locale language into account

8528584
decltype	auto
it s auto + decltype

8528588
for-loop	arrays
the first example a for-loop will iterate through the elements of an arrays and is the preferred method of looping through an arrays

8528600
chunked	transfer-encoding
i have a client making a soap request to a server from a java client which sets the header transfer-encoding chunked

8528600
chunked	transfer-encoding
is it possible to send both transfer-encoding chunked and content-length 123 as headers

8528610
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome safari no errors in console but when i try to use it in firefox it doesn t

8528614
memcpy	memset
this applies to both memset and memcpy

8528614
memcpy	memset
misalignment in some cases when you re dealing with misaligned data on a processor that doesn t support misaligned accesses memset and memcpy may be the only clean solution

8528614
memcpy	memset
although memset and memcpy are usually compiler intrinsics with special handling by the compiler they are still generic functions

8528614
sse	avx
a common example is when using sse avx intrinsics

8528614
sse	avx
if you simply write a loop using sse avx aligned load store intrinsics you can probably do better

8528645
daemon	cron
if you re looking for something easy to just run a specific script when new files arrive the incron daemon provides a very handy combination of inotify 7 and cron 8 -like support for executing programs on demand

8528655
google-chrome	safari
when first loading the show page the listners are created at least i can trace them in google-chrome safari

8528659
int	chars
the problem is i m actually doing some compression so i generate int between 0 and 255 and i want to write the chars who s ascii value is equal to that int

8528685
stdout	stderr
if you are redirecting stdout or writing to any other handle like stderr it will not show up in its output

8528706
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

8528715
outputstream	inputstream
when you are processing byte-oriented data as distinct from character-oriented data you should be using inputstream and outputstream classes and not reader and writer classes

8528715
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in this case you should use fileinputstream fileoutputstream and wrap with a bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream if you are doing byte-at-a-time reads and writes

8528734
outputstream	inputstream
byte i o is handled by subclasses of inputstream and outputstream while character i o is handled by subclasses of reader and writer

8528759
width	height
so if you define width and height of the canvas to 100 it will always show the map covering whole screen

8528804
hash	salt
if you are choosing a hashing system yourself rather than building an app using an existing database which already contains hash passwords then you should make sure your hashing algorithm also uses a salt

8528804
hash	salt
this automatically generates a salt and concatenates it with the hash value in a single string

8528823
hide	show
i m trying to add a button that show and hide a div at the bottom of my website

8528836
button	checkbox
i want to check all checkbox when click on the button

8528837
min	max
we have a jdbc datasource that has a connection pool with a min max of 1 10

8528883
inherited	subclassing
super is referring to the base class that your uiviewcontroller subclassing inherited from

8528903
gif	png
my gd wrapper works like charm with jpeg and png images however when using gif image the resulting image loses transparency

8528918
post	get
i am using ajax functions to get and post various forms via an api.php file

8528939
bash	subshell
another solution is to define the function to run in a subshell but still within the same instance of bash and then cancel the set -f within that function by using set +f

8528979
superclass	subclassing
the pointer is declared to be of some superclass which is extended by several subclassing

8529000
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried this in safari google-chrome and firefox and i ve cleared my history and cache

8529025
width	height
cgbitmapcontextcreate returns nil because the width and height parameters were set as floats not ints

8529029
memcpy	memset
as already answered the compiler often has hand optimized routines for memset memcpy and other string functions

8529029
memcpy	memset
now the amount of code number of instructions that a fast memcpy or memset from the compiler is usually much larger than the loop solution you suggested

8529029
memcpy	memset
if possible and it is with some processors and memory systems the memset or the write part of a memcpy can be single instructions with a whole cache line or whole ddr location and there is no read required instantly doubled speed

8529029
memcpy	memset
at a minimum the compiler memset and memcpy routines are going to perform a byte operation if the start address is odd then a 16 bit if not aligned on 32 bits

8529030
centos	linux
not sure about this behavior in other centos version or linux distros but in centos 6.1 etc udev rules.d 70-persistant-net.rules is automatically generated by the os and after a couple of reboots it will be regenerated based on the mac addresses in the ifcfg-eth files

8529192
post	get
one of the answers below has me on a better track i ll post some better code when i get it to work

8529193
createfile	getlasterror
i have written a class to handle named pipe connections and if i create an instance close it and then try to create another instance the call to createfile returns invalid_handle_value and getlasterror returns error_pipe_busy

8529211
getter	setter
so in summary the new technique creates a getter and setter for you property and allows you to also specify the name to be used for the instance variable used for encapsulation

8529234
queue	fifo
you want a fifo queue

8529234
queue	fifo
user448810 mentions the standard implementation for a purely-functional fifo queue

8529286
jar	war
if coreproject also has web stuff in it stuff the belongs in a war not a jar then you could make it a war project and have the other two war projects incorporate it using war file overlaying

8529312
width	height
the #framecont div is like a container with a set width and height

8529325
overwrite	preserve
as you re using -p to preserve full-path info you ll really need to be careful not to overwrite your working system with old files

8529338
superclass	subclassing
so superclass reference variable can hold reference of subclassing object without cast but when you assign reference from the superclass reference variable to the subclassing reference variable you must have to cast

8529348
jboss	glassfish
jboss 6.1.0 final and glassfish 3.1

8529348
jboss	glassfish
mywebapp jboss machine b ----- jbosshelloworldejb jboss machine b ---- glassfishhelloworldejb glassfish machine a

8529350
post	get
whether you submit these methods via get or post the captcha var will be checked on the server side at which point you can admit deny for the purposes of averting bots

8529361
folder	directory
i want to make a drracket program that can copy all of the files from a given directory taking it off of a usb camera when it s plugged in it s seen as a mass storage device and paste them into a folder on my computer s hard drive

8529371
inherited	properties
we know that when a class inherited from its base class it takes with it the public properties and methods

8529402
freemarker	velocity
velocity or freemarker

8529437
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome but not in ie

8529461
min	max	range	min	range	max
a defined min max range

8529482
post	get
either use post and not get or

8529597
interpolation	splines
splines interpolation in exel

8529601
int	double	int	chars
they are not actual types in the c++ sense in that they are neither pod plain old data like int double chars etc. nor classes

8529609
put	get
like you said you could draw a curve and plot those points then put them into some equation solver to get an equation that could describe the curve you re looking for

8529636
stdout	stderr
subprocess.call also accept stdin stdout stderr redirections

8529657
getter	setter
remember properties are basically just shorthand for the underlying setter and getter methods so you can also conform by having the appropriate setter and getters.

8529659
width	height
more generally top left should be at w-w 2 h-h 2 where w and h are the width and height of the canvas and w and h are the width and height of the image to be drawn

8529709
decimal	ieee
the size of a float is platform-dependent although a maximum of 1.8e308 with a precision of roughly 14 decimal digits is a common value the 64 bit ieee format

8529713
udp	rtp
and there is no other broadcast form of traffic than sending rtp udp packets over two different ip addresses

8529776
post	get
you may want to look into the post redirect get design pattern where a post is only used for sending data to the db or to the server for processing and all data displayed comes from a get that the post calls

8529846
google-chrome	firefox
just tested something that works perfect on firefox and google-chrome doesn t makes anyhing with font-weight bold bolder property

8529946
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that if the main app pop-up a modal dialog when helper is active and the helper then refocuses the wrong window the modal dialog is hidden and the main app appears frozen

8529956
prepare	execute
the sqlite prepare statements seems like a good way to execute queries versus raw sql statements

8529971
for-loop	loops
i don t know what topics your class will cover later but you may consider looking into the for each loops instead of the standard for-loop

8530036
swing	windowbuilder
i ve tried using swing by hand with eclipse windowbuilder pro and with netbeans all with little success

8530055
width	height
however for client side preview i want to show it at the width i have specified but get the height of the image after being resized to the specified width and adjust it with javascript

8530103
swt	swing
if you don t like swing you may try swt

8530123
many-to-one	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one	many-to-many	one-to-many
consequently the direct many-to-many association disappears and is replaced by one-to-many many-to-one associations between the 3 participating classes

8530127
min	max
of course if you wanted to avoid having to code on every case you could define your own isinrange num min max type function to return a boolean and then say

8530144
decoder	encoder
i used google protocol buffers as encoder decoder over http s

8530147
super	abstract
while there are others which refer to attributes of the class in which case i think it makes more sense to make it as an abstract super class

8530160
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
changing the html to what i have below adding the fixes the issue in google-chrome firefox ie9 and safari

8530181
entity-relationship	diagram
check out the entity-relationship diagram sample online -- it s probably pretty close to what you want

8530193
hex	binary
in my case i was saving the sha1 keys into binary 20 columns by calling the mysql function unhex when i inserted them and then calling hex when i pulled them out 1

textview	imageview
i have a relative layout that has an imageview and and a textview aligned to right of the imageview

8533806
textview	imageview
initially textview s visiblity is set to gone hence the size of the view is just that of the imageview

8533806
textview	imageview
now when the view receives focus i set the visibility of textview to visible and set an animation to incrementally resize the view from imageview s width to approximately imageview+textview width i am actually giving hard coded value in the program

8533806
textview	imageview
hence for my solution i kept the parent layout relative layout set to fill_parent for the width had another child layout background whose size i could control through program and then on top of this i have my imageview parent left aligned + textview right of imageview fill_parent

8533806
textview	imageview
so when the view is created for the first time parent layout is always fill_parent background layout has size of the imageview only and set textview s visiblity to invisible

8534034
post	get
when using the post form post method i get the following output

8534039
puts	gets
after lot of testing however i ve come into some light about the problem it seems that when you pass the enddate to the script it transform it to string to later again transform it to a date object when doing this the script seems to ignore the hour and it simple puts 00 00 00 00 but when checking the max selectable date it gets 12 00 00 00 since the date i m givin is greater than today it becomes not selectable

8534048

post	get
how do i get the translated sourcetext value from the google sample rest from javascript into the formfield so i can post the value to another destination

i am unable to navigate to any other place because when i drag the map it start showing gray tiles after a fixed width and height

8535491
spaces	linefeed
i d like to add a spaces after any point found with an alphabetic or numeric character just after it no spaces found assuming the next character after the point is not an end of line cr linefeed ... character

8535527
google-chrome	firefox
something like this see fiddle will work for google-chrome and ie note it will not look right for firefox

8535540
quicksort	mergesort
i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant

8535542
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in all other browsers i ve tested firefox opera google-chrome chromium

8535554
comparator	comparable
treeset has a constructor that takes a comparator meaning even if the objects you store aren t comparable objects by themselves you can provide a custom comparator

8535623
superclass	subclassing
the only way to do what you are talking about is to subclassing the object and write a new hashcode and equals and this would only really make sense to do if the subclassing had a defining variable that should be added in addition to the superclass hashcode and equals

8535626
folder	directory
having read that there are several issues with the drawable folder i copied it verbatim into the directory

8535627
screens	tablet
you ll then do something like this if screens comparevalue then we have tablet else phone

8535631
uiview	subviews
i tried adding a new tableviewcontroller complete with xib and then removing the uitableview in ib and replacing with a uiview and a uitableview as a subviews hooking up i believe the delegate to the file s owner

8535634
children	parent
in other words all components are children of the parent tab panel and so are processed on each request..even if they aren t visible

8535649
getter	setter
if you want a generic solution to the problem you would have to extract getter and setter into an interface and then use a proxy to either intercept all methods starting with set or have them annotated and process annotations in your handler and then either do nothing or preferrably throw an unsupportedoperationexception

8535671
google-chrome	safari
if the user right-clicks and selects download linked file as or its equivalent the file is presented with a .pdf.png extension in google-chrome and safari

8535671
google-chrome	firefox
i want firefox and google-chrome to know that it is a pdf

8535673
google-chrome	safari
so it s doing a sync xhr in google-chrome safari and an async one in everything else by default because it passes options.sync as the value for the async argument to xmlhttprequest.open which is backwards but whatever

8535673
google-chrome	firefox
and since you don t specify whether you want sync or async you get sync in google-chrome and async in firefox

8535695
g++	gcc
in reality scons simply directs to the gcc g++ compilers in the sdk build directories

8535696
google-chrome	firefox
my website looks fine in firefox and google-chrome but for some reason internet explorer renders it horribly

8535708
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

8535732
getter	setter
the problem is in order to use hibernate all the persisting attributes has to have getter and setter

8535746
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator

8535746
equals	compareto
compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals

8535775
getter	setter
with hibernate you can have private setter or have hibernate only operate on the fields and ignore the getter setter completely

8535775
getter	setter
with field-access hibernate doesn t need there to be any getter or setter for a property but it also goes around any logic you may have had to do other things like set transient non-persisted properties on your objects

8535784
int	boolean
row then you can use jtable # changeselection int rowindex int columnindex boolean toggle boolean extend for example

8535825
jboss	glassfish
that are for example at least tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 websphere as 8 jetty 8 etc

8535826
submit	submission
in your form to stop the form submission you just added a .click fn to the submit button

8535863
maven	pom.xml
the same thing happens with maven except that the way to tell maven that you need that jar is by adding it as a dependency in the pom.xml

8535874
uitapgesturerecognizer	uicontrol
if you decide not to use a button or not to use the uicontrol methods you can attach a uitapgesturerecognizer to the same view with a different target action

8535880
for-loop	loops
in this case where foo and baa are only used within the for-loop it s best practice to declare them inside loops

8535882
google-chrome	safari	hash	md5
the sha1 and md5 hash obtained this way match the fingerprints displayed by safari and google-chrome for an untrusted certificate

8535890
implements	extends
you can extends class a and implements setters that throw an unsupportedoperationexception or just do nothing when called

8535904
jaxb2-maven-plugin	xjc
i have a modular project in which for every single module i use jaxb2-maven-plugin to compile xsd files with xjc

8535943
put	get
when done it would put it back in the blockingqueue letting the next thread get the class

8535953
post	get
there is another post about this same thing how can i get the md5 fingerprint from java #39

8535957
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is how it looks correct in firefox google-chrome and safari

8535959
filtering	grouping
i need set a s columns showing on the graph by default but i need a filtering or action that will allow the user to switch the grouping without having to select the companies individually such as a single-select radio-button style filtering with the following

8535959
filtering	grouping
currently i have an exclude single-select filtering on which will exclude the selected grouping

8535959
toolbar	tabs
toolbar no tabs no

8536053
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so i have a uitabbarcontroller with an uinavigationcontroller in it

8536068
websocket	pusher
hosted websocket services such as pusher - who i work for

8536090
pull	push
create a git repository populate it with a pull from the svn repository via git-svn and push that to github

8536190
maven	pom.xml
it seems you have changed something maven does not find the parent pom.xml referenced by relativepath attribute

8536221
put	get
when you get to session type information i would want to carefully analyze those requirements and put the relevant pieces in the message schema itself

8536226
put	get
put this in a subquery and we can get the maximum

8536232
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the layout does not display correctly in google-chrome 16.0 or safari 5.1.1 but does display correctly in firefox 8

8536261
switching	screens
to start simple a switching case in the ondraw checks the screens and then calls the right thing to draw

8536287
google-chrome	safari
safari just connects google-chrome however prompts for the user pass

8536315
min	max
if bin_range is not given then use min of all data max of all data as the bin_range

8536315
min	max
that means that the bins are ultimately determined in your first example of two sets of input data by calling numpy s histogram with bins 10 and bin_range min of all data max of all data on the first set of data

8536330
gridview	objectdatasource
when i connect a gridview to the objectdatasource it wants to count the rows in the eventlog

8536350
firefox	safari
however when i uploaded the website to adobe browserlab and when i looked at safari and firefox on a os x the footer is a bit off from safari and firefox on a windows operating system

8536383
google-chrome	firefox
you can target browsers specifically normally firefox google-chrome etc work roughly the same and ie may work slightly differently

8536393
keydown	keyup
you have to keep track of keydown keyup events and keep a list of all the keys that are currently down

8536396
webkit	gecko
especially gecko and webkit rendering engines behave almost exactly the same on each platform bugs should be easy to squash

8536478
firefox	safari
it works on internet explorer to some extent but fails when i call try to run it on safari or firefox

8536535
firefox	safari
you can find out yourself by using a javascript debugger such as firebug for firefox or the built-in web inspector for safari

8536544
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
if you want to specify a grammar and have ocaml generate lexers and parsers for you check out these ocamllex and ocamlyacc tutorials

8536553
cos	sin
if your space is not euclidean then the transformation you want may not actually be affine or if it is affine the matrix for the rotation might not be as simple as what i wrote above with sin and cos

8536565
width	height
be prepared to keep track of a lot of x y positions and the width and height of each object

8536576
width	height
the solution was as commented before to display the swf files in a separate php page in which you set the the height width of the swf via swfobject and then using the iframe source setting of fancybox

8536579
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is specific to internet explorer at least in version 6 as other major browsers firefox and google-chrome do not present this behavior

8536583
for-loop	loops
dude the best way from performance point of view is to iterate using for-loop and the first time you encounter the desired value update it and use the break to terminate loops

8536589
gif	png
according to the msdn documentation by default the fileextensionsattribute .net 4.5 should allow me to only upload only jpg jpeg gif and png files - which is what i want

8536597
opera	google-chrome
in ie7 8 9 google-chrome opera - all as expected pop-up open form don t

8536597
opera	google-chrome
ie7 8 9 google-chrome opera - hit bp on line 1 then bp on line 2

8536597
jquery	jqmodal
jqmshow - command from jqmodal this is a plugin for jquery

8536613
division	multiplication
this could be more efficient than the division because e.g the two multiplication can be pipelined in paralle

8536635
folder	directory
the value r sort of did the trick but then the application couldn t find its template files even if i moved them out of the polls directory and into the root of the templates folder

8536638
n-gram	words
as your data is machine generated use also words bigrams and tigrams even higher order n-gram

8536662
installation	upgrade
we have developed a somewhat diffuse system for handling component installation and upgrade across server environments in an automated manner

8536669
versioning	upgrade
your web.xml which is syntactically invalid by the way specifies the old servlet 2.4 versioning which was upgrade over 5 years ago already

8536694
sproutcore	cappuccino
because it is the most popular client-side framework relative to others sproutcore amber.js spine knockout.js cappuccino etc. there is plenty of documentation

8536703
width	height
both width and height must be sufficiently large

precision i really want to set these properties within the post treatment not in a get

8536819
post	get
post username and password and get set-cookie

8536819
post	get
use to post username and password and get set-cookie

8536842
post	get
i can achieve that by using js and get method but my goal now is to use js probably with submit and post method

8536890
children	parent
however i need some help with my css because it applies the arrows to all child elements if the parent has children

8536931
width	height
so the only mode that will change the stage width height values is noscale

8536988
children	parent
each parent has an id each child object has a property parentid that identifies a unique parent like child.parentid parent.id each parent object has property children

8536988
children	parent
this methd attaches to each parent children property the children that matches on parent.id child.parentid

8536988
children	parent
i actually do not have objects with the property names parent children rather i have all kinds of properties that manifest the child parent relationship

8536997
zoo	xts	zoo	chron	xts	chron
note that r has lots of date formats so it s worth checking to see whether you are currently using posixct or date or chron or zoo or xts or one of the other formats

8537018
superclass	subclassing
making an override method in subclassing less accessible than it was in superclass would violate the contract of the superclass .

8537033
width	height

8537035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
alternatively if possible it would be much simpler to educate the users to have 2 or 3 different browsers for instance firefox opera google-chrome safari to mention the good ones

8537039
multibyte	substr
substr instead is multibyte save and doesn t count the bytes but the chars

8537046
int	double
i have a table including the columns int id pkey int group double sortorder where sortorder implements a user-specified sort order within one group

8537070
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer

8537075
put	get
then if you want the background to show through in the gutter put a border-right on the main-content area so that you get a sort of artificial gutter

8537079
width	height
copy from sx sy width sw and height sh to destination image dx dy

8537123
textview	imageview
my xml has several nested linearlayout s textview s and imageview s

8537129
for-loop	arrays
it would like to use a for-loop that would make it easier since i would like it to output all arrays until max is reached automatically

8537137
put	get
i guess what would be really good would be to build a database put some data in it and then get a tool that can create an in memory representation of it

8537138
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
inspect the generated dom tree instead with firebug firefox or the developer tools google-chrome safari

8537139
apache	nginx
you really should do it with nginx or apache conf if it s for all items in subdomain

8537150
ant	maven
if not maven or ant you can just run through the browser

8537150
junit	cactus
but unfortunately you might have to stick to cargo cactus based testing with junit 3

8537153
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
for example you have operator class which has add subtract multiplying divide static methods in it

8537156
draggable	droppable
using jquery ui draggable droppable i drag the items from the first column pick into the second one drop

8537158
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
depending on the browser i like google-chrome firefox safari for this you want to look at developer tools

8537158
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox you can use firebug in google-chrome it s developer tools and in safari you have to turn on developer menu through preferences

8537182
pull	push
anyway i have some code that was working yesterday but after i did a pull push with git something went a bit wrong with my validation

8537187
lisp	scheme
enforced in contrast to languages such as common lisp scheme or

8537260
post	get
in general it would be a good idea to post an explain plan with your query to get a better answer

8537312
folder	directory
i then was told to go to localhost where i should have a directory view of the htpdocs folder

8537403
bids	ssis
i am using ssis in bids 2008 and i am trying to get a count of an object variable containing a list of files

8537450
vlookup	sumifs
my excel knowledge doesn t get far past sumifs vlookup and pivottables

8537456
gridview	onclientclick
the program itself is using c# microsoft visual studio 2010 ajax sql server from godaddy -- stored procedures that are linked to sql datasources the tickets are stored in a gridview and onclientclick will display the ticket info the error message pops up when the ticket is associated with more than one productid

8537456
post	get
i will be active on this page so i will get back to questions fast and post things that are needed

8537492
portrait	landscape
i want to be able to detect and get notification when the user is rotate to landscape or portrait mode

8537498
ssl	https
i am only using ssl https as well on wls found under your server general configuration page specifically ssl listen port enabled

8537513
unix	bsd
i m not an expert of berkeley system distribution bsd unix filesystems so i can t really promise that it would work on any mac but this approach works on mine

8537525
kobold2d	cocos2d-iphone
kobold2d uses the latest stable versions of cocos2d-iphone 1.x and 2.x

8537534
pull	push
this way user x and i can push our local changes to our own public repos and then pull changes from each other s public repos

8537537
width	height
in order to override the attributes of the layout you re including you must also override both the layout width and layout height

8537542
apache	nginx
defaults to true but in the production environment is turned off as the server software nginx or apache used to run the application should serve static assets instead

8537567
kerberos	ntlm	ssl	ntlm
in terms of the client to the database there are several authentication models user pass ntlm kerberos and i think some more and you can use ssl and ipsec on the connection between the webserver and the database server

8537572
google-chrome	firefox
but on the test server it is working fine in google-chrome firefox etc

8537590
rss	feed
i would set up rss feed for each item you wanted to let people use

8537590
rss	feed
not sure what sort of system you re running but wordpress allows you to make custom rss feed based on almost anything you want

8537649
rss	feed
if your news articles are stored in a database table then you can easily extract them using php and populate an rss feed with them

8537682
accessor	properties
that s a safe habit to get into when working with properties to ensure you don t run into memory leaks because when you are dealing with pointers the accessor generated will release and retain for you

8537711
cells	tablecell
if i pass a center param into tablecell template i would want to create a table cells that has it s text centered and of course left would get it s contents left justified

8537716
min	max
parallelising at a min max node would be wasteful because you already have better choice so continuing down the path of lesser value is less likely to yield the best result

8537723
pull	push
assume that right now we have only one master branch and whenever we want to push anything to staging or production we have to git pull making all changes live even the unwanted ones

8537747
atof	strtod
atof could crash on this so use strtod instead

8537797
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql sqlite or even leveldb if you want simple key value store

8537813
rss	feed
there is no rss feed for linkedin groups as they all require the viewer to be a linkedin member to join at a minimum

8537813
post	get
you could use the groups api and the recommended php wrapper simple-linkedin to get the recent post from a given group but the catch as with all linkedin api integrations is thta the viewer must be authenticated against the api

8537871
org.json	gson
i d say use crest and ignore all these red-eye nerds who say that you should reinvent your own bicycle by using httpclient and gson org.json

8537872
inherited	properties
so thinking back on your original issue if there for some reason is some inherited of the z-index going on which can be checked in the chrome dev tools it might just be easier to explicitly set the z-index of each radmenu or the containing element as this will guarantee the desired behavior regardless of inherited since properties set on item itself with higher specificity should prevail

8537873
oncreate	onstart
that s because all service s lifecycle callback functions like oncreate and onstart are called from main ui thread

8537918
post	put
i have also retrieved all images from post and put them in a zip

8537933
stdout	fflush
maybe your stdout is not fflush immediately because it is not attached to a terminal

8537941
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
just test the code maybe you need to set the navigationcontroller as property if you need do sth like pushviewcontroller animated

8537975
integer	unsigned
i specifically want an integer or unsigned integer for this

8537994
mouse	keyboard
my goal is to make a program that will run transparently in the background minimized or in the quicklaunch area and have that program artificially implant keyboard and mouse input for a third party full screen application

8538006
hash	md5
using hashing algorithms like md5 we suffer from a limited entropy which means that very long passwords might result in hash that can be regenerated by a shorter password

8538044
portrait	landscape
i basically want to proportionally resize them so that for example a column which takes up 1 3 of the grid width in portrait orientation will still take up 1 3 of the width when switched to landscape

8538044
portrait	landscape
i basically just hard code the ipad and iphone landscape to portrait ratio

8538111
ssl	https
this is provided that your api is over ssl https

8538117
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox 8 google-chrome 16 and safari 5 on os x lion

8538124
children	parent
the advantage of a many-to-many table is that it can be indexed so that retrieval of both all children of a parent or all parent of a child can be rapid

8538124
children	parent
putting the data in a single string means you can only find quickly all children of a parent

8538136
hash	whirlpool
if you need more bits use a hash with a bigger internal state sha-512 whirlpool etc...

8538166
button	checkbox
when in edit mode the user also has the ability to click another edit button to enable a set of checkbox and then click update

8538174
client-side	server-side
others suggestions of standardizing on utf-8 is good practice but if you didn t want to just make sure you are using an encoding schema that works with your chars and is used both client-side and server-side

8538186
google-chrome	firefox
i was having the same issue in firefox and google-chrome

8538186
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome and safari

8538212
post	get
i want the same navigation for my single post view but i can t get it to work i made the changes for php functions but in codex i only found a vay to display post from the same category

8538258
subnet	packets
you can assign different subnet to 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 pairs and have host2 forward the packets from 2 to 3

8538270
hide	show
i tried to implement that using jquery hide and show

8538302
pull	push
whenever a change has to go live you simply merge the feature into the staging branch and push it to the server - the staging env then pull that branch and deploys

8538309
maven	pom.xml
you can publish a maven artifact which users of your framework can then use without having to include the dependencies yourself--your pom.xml is enough

8538319
post	get
if i perform a post without the headers i m getting the expected error but when i add the headers i get a 404 error instead of what i actually need

8538334
javap	package-private
really javap reports that innerprotected is compiled as public whereas other member classes are package-private

8538345
pthreads	fork
if you want to execute an executable file directly and you are on pthreads you can also look at the -family of functions in conjuction with fork since exec replaces the current process

8538356
portrait	landscape
but anyway if anyone s interested to know what i did was create a landscape app and compose the ui so it appeared portrait user input was a drag but overall it worked

8538407
stdout	stderr
exec d processes inherit most open file descriptors including stdin stdout and stderr so you can hook input and output up to whatever you like...plus there are fewer security implications

8538409
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the bannerslider works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari but in ie i get a blank slide after each good slide

8538412
vbscript	vb6
well com activex classic asp and vb6 vbscript is now much less used than it was so it can be said to have been replaced by .net

8538412
vbscript	vb6
as well as vb6 vbscript a considerable number who were writing in c++ and java with windows as a sole or primary target platform are now at least partly using .net instead

8538430
portrait	landscape
if the device is in landscape orientation it works fine but if the device is physically held in portrait orientation it does not display the way i would like

8538430
portrait	landscape
the device is physically held in portrait orientation but i want to display the view as if it was held in landscape

8538430
portrait	landscape
i want to always display the modal view in a landscape orientation even when the device is held in portrait

8538462
width	height
not sure if this is exactly what you re looking for but you could define the layout_ width and height as wrap_content in the xml measure it in your constructor or oncreate and then resize the layout to your desired size

8538468
rss	feed
i m working on an rss reader so i am pulling in html from rss feed

8538468
google-chrome	firefox
if you shrink the output frame it doesn t break in google-chrome but in firefox the images will break out of the box instead of resizing

8538491
free	malloc
malloc not counting the virtual memory via the mmu is the other way around allocating a number of linear chunks of those fractions to meed the alloc need and having an alloc free scheme that attempts to keep as many large chunks available just in case a bad malloc system is one where you have half of your memory free but the maximum malloc that works without an out of memory error is a malloc of a small fraction of that memory say you have a gig free and can only allocate 4096 bytes

8538539
post	get
there is more on this at android 4.0 turns get into post

8538544
hash	md5
i have a production problem where two md5 hash don t match between a server version of an excel 2003 binary file generated by syncfusion .net library and a local one

8538544
hash	md5
when i upload a local excel file that was only opened by double clicking via windows explorer the server finds that md5 hash are not the same and won t let file upload

8538544
hash	md5
the affected bytes are at offset 0000046c 2 bytes and at 0000046e 4 bytes that change upon every opening of the file which obviously changes md5 hash

8538556
hash	md5
you re better off using the indy md5 hash class

8538556
hash	md5
it s too bad the version of indy that comes with xe doesn t include encryption because their md5 hash class is flawless and easy to use

8538566
folder	directory
inside your flash cs5 install directory there should be a folder called air2.6

8538566
put	get
the other thing you ll want to do is to put an updated airglobal.swc in your install folders so that you get air3.1 code hinting

8538631

m2e	pom.xml

so i started investigating their layout and i find out they have an div#application width 100 height 100 and i think they have settimeout || setinterval that calculates the div#application height to adjust the height and width of the divs inside of it

8538792
setinterval	settimeout
i also noticed that their website does not perform well on less capable computers i think its because of the layout calculations they do with either setinterval || settimeout

8538794
for-loop	loops
don t use foreach as the message says convert loops to a regular for-loop

8539104
addition	multiplication
the code below do the addition not multiplication

8539128

setinterval	settimeout
please don t pass strings to settimeout and setinterval

8539142
zoo	xts
you probably have an xts or zoo object and need to use the write.zoo function

8539142
zoo	xts

8539161
submit	submission
i have a form that submit using post and i want to covert it to an ajax submission of the form

google-chrome	firefox
if forced to pick a required browser i d prefer firefox or google-chrome

8539223

in my opinion supporting reverse orientation makes way more sense if you are in landscape rather than portrait

it seems to me that a user would be far more likely to have their device in either right side down or left side down for landscape mode then that they would have their device all the way upside down for portrait

8539492
pull	push
since you already have a sql server session you will be making sp calls to pull push the data already and adding a small object to that should have minimal perf issues compared to other options like persisting it down to the client and sending it back on every request

implements	sealed
you want to minimize the number of times you write to the session request a lock when it is stored in sql as it is implements in a sealed class that exclusivity locks the session

8542062
for-loop	arrays
while it is not clear to me how it s not working i can guess that there are more contents in the file than just 5 strings perhaps another newline which causes the while condition to evaluate to true causing the for-loop to read 5 lines which will fail and not actually read anything and replace the good values in the string arrays with crappy ones empty string

8542062
for-loop	loops
instead of having an outer while loops you probably want to add the condition to the for-loop itself

maven	m2e
in this case it might be that the m2e plugin uses a local maven copy repo

8546668
portrait	landscape
the change is fine for portrait to landscape rotation

8546668

google-chrome	safari
i ve confirmed the same buggy application behavior on mobile safari for which sencha touch is built along with all other webkit browsers like safari and google-chrome but haven t been able to confirm the bogus response handling specifically since ios doesn t really expose this low-level debugging information

8546739
int	double
keep in mind also that int and double do have limits to their storage capacities so you may want to consider how to handle overflow if someone decides to do something crazy like 100 000 100 000 000

almost all other jsf component libraries also offer similar functionality primefaces and richfaces

8547903
cpu	hyperthreading
with a query that doesn t end up blocking on resources on a 4-core machine you theoretically get a 4-times speed up 4 hyper-threaded might give you more or even less but probably not 8-times since hyperthreading s doubling of some parts of the cpu doesn t give a clear two-times increase

8547903
affinity	processors
with the same query on a single-core or with processors affinity meaning only one core is available a webserver in web-garden mode then there s no speed-up

8547905

i setup an ejabberd server on my macbook successfully and tested it with ichat and adium

8547975
width	height
as a sanity check you could check the height and width of vector_header something like

8547975

i need to generate new dimensions for an image to match a ratio of a given width and height ...but without increasing the size of the original

8548265
icmp	udp
besides that ping doesn t use udp but icmp so the results mean nothing

8548265
udp	mtu	vlan	packets
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500

8548282
width	height
try this let s say your image is and the desired aspect ratio of width to height is r

8548282
width	height
using the width and the aspect ratio calculate the target height

let s consider i only want to push to pull from svn s trunk and don t need to worry about other branches tags

8548585
google-chrome	firefox
i m fine if it works in the latest firefox google-chrome safari.

8548674
width	height
the only other way i can see this happening is by returning in your json result a style element with some auto-generated class containing the new width and height

8548684

8548872
mouseup	mousedown
2 1 touchstart 1 touchend 1 mousedown 1 mouseup and nothing at all for the second tap

8548872

bitmap string filename int width int height or even bitmap image size but it s not supported on mobile framework

8548950
qtcore	qtgui
2 pyinstaller does not support import pyqt4.qtcore pyqt4.qtgui and from pyqt4 import qtcore qtgui is the only supported way according to here

post	put
just put it into a console application which will generate a message definition list file to be read by your application and set it up as a post build activity in your project

8549049
width	height
in the end i looped through the images doing getimagesize until both height and width were over a certain size and then broke the loop

8549108
comparator	icomparer
you need to implement comparator instead of icomparer

8549108
comparator	icomparer
icomparer would be implemented by the class performing the sorting such as a list class while comparator would be implemented by the class being sorted

8549150
innodb	myisam
experiment with a few different engines such as myisam and innodb

8549165
hash	md5
if you re doing a lot of these queries consider saving the md5 hash in a column or index

8549182
ubuntu	debian
if you are using ubuntu or debian this will make junit and some other libs always available for ant

8549221
hash	md5
it s also inefficient to use an md5 hash digest as a primary key

8549229
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
note this problem only happens on internet explorer i have tested on google-chrome firefox opera and safari

8549239
ant	maven
it can be a little intimidating at first to figure out how it works which is quite a different approach from ant or maven but it s worth getting your head around if you ll be using it

8549240
disk	ram
when the second loop starts c1 and d1 would then be loaded from disk into ram and operated on

8549240
put	get
assuming a fairly dumb caching policy of if the byte is not in the cache put it there and get the following byte too while we are at it you will get a scenario something like this

8549346
mp3	wav
ive been trying to interface with the lame_enc.dll using python ctypes and encode wav to mp3

8549346
mp3	wav
i think that i am quite close as i have an mp3 output in which i can hear some words recorded to wav at 22050 hz mono

8549346
mp3	wav
the assumption of a 44 byte header for wav is not always correct which is why i had the click - it was encoding data from the wav header into the first mp3 chunk

8549354
typedef	struct
when declaring an enum you specify the name of it right after the word enum it s not like using typedef to create an alias for a struct

8549381

8549691
folder	directory
i have ndk-modules directory in root of my android project and i have following in my android.mk of jni folder

8549692
int	chars
i thought that chars and int were two distinct data types in java and that i would have had to cast the chars to an int for this to give the ascii equivelent

8549715
int	chars
chars and int are two distinct types but this works because an int has more precision than a chars

8549715
int	chars
that is every value of chars can be represented as an int so no data is lost in the cast

8549716
int	chars
a chars can be automatically converted to an int

8549716
int	double	int	chars
chars to int long float or double

8549723
typedef	struct
the advantage of anonymous namespaces is you can also define types classes struct enums typedef as well as static variables and functions

now if i go back to my javascript code and change my hmac code to .digest hex instead of the default binary and log the base64 encoding of the result i get.

8549737
udp	tcp
for the communication problem here s a simple approach have the server periodically send each player updates whether through a constantly connected tcp connection or just periodic plain old unreliable udp packets

8549737
udp	tcp
read about the difference between tcp and udp -- there are many many places including on so just search that discuss the tradeoffs

8549743
google-chrome	safari
if you use google-chrome or safari and open the element inspector you ll see their body gets the when the page is loaded

8549761
google-chrome	firefox

don t forget the apostrophe â using foldl or foldr to do sums with the standard numeric types int int float double etc. will build up huge thunks which will use up lots of memory and possibly cause your program to overflow the stack.

8554777
versioning	upgrade
however only sufficiently recent versioning of containers 0.4.2.0 contain data.map.foldl and you shouldn t upgrade it with cabal install since it comes with ghc

8554793
nspopupbuttoncell	nstablecolumn
i can easily show all the items in a nstableview without problem however if i try to bind a nstablecolumn containing a nspopupbuttoncell to the arrangedobjects on the same controller i get a nasty exception thrown at me

8554815
unix	sunos
however on some older unix systems sunos hp-ux etc. the bin sh does not understand it

8554840
profiling	instrumentation
profiling it with the zombies instrumentation and it will tell you where it is being released

8554869
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
i m not sure about onclick but i d use onmousedown and onmouseup

8554869
onmousedown	onmouseup
you would set the time onmousedown that dragging has started and check that flagged time onmouseup

8554890
chown	chmod
just use chown or chmod and give your non-root user privileges

i ve just experienced a similar issue not seeing the uploadify button in firefox though i do in google-chrome - both in the site i m developing and

8555003
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade the versioning of flash and now when i visit the uploadify demo page i can see the select files button as expected

8555018
width	border-color
note previously borders where all width 1px border-style solid and border-color #000

8555020
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you can t use listview findviewbyid r.id.officel if you have setcontentview ... commented out

8555032
mouseup	mousedown
works pretty well on my webapp and the feedback is much better than dealing with mouseup and mousedown events on mobile safari is too slow

8555047
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
choose a pair of odd integers x and y that are multiplicative inverses of each other modulo 2 32 then multiplying by x to obfuscate and multiplying by y to restore all multiplication are modulo 2 32 source a practical use of multiplicative inverses by eric lippert

8555099
uiview	subviews
just add a subclass of uiview as a subviews and do all the logic there

8555121
width	height
the jqgrid is wrapped by a dragable div that sets the width height of the grid

8555132
children	parent
my first idea was to make parent propagate all the touchessomething calls to its children but a i suspect there might be an easier solution and b i don t know which child sent the event to parent and sending touchessomething messages twice to the same view might cause shenanigans

8555140
jobs	cron
so once again the pdo calls were failing but this time only for cron jobs

8555143
freebsd	linux
win2k xp freebsd linux mac os x

button	checkbox
however rather than showing a mere checkbox i d like to display a particular showing either a green selected or red not selected button based on the state of the database value

8555210
folder	directory
the problem is that the cron job which uses the command-line php executable is running with the current directory as the location of the php executable or the home folder of whichever account is running the job

8555229
apache	nginx
nginx does not run php directly as apache does and simply hands php requests to another separate process

8555234
hash	salt
i am trying to set up a php members area on my web server which has hash and salt passwords

8555234
hash	salt
register.php should take the username hash the password with a salt store all 3 to db works

8555258
versioning	upgrade
additional testing showed that this was last working in ee sp3 5.2.7 but became an issue in ee sp4 5.2.8. we urgently need to upgrade to the latest 5.2 service pack ee sp5 to address other issues - but upgrading to liferay 6 is also a possible option as long as we can find a combination of a solution and versioning that works

8555300
getter	setter
but i don t recommend to change getter setter

8555305
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
placing a uitabbarcontroller inside another container view controller like uinavigationcontroller can lead to undefined behavior

8555319
ivar	subclassing
the compiler explicitly disallows any other class even subclassing from accessing that ivar

8555319
public	protected	ivar	subclassing
public means anyone can access the ivar and protected means subclassing can access it but other classes can t

8555322
public	protected
implementations of the derived type will include all fields including private ones of the base type and can access any and all public or protected members of the base type as if it were its own

8555322
ienumerable	icollection
an object representing a database table may for example allow itself to be passed to a routine that wants a thing that can enumerate contents which are of type t ienumerable t in .net or a routine that wants a thing that can have things of type t added to it icollection t in .net or a thing that wants a thing that wants to know when it s no longer needed idisposable in .net

8555332
hash	hmac
if you assume no one else has access to your secret key a crc hash or hmac would all suffice to ensure you detected changes

8555391
width	height
or just remove the float height and width

8555395
getter	setter	inherited	properties
if properties getter and setter were independent entities an interface that defined a properties setter and inherited from one that defined a properties getter would allow read-write semantics

8555395
getter	setter
instead getter are read-only properties and setter are write-only properties

8555395
inherited	properties
if a type defines a write-only properties but inherited a read-only properties vb.net and c# will only see the write-only properties

8555395
inherited	properties
if an interface inherited an interface which exposes a read-only properties and an interface which exposes a write-only properties neither properties will be usable on the interface because neither vb.net nor c# is willing to use the fact that a properties is being read or written to determine whether to use the read-only or write-only properties

8555395
inherited	properties
as noted the solution is to have an interface which inherited one with a read-only properties and implements a read-write properties

8555466
super	implements
it will only work if the class implements the interface directly as opposed to inherting the interface from a super class and specifies a concrete type for the type parameter as opposed to using a type parameter as in the following example

8555478
pop-up	dialog
note that these mechanisms ask the browser to pop-up a dialog box for authentication

8555556
portrait	landscape
for example lets say i m writing to pdf in portrait orientation 8.5in wide x 11 in height and at some point i want a page in landscape orientation 11in wide x 8.5 in high

8555583
for-loop	loops
using a for-loop we will loops over each fields

8555583
for-loop	loops
using an if loops we would do substitution to the fields when the for-loop parses over second and third fields

8555595
rss	feed
in my app i have created a uitableview which retrieves the xml of the apple hot news rss feed

8555595
put	get
i am not so sure how i can present this how can i edit the uitableview so it can sort itself and put labels in the middle and so on i think you get the point

8555640
folder	directory
if it works in visual studio and when you invoke the .exe in the bin directory i would guess that you have the requisite permissions in those folder and therefore it functions correctly

8555706
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as for internet explorer 9 it along with google-chrome safari and firefox of course supports the history api which you should be using instead

8555775
daemon	cron
for such games you d usually have a cron job daemon running every minute or so that recalculates all amounts of all users in this way

i am not so sure how i can present this how can i edit the uitableview so it can sort itself and put labels in the middle and so on i think you get the point

8555802
postgresql	mysql
or rather what is the best way to do this in a non database driver specific manner as i ll be using sqlite mysql and postgresql in my development testing

8555832
getter	setter
sometimes a property getter setter does more work then just hold a value

8555835
public	protected
the primary reason people use properties for protected and public fields is so you can add behavior without breaking binary compatibility

8555843
getter	setter
this si a complete list of browsers and their support for getter and setter

8555852
getter	setter
in most cases you can use autogen getter and setter instead of a field but there is a subtle difference a getter and a setter are a function call even if inlined - thus a backing variable is always adresses as if it were volatile

8555864
typedef	struct
personally i would just use the types as they are instead of extra typedef to avoid typing struct but whatever

8555947
getter	setter
in general direct public access to instance variables is frowned upon instead they d be accessed through getter and setter

8555984
integer	unsigned
nsindexset stores unsigned integer primitive types whereas nsset stores objects

8555991
vmware	virtualbox
you can easily try bochs or dosbox on ubuntu just apt-get one or the other or both if you just want to run some old x86 dos programs that wont run in qemu or virtualbox vmware because they dont emulate dos

8556008
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to make a pop-up dialog to allow the user to fill in a form

8556039
put	get
wherever i put a command like passengermininstances 3 and try to reload apache i get

8556043
restrict	shared
most commercial shared hosts run php in safe mode which disallows exec or at least restrict it to special directories

8556082
folder	directory
you don t have to do anything in your folder there is no relationships between that code and the directory hierarchy

8556088
rss	feed
i have a new feature on my iphone app that reads my rss feed

8556092
bazaar	fossil	bazaar	git	bazaar	svn	fossil	git
i say strong no-no for git as first vcs but you have wide choice even without it - svn poor branch|merge comparing to dvcs bazaar not a tool of my dream but who knows mercurial fossil scm monotone

8556100
getter	setter
xmlencode will use getter setter methods to properly convert objects into xml

8556128
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing asd.qwe.mycollection

8556152
sse	avx
code vectorization converting to sse avx may also occur which allows parallel execution of the code in some cases

8556183
uiview	subviews
assuming your uilabel is being added to the contentview of your cell just make sure your subviews whether a uilabel or other uiview -derived object have their autoresizingmask set up to allow flexible width uiviewautoresizingflexiblewidth

postgresql	mysql
i had been hoping for a mysql equivalent to postgresql s table functions

8556325
put	get
what i want to do is to get a number of strings in an arraylist of objects and then put them on a printable report

8556332
width	height
at the moment i am scaling my graphics by setting their width height as some fraction of the window height

8556360
client-side	server-side
on that note i find it hassle some to keep the client-side validation code and server-side validation code in sync especially if they are written in different languages which is always the case if you are not using node.js or gwt

8556360
client-side	server-side
however if there are certain validation that can only be performed on server-side database uniqueness constraint for instance then it is important to show user that their client-side actions have failed

8556361
postgresql	mysql
anton s answer would be the preferred solution if we were talking about mysql but as you pointed out it causes errors in postgresql since postgresql is a bit more restrictive in its select grouping functions

8556406
getter	setter
i m trying to generate getter setter for my doctrine mongo document class

8556406
getter	setter
however when i attempt to generate the getter and setter using the cli command php app console doctrine mongodb generate documents sitegamebundle i get the following back

8556452
int	chars
you re comparing a a pointer to the start of a string to a single chars q - you re comparing a pointer and an int value as your compiler warnings will tell you

8556537
spaces	delimiter
split the textarea message string into arrays delimiter by spaces and check each array element against the proposed username

8556567
listview	gridview	textview	imageview
i am trying to create a gridview listview that displays an imageview and textview in the same grid list row and the image and text are being dynamically updated on the row during scroll

8556635
client-side	server-side
i know there s an ajax library in there but i don t use that. we have to understand the difference between server-side and client-side

8556668
multiplying	add
a smart compiler will figure out to just add as precomputed to a for each iteration through the loop vs doing the more expensive multiplying on each iteration

8556680
accessor	properties
11.2.1 properties accessor

8556692
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that is bound to a sqldatasource

8556749
post	get
start with one of those and then post a follow-up question if you get stuck on something

8556761
width	height
each element will have a set width but will have a variable height determined automatically by the content inside that element

8556807
public	protected
i m a bit confused about the difference between public private and protected

8556830
devise	cancan
ensure the user is authorized to view the data in my rails app i use devise and cancan

8556851
post	get
i guess in simpler terms what i am trying to do is get the post value of a disabled textbox to use in a sql insert statement when the form is posted

8556869
gridview	sqldatasource
for meeting your requirement i think you shouldn t use sqldatasource to bind gridview instead of manual binding the datasource to gridview

8556898
width	height
i am using sizetofit in a piece of code where i want it to ignore the width but just size to fit based on height

8556910
uiview	subviews
you may be better off writing your own subviews of uiview that can handle multiple lines of text each with its own label

8556944
post	get
if your form requested by post method you can get the value of form control by syntax

8556946
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
in the spritesheet constructor you specify the image which has all the tiles and the width height of the tiles in the sheet along with any spacing and margin if you have need that

8556955
int	chars
hi i have made this code but here something unusual is happening i am printing the addresses when i increase the address of all then from my view increment in int would be 2 float would be 4 and chars would be 1 but i got the following

8556955
int	chars
for float and chars i think its correct but for int i don t know why it is giving so

8556995
width	height
judging by these i would assume that in landscape orientation the window height will be less than window width

8556995
width	height
if the width were lower it would amount to portrait orientation and if the width and height are equal it should be treated as square

8557009
submit	submission
this is because the submit button is only included in the form submission traditionally when said submit button is clicked

8557012
int	chars
you can make life easier for yourself by using the fixed-width types by using unsigned types unless being able to represent negative numbers is absolutely required and by not using int when chars arrays will do

8557015
getter	setter
you can make speedpref fuelcapacity and fuel public member variables however a better approach would be to make them properties on the class with appropriate getter and setter

8557046
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i m not sure how it affects the other browsers especially opera but for google-chrome and firefox adding this rule seems to help.

8557103
mouseover	mouseout
the following code after your for-loop should let you assign all the mouseover and mouseout handlers in one go to apply to all the clones

8557117
post	get
how to get the data into the controller which has http post controller like

8557184
inherited	properties
what entails from this is that when you are actually creating a new object that inherited from person object by calling object.create then what happens in its implementation is a new object will be freshly created and then it will return that new object which will override the prototype properties that javascript assumed you have created by doing that person.prototype assignment previously earlier in your code

8557217

i ve used both jogl and lwjgl - in fact i recently switched from jogl to lwjgl.

8557233
google-chrome	firefox
it would not work if added dynamically later on google-chrome would work with firefox

8557367
google-chrome	firefox
now firefox is dead-level and for ie google-chrome the label text is 1px higher

8557367
google-chrome	firefox
if i remove the link to reset.css things change again google-chrome becomes dead-level ie puts the label 1px higher than the input text firefox 1px lower than the input text

8557419
onresume	onpause
the best solution will be to save the current time and stop the timer in onpause then restart the timer in onresume adding to it the saved time

8557432
for-loop	loops
i heard a rumor that for large list items a for-loop will work faster than a foreach loops

8557443
int	chars
in order to have an array where each element has a int float and chars element you would do something like this

8557443
int	chars
you would then reference your elements as a i int a i floats a i chars

8557554
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my js fb connect to oauth versioning when i am trying to logout from fb programatically using fb.logout method i am getting error like

8557570
subtract	add
any packages previously installed and in the wrong place can be moved to the usr local lib r site-library directory assuming you are sudo ing it just by moving the directories thanks tommy but as usr lib r is controlled by apt - best not add or subtract anything from there.

8557599
nsmutablestring	nsdata	nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsstring	nsdata
also with a nsstring also nsdata nsset etc. property it is better to define them as a copy since it would be perfectly valid to pass in a nsmutablestring instead since it is a subclass of nsstring which then the contents could be altered externally of this object

8557611
put	get
the only way to get it working would be to create a table with say 3 columns put the respective content in the three columns and then style the each td of the table giving the inline-css

8557617

check the inherited properties of your page directive

8557889
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the first flash video is stopped when i click the next slide

width	height
you should use the sizethatfits method and pass in a cgsize with the width you want and a value of cgfloat_max for the height

8557907
gridview	sqldatasource
in it i have used sqldatasource objects or ado.net to bind data to gridview and display it to user

8557966
pop-up	dialog
i m using jquery ui dialog control to display a pop-up on hover of a span

8557966
mouseover	mouseout
i understand jquery is firing mouseout mouseover rapidly even though the pointer is still within the span

8557972
client-side	server-side
the question as to whether they should be client-side templates or server-side is the crux of the issue

8557995
textarea	textbox
keyup and change events are working fine but paste event is little bit strange when i paste something in textarea the word count doesn t change at that moment after some debugging i found that paste event fires up before pasting something on textbox

8557998
piston	tastypie
luckily you can easily add an api to django through piston tastypie or our favorite django-rest-framework

8558008
ccscene	cclayer
you can manage your own orientation method by rotating your current cclayer ccscene

8558035
put	get
i just want to know how i can get the app to realise when the user types the that it has to realise that there is a t a h and an e and put out a certain list of characters

8558046
hide	show
normal android application behaviour states that the home button hide the app to the background you ll be show the home screen and back button finishes the application goes through onpause onstop ondestroy in that order

8558054
hide	show
what id like to be able to do however is allow users that have javascript disabled to still get a basic show hide hover effect via css only

8558066
post	get
the only way to pass a javascript variable to php would be through a get or post request this could be via ajax or a synchronous page load

8558067
min	max
the only way that i think you can archive your result is to make multiple queries with a limit 2 select the 2nd result min and max are not designed to select the x th value from min or max

8558071
width	height
now i want to set height and width for the mydraw in run time for that i have used following code

8558081
post	get
what you want to achieve can be done by sending httprequest from your client side code javascript to server via http post method or get - depends on the semantics where you can parse it using php

8558109
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
from what i understand launchd daemons in systemd library launchdaemons are automatically launchd as root as long as they have the correct permissions

8558143
subtraction	addition
now run your combo in a for-loop and inside it whenever you find a 0 do addition and whenever you find 1 do a subtraction

8558162
post	get
i would try to get 2-3 memory dumps at the time of hanging post it here as well as to msft people

8558170
wamp	ampps
ampps is also a wamp stack with auto-installation of more than 230 open-source scripts

8558173
onfocus	onblur
you d need to use events like onfocus onkeypress and onblur in conjunction to achieve a similar level of responsiveness in older browsers though

8558175
jobs	cron
start with the format for driving the cron jobs

8558178
pop-up	dialog
i am attempting to use a jquery dialog to pop-up a window upon let s say an add button which will therefore show a dialog with a html.beginform form within

8558192
jobs	cron
cron enables users to schedule jobs commands or shell

8558213
innodb	myisam
i d recommend you to do a dump of the db change all the text from that file from innodb to myisam then load the modified file

8558225
width	height
i want to increase imageview width and height while zoom-in and reduce imageview width and height while zoom-out

8558227
snmp	mib
by the looks of things you ve created your own mib oid s correctly but nothing is responding to the new oid when you query the snmp host

8558294
put	get
if i put the loops with the time print ofcourse of generic below the simple i get better time for generic and if i put simple below the generic i get better time for simple

8558322
equals	gethashcode
sometime with the equals method it is also good to override the gethashcode implementation

8558324
email-ext	jenkins
version 2.15 of jenkins plug-in email-ext added support for attaching files to build notification e-mails

8558324
ubuntu	linux
the build log appears to be stored on the jenkins master node in this case ubuntu linux

8558324
email-ext	jenkins
the email-ext file attachment feature defaults to using files from within the project workspace which is on the jenkins slave build machine in this case mac os x

8558328
ssl	socks
i ve try to google it but the only i found is the class libs which have implement socks witout ssl or ssl without socks

8558387
innodb	myisam
as i know myisam doesn t supports foreign keys compare the features offered by innodb vs the features of myisam

8558417
getter	setter
if we refactor our daos to not use any default arguments probably a good thing we may land up having setter getter for the mandatory members that must be initialized

8558428
ssl	socks
our secureblackbox offers ssl tls support and socket classes support socks proxies and http connect proxies

8558472
pop-up	dialog

going by the exception message lines is not a seq of strings int chars or int arrays

8558513
profiling	instrumentation
profiling with instrumentation it points there is a zombie object in

8558514

as you have found out the httpcontext is not persisted across requests and hence neither are iprincipal and iidentity - the httpcontext is constructed at the start of each request by the framework and the iprincipal and iidentity are constructed from the authentication ticket deserialised from the authentication cookie

8572661
iprincipal	iidentity
in this scenario the service will authenticate the user and send back an authentication cookie in the response to the calling application and that application will then use the cookie to construct the iprincipal and iidentity on each subsequent request

you can override the iprincipal and iidentity when the application.postauthenticaterequest event is raised

8576048
tokudb	myisam	innodb	myisam	innodb	tokudb
what you need to do is configure your database to support the i o volume you ll be doing such as - use appropriate database engine innodb and not myisam make sure you have fast enough hdd subsystem raid not regular drives since they can and will fail at some point design your database optimally inspect queries with explain to see where you might have gone wrong with them maybe even use a different storage engine - personally i d use tokudb if i were you

often these libraries also require that this container be pre-sized--styled with height and width properties

8576733
jqplot	highcharts	jqplot	flot	flot	highcharts
among javascript plotting libraries i recommend the jquery-based options because you need less code to create yoru plots and because it s easier to use jquery s ajax methods to load your data for instance jqplot flot and highcharts the three libraries that i recommend below all include in their basic distribution complete html css js example plots that demonstate loading data via ajax

8576733
d3.js	protovis
d3.js the successor to protovis

highstock a time-series library from the highcharts guys

8576733
jqplot	highcharts	jqplot	flot	flot	highcharts

8576758
textview	imageview
i am having a layout with a textview edittext and imageview

8576787

8577052
client-side	server-side
when i click the button it only validates server-side but not client-side

8577098
getter	setter
note this doesn t implement any setter or getter but as pointed out already by the comments this is not really needed when using classes

8577117
width	height
typically i would wish for it to constrain itself to 1 1 so that if the relativelayout.layoutparams contain a width of 200 and a height of 100 the custom relativelayout would constrain itself to 100 x 100

8577117
width	height
what actually happens when i do this is that bizarrely the height is properly restricted as i intended but the width is not

8577117
width	height
specifying a height of 200 and width of 100 in the relativelayout.layoutparams results in my custom relativelayout having a height of 100 and width of 100

8577117
width	height
specifying a height of 100 and width of 200 in the relativelayout.layoutparams results in my custom relativelayout having a height of 100 and width of 200

the problem is when i start the page with hide on the visualization and then click the button to show it it will not display the visualization

8577366
hide	show
if i comment out the hide at the beginning the 2 buttons to show and hide work fine but when its initially hidden it does not work

8577444
put	get
in the following example i ve used the interposed class so if you put this code into your unit only those web browsers on the form or those created in this unit dynamically will get this behavior

8577498
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome textareas can be resized.

8577502

8577637
installation	upgrade
you will have to upgrade your xcode installation

8577663
put	get
yeah actually codeblocks has this error what you have to do is get the classes namely the .cpp and the .h out of the folder and get them in the root of the project so cut them and paste them where the main.cpp is and it should work also what you can do is put #include source theclass.cpp and u can also solve it that way also do the same for the .h

8577664
mouse	keyboard
it seems that the change even is only trigger by elements which are changed by the keyboard or mouse anything changed by jquery is not being flagged

8578117
folder	directory
the current working directory when you start your script is not the location of the script it s whatever folder you happened to be in when you ran it

8578117
folder	directory
the cd then changes the working directory to the folder containing that and the exec is just for a tiny efficiency it replaces your script s executable process with the java vm rather than starting it as a child process

8578131
put	get
with wpf you get a clear one-to-one relationship between your intent treating buttons as a group within a layout and the actual code put the buttons in a stackpanel grid .

8578366
jobs	cron
i migrated my code from using cron jobs to using gearman workers which were managed through supervisord

8578366
jobs	cron
eventually i figured out that when i was using cron jobs i would load each page via wget rather than command line

uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
just set the modalinpopover property on the uiviewcontroller being displayed in the uipopovercontroller

8578493
hash	salt
a common usage is a salt hash

8578493
hash	salt
so the way to improve on the hash is to add in a salt value

8578533
hash	md5
i aways use the session approach but if you want to be very secure prevent sessions hijacking you could save the current ip and some other characteristics of the user in a md5 hash in the database along with the session id

8578533
hash	md5
then when a page is opened after login you can regenerate the md5 hash with client properties and check that with the session id in the database

8578546
mef	prism
i am converting a project to prism mef and need to download the list of modules from a central db

8578600

you can use sed to replace your spaces delimiter with whatever you like

8578621
primes	modulus
what s necessary is that the factor be relatively primes to the modulus

8578621
primes	modulus
since the modulus for binary arithmetic is always a power of two any odd number is relatively primes and would suffice

8578621
primes	modulus
if you were to take a modulus other than by overflow though a primes would continue to ensure diversity assuming you didn t choose the same prime...

looking at the class hierarchy the problem becomes apparent i have stumbled on to the dreaded diamond in multiple inheritance where the widget1 inherit from qwidget and signalinterface and both which inherit from qobject

8578660
redmine	bugzilla
it would be nice if it could also show a combined activity feed as both github and redmine offer and even better if we could add one-off external bugs to track something in an upstream bugzilla for instance but now i m really getting into dreamland

8578660
redmine	trac
i m dealing with multiple teams over multiple sites each using different issue trackers all of redmine jira fogbugz and trac of interest currently

8578679
fseek	fread
jni side you can now use fdopen fseek fread etc

and then push to pull from as appropriate

8578689
post	get
immediately after the text messages get sent the app then connects to the internet and tells the server via an http post the number of texts that were sent

button	checkbox
i need the checkbox to function like typical html radio button that let a user select only one of a limited number of choices

8578788
versioning	upgrade
for simplicity we handle versioning upgrade via a major upgrade like so

8578788

because the major upgrade performs a full uninstall followed by a reinstall we are losing the user-defined settings in the registry

8578807
google-chrome	firefox
it s specific with google-chrome only since i tested it in firefox and it worked perfectly

8578833
width	height
for the original values you can use the css width or height they will still the pixel original value the modified by zoom value will be the clientwidth clientheight offsetwidth and offsetheight element properties

8578884

1 in safari when i hit the left right with my mouse i get a popup message telling me that i must use the left right keyboard arrows

8578921
inherited	subclassing
inherited class is a subclassing of qobject

8578951
width	height
the problem is that the textbox in the 3rd column of the usercontrol used as a listbox item should not automatically increase its width when i type into it some long text it should just wrap increasing its height up to a maximum height

8578984
width	height
if you add a second element that has no width but is the height of the container your single element will move to vertically center with this no-width element thus vertically centering it

8579103
equals	gethashcode
update to use it in linq map all columns as compositeid and mutable false then override equals and gethashcode with default implementation

8579110
google-chrome	firefox
untested in anything except google-chrome and firefox but you could try using a combination of float left and margin-left

8579136

building a good app that runs on all kind of devices requires effort in making multiple sets of drawables and probably multiple sets of layouts landscape portrait small large screens etc

8579181
post	get
a typical scenario is the following post redirect get model

8579186
udp	tcp
finally if you want to use udp you should probably try to use udp instead of wierd tcp

8579189
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 10.04 lts

8579424
google-chrome	firefox
i was only apple to play .ogg files in both firefox 8 and google-chrome 15 from the local file system

8579435
versioning	upgrade
since this is the first time you will have to run a database upgrade i would be tempted to add an extra table to the schema that will hold the versioning information

8579435
versioning	upgrade
that should allow you to upgrade from any previous versioning to the current without maintaining several code paths since a 1.0 to 1.2 upgrade will never change and you should have a known start position for each cumulative step

8579480
mp3	ogg
i had a similar issue for some reason it would not load local mp3 files the solution for me was to use ogg files and all worked

8579480
google-chrome	firefox
my local dev system is linux apache2 and i tested with firefox 8 and google-chrome 15

8579480
mp3	ogg
the audio tag did work with remote mp3 and ogg files though i don t know why they were not working locally again ogg worked locally

8579486
unsigned	short
it gets treated as an array of short because of the unsigned of the type which makes the largest value too large to fit in a signed byte or char

8579489
put	get
please note that i ve used the interposed class so if you put this code into your unit only those web browsers on the form or those created in this unit dynamically will get this behavior

8579524
csla	.net
csla .net is a framework that my company uses heavily in most of our projects so some of these constraints are forced by the framework itself and can t be changed

8579555

inherited	properties
in this case user is a properties on the system.web.webpages.webpagerenderingbase abstract class which is used by the view engine when rendering views as they inherited from it

8579754
post	get
you can prefix the get variables with get_ and the post variable with post_ for example

8579755
post	get
this code basically does what does just in a worse way get having priority over post

8579755
post	get
you should completely remove this code and update the script to use the appropriate variable or to access post get data instead of just using

8579776
post	get
it ll handle get and post transparently and decode the uri-encoded strings for you

8579787
int	boolean
there are several ways the easier is probably to create a boolean preference or an int if you want to handle more than two layouts and if it is set to true then you load a specific layout and if not you load the other one

8579803
getter	setter
i fully understand the concept of using the syntesize directive to create getter and setter methods if i had property int width and synthesize width i am inadvertently creating a getter method of width and a setter method of setwidth

8579803
getter	setter
it seems to me it only works correctly when my getter and setter are both named in the x setx naming convention

8579803
getter	setter
b can i create a getter method but not a setter method or vice versa

8579803
getter	setter
c is it mandatory that if i do create both a getter and setter method for origin that they both be named in the x setx manner

8579821
superclass	subclassing
it s part of the is-a relationship of subclassing instances to their superclass

8579821
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
that s part of the contract for implementation inherited each subclassing instance must be able to act like any other members of their superclass

8579840
children	parent
only the parent surrounding the hovered children should change color

8579911
content-disposition	content-type
in theory the filename parameter should be set on content-disposition not content-type

8579915
folder	directory
i ve gone into the project properties and went to the java build path and imported the .jar from the mainactivity libs folder that didn t work and then i tried to import it from my sdk directory and that didn t work

8579923
width	height
for the moment i just increase the height and width of the canvas to zoom in

8579923
width	height
initially the canvas has width 100 and height 100 so no scrollbars are needed but when i enlarge this i need those scrollbars

8579957
post	get
i think that to get a definitive answer you may need to post on the cmake mailing list and if you get a good answer post it here

8579976
post	get
you should better use datatype json and mtype post to get the data directly from the server without needs to make separate call

8580004
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in order to find this you can right click on the element on the page when you are viewing the actual page - and click inspect element. this is in google-chrome firefox safari

8580023
ready	each
i do a lot of stuff in each of these ready functions to prepare the site

8580029
put	get
you just put your work code in one function doinbackground and your ui code in another onpostexecute and asynctask makes sure they get called on the right threads and in order

8580065
hash	md5
you should store passwords with a one way hash function md5 sha1 sha256

8580078
post	get
fortunately we re targeting browsers that all support postmessage but the dialog javascript doesn t appear to be getting a value for window.opener so i don t think it can get a reference to the window so it can post a message

8580088
children	parent
if you want the same distance between every element the easiest way is to float the children set a negative margin on the parent element that has the same size as the margin on the children and make the parent x times as wide as the children + x times the margin where x is 3 if you want 3 elements next to each other like this

8580121
width	height
then for the size divide your document width by 109 ppi and your height by 109 again ppi and enter the resulting values in their respective locations making sure inches is selected

8580167
post	put
i want to know if there s a way to put all these steps in one page this page will have input boxes for media background post type and add new post

8580249
getter	setter
these lines don t actually create getter and setter they just inform the compiler that your class has these properties

8580249
getter	setter
the compiler will then expect getter and setter if you don t use readonly named -origin1 and -setorigin1

8580249
getter	setter
the names of the setter getter are important see apple s documentation on key-value coding for details

8580263
setinterval	settimeout
to try my suggestion just call settimeout instead of setinterval then at the end of your mycode you call settimeout again

8580276
accessor	properties
if you declare a properties you ll need to either provide your own accessor or use the synthesize directive to create them

8580276
getter	setter
b can i create a getter method but not a setter method or vice versa

8580276
getter	setter
c is it mandatory that if i do create both a getter and setter method

8580276
accessor	properties
you can provide your own names for the accessor but you should stick with the usual convention if you want your class to be key value coding compliant for the properties in question

8580288
jobs	cron
server load grows quadratically with increased use per license due to large amounts of processing that occurs through scheduled cron jobs

8580292
gridview	repeater
a repeater will only render what you tell it to render it doesn t add additional html to the page like a gridview or a dataview would

8580302
width	height
setting the width and height of canvas using css is not a good idea

8580302
width	height
to achieve what you required you should not give width and height of canvas in css

8580324
post	get
when i add the canvasauthorize permissions extendedpermissions attribute to both the create methods and a link from another page calls this create method normally the get method should get called but in this case the post method gets called

8580324
post	get
but if i comment the post method then it goes to the get method

8580325
getter	setter
then create bean setter getter method for each enum and then you can simply access these all enum like as normal variable

8580355
google-chrome	firefox
i know that google-chrome and firefox can both open data uri images

8580363
put	get
i have a query and i want the result to be the cookie if i try this each time i get the result -1 if i put the anwser in a gridview i get the good result

8580368
ready	each
using jquery deferred you could build promises for each ready function and combine them with jquery.when to trigger a final action

8580392
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome

8580397
draggable	droppable
i recommend you to use jquery ui s draggable and droppable interactions

8580407
width	height
i have a list of content items each with a set width but different variable height

8580442
rational-numbers	base	rational-numbers	radix
if you want to get fancier you can define the base and the radix as rational-numbers with two integers as described above or make them themselves irrational numbers

8580455
button	checkbox
all of the forms are just displays text_fields instead of select boxes radio button checkbox etc

8580465
width	height
you will have to make the overlay taller than the container for the images but the same width and float it overtop if it is the same height the shadow will appear from all sides

8580476
maven	pom.xml
maven debug logs show the following message for a missing pom.xml file

8580499
installation	upgrade
i ve done some reading on the installation but it s not clear to me whether i will be upgrade to the sql server developers edition or whether the install will create another instance

8580540
children	parent
or more generally when an object child object inherits from another object parent object how should children methods use helper functions and is it possible to make these private

8580544
children	parent
it just pulls the parent userstory with a particular id and all of it s children

8580559
bash	tcsh
this is a ksh script launch it though ksh or any shell like bash sh csh or tcsh which understand the #

8580575
avro	thrift
this is reinforced with modern serialization frameworks like protobuf thrift avro which will generate the code behind these serialized objects for you anyway and expect you not to muck with the internals of those classes through inheritance

8580584
implements	extends
i am thinking a good way to extends this object is composition but the problem that my superclass must implements the primary object s interface which would be about 600 lines of stub code

8580619
children	parent
i want the windowstate behaviour of the mdi children to be different in a parent

8580700
mouse	keyboard
i suppose one thing you could try would be to set some application-level or parent-level tunneling events so you can toggle a flag indicating it was mouse clicked or keyboard pressed previewmousedown and previewkeydown

8580703
gif	png
i am wondering how do you convert jpg gif and png images into real .ico s

8580703
gif	png	gif	bmp	gif	ico	bmp	png	png	ico
from all i ve read and found so far php handles gif jpg and png very well but when it comes to bmp the format you need to get to before porting over to ico - only wbmp is natively supported wmpb is a crappy monochrome format which is nothing like the real bmp

8580707
listview	gridview
for example if this is a property of a business object and you use data binding to show your data in some control like gridview or listview independent from the actual framework it might be that this property will be recognized as updateable now and the user might change some values you and some other assemblies considered immutable so far

8580727
implements	extends
myview extends glsurfaceview and myrenderer implements glsurfaceview.renderer

8580731
postgresql	mysql
i ve seen similar questions but they had to do with using mysql whereas this kind of broken transaction is not supposed to happen with postgresql

8580752
hide	show
also if you fade-out-in the div elements rather than show hide ing them they will still occupy their spot on the document

8580752
hide	show
if you use show hide then the element will no longer be in the flow of the page and you won t be able to mouse-over any hidden elements to make them show again

8580778
post	get
so im working on a rails app where users can comment on photos or videos another user has uploaded and so far everything is great except i am not able to get the current user_id associated with the person who has commented on the post

8580810
bmp	png
if you have massive resources on the page such as bmp or png files that are several hundred k see if you can convert them to other formats or resize them on the server to the size they render at

8580817
folder	directory
i put all files in a common directory called ajax and put this in an .htaccess file in the same folder

8580885
children	parent
the children inherit the opacity setting from there parent

8580889
hide	show
hello i am doing a simple toggle that hide and show certain blocks of text when i click on a navigation option

8580889
hide	show
i am doing this by running a for-loop and using length.div to determine the exact div that i want to show or hide

8580897
pull	push
if it passes qa will pull from webdev - merge - push to webdev and if its a big change can review again there to make sure it is fine

8580918
submit	submission
it sounds like the jquery mobile framework is still hi-jacking the submit event and running its own ajax submission of the form

8580940
width	height
remember the image is dynamically resizable vertically and horizontally so i had to strip the image width and height

8580946
profiling	debugging
many tool-chains include an instruction level simulator that will perform trace code-coverage and profiling but you may have to create debugging scripts or code stubs to simulate hardware to coerce the execution of all paths

8580959
textview	imageview
if i understand your question correctly you re looking to apply some padding to an imageview that you display to the right of the titlebar textview

8580969
post	get
so i get a can t verify csrf authenticity warning which resets the session then i can t update the post

8581011
getter	setter
if you want to implement the getter setter that way you ll need to use a private member variable

8581019
accessor	properties
some languages do not allow you to override a properties without overriding all visible accessor

8581054
post	get
and that by using method post not method get

8581066
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
because getelementsbytagname returns a collection or alternatively give the element an id and use getelementbyid instead

8581069
inherited	properties
i think the only way to override the inherited properties is to do something like this

8581094
post	get
and i am trying to get the post filtering by this custom field the problem is that the value its an array and my code its not working

8581155
for-loop	loops
then i can t loops through the for-loop a second time and still keep what i wrote in the previous iteration which is something i want to do as creating the new writer to the existing file erases the existing content

8581175
post	get
there is a good description in this post about why it is better to fix bugs in a stable branch and push them back to dev while using a dev branch for features which get pushed back to the stable branch as well.

outputstream	inputstream
i m already able to get the generated file as an outputstream now i m just looking for an implementor to use to keep things in memory which implements inputstream as well

8581289
superclass	subclassing
because the logic for performing an action is contained in the superclass all you have to do to make a subclassing is register what events it responds to and create an actionobject that contains the logic for its response

8581292
google-chrome	firefox
i have a javascript file where no matter where i place it in the includes the file below it is not being run in both google-chrome and firefox - probably other browsers as well - just haven t tested them

8581311
inherited	subclassing
the supportseventvalidation attribute is not inherited for subclassing so if you create a subclassing of dropdownlist don t apply that attribute to the subclassing and use the subclassing on your page you will have a control that doesn t trigger event validation even if event validation is enabled on the page

8581359
stdout	stderr
i have a very simple script that output some text to stderr and stdout with println

8581364

if the download is successful clicking on a row with the intended image leads to the uiimageview expanding to the height of the row and the width increases at scale

8581386
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari this link does not do anything when you click it

8581427
width	height
attach an event on the image load or show or resize using jquery just google it and in the event handler find the width and height of the image and set the width and height of your parent div

8581450
width	height
and the height and width properties set to match the container

8581454
int	boolean
the nullable type in this case nullable int has a property of hasvalue which is boolean

8581474
post	get
that should mean only post get requests can be made to external places and only to places listed in the manifest requiredpermissions list

8581476
getter	setter
i m sure there s more to it particularly in the getter and setter but that s it in a nutshell

8581518
post	get
there is some limits for number of users you can request info for i m not sure on the numbers but 50 users works ok and on url length which can be worked around issuing post request and specifying method parameter equal to get to graph api

8581524
innodb	myisam
if you are having slow query times perhaps take a look to see if you are doing any intensive updates to the database as myisam does lock the table rather than the row like innodb on updates

8581531
innodb	myisam
not only for its support for row-level locking actually mvcc which is better than row-level locking but also innodb is superior to myisam in terms of resistance against data corruption

8581552
folder	directory
when the web application is run from vs2008 it retrives the image files and display them.how ever when i deploy the same project in iis using virtual directory the application couldn t access the files on the shared folder it says access denied

some large project like extjs or qooxdoo have build in loaders to load only required code but here is a lot of libs which simplify this and you can use in your project head.js lab.js

8581641

you will need to set up an account one that has access to the remote folder in your iis virtual directory

maybe std ostream_iterator and std ostringstream

8581910
post	get
i m using the post redirect get pattern in my asp.net mvc 3 web application

8581910
post	get
typically if you submit a post that triggers validation you get a 302 redirect back to the original page so the user can correct their form input and resubmit

8581910
post	get
if the user refreshes the page they will get that the browser needs to resend the information you previously submitted prompt which is the whole point of doing post redirect get

getter	setter
if the attribute exists in the document mongoid will provide you with your standard getter and setter methods

8582152

with jquery i could copy the src height and width of the image and manipulate the markup into something like this

typedef	struct
we have a linked list and some typedef struct

8582515
typedef	struct
yes that s what you should do put the typedef in the header along with the struct

8582515
typedef	struct
typedef declarations paired to those struct fit in naturally there and are often expected to be there by someone looking at the code

8582515
typedef	struct
if you re going to be using the typedef exclusively you might consider the following syntax which obviates you from using the struct keyword altogether

8582540
opencv	emgucv
2 if you would like to roll your own with image processing you could look at using the emgucv library which is the .net wrapper for opencv

since nsmanagedobject doesn t synthesize method imps but rather uses dynamic dispatch and forwarding to resolve its setter getter gdb cannot find the imps and so fails

put	get
you shouldn t put the id in the route since that s equivalent to a get

8582724
post	get
you should really consider though if you are wanting to carry the user s request in the url across paging then one would consider why the form wasn t made as a get request as opposed to a post request in the first place

8582802
typedef	struct
you typedef a struct in c to avoid typing struct node .

8582808
typedef	struct
declaring an item using typedef struct node list is not correct

8582829
typedef	struct
the first typedef defines node as an alias for struct node to allow you to refer to it simply as node without writing struct node every time in c regular type names and struct names live in two different namespaces

versioning	upgrade
you most likely need to upgrade your versioning of django by using setuptools

8582849
ceil	floor
the whole point of ceil floor operations is to convert floats to integers

8582849
ceil	floor
the point of the ceil and floor operations is to round floating-point data to integral values

8582849
ceil	floor
additionally you must have versions of ceil and floor which return floating-point numbers if you want to conform to ieee 754

post	get
with a solution like mongodb you can model the post as objects that contain some or all of the information related to comments and attachments likes saves doing a little denormalization as embedded objects instead of separate collections tables that would otherwise have to be joined together to get that same information

8582894
put	get
you don t get this packing and unpacking for free but it s pretty easy to do. luckily your tabtype enum is serializable so it should be trivial to put into a bundle

width	height
is there any way to pass through the width and height of the source when making a post through fb.ui or fb.api

8584076
jcl	rexx
i ve used a rexx script called batchpdf to set up the appropriate dd statements and then run ispstart and ftincl and at the moment this is working well however it seems to be a fragile solution - if the company changes their ispf dataset concatenations the jcl could break

8584140
draggable	droppable
the problem is that despite the fact that i provided the tolerance value for both draggable and sortable in order to create the posibility of triggering either drop or sort tolerance pointer for droppable so you can reach this easily and the other one when you insist more - tolerance intersect for sortable droppable is triggered everytime except when i drag the mouse at about 100px bottom or top from the placeholder and release the dragged item

the onetoone would work only if each parent had at most one child the above code works for the more general case when a parent can have many children

8584859
implements	extends
as all of the major browsers try to implements as standard as possible html5 the old browsers will not support it ever so if your app targets old browsers too it is worth the trouble of extends old browser with a self made library which does the same things as html5 and the same function names

8584906

8585354
pop-up	dialog
the dialog is there to prevent sites from abusing pop-up to deny users the ability to use the browser s interface

pop-up	dialog
instead of using a pop-up window you might want to consider an html dialog box that you position on top of the rest of your ui

8585370
punctuation	words
the only way this won t work is if your words ends in an underscore and you wanted that punctuation to be part of the words for example bug and another_ blahblah will pick out another since another wasn t followed by a space

8585509
pull	push
i want to be able to do something similar for hg pull push merge graft so that if i know that i never want to merge a given change i can just block it from consideration making subsequent cherry-picking merging etc. into a more fire-and-forget affair

i can implement the boundary portion with ejb s stateless stateful singleton and the control layer with cdi or ejb s

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
and you want to find the element where group is group3 then you loops through the arrays with a traditional for-loop as follows

flask	django
on top of that you might want to use a framework like django or flask

try-catch	exception-handling
also in order to catch all exception-handling on the server instead of multiple try-catch blocks you can implement ierrorhandler

google-chrome	firefox
your code works fine in google-chrome and firefox i found the issue in ie9 on some googling found that having doctype works can you try putting

8586722
int	chars
the code runs fine when unsigned chars is replaced by chars or int as expected it terminates

8586722
int	chars
as i have i have read in eof is defines as -1 in stdio.h then why does this code fails for unsigned chars but runs fine for unsigned int

8586759
put	get
i ve managed to get the t-sql from the query by simply hovering over the iqueryable object after i put a breakpoint in but the query uses parameters such as p1 p2 etc - some of which are a mystery to me usually ones in a coalesce function

8586768
mdpi	hdpi
create the image with 9-patch so no need to save the images for different density like hdpi mdpi etc

8586774
int	chars
use an int cast it to a chars after you ve checked for eof

8586797
min	max
the nice thing about it is that you don t need to worry about min max or step size and yet it performs very well in most one-off situations

8586798
graphics2d	bufferedimage
when i call the jframeâ s component.printall method and then print the graphics2d object to a png file using bufferedimage and imageio.write then the printall method havenâ t catched the glcanvas

the int promotion rules in c will implicitly convert the unsigned chars to unsigned int

8587041

the addition works well because an implicit casting has performed on it but for the multiplication of different value types an error occurs

8587042
versioning	upgrade
a major upgrade automatically uninstalls the old versioning before installing your new one

8587043
cpu	processors
be aware that on current laptop desktop server out-of-order pipelined superscalar processors with complex cpu caches and tlb and branch predictors the execution time of some tiny loop or sequence of machine instruction is not reproducible the nanosecond count will vary from one run to the next

8587043
debian	linux
btw on my i3770k recent gnu linux 4.2 kernel debian sid x86-64 desktop computer system -calls like time 2 or clock_gettime 2 runs in about 3 or 4 nanoseconds thanks to vdso 7 which avoid the burden of a real syscall ... so you could use them inside your program quite often

8587080
for-loop	loops
since sql parameter names have to be unique you could use a for-loop instead and append the index of loops variable in each iteration to the sql parameter name

8587129
width	height
you can not specify width and height in your input and expect work fine with ckeditor.beacause

ilist	icollection
you could write an own class that implements icollection or ilist there you would implement add as session ... .

8587434
put	get
i d put the organization_id as a paramater in the sign up link but that s not very secure as that means any user could simply change the organization_id in the url and automatically get an account to another organization that doesn t belong to them

8587437
children	parent
in other words one execution of this function returns a list of elements which are children of the given parent id

8587512
udp	tcp
the key question was related to what kind of situations would udp be the better choice over tcp

8587512
udp	tcp
with the massive growth of mobile applications and the occasionally connected or occasionally disconnected paradigms that go with them there are certainly situations where the overhead of tcp s attempts to maintain a connection when connections are hard to come by leads to a strong case for udp and its message oriented nature

8587512
udp	tcp
now i don t have the math research numbers on this but i have produced apps that have worked more reliably using and ack nak and message numbering over udp than could be achieved with tcp when connectivity was generally poor and poor old tcp just spent it s time and my client s money just trying to connect

8587525
inherited	properties
i have created a simple control which inherited from link button which contains a list of a simple object called linkparamaters the idea being that in markup you can define a postback url as well as parameters which then returns the postbackurl properties to include a querystring

8587972
width	margin

post	get
well you can t force a provider to send you something over post or get or any other http method

8596143
post	get
some do that others don t lightopenid itself supports receiving data from both post and get but there s still no way to force the provider to use either one

8596165
opera	google-chrome
in opera and google-chrome it works fine when there s only one div but if there are several divs on top of each other and i try to move one over the others it lags

8596182
jsf	seam
now i decided to try jsf 2 + cdi + seam 3 + primefaces 3 i know this version is not final yet and had so many problems along the way that i am looking for alternatives

8596197
cgpoint	cgsize
this is not caused by wrong data in the notification but by a bug in accessing the height member of a cgsize or the y member of a cgpoint

8596197
cgpoint	cgsize
the workaround is to take the address of the cgsize or cgpoint struct then use pointer arithmetic to access the desired member

8596282
perl	tcl
an familiar example is regex - perl python tcl .net and most other implementations use a state machine internally

8596287
allocator	stl
if the value of strlen s isn t known until run-time then one can bring the code into compliance by either converting to performing the allocator deallocation explicitly on conventions arrays or by using stl containers. std vector

8596292
width	height
no need to fix the width or height or anything else and the animation doesn t jump

8596295
alloca	malloc
the standard workaround is to use malloc or alloca

8596308
post	get
make your form use a post method and check if the request method is get direct access or link from another page or post form submission

8596309
jar	war
if that file is absent in war or jar then jsf won t scan for jsf-specific annotations inside war or jar as well

8596374
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome or firefox when you click on reload the page change immediately and the first query on the next page will have to wait the previous query to finish

tcpclient	networkstream	tcplistener	tcpclient	tcplistener	networkstream
where clientstream is the networkstream associated with the tcpclient that was built from a tcplistener

8596407
tcplistener	networkstream
edit when i want to debug tcp clients in c# i use a tcplistener s networkstream and do .receive synchronously

8596408
post	get
so i used my own browser to request the captcha and solve it then used curl to post the reply from our development server to clientlogin after which i was able to get the auth_token necessary to transmit messages

8596413
hash	salt
as explained in one of the answers in secure hash and salt for php passwords this changes the value of hash making a password more difficult to compromise

8596413
hash	salt
as part of the verification mechanism the password entered by the user is combined with the salt and hash as needed

8596420
decoder	encoder
encoder decoder run

8596446
hash	salt
salt passwords reduce the probability that a rainbow table will already have the salt password s hash contained in it

8596468
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas why the code below wouldn t work in ie yet in firefox and google-chrome it does

8596468
google-chrome	firefox
i get the id alerted out in firefox google-chrome but not ie

8596510
children	parent
to make shure you are removing the right parent element up in the tree and its children you can try this

8596529
width	height
i think your problem is being caused by the fact that you re setting the width and height of the canvas through a style sheet instead of the width height properties of the canvas element

8596529
width	height
for some reason setting the canvas width height through its style sheet causes weird scaling issues

8596529
width	height
the same code you provided i just changed it so that it would set the width height by way of style sheet

8596529
width	height
i think it has something to do with the fact that the stylesheet width height actually controls the rendering surface where as the width height element properties control the size of the element

8596533
inherited	properties
what if we wanted to define another class called manager which inherited some properties from person

8596533
inherited	properties
there is no point redefining all this properties again when we define our manager class we can just set it to inherited from the class person

8596533
inherited	subclassing
then we copy the inherited prototype into the subclassing prototype as follows subclass.prototype new inherited

8596533
implements	extends
now that we have implements our inheritance we can start using it to extends our classes

8596533
inherited	subclassing
also note that you will need to specify this inherited before you can actually define our subclassing

8596533
inherited	properties
our manager class will always have the methods and properties defined in the person class because it inherited from it

8596557
hide	show
the faster and easier way to show hide occurrences of your code is by pressing the hotkeys

8596566
hash	salt
but if you append a salt of say 30 chracters to his plain-text password and then hash it

8596656

division	multiplication
go s and are similar to shifts that is division or multiplication by a power of 2 in other languages but because go is a safer language than c c++ it does some extra work when the shift count is a number

8596705
x86	64bit
shift instructions in x86 cpus consider only 5 bits 6 bits on 64bit x86 cpus of the shift count

every tutorial i ve found so far requires you to input the full data set then r computes the statistics itself but i was wondering how to pass the mean median min max etc.

8597017
post	put	post	get	put	get
rather than specify actions edit delete ... in url segments you will want to make use of http verbs get put post delete

8597081
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both seem to have stopped supporting it since i wrote the above according to this article which was mentioned below which is really annoying

8597098
gridview	radgrid
in my experience the radgrid and the gridview works in the same way with respect to the event model so this so answer might sort you out

8597108
treemap	treeset
correction use treemap instead of treeset as suggested by thomas

versioning	upgrade
the original test case will now pass if you upgrade to autofixture versioning 2.7.2 or newer

8597204
post	get
for example server.com article 123 could house not only get but also post edit and delete delete

8597248
client-side	server-side
there are a multiple options to obtain it for server-side or client-side and how you want to do that is highly dependent on the specifics of your application

8597263
punctuation	words
i want to put words back into the form of filter string with the original punctuation and spacing

8597264
selecteditem	selectedindex
this will give you the selecteditem and selectedindex properties of the current tab

8597306
post	get
to just view the comments using a post request you have to tell it to treat it as a get request by adding to the query string

8597364
folder	directory
essentially you have to figure out what folder your code is running under also called the working directory and construct a relative path from there

8597408
maven	pom.xml
but instead using the maven eclipse plugin to synchronize the pom.xml of my project with the eclipse configuration files and then the plugin must be built with the eclipse ide

8597458
bash	subshell
as your headline is bash continue on err i think a subshell is what you need

but it is not downloading the file i used this download method with the tomahawk tree and it worked now i m trying with primefaces but this doesn t download the file and no error

8597630
uisearchbar	uinavigationitem
it s not hard to put the search bar in the navigation bar see uisearchbar and uinavigationitem

8597650
getter	setter
you simple use get_asstring to call the property getter and set_asstring to call the setter

8597650
getter	setter
the mismatch between the getter and the setter is painful

8597665
min	max
examples of validation methods i need checks for null empty isstring isnumber length min max value less than greater than between not equal not less than not greater than etc

8597703
backbone.js	javascriptmvc

8597711
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it is stuttering a bit but not like in google-chrome where it s apt to give someone a seizure

8597733
min	max
just put these inside another div and make it 1020px wide secure the position and max min widths

8597740
move	drag
but hey have to make a tradeoff between telling the player to seek on every mouse move which could bog down the player as it computes keframe plus delta for every mouse move versus actually being able to drag the bar

8597819
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but if you trigger the click event of the submit button that will work in firefox and opera but not google-chrome

for some reason when i call the get session method the get organization and pass the data to a selectlist method to handle some naming logic the session variable is getting updated

8597877
nextuntil	each
my code is the following i thought using nextuntil would make the job but it makes the each iterate over all the elements

8597893
hash	md5
i am trying to md5 hash user-supplied data a file using the crypto functions in advapi32

8597908
switching	screens
if in your moment of creativity you decide it would be nice to display your application with say a listview that takes up half the screens and a webview that takes up the other half - so that when you click on a list item in fragment a it passes an intent to the webview in fragment b and suddenly you see what you just clicked without the app switching activities - then you could use a fragment

8597949
post	get
you can use a filter to get at some specific types of post on a wall

8597949
post	get
however you can not use to get photo post

8597970
post	get
i was able to get the javascript side of things working thanks to manishekhawat and the server side thanks to this awesome post

8597976
button	checkbox
the easiest way would most likely be to simply add the checkbox near the file upload button instead of directly in the dialog that shows up

8597985
folder	directory
my project s getting an error for drawable-land-xhdpi as an invalid resource directory name in the res folder

8597994
g++	gcc
try renaming your file to file.cpp and use g++ instead of gcc

8597995
for-loop	arrays
i ve done this with a for-loop over the arrays

8598012
post	get
to get the package of the android market this post may help

8598022

i am getting sparse hash collisions with these small strings i have tried something simple like adding a salt did not work

8598038
starttls	smtps
amazon ses supports expanded attachment types verp and starttls for smtps

8598039
hash	md5
what if i used sha512 and then md5 on that hash

8598059
google-chrome	firefox
i can t test it in ie9 right now but i t works in firefox and google-chrome

8598064
folder	directory
after that i opened a w32 console application in visual studio added the include folder to include directory added the debug folder to library directory and additional library directory under linker and added libcurl.lib to additional dependencies

8598096
folder	directory
eclipse did something extra weird with the directory names so it imported into the project named drawable-land-xhdpi but the actual folder name was drawable-land-xdpi missing the h in xhdpi

8598101
hash	salt
use a salt strengthened hash

8598101
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
the second method requires you to use a general purpose hash function sha-2 family or better not md5 or sha-1 as they re broken weak or better yet a hmac create a unique salt for the user and a unique application wide salt and then iterate the hash function many times 100 000 etc to slow it down called key stretching strengthening

8598109
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have tried assigning it to a blank uiviewcontroller subclass setting it as the initial view controller setting the uinavigationcontroller as the initial view controller trying to display the view using a button rather than programatically and changing all the different settings for the view and nothing makes any difference

8598117
soundpool	audiotrack
instead of prerecording wav files and embedding them in your application you can instead generate the split-channel wav audio in memory from code and then either save it as a wav file that you would play with soundpool or play the audio directly using audiotrack i d recommend the latter

8598126
put	get
and i figured i would use pointtoclient to get the positions of the cursor to send with the tower when ever we want to put it down

8598168
parseint	stringtokenizer	spaces	delimiter
to process a sequence of integers would depend on the formatting so you would want to make sure that they are seperated by spaces or some standard delimiter like white-space or comma 1 2 3 4 or 1 2 3 4 and then use the stringtokenizer or a similar class to break up the string into individual integer strings and then parse with parseint

8598172
udp	tcp
unix-domain sockets don t use udp or tcp since they never go across the network

8598172
udp	tcp
they do use sock_stream and sock_dgram though which behave similarly in most respects to using tcp and udp sockets to localhost

8598182
processors	hyperthreading
especially because many processors support hyperthreading

8598182
affinity	processors
be careful when you start multiple workers the linux kernel really prefers to keep processes executing on the same processors for their entire lifetime to provide for strong cache affinity

8598182
cpu	affinity
to combat this you might want to start your workers with an explicitly limited cpu affinity

8598189
hide	show
the thing is i cannot append to it show or hide it use .empty

8598234
post	get
jsonp only supports the get http action ie not post

8598261
width	height
keep your canvas s width and height the exact size of your original image size it ll be ok

8598280
switching	screens
in this example i d like the switching to occur on a touch event that happens anywhere on the screens

8598289
h.264	webm
flash supports h.264 not webm

8598297
versioning	upgrade
now the challenge is i need to be able to know the versioning of bbm running on the user s device so i can display an appropriate message telling the user to upgrade if the user does not meet the bbm platform requirement

8598315
uiview	uiwindow	portrait	landscape
in other words the uiview has its coordinates swapped to landscape as expected but its parent uiwindow still claims to be in portrait mode.

8598358
jlist	jtable
a jlist would probably be better than a jtable

8598398
google-chrome	firefox
if you go to this site hover over the about link in firefox or google-chrome and you can see that a menu popsup

8598431
hash	salt
they both work by using bcrypt to generate a salt hash of the password the only difference is that devise by default uses a higher cost for the hash it would take more cpu cycles to brute force it but of course you could easily add that to the railscast code so roughly equivalent in that respect

8598448
post	put
2 put the button in a form post that form to your plugin and add some code to handle the post d form if you do this make sure you include a nonce for security and also make sure that the user trying to click the button has the right privileges to do so

8598468
free	realloc
so you end up calling realloc free with a random garbage pointer that corrupts the heap and causes a later crash.

8598494
getter	setter
.attr name value is a setter .attr name is a getter

8598511
calloc	malloc
however calling it with a non-null pointer that was not obtained using malloc or calloc causes undefined behavior

8598514
for-loop	loops
this for-loop is the main loops which do the most of the computing

8598524
hide	show
the code in general would be more robust against these types of issues if you put a class in the div tag that you want to hide show and then you d have more robust ways to find it rather than relying on there being one and only one div tag in exactly the right place

8598532
dictionary	map
the other way to do it could be adding you own implementation of map dictionary which extends arraylist and in fact is a list of kvpair where kvpair looks like

8598536
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
also you can only have memory leaks when you use malloc or calloc without a corresponding free including equivalent use of realloc

8598553
min	max
i have set the number input field to have a min value of 1 and max of 7 but a user can still manually type in whatever number they want 0 or 8

8598570
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
also getelementsbytagname returns a nodelist so you need to get off of it or use getelementbyid instead when writing the cookie - this is why the cookie result is undefined

8598595
width	height
you could make it visibility hidden and set width and height to 0

8598602
width	height
the second bar has height 0 and the x-axis has a bar width ranging from -4.4 to -4.2 on the x-axis an so on

8598602
range	infinity
the last bar has a density of 0 and range from 2.6 to infinity

8598602
min	max
naturally we would set the xlim of the plot object to min and max of the breaks so that the first and last bars of 0 density are not plotted

8598635
int	chars
for example enum fruit might be compatible with int with chars or even with unsigned long long if the implementation chooses as long as the chosen type can represent all the values

8598653
range	median
you actually need the full ranked data to plot a proper boxplot because the quantities are median quartiles and the actual value of the closes data point within 1.5 times irq plus all data points that are outside that range outliers

8598656
disk	ram
you only need the working set of data to fit in ram because the non-used pages are not loaded and just kept on disk

8598660
system.in	system.out
even when i run it through the command line however it does not display output nor prompt for input when i use system.out system.in respectively

8598693
qgraphicsview	qvboxlayout
i am having trouble getting a qgraphicsview to show up in a qvboxlayout object and i have no idea what is wrong

8598744
wsimport	jaxws-maven-plugin
the wsimport is inside the maven plugin named jaxws-maven-plugin

8598745
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this can be done even on a system that is inherently case-insensitive windows because the repository itself is still case-sensitive

8598758
children	parent
meaning it has a parent child relationship with infinite children

8598759
google-chrome	firefox
so in firefox and google-chrome the second method is multiple times faster - just as i expected

8598772
google-chrome	firefox
for most of the links the transitions are working however links that i have visited do not play the animation in google-chrome and i would assume other webkit browsers as well within firefox however all links do the transition animation just fine

8598789
xslt	xquery
how can i exclude result prefixes from an xquery similiar to the xslt exclude-result-prefixes attribute in xslt

8598816
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if this view controller is part of a uinavigationcontroller with a toolbar configured or a uitabbarcontroller then any action sheet needs to be presented in the parent controller s view

8598830
mouseover	mouseenter
also check if you have any mouseover mouseenter css properties events

8598847
google-chrome	firefox
there are ways of seeing the changed html though - firebug in firefox f12 developer tools in ie or google-chrome

8598891
rjava	jri
ps please use stats-rosuda-devel mailing list for rjava jri questions - you get answers much faster

8598950
int	boolean
strpos can return an int 0 if the string you re searching for is at the start of the string which will then be interpreted as a boolean false

8598951
int	chars
this is a poor man s encryption every chars as int

8598969
fadein	fadeout
i am working with the jquery fadein fadeout method and confused by exactly what it is doing

8599258
public	protected
use either a protected non-virtual destructor and shared_ptrs they have static linking or a public virtual destructor

8599274

width	height
fairly hard-coded values for the width and height of each cell

8604398

g.measurestring will give me the width but not the height if it wraps to multiple lines

8604400
free	malloc
each time when you do a malloc think of the place where you re going to call free

8604411
free	malloc
as a rule of thumb you want to call free for every malloc call

8604425
unix	aix
i am using aix unix in which grep -ow a-za-z_ filename is not working as for aix -o switch is not present

8604448

the problem is that heroku does not use a mysql database in production but a postgresql database

8604571
excel	listobject
the data is edited using a excel table which tranlates to an listobject inside vsto

8604576

the problem i m having is getting is being able to access the height and width of the original display object i am replacing with the new one loaded via the loader class

8604599
put	get
you ll have to roll your sleeves up and write your own loop to put things into your groups but the above approach should get you started

8604601
folder	directory
can t i just delete the obj folder or empty the bin directory or clean solution or something

8604605
jboss	glassfish
i deploy my application on jboss 6 or glassfish 3 so the solution must be standard

8604609

versioning	upgrade
before upgrading it to 1.7 versioning all works fine but when i upgrade tortoisesvn to 1.7 versioning it gives me an error when i try to commit or to show history log or to update

8604767
versioning	upgrade
so why netbeans tells me that i have to upgrade the svn client as i already have the newest versioning

8604802
folder	directory
check if you have this folder in your wp-content plugins directory - even if it is not activated in wordpress the very presence of it there is a potential security threat as the attacker can use the direct url of the plugin faulty file to access it

8604809
google-chrome	safari
linux i686 applewebkit 535.7 khtml like gecko google-chrome 16.0.912.63 safari 535

8604834
hide	show
when show hide is used

8604846
getter	setter
you could simply write your own getter and setter to expose the instance variable

8604860

at first it catches the first line of the file to set min and max

8604860
min	max
if a new min or max was found

simple don t bother and just salt you hash and please don t use md5 go for sha1 or better for win

8604985
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
to protect yourself from those rainbow tables just make sure that you either salt your hash or stack multiple encryptions md5 sha1 pass

8605017
min	max
min and max are worksheet functions

8605017
min	max
i cannot tell the location of the values that are parameters to min and max

8605017
min	max
it is possible to use the min and max functions on an array but i know of no way of selecting a portion of an array

8605024
persistent	transient
if you don t want to persistent the data but you want it to be bound as part of the automatic binding then you can use the transient annotation.

8605104
hash	salt
to make it harder for brute force attacks on a hash use a salt and compress the salt data before hashing it

8605116
width	height
if you want to move the div out of visible area or hide it make the width and height 0px

8605167

packets	multicast
keep in mind that firewalls installed on pc can sometime silently kill packets i ve see that under windows especially if you use multicast or loop back addresses

8605310
try-catch	exception-handling
remove the second try-catch to let the exception-handling get caught in your first catch block

8605312
try-catch	exception-handling
let the exception-handling that occurs inside datacontext.savechanges bubble up to your try-catch inside the first section of code

8605320
try-catch	exception-handling
you don t throw the exception-handling so you aren t going to catch it in the try-catch of the first method

8605329
ceylon	kotlin
both kotlin and ceylon supports reified generics so its definitely possible to do so on top of the jvm

8605329
ceylon	kotlin
if scala 2.10 s reification turns out to be more limited than kotlin and ceylon

8605348
try-catch	exception-handling
you shouldn t catch the exception-handling in acceptchanges then and let first try-catch block handle it

8605352
mouse	keyboard
it works if you use keyboard but i ve got problem with the mouse

8605370
post	get
then with each api access require that id to be included in request either in get or post on in the header

8605435
entitydatasource	detailsview
i m using detailsview with entitydatasource and binding entitydatasource directly with entity model

8605464
post	put
1 if i want to use the application x-www-form-urlencoded request header i need to create a standard post string of so that when php gets it it can put it in the _post associative array

8605470
maven	pom.xml
i think this is more convenient solution because when you add a new xsd you do not need to change maven pom.xml just add a new xjb binding file to the same directory

8605499
vsto	add-in
i have implemented a vsto word add-in when the user install the setup file my add-in control does not appear until adding it from â œcom add-inâ dialog in the word option

8605557
ubuntu	linux
i have no knowledge about ubuntu linux and java environment

mktime	strtotime	mktime	strftime	strftime	strtotime
the datetime class sure has some handy methods and seems overall superior to the native php date functions like strtotime mktime and strftime and more

8605592
hide	show
i have the code below that grabs some html from an ajax request and then hide one row of a table and show another but even though the var that i create to hold the html quick_edit_html is available after the ajax function has run tested by putting it in an alert box firebug tells me that it does not exist when i try and use it in the next function which is not running until the ajax request is done

8605600
subtract	add
i want to add one to the w3c version instead of subtract one in the ie version to ease my conversion effort

my browser google-chrome and firefox tells me that the field is empty

8605711
comparator	comparable
implement comparable interface for hotpartsbean and override the comparator method

8605818
google-chrome	firefox
however the browsers rendering for all google-chrome firefox and ie seems to be inconsistent

8605895
anydac	mydac
update i intend to purchaser anydac unidac mydac the choice of which will be another question

8605898
put	get
the method calls get and put are safe - several threads can try to put at the same time and nothing bad will happen but that doesn t protect you from problems which arise when you call several methods in succession and the state of the map must not change between them

8605902
children	parent
that simply traverses the dom up to the parent element #5 #2 whatever and then back down to all the children the images you want to change

8605923
google-chrome	firefox
those are firefox 5 firefox 9 and google-chrome respectively

8605941
inherited	subclassing
if you wanted to save even more code you could make all the classes you wanted to have this behavior inherited from a common subclassing of nsmanagedobject and then apply this to that common class and all your subclassing would inherited the behavior

8605941
put	get
i ve put in checks to prevent this from being used on classes that already have their own custom implementations of valueforundefinedkey because if someone put that method in their class there s going to be an expectation that it will continue to get called

8605941
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
also note that there may be appkit code that expects the exceptions from the nsobject nsmanagedobject implementations to be thrown

8605949
many-to-many	one-to-many
one-to-one self-referential and bi-directional association is surprisingly a bit more complex that one-to-many or even many-to-many self-referential and bi-directional association

8605975
post	put
and oh ye if i use post instead of put in my edit - the this- data gets set but i cannot save the data

8605992
move	drag
grab the diagonal lines compound path an choose a keyframe on your timeline a ways out from the start frame then drag the compound path of diagonal lines to one side or set a large margin to the left so during the animation sequence it move to the right

8605999
getter	setter
no normally not unless you declare the getter and the setter synchronized

8605999
getter	setter
if the setter is being called from one thread and another thread wants to access the getter it has to wait for the other thread to end his task first

8606016
cpu	processors
however what complicates this and does in fact cause a slowdown is processors caches in order for two threads running on different cpus to access the same piece of memory and see each other s changes the cpu caches have to be synchronized which can completely negate the massive speed advantages of these caches if it happens a lot

8606026
freetype	libpng
in some cases you may need to install additional non-python dependencies libpng and freetype through your system s package manager

8606026
freetype	libpng
the other dependencies libpng freetype are system libraries and if you can build matplotlib for python2 you already have them

8606032
width	height
every time i set the width height of the .swf to 100 or auto the movie gets cut off at the top and bottom under the div containers

8606046

i m designing a php products system which is required to be very general in that each product may have a number of options height width colour gender etc. but that some products may not have those options and some may have none

8606048
subclass	abstract-class
i realized late i m a moron that asynctaskloader is an abstract-class so i need to subclass it.

8606052
post	get
note ajaxfunction is the default ajax exemple for a get post

8606058
children	parent
now i want to link up the classes so that my base array still contains all the items but each item has its navigational properties set children parent

8606058
children	parent
my inital thought was doing a groupjoin to fill the children and then a join to fill the parent

8606081
width	height
all you have to do to make it what you want is restrict the visibility of the rectangle to the percentage you want and change the height width ratio

8606095
folder	directory
i made it work pretty easily with all files in a single directory but then we ran it in a folder with subdirectories and as you can probably guess it threw a lot of errors

8606103
portrait	landscape
on ios using ipad simulator portrait mode in safari the video plays but once i turn it to landscape and load the page and try to click the video to play nothing happens

8606192

8606246
maven	m2e
a ways back i had tried to install the m2e plugin to experiment with maven

8606285
hash	md5
i had thought about maybe generating and storing an md5 hash storing it to session and passing that as an escape param but that seems a little sketchy

8606306
put	get
the only way that i seem to be able to get async working is if the messages are non persistent by this i mean that the putsuccesscount equals number of messages put on the mqasyncstatus all other times it is zero

8606317
google-chrome	firefox
to the individual text fields but it did not seem to work testing in firefox and google-chrome

8606358
folder	directory
the users have files in a shared folder to which both have access using a virtual directory with read access

8606385
memcached	apc
it mean that you keep mysql for store data but install apc this solution is simplest and fastest for small servers and applications or memcached better for using width several servers

8606385
memcached	apc
for each read-request you check apc memcached for you data and ask mysql only if your cache is removed or updated

8606393
opera	firefox
but there is no problem when playing in firefox or opera

8606421
post	get
google allows only post request facebook supports both post and get

8606451
bluetooth	usb

8606488
jar	war
the model and the ejb are in the a separate jar file and the the action classes are in a war file

8606496
min	max
if the min and max sizes are the same it prevents resizing

8606564
folder	directory
you can tell it because what would normally be inside the .git folder is right there in the directory and the directory itself is named with a .git suffix

8606597
cpu	processors
i would like to know if there is any smart way to trigger off the asynchronous process so that i can avoid the cpu usage spike and still get optimum response time from the asynchronous processors

8606655
mpfr	mpc
i downloaded gcc 4.6.2 with gmp mpfr and mpc and did a build

8606655
g++	gcc
i could see g++ executable in build gcc directory

8606727
getter	setter
in this case you should use always self.question to use the getter and setter generated and use _question release in the dealloc method

8606771
jar	manifest.mf
manifest file is located inside jar at meta-inf manifest.mf path

8606800
folder	directory
if you follow the xaml way you would just have to feed the directory argument of deletedirectory with the physical unc path to the folder you re trying to get rid of

8606811
dictionary	map
what i want to do is to create a dictionary stringclassname string windowtitle or any map to pass to that method

8606824
hide	show
i m trying to get this to work in a wicket renderhead-method the parameter iheaderresponse response is passing a javascript to show respectively hide links in the calling parent page

8606842
nsstring	nsdata
it looks like you are passing an nsstring parameter where you should be passing an nsdata parameter

8606883
uinavigationcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
i am not surprised to hear that uipageviewcontroller behaves like this though - after all uinavigationcontroller works the same way if you push a view controller onto the navigation controller s stack and that view controller does not permit the current orientation of the device the interface does not rotate to an orientation that the view controller does permit

8606916
public	protected
i would much prefer having it in my hosting provider s protected directory instead of public

8606962
hash	md5
here are some benchmarks for hash md5 and sha1

8606970
public	protected
i would much prefer having it in my hosting provider s protected directory instead of public

8606970
post	get
whether you use post or get doesn t make a difference security-wise but using post would be more fitting as you are changing state on the server

8606984
uiview	caanimation
there s a great class called caanimationblocks and explained here that is a category on caanimation that allows you to use completion blocks like you would on a uiview

8607000
versioning	upgrade
maybe it works if you upgrade to the latest versioning of both

8607034
width	margin
if there isn t i was thinking that i could get the outer width of my list elements with their margin and the inner width of the wrapper

8607034
google-chrome	firefox
by the way this was tested in google-chrome and firefox

8607061
addition	multiplication
if it s just basic addition multiplication etc

8607063
put	get
you may try to put super.onsaveinstancestate in the end of the onsaveinstancestate function and implement onrestoreinstancestate in which you get your data back

8607074
width	height
but only width is working and height is not

8607096
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade wordpress to 3.3 versioning and the navigation is not working any more because i have spans tags into the menu link added with link_after and link_before

8607125
put	get
it is possible to get great performance from wpf applications as well as slick ui but you need to put in a bit more work

8607166
mockito	easymock
like brice i prefer mockito to easymock but here s the easymock version that is closer to your original example since your example was easymock

8607166
mockito	easymock
i think you can see from the two examples why many people prefer mockito but if there s some reason you prefer or are mandated to use easymock you can do just about anything you can do with mockito just with more lines of code

8607273
interbase	firebird	postgresql	mysql
zeoslib - open source supports mysql postgresql interbase firebird ms sql sybase oracle and sqlite

8607273

i have an extension for google-chrome and firefox and now i want to port it to ie too

8607390
post	get
basicaly i now need to get the number of post in each thread and the date of the last post in each thread

8607399
width	height
if you use npc as your unit the total width and height of your graph is 1

8607400
mako	genshi
when you run paster quickstart it should ask you if you want to proceed with genshi or mako

8607403
rspec	capybara
i tested it like so in a rspec request test using capybara

8607421
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
i also tried to use an outputstream a dataoutputstream and a bufferedoutputstream

8607432
clang	llvm
also i use clang llvm 3.0 it was built using this tutorial

8607447
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	int	double	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
i started out with int data types for my imaginary and real aspects of my complex numbers because of my vast ignorance when after coding addition subtraction and multiplication successfully i realized that for division i would need to use double

8607447
int	double
when i switched to double i got bad results from my previous three calculations which worked wonderfully when the values were stored as int

8607475
innodb	myisam
the following doesn t belong to the question but as a side note after some other tries i switched the engine from myisam to innodb â with rtu_nb mp_nb datetime as primary key â and the statement completed after 0.13 seconds

8607585
strcpy	strncpy	printf	strncpy	printf	strcpy
i have tried using strcpy strncpy printf with the same results

8607599
disk	ram
also they take up disk space and ram and can easily be larger than the table itself

8607600
versioning	upgrade
you either upgrade your versioning of delphi or use something other than tadoconnection

8607608
min	max
wouldn t hurt to get familiar with group by in linq and aggregates max min count

8607627
int	double
what every c c++ programmer should know about printf format specifiers are d is for int f is for double

8607663
post	get
you can also define a whole range of parameters so it s easy to mimic a post or get - then you run the script regularly as a cron job save the results each time to a new file and compare it to the old one with php

8607666
versioning	upgrade
if the code doesn t run on php 5.2+ then you can t use a current phpunit versioning which is definitely more of a concern and my first general recommendation is to find any issues an php 5 upgrade might bring

8607711
chunked	transfer-encoding
... you need to make sure you add the transfer-encoding chunked header for it to display properly

8607715
strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup
as an alternative to everyone s examples of strcpy you can just use strdup and skip the malloc

8607720
accessor	ivar
the ivar first one is a plain variable that cannot be accessed out of the scope of an implementation of the interface it s created in if private directive is used and has no synthesized accessor methods

8607720
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the properties second one is a wrapped ivar and something that can always be accessed via instantiating a class and has accessor methods synthesized if synthesize directive is being used

8607725
getter	setter
sure there are private fields but there are a lot of getter and setter methods

8607739
behat	mink
you could definitely look at behat and mink

8607739
behat	mink
behat is a runner for cucumber s gherkin syntax given when thens and mink lets behat run real browsers

8607739
webrat	cucumber
while using cucumber and something like webrat or selenium to test a non ruby application is ok sticking with php if that s what your app is written has manifold benefits - developer skillset and ease of app setup the kind of stuff you do in given steps being the most obvious

8607741
kde	gnome
that said i dont know why you would use php my admin when you could use mysql workbench or one of the other gnome or kde admin apps

8607753
width	height
make a call via javascript to change the size of the window using window.resizeto width height

8607753
google-chrome	firefox
however this doesn t work in later versions of google-chrome or firefox for that matter

8607756
post	get
any time the site post back the ie window will get moved to the background

8607789
installation	upgrade
then they will be selectable during installation and upgrade works well with them

8607844
for-loop	loops
i am trying to loops through the buttons to edit the height attribute of each one however when i set up a for-loop i 0

8607861
codeigniter	yii
and finally i recommend considering using a web framework symofony yii codeigniter as once you get the hang of it they enable you to develop faster and in some cases have flexible rewrite routing rules built in

8607862
inherited	properties
removing properties of an inherited object in c#

8607922
post	get
using post i d get the resulting url

8607922
post	get
but using a renderurl with the parameter set i d get this which is a combination of what both post and get would return

8607922
post	get
so for now i can either use a form with post and paramutil.getstring will recognize the data but the link will not be bookmarkable or i could use a form with get leaving information in the url but i cannot get paramutil to recognize the data

8607936
postgresql	mysql
if your database is small enough which it will have to be since the heroku postgresql db is also 5mb and you would prefer to remain on mysql then you could use the cleardb mysql addon - - their entry level db is free and is the same size as the heroku shared postgresql db that you get by default but be careful that the number of connections is limited so don t be going crazy with your web dyno counts

8607945
g++	gcc
i can see that c mingw is installed and i can run gcc and g++ from a cmd prompt window so i am pretty sure that i have path set correctly

8607948
inherited	subclassing
what you want to be able to do is add some subclassing of the listview as a subview of the tabhost view rather than having multiple inherited

8607999
hash	md5
use a crc32 or md5 hash function on the contents loaded

8608039

unless you are adding the uinavigationcontroller to another uiviewcontroller that is utilized for a different method of navigation uisplitviewcontroller or uitabbarcontroller i would recommend adding the uinavigationcontroller to your application window in the appdelegate then add the uiviewcontroller that has your view in it

if it s not you might be specifying that the accessor use a different ivar in your synthesize directive for ext or you might have provided a setter -setext that doesn t properly set the ivar

8609359
textwrangler	bbedit
if you get textwrangler s big brother bbedit then it comes with command line tools bbedit and bbdiff which give you the behaviour you are looking for plus a lot of other useful functionality

8609658

superjos has the most correct answer and using the continuous testing addin you can get visual studio to run the moles runner through the nunit console runner with this batch file

8609687

use mbrs minimum bounding rectangle with min max coordinate

8609924
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
i am not quite sure but i think your problem is because your are trying to handle events in uiwindow class rather than uiviewcontroller class

8609924
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
add the view of that uiviewcontroller to your uiwindow instance

8609924
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
it is kind of swapping views under the uiviewcontroller rather than in the instance of uiwindow .

8609944

google-chrome	safari
i don t mind if it is similar to google-chrome or safari

8610359

correction you said pygobject that is gtk+3 so the example is as follows the main difference is that there is no expose event instead it is draw and a cairo context is already passed as a parameter

mouseover	mouseout
this will wait half a second before doing whatever when you mouseover the element and the whatever will not happen if you mouseout within the half second

8610364
hide	show
hide the optional ones and show them as required

8610374
opera	google-chrome
since google-chrome and opera both recognize this format they ll disregard the subsequent source declarations and use eot to display the font

8610374
opentype	woff
personally i would recommend placing the svg version first in your css and for browsers that don t recognize this format suggest truetype ttf second then woff then eot for browsers that don t support any of the aforementioned some older versions of ie appear to support opentype exculsively

8610380
express	node.js
i m using node.js with express web framework and ejs template engine

8610603
post	get
do i have to make sure that my post and get variables never conflict in all layers of my view models in this case the company and employee classes

8610660
post	get
it might be a good idea to hash the email addresses since there s a big chance that the links might be posted to a forum or similar and the post might then get crawled by an email address crawler

8610660
hash	md5
i think that just a simple hash md5 of the address would almost solve this

8610668
int	chars
since you are accessing a string using it would convert the index to an int in that case x would convert to 0 so it would extract the first chars 1

8610681
pbkdf2	hash
a pretty strong hash function would be like this this hash function is a pbkdf2 hash

8610692
put	get
to get this working i had to put a single quote around the case -- total

8610702
post	put
once you have manage_feed you can http post the posting using the graph api to put the stream item into their feed

img .each function this attr src

8610878
internationalization	localization
in case of time zone it has nothing to do with internationalization and localization there are several different time zones in usa

then you can use that to make it a bit bigger in width and height and set the frame of button to that

8610951
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox but ie8 displays nothing..

8610952
client-side	server-side
if you want to create a particular version of your page that is more compatible with email clients you re going to have to ensure that any modifications to your html are performed server-side not client-side

folder	directory
so now my folder mysite contains mysite and mysite_env directory

8611008
post	get
redierect from the post to the get following the prg pattern

8611009
google-chrome	firefox
it works like a charm on google-chrome clientwidth is 0 until the image is loaded but on firefox it instantly goes some tiny number in my case 24 instead of 700 so the actual shrinking part happens before the images is loaded so it stays at the same size

8611026
width	height
like status uploaded error etc x width y height etc

8611041
getter	setter
both have extend render initializer getter setter methods

8611050
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

8611055
keydown	keyup
once for the keydown event and again for the keyup

8611063
png	tga
the texture is an uncompressed png with alpha but i also tried with tga 24bit 32bit with no luck

8611066
button	checkbox
what the problem is and i cannot yet detect how to fix is that if i select let s say 3 out of 4 checkbox and press and button that verifies the selections writes selections to textbox the program automatically checks all the checkbox and gives me all the values which i don t need

8611093
getter	setter
getter and setter are in model according to mvc paradigm

8611196
folder	directory
then when i click browse for either root directory or archive file and select the folder i can t click finish

8611198
free	malloc
these first couple programs do not use malloc or free i just wanted to see how memory is allocated and de-allocated for standard arrays local to a function

8611213
portrait	landscape
for portrait layouts use the layout-port folder for landscape use layout-land

8611216
munin	cacti
typically for monitoring the server you will want to use a tool like zabbix or cacti or munin

8611219
free	malloc
you shouldn t be allocating such large arrays on the stack use malloc and free to allocate and deallocate the memory on the heap there s no way to get around malloc for such sizes of arrays

8611228
hash	salt
you should also read secure hash and salt for php passwords

8611237
rss	feed
i have a php script that is parsing an rss feed and entering the info in a db

8611269
pbkdf2	salt
use bcrypt or pbkdf2 which will require you to use salt and iterations

8611273
mouseup	mousedown
also when i attached the mousedown mouseup event listeners then i got the same exact thing you did with the whole orange highlight thingy

8611275
int	boolean
or if value are int or boolean cast int boolean on them

8611290
mouse	keyboard
basically it needs to accept mouse events click motion etc while not stealing keyboard focus from the window it is trying to type in

8611315
loops	while-loop
using the while-loop in this way seems nonstandard to me however i can t think of any other way to create a wait-until sort of loops

8611342
persistent	transient
variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object

8611342
persistent	transient
in fact most persistent frameworks and databases won t store transient fields

8611359
rss	feed
im trying to retrieve the rss feed from new.google.com im using working with the top stories feed right now topic h output rss

8611366
free	strdup
do not pass these pointers to free 3 . also you should probably not being doing dir dirname dir as you ve then lost the pointer to the memory allocated by strdup strdup allocated memory should be passed to free

8611368
public	protected
make a protected virtual abstract function returning boost any and a non-virtual non-abstract public template function to hide it from the users of your interface

8611392
google-chrome	firefox
when i use the url address it shows different in the google-chrome firefox and ie 9

8611416
public	protected
one way would be to make a public or protected method that simply returns the array but that could provide too much access

8611429
oncreate	setcontentview
if i don t setup the rest of the code in oncreate past setcontentview i don t have an issue

8611433
free	malloc
i ve created a simple program to help myself understand memory allocation malloc and free

8611449
int	chars
i m aware this is what it should do given the above however how can i make it concatenate the result of each column into one result whilst also only including de.projectcode when the result it not null this can be chars or int values

8611453
post	get
i have read the many post out there regarding what to do for this error and as far as i can tell i have the correct web.config values but i still get the error

8611454
hide	show
update orders return true or false it show or hide edit button depending on that condition only

8611461
post	get
it should effectively work like a post as it is an ajax call just make sure the backend can receive the get variables

8611491
interpolation	splines
what is the r equivalent of the simple matlab cubic splines interpolation in 2d space shown here

8611496
floating-point	integer
in other words sqrt returns a floating-point number while truncate returns an integer

8611508
projectile	angle
i ve seen a few examples that move a projectile in an arc from point a to point b but what i need is for the cannonball to first move along the axis of the cannon itself it s no good if the ball leaves the end of the cannon at a different angle to which the cannon is pointing

8611510
post	get
i can t post everything on here though here should give some in site what i did to get this to work

8611522
namenode	hdfs
the configuration files will contain settings such as the location of the jobtracker the hdfs namenode and the hbase master node

8611588
google-chrome	safari
also my other issue is that when users click on links in google-chrome and safari they turn white.

8611686
uiview	subviews
i ve also tried setting all the uiview s backgrounds by iterating through the subviews but to no avail

8611723
width	height
loadfromdata expects the buffer you are passing to have all the necessary information about the image...including its width and height

8611723
int	chars
in fact i m surprised that line compiled as written...because loadfromdata expects a chars for it s specification of the format and you re passing an int

8611723
width	height
if what you have is a raw byte array of data and know the width and height from some other source you probably want to use the appropriate qimage constructor for that

8611759
ant	maven
i m trying to build a new web app using eclipse i want to use spring web services and hibernate so i thought i d try using maven instead of ant so i don t have to track down all the jar files manually

8611759
getter	setter
for example i can t generate getter setter or use the refactoring tool to rename eclipse gives me an error like the resource is not in the build path of a java project

8611759
maven	pom.xml
now i want to add the spring libraries as a maven dependency and be able to build the project with maven so i figure i need a pom.xml file

8611759
maven	pom.xml
doesn t not seem to help me create a maven pom.xml file and i figure if i just create the file manually that probably won t work

8611771
ant	maven
my guess is that maven isn t mapping environment variables into system properties which is what ant is expecting with isset

8611772
width	height
but i expect you can just drawsquare x y width height color

8611784
width	height
why does this animation result in the window moving across left to right in the original position first then jumping to the other position even though i set the width and height properties before the animation started

8611784
width	height
it seems to reset the height value when it starts to show the width and then changes it back when doing the second animation

8611790
maven	m2e
in any case make sure you re using the latest version of eclipse indigo 3.7.1 m2e the latest and best version formerly known as m2e and the maven integration for wtp from the eclipse marketplace

8611811
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
for the second approach you need the m2e plugin to add maven support and auto creation of pom.xml file if there isn t any

8611825
jboss	glassfish
that are at least tomcat 6 glassfish 2 jboss 4.1 etcetera

8611825

actually https proxy can be used to tunnel any traffic not necessarily ssl

8612693

existingvalues exists on the client-side the users browser so you would need to pass it to the server-side somehow

8612707

on the up side you get all the sorting and filtering power of a database anything you ll need like and sqlite is fast easily enough to store game data in and very possibly faster than your own code

8612730
children	parent
i m looking for a way to configure nhibernate so that orphan children entities are deleted automatically but if a parent is deleted and a child exists a delete query on the parent is executed but not for the children

8612730
children	parent
the all-delete-orphan doesn t work for me because it deletes the children automatically when the parent is deleted

unlike what a lot of people are saying online you do not do a get curl call but you still do a post call

8613017

every time i went to the url in a browser it was fine and every time i tried to run a get curl command or a post command where all the variables were still in the url and not specified in postfields it failed

8613032
post	get
my suspicion is that your signature isn t getting generated correctly - frequently when people have oauth signature 401 errors when moving from get to post it s because the signature isn t getting generated correctly

8613032
put	get
if you put the specific variables for your call into the form you should get an identical signature - if you don t it means your signature is getting generated incorrectly

8613035
dictionary	map
i was thinking that map could store the function in a dictionary of type and then call could do the casting to the appropriate type but i m unable to get that to work

8613351
free	malloc
for every malloc there should be a free

8613356
equals	compareto
because objects that are different may share the same hash-code just comparing the hash-code is not a replacement for equals or or compareto

8613356
equals	gethashcode
this will only work if manager has a valid equals and gethashcode implementation

8613412
hide	show
my second question is that when i click on the same button or anywhere else on the view then the popover should get hide and if i click on another menu button popover should get hide from previous button and should be show on other button.

8613415
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals you should also override gethashcode this is used when you put your instances in a dictionary to calculate the bucket

8613415
equals	gethashcode
if you ve implemented gethashcode and equals well then you re able to determine whether a dictionary contains a specific instance by doing

8613444

8613562
width	height
it failed cause #image1 height and width gives 0 before it is fully downloaded

8613562
width	height
so i tried to keep inspecting size of the image until it has specific width and height

8613562

the function is called before image1 has width and height

8613564

i ve done this in the past to add wsse headers in situations where i couldn t add a dependency on microsoft s ws-security library since it isn t available for mono

8613681
portrait	landscape
the problem here is that some devices are portrait mode by default and some are landscape by default

8613681
screens	tablet
but on a tablet or a wide phone that is landscape by default the y axis is aligned to the shortest side of the screens

8613681
portrait	landscape
similarly if you force your game to be in landscape mode with in the androidmanifest.xml or via screenorientation.landscape as in your snippet then a portrait phone will return rotation_90 and a landscape device rotation_0

8613732
getter	setter
4 and of course - do not forget about getter and setter in in a class of a command object

8613745
accessor	properties
abstract classes don t allow bodies to the accessor of properties as far as i understand so that makes it trouble some for me

8613757
google-chrome	firefox
so if a browser doesn t offer support for playing mp3 files i know google-chrome does maybe firefox then it should be automatically downloaded when clicked

pull	push
the thing is i want to server to push data not the clients to pull that would be easier in my understanding

8614314
children	parent
in a dag a node can have multiple parent thus you have to take care not to delete the same node twice this would happen if each node just deletes all its children - for this reason a ptr_vector will not work here

8614372
hash	md5
for example the famous md5 hash algorithm p2p transport etc

8614478
flask	django

but it s hide and show the layouts very fast

8614889
ubuntu	debian
to install mysqldb under virtualenv you need to be able to compile the mysql module which means you need all the general compliation tools the python header libraries and the mysql client ones under ubuntu debian these are packages build-essential python-dev libmysqlclient16-dev at this point pip install mysql-python should work and from there you should be able to use mysql within django

8614923
hide	show
you may then want to hide the detail row and show only the aggregate data

8614928

8615126
versioning	upgrade
but considering that you re targeting an old versioning of the .net framework and don t want to upgrade it s a good bet that you probably have no need to call the latest api function either

8615205
innodb	myisam
the server where the inserts occur has a black hole table type that replicates to another server where the table is innodb or myisam

8615205
innodb	myisam
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario

8615205
innodb	myisam
you can use the merge table type for myisam not available for innodb

8615210
getter	setter
testparent extends actionsupport and it has the protected variables like gridmodel sord records etc and their getter and setter

8615272
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
after long investigations i noticed my new js code which proxies setinterval clearinterval settimeout cleartimeout methods caused this problem

8615317
innodb	myisam
it s got higher insert speed compared to innodb and myisam and scales much better as the dataset grows innodb tends to deteriorate once working dataset doesn t fit the ram making its performance dependant on the i o of the hdd subsystem

8615317
tokudb	myisam	innodb	myisam	innodb	tokudb
from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb

function for the class given below.at runtime the width and height will get set dynamically

8615461
post	get
i do not see any problem in manually setting the post variables to serve your purpose you may get to some logic problems if you are not paying attention but in the end they are still variables

8615463

yet another option for you would be to skip the wait form completely and instead show an waiting image on the mainform and hide it when the sql processing is done

8615467

a linkedin employee mentions that both client-side and server-side checks are done

8615579
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
as a guess without code you re probably emptying or initialising your text fields in viewdidload viewdidappear or viewwillappear - do it in your viewcontroller init instead

8615602
width	height
i would use the usual grid control with some gridsplitters to change the columns width height

8615602

one issue with using property is that it is hard to extend the behaviour of getter or setter in subclasses using standard class mechanisms

8615910
getter	setter
the problem is that the actual getter setter functions are hidden in the property

8615910

i have a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller

8618350
int	chars
so when you call sprintf to convert the int into its string representation right there inside the function it invokes undefined behaviour when it tries to put the chars 0 at index 6 because the indices 0 to 5 are already occupied by six digits of 998001 which is the product of 999 x 999

8618350
ostringstream	std
as james kanze pointed out in the comment that the real solution is to forget about sprintf and better use std ostringstream and std string as

8618378
getter	setter
interface b contains getter and setter and modifying methods

8618378
getter	setter
what i want is that i want to take out all the getter from interface b somehow and put them in a separate interface so that when i return a concrete object i don t have access to the setter and modifiers of interface b

8618495
min	max
i would suggest first to manually set the pool size in your connection string using max and min pool size attributes see for details

8618507
getter	setter	implements	modifiers
one way to achieve this would be to create a read-only wrapper object which implements interface b propagates the getter to the wrapped object and raises an exception like illegalaccessexception or invalidstateexception from within the setter and modifiers

there is no need to first hide it with css and then display it with javascript when you want it to show up from the beginning

8618639
post	get
but the browser according to the specs must get confirmation to allow to send the post request to the redirected url

8618692
width	height
edit i thought it may be the fact that when i am drawing the rectangle the mouse is strictly over the very edge of the shape so i tried setting the width and height to 99 and it seems to work okay now

8618703
int	chars
the c compiler is just copying the bytes from the int into the space for the pointer and back just like how you can hold a chars in an int

8618723
maven	m2e
however relating back to my own interest above i ve not found any combination of a few tools - including these - that can at least match the same checks that eclipse provides. combine this with maven m2e providing a common build configuration process that can be shared by both eclipse and your ci system and you should be in good shape

8618750
prepare	execute
i wouldn t prepare execute the transaction statements

8618750

pdo prepare and pdo execute return false if there s an error or else they throw pdoexception if you setattribute pdo attr_errmode pdo errmode_exception

8618752
google-chrome	safari
although the webview is based off the webkit rendering engine i believe that is all it has in common with browsers such as google-chrome and safari

8618797
subtract	add
it would be entirely possible that on hardware which included a special trap for hardware address 0x12345678 converting a pointer to an integer would subtract 0x12345678 from the hardware address and converting an integer to a pointer would add 0x12345678 back in thus an integer value of zero would represent a null pointer

8618798
stdout	stderr
the child dups its stdin to one pipe and dups its stdout and stderr to the other then runs execlp to run the game code

8618917
archetypes	dexterity
the site has both archetypes and dexterity content

8618987
accessor	properties
prefer using properties accessor to directly accessing instance variables in methods other than init.

what i need help with is to use jquery to find the width of each item and assign the item s height property to be equal to the width so that no matter the width of the browser window the width and height of the item is equal

8619241
width	height
once the width and height are the same it ll be easy to use css3 to make nice circle backgrounds

8619531
hide	show
whenever a function gets called every 10 seconds or so it randomly selects one or the other to show or hide

8619531
hide	show
it will switch back and forth show and hide each div appropriately

8619531
hide	show
even if the else gets called it doesn t actually show or hide either div hence the little debugging else called

8619539
hide	show
you say that you re just trying to show hide some specific items on the page

8619550
children	parent
in this new form you re attaching an event handler to a parent object and then looking for clicks in any children that match the .alert-box selector

8619556
mdpi	hdpi
in my application i support ldpi mdpi and hdpi mpbile phones

8619556
screens	tablet
when i run the application on this tablet the size of application is not feet on the screens

you should attach the database to the sql server instance using the sql server management studio which will upgrade the database to the correct versioning

8619587
onresume	onpause
thus for activity you can open db in onresume method and close in onpause

8619603

8619735
udp	tcp
so ideally i am looking for a way to unite tcp and udp on the server and manage both these connections under individual client threads

8619735
udp	tcp
currently i am wondering if it is possible to accept a tcp connection and set up udp communication from that

8619735
udp	tcp
from my understanding the endpoints for tcp and udp would be formatted differently

8619754
jobs	cron
the gem creates cron jobs

8619849
put	get
obviously we re meant to put initialization of all the properties in the oncreated partial function but we d much rather have the ability to add some logic to the get property

8619868
pop-up	dialog
i have written a seekbarpreference class that is embeded widget inside the preferences activity instead of pop-up dialog

8619883
onresume	onpause
what i noticed is that onpause is called before onnewintent and then afterwards it calls onresume

8619883
onresume	onpause
the problem is that i have listeners registered in onresume that get removed in onpause but they are needed inside of the onnewintent call

8619885

8619938
post	get
as you already mentioned correctly match will create both get and post routes

8619938
post	get
using the correct matchers get or post keeps your routes clean and helps prevent unwanted behavior of your application

8619938
post	put	post	get	put	get
the latter point is true especially for post routes where you do not want to accidentially put a get request link on your webpage that can be followed by search bots

8619981
post	get
is it possible to simply refer to this in some form via get or post

8620023
post	get
likewise when a user-agent submits a form it issues an http get by default unless the method attribute of the form tag indicates it should post the data

8620023
post	get
if your api runs over http then the rules would specify get post delete etc

8620059
width	height
i m not sure why you d want to create a view with a width and height of zero but that s another story.

8620072
skip-lists	tree
i would suggest that you write a skip-lists to store your dictionary since this will still offer o log n lookups insertion and removal while also being able to provide an index tree implementations can generally not return an index since the nodes don t know it and there would be a cost to keeping them updated

8620119
allocator	stl
the crash does not always happen in the same place in the code each time i run it but does always happen during an allocator call to create a node in an stl list

the first row and first column of the table must automatically resize in width and height to the variable cell dimensions in the content area of the table because the user will be adding new table cells with variable amount of content

see my post here which shows how to get font information by subclassing itextextractionstrategy

i m also curious to learn a little more about how olap engines handle strings. the particular use case i have in mind is that i have a unique pre-existing record description for each of my olap facts and i want to put those descriptions in the cube so that i have the option to get them back when i do a drillthrough operation

awesomium	berkelium
berkelium or awesomium in general are probably a good bet they re rather widely used for embedding webkit and will work well

the while executes much much faster than the fadeout fadein calls so you only see the last result

8623047
min	max
i would like to aggregate data by grouping on id and taking either the max or the min

8623049
keydown	keyup
you could probably just use keyup to stop all sounds and then in keydown start the sound that goes with whatever key was just pressed - i m assuming your intention is for the sound to keep going only as long as the key is held down

8623058
min	max
i can set max date and min date programmatically using this link

8623058
min	max
i want to set min time 07 00 and max time 10 00 in timepicker and maintain an interval of 30 minutes

8623117
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
whereas in google-chrome firefox and opera it looks fine

8623120
for-loop	arrays
by then the arrays index has advanced to the end of your for-loop thus it points off the end of the arrays to an undefined value

8623164
google-chrome	firefox
if the code is a short snippet then as yoshi has pointed out earlier - modern browsers like google-chrome and firefox with firebug my favorite allow you directly run js snippets on the browser javascript console

8623299
textview	imageview
a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more

8623303
realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the speciï ed size

8623303
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise ifptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undeï ned

8623303
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
note that in your case the pointer being passed to realloc is not null ans also was not received by calling calloc malloc or realloc which breaks the requirements mandated by the standard hence the undefined behavior

8623304
width	height
that s cuz the layout height and width take integer values

8623304
width	height
so in a way it s possible to do what you re trying to but only with weight and not with height or width

8623315
post	get
i want to get the http ..............html of the post and the title then go to the next page and get all the pages and so on and store them in database

when the module is loaded a thread object is created to represent the main thread and it s _exitfunc method is registered as an atexit hook

8623655
unsigned	short
there s no unsigned short in java all numbers in java are signed you will need an int to store an unsigned short

8623655
unsigned	short
and as chicharo pointed out an unsigned short will only occupy 2 bytes of memory not 4 bytes

8623670
swt	swing
furthermore eclipse uses a completely different ui swt than netbeans swing and these two systems are not compatible

uiview	subviews
create everything in the view controller add the uiview as a subviews to the main view and keep track of the uilabel subviews with properties

8623850
fadein	fadeout
you cannot have one object fadeout and fadein at the same time - the object can only have one state at a time it s either fading in or fading out but not both

8623850
fadein	fadeout
if you re willing to do them sequentially so the old dialog fades out and then the new one fades in the two fades are one after the another rather than at the same time then you can use the type of code that vitaly proposed where you do the fadeout and then in the completion function for that fadeout you change the contents of the dialog and then do a fadein

8623850
fadein	fadeout
if you had reasons to only want one dialog and want the simultaneous fades then you could fadeout one block of content in the dialog and fadein another block of content

8623886
daemons	systemd
install ntp daemons that adjusts the time by tuning slowing down speeding up the systemd clock in very slight fashion during long time span

8623902

for-loop	arrays
use a normal for-loop to iterate over an arrays

8625387
getter	setter
also it s not generally a good practice to leave public the properties a better approach is to make the property private and create some methods to access it it s call getter and setter example

8625387
getter	setter
using getter and setter you have a better control over the data to be noted that in your example the setter won t be needed

8625408
folder	directory
what i want is if i click on file name column i want the parent folder always on top then ascending descending folder names and then ascending descending file names and if i click on file type i want directory to remain untouched and then i want normal files in ascending descending order by their size

8625428
g++	gcc
here s a comparison the size of a binary produced by g++ for your code on linux using gcc 4.6.1

8625428
g++	gcc
the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger

8625431
int	double
you d probably want to replace the casting of double to int with a union since the former violates strict aliasing although even use of a union to access something different than what is stored is technically illegal

8625443
stdout	stderr
i ve spent a lot of time researching various ways to read stdout one with asynchronous reads and listening for events and the other method was with separate threads polling stdout and stderr and raising events to the ui thread which is updating the textbox

accessor	properties
i tried to see the value of but i think it is magic accessor __get and __set so i could not see the value of this properties before calling that method

8625724
width	height
you have to hard code your width height in an inline style

8625724
width	height
the reason is it uses the width height to create the other elements within the map

8625818
swt	swing
ibm built swt as a native-peer based competitor to swing

8625930
getter	setter
the one structural change this approach requires from the code you posted is that it requires a same-named property or equivalent getter setter methods to be defined in the base class

8625930
getter	setter
again the catch minor difference is that in order for this to work the base class must define a property of the same name or equivalent getter setter methods

8625941
typedef	struct
by the way in c++ you don t need the typedef trick for struct s

8625957
width	height
as far as i know they both offer you the same information one as a rectangle with his width and height and the other just the origin point

8625961

int	boolean	int	double
since all of the relevant variables are int double strings or boolean as a last resort i can switch on the type and use the corresponding totype method but i bet there is a more elegant solution

8626354
equals	compareto
ofc you need to implement equals and hashcode so that class behaves consistently in each set implementation but for treeset this should work as is since treeset relies on compareto method while performing add remove or contains operations instead of equals like hashset

8627212
children	parent
afik java stores the object as object-graphs graphs of objects where the parent object has the subobjects as its children for garbage collection

8627270
int	chars
since filename is declared as an array of one wchar you would think that only one chars would be copied but the compiler pads the struct to be an extra two bytes long so that its length is an int multiple of the size of an int which is why a second wchar is copied as well

8627324
hash	md5
if you want an extra long or seemingly more random id you can sha1 or md5 the uniqid to create a hash

8627325
hash	md5
the special script that you re talking about however can be a multitude of things from an md5 hash of the input name to an incremented number to prevent overwrites

so i was hoping someone could show me how to use the hash salt method in this case....

8627494
hash	salt
please note i have been looking through this site for this answer and i see people time and time again say salt hash is not encryption i understand that but its not as simple to attempt to hack my site if the links were hash as they would be if they were just simple integers

inherited	subclassing
the __construct function is not inherited to subclassing so there is no reason for to be set in the second child class

8628118
integer	radix
if the elements in the actual code are integers you can use a special-purpose integer sorting algorithm such as radix sort for an overall o max s t time complexity though if the bags are small the built-in array.sort will likely run faster than a custom integer sort

8628130
hide	show
and show hide left right button if inner-container is left 0 else..

8628162

8632560
min	max	range	min	range	max
and last thing if you re using rnd.nextdouble method and you have to generate huge amount of random numbers within a range min max and you re doing it in a loop you might want to consider taking max_value - min_value out of the loop or embedded loops

actually there s a case for saying you should never need to use strcpy or strncpy or strcat or strncat

the return properties from the base class would be the interface and this wouldn t necessarily need to be overridden in the inherited class

as of the jit yes it will probably inline either sooner or later.depending on how heavily the code is used so a function call overhead may be seen at first but when the getter setter has been called sufficiently often then it is inlined

the problem is that at the end of an edit update action set the action type on screens gets stuck in update mode and i can t switching to create mode again
