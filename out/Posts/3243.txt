1920438
serializable	deserialization	qlist	qhash
since your profiling suggests that the qhash serializable takes the most time i believe that replacing qhash with a qlist would yield a significant improvement when it comes to deserialization speed

1920438
serializable	deserialization
the qhash serializable just outputs the key value pairs but the deserialization constructs a hash data structure

1920438
qlist	qhash
even if you said that you need the fast child lookup i would recommend that you try replacing qhash with a qlist as a test

1920469
firefox	safari
jquery runs fine in safari and firefox

sorting	filtering
ie its kind of a direct one way binding and is called as and when is needed and i do all linq related sorting filtering selecting on the server

1920633

1920709
switching	screens
to answer my own question the login window has a cancel button when fast-user switching and a back button when in the login screens therefore i managed to identify between the two buttons by the following code

1920821
svg	vml
many frameworks today use vml to offer svg and canvas functionalities

uilabel	uitextview
try uitextview instead i suspect it would work like a uilabel for you

1920920

1922032
lxml	beautifulsoup
from what i can make out the two main html parsing libraries in python are lxml and beautifulsoup

lxml	beautifulsoup
when would i want to use lxml and when would i be better off using beautifulsoup

1922040
width	height
as size width height are get properties of system.drawing.image

1922064
lxml	beautifulsoup
for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml

gtk	gdk
i ve got a gtk gdk docked window that i need to give keyboard focus to so accelerator keys shortcuts work

1922130

1922227
packets	multicast

1922231
int	chars
to print the int value you ll have to write a loop to decompose the int to individual chars

1922271
pthreads	fork
on pthreads you should be able to fork a child process with access to the parent socket since forked processes inherit the parent s sockets

1922307
udp	tcp
so i ve heard some theories that udp is a security risk but i don t really understand how it s more of a risk that tcp or how a policy server doesn t relieve the risk

1922335
daemons	systemd
another suspect is some systemd monitoring daemons like monit

1922346

1922544
scrollable	panels
what matters more than the raw number of items is the ratio of items in the list to the items visible in your scrollable panels whether youâ re talking about a list box or the dropdown portion of a combo box

1922544
mouse	keyboard
there no reason not to and even with a small the number of items it benefits users using the keyboard only rather than the mouse very common for data entry

1922557
implements	extends
rather than loading an external swf i have implements info bubbles for modest maps by adding removing child objects like a textfield to my marker object which extends sprite in response to the appropriate mouse events

1922594
maven	pom.xml
now you need to add a property to your maven pom.xml called mode which should be

1922622
minimum	max
grouplayout supports this we can specify the max size in the addcomponent method alongside with minimum and preferred

1922628
public	protected
also in your above example we have to assume that the base foo method is marked as public or protected as otherwise the use of the virtual modifier is kind of pointless anyway as it won t be visible to base other classes

1922645
vcard	vcalendar
in the vcard and vcalendar formats

1922645
rfcomm	l2cap

1922740
subtract	add
then add subtract delta_x to the x-coordinate of the blue point you want the line to be perpendicular to

1922748
subtract	add
found another problem the code that calculates the boundaries subtract from the maximums but doesn t add to the minimums

1922748
min	max
it works as it should but i am confused as to why the correct values are coming out of max instead of min

1922748
min	max
it s preventing me from going off the top of the screen again from max instead of min

1922748
min	max
now the actual values are coming from max and the maximum values are coming from min

1922748
min	max
so because i had no clue here is what min and max do

1922764
comparator	comparable
you can use comparator to compare objects that do not implement comparable or enforce a different sorting strategy

1922764
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for example the string.compareto method performs case-sensitive comparison but you could provide the string.case_insensitive_order comparator which would result in case-insensitive sorting

1922774
mkmapview	mapkit
in my case i had a category for mkmapview and did not bind the mapkit framework with my target app thus the class which the category belongs to wasn t found at build time

integer	unsigned
in other words uid_t and gid_t are unsigned 32-bit integers and pid_t is a signed 32-bit integer

1922794
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
maybe you also want to use small normal large instead of ldpi mdpi hdpi because the former refer to screens size instead of density

1922805
implements	extends
i ended up looking at the log4net source and determined i can implements my own appender that extends fileappender and overrides the file property

1922824
ant	maven
besides maven ant and other build tools that provide similar functionality one would rather build interfaces in java and switch the implementations at runtime

many of the fields are volatile int and as it turns out i need to upgrade one of those to a double

1922939
pop-up	dialog

1923085
int	chars
to access a single chars of string s its s x where x is an int index

1923085
int	chars
to get the int value of a chars it is ord c where c is the chars

1923085
int	chars
to cast an int back to a chars it is chr x

1923090
ord	chr
normally just ord and add 2 and chr back y z will give you unexpected result

1923093
ord	chr
functions chr ord

1923132
draggable	droppable
the div is the actual droppable which then inserts the text of the draggable into the textarea

this makes sense but i want rails to ignore this folder and just let me use apache to render a standard directory listing here

1923527

1923572
folder	directory
if on other hand i don t use use_sudo and set var www directory ownership to myuser i still cannot deploy - some of my deployment commands set folder ownership to apache user www-data and then i get something like

1923586
int	double
this works for the string and the usual primitive value types you will encounter int decimal double bool datetime

1923588
implements	extends

1924249
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	bmp	pcx

1924254
multiplying	add
so to convert a list of digits to a number you need to reverse it in order to start at the back multiplying the digits together with the corresponding powers of ten and add the result together

squeak visualworks and gnu smalltalk provide good ffi systems and you could therefore make native uis but doing so would be comparatively arduous and complicated

1926101

in my experience changing the key for one join from a string especially chars 2 to an int will not make a measurable difference

1928208

an easy way i use to construct an equals and hashcode method is to create a tostring method that returns the values of the business key fields then use that in the equals and hashcode methods

1928255

it will be some extra cycles to parse all the class information but so long as you don t put any css info on that class it doesn t change display doesn t put you in quirks mode and doesn t get you in fights at work

1928424
button	checkbox
you still use this.checked in the attr ... code which of course won t work as this is a button now and not a checkbox anymore

all the while when the user moves his mouse i still want them to glow on mouseenter and deglow on mouseleave

1928649
post	get
post requests can provide a bit more context besides the url but for your question one could argue that they are just a more complicated variation of a get request providing some more arguments besides the ones from the url and in most cases one could turn a post request into a get request with a more elaborated url anyways

1928650
folder	directory
the .svn folder is just a hidden directory which will appear in every or at least most of the directory in your source tree

1928710

stdout	stderr
subprocess.popen has stdout and stderr arguments that can accept a file-like object

1929202
getter	setter
you are correct the issue is when ever you use albums in the first code block you are referring to this setter getter

1929212

1929298
qtoolbutton	qmainwindow
you can use a qmainwindow with a qtoolbar where you put several qtoolbutton s

imperative	declarative
the cmake language syntax isn t great but a declarative build with odd syntax beats an imperative build in python

1930142

you can get udp type behaviours over unicast tcp pubsub

1930483
udp	tcp
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

1930483
udp	tcp
if you really really really need to use udp and lazy acks and so on then you could strip out rabbitmq s tcp and probably pull that off

1930630

about the inlining the compiler will inline a lot of functions sometimes even whole classes so to speak anyway even if you don t ask it to do that

1931724
uiview	calayer
each one of those sprites would be hosted in a core animation calayer or uikit uiview and then animated about the screen

by using two dirname s and i ran realpath earlier to remove the symlink from the path

1931976
put	get
in short those environments need to be nested in arbitrary ways maintained between instances of user interaction a define x 1 typed at the scheme repl should presumably result in the user being able later to type in x and get back 1 as the value put inside objects modelling scheme functions since scheme functions close over the environments they are created in etc

1931987
cos	sin
this creates a sin cos pair per iteration

1931987

1932247
implements	extends
of course all of the classes could implements the interface but that seems redundant because the children of the abstract will inherit the interface because they extends the abstract class

1932303
mp3	wav
as long as you re doing this as a batch job rather than use lame as a library just use an existing command-line program to convert the mp3 to a temporary wav file that will be much easier

i have a row of images row1 when you click on page 2 row1 should hide using this function hide slide and after all of them have hid row2 should show using show slide but these hide and show functions occur at the same time i want the hide function to finish before the show function executes here is my code

1932349
implements	extends
provide the concrete classes that either extends from the abstract class or extends from another class and implements the interface

1932349
implements	extends
by doing #4 you ensure that all classes that implements the interface can be used - if you were to use the abstract class instead then classes that implements the interface but do not extends the abstract class cannot be used

1932349
implements	extends
the one argument for having the abstract class and the concrete classes implements the interface is that if you were to later change the concrete class to no longer extends the abstract class then you could forget to also implements the interface which in some cases could break the code without the compiler complaining

1932371
inline-functions	inlining
to make inlining possible in the absence of unusually clever compilation and linking facilities the definitionâ and not just the declarationâ of an inline-functions must be in scope â 9.2

1932754
inherited	properties
generally you don t set this directly due to what microsoft has taken to calling dependency properties which as far as i can tell are exactly the same as ambient properties which is to say that unless you set them explicitly they inherited a value from the immediate container which may in turn so inherited

post	get
this is because clicking a link is always get based so it s easier to change the search submit to get than change the links to post since that requires a fair bit of javascript

1934478
spaces	delimiter
one thing to note is that as you know while will handle spaces and for won t but by sending the output of find with null termination and setting the delimiter of read to null you can also handle newlines in filenames

1934479
put	get
simply put your css into a folder and either put images into deeper folders beneath it or put images into a parallel folder to your css and use a single .. to get to the images relatively

1934486
hide	fadeout
you can of course finetune this a bit more and make hidespopup hide the popup gradually with a slow opacity fadeout and if the users moves in while it is hiding you stop the animation and set the opacity back

1934496
gtk	gdk
there seems to be an incompatability with gtk gdk shipped with f12

1934529
button	checkbox
after checking unchecking into the new checkbox column of the dgquery rows i will click a button to save into a database only the rows i checked

1934574
put	get
it looks like you re trying to convert the string to a date the other way around so you can get the seconds from it and put it in the text area

1934579
unsigned	short
for instance sqlite_unicode.c line 1861 contains integral constants greater than 0xffff but are declared as unsigned short

1934587
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have some pages on my local machine accessed via localhost that are horribly slow to open load using ie8 but very fast using firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1934592
pascal	delphi
i learned it that way in turbo pascal but delphi and the free freepascal still support this today

1934641
accessor	properties
i am mutating my properties through a couple of accessor

1934652
put	get
i really tried to put together as much as i could for people to get rolling

1934676
unification	inference
type inference in a statically typed language refers to a system that can deduce types for program terms without programmer assistance typically using a hindley-milner-style type system and unification

1934676
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml both have type inference

1934684
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
and it will work on firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie8 ie7 and 6 are not important

1934691
touchesbegan	touchesended
this is a hack in that it s not truly handling touches touchesbegan touchesended etc. but it works

1934710
hide	show
the jquery hide show effects can be a bit strange with table components however

1934738
tinyint	varchar
phone phoneid int pk contactid int fk number varchar sortorder tinyint

1934742
getter	setter
the skill class just has some setter getter basically so i removed most of the annotations but the foreign key one

1934771
post	get
pull jquery in to your project and look at its get post methods documentation

1934777
folder	directory
you can use the full qualifying path or copy the file folder structure into the debug release directory

1934787
put	get
if you want to implement this yourself you need to decide when to get the start time--you can put a script tag at the top of the page which may execute before the content has rendered on the onload event which will wait until all images and scripts have loaded or something like the the jquery ready event which occurs when the dom is ready but doesn t wait for resources to load

1934809
vb.net	vb6
i d say vb6 is still ok for throw away prototyping and probably better than vb.net in that regard

1934814
post	get
after i get back from holiday travel i will post my code

1934832
do-while	break
the only modification i made to his code was to use a do-while loop instead so it would not skip the element where first loop break

1934837
integer	unsigned
yes 0x2284a is indeed larger than 0xffff which is the largest a 16-bit unsigned integer can contain.

1934851
post	get
when you get past the items above post another question about the details it mainly involves a couple of special controls

1934872
pascal	delphi
as for using it in delphi all i know of is how to use it in free pascal

1934885
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
so provided you haven t changed the collation of your string columns in your table from case-insensitive the default to case-sensitive the following code should work

1934908
hash	md5
so far i ve concatenated the information and computed a md5 hash of it using the .net classes i cannot use the new vista enhanced api functions as we target xp still - .net 3.5

1934914
django	turbogears
my team however is evaluating gae for use on an all-new project and our existing experience is with turbogears not django

1934930
apache	nginx
look into mod_xsendfile on apache or equivalents for nginx etc if you like to use django for authentication

1935000
mouseup	mousedown
on the mousedown event this code starts a repeating timer every 500ms in this example that is cancelled as soon as the mouseup event occurs

1935061
informix	ingres	informix	firebird	ingres	firebird	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
in this way if gae works for you great if it does not you can move your code to a different db sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql firebird db2 informix ingres and - soon - sybase and mongodb

1935112
qevent	qobject
define and implement bool mainwindow eventfilter qobject qevent

1935141
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
should work on google-chrome firefox and safari on windows too

1935145
int	double
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space

1935154
cpu	processors
on these processors non-aligned access causes a processors exception which - depending on cpu os and settings - will cause a process crash or just a lot of work for the os

1935165
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you need something that works cross-browser firefox google-chrome safari and ie you could look at firebreath

1935172
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you decide to go the plugin route firebreath is a project that lets you create a plugin that you could do rendering from that will compile to be both an npapi plugin firefox google-chrome apple safari and an activex control ie

1935178
stateless	stateful
the reason why we chose to use a stateful bean over a stateless bean was because we need to open a database connection to an unknown database and perform queries on it

1935181
findwindow	setparent
look for findwindow getclassname and setparent at

1935187
opera	firefox
after installing latest updates firefox still crashes opera keeps alive

1935188
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a website on my localhost and i m trying to get a sqldatasource to populate my gridview but it gives me the error data source name not found and no default driver specified

1935194
quicksort	heapsort
i ve checked quicksort merge sort heapsort d-ary heapsort insertion sort selection sort all do not answer the requirement which leads me to believe there s a need for a specific algorithm for arrays of length 5

1935240
memcached	apc
i am using memcached for cacheing objects but would like to add in addition an opcode accelerator like apc

1935240
memcached	apc
memcached for cacheing my objects and apc for code acceleration

1935259
webclient	webrequest
i have a few programs which use webrequest not native webclient and i see throughputs in the near mb s range with resources in the 10-20mb range coming from half way around the world

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached does not have any bytecode or php acceleration features which is why i would run it side-by-side with apc or xcache

1935341
ubuntu	linux
i am now migrating most of my apps etc to linux ubuntu 9.10 to be precise

1935342
int	double
if this reasoning is correct i wouldn t expect to see the same pattern for value-type properties int double datetime ...

1935366
post	get
2 make sure the user doesn t get to like dislike a post twice

1935429
stateless	stateful
say whatever comes to your mind in terms of security application type stateless stateful db calls or anything else

1935445
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
there are some attempts at mvc in some js frameworks mainly sproutcore and javascriptmvc

1935450
post	put
i d put indexes on the two main columns player id and post id which is critical to the next bit

1935450
post	get
i d then use a joined query whether in a stored procedure in the code or in a view to get the post information

1935487
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
on calling free you should call free once and only once on the non-null values returned from malloc calloc or strdup

1935492
int	double
why you re using a double is also a mystery unless you want to process really large files - i d be using an int or a long for that

1935521
firefox	safari
however when i run this in firefox and safari latest versions on mac the name is not returned

1935655
super	extends
here you can see the difference between super and extends

1935657
vim	emacs
although vim or emacs have steep learning curves and are not for everyone

1935658
addition	multiplication
i know that the standard construction of f is to take an irreducible polynomial f of degree n in gf p and then view elements of f as polynomials in the quotient gf p x f and i have a feeling that this is probably already the right approach since polynomial multiplication and addition should be easy to implement but i somehow fail to see how this can be actually done

1935675
super	extends
a mnemonic he uses is pecs - producer extends consumer super

1935675
super	extends
pecs - producer extends consumer super

1935680
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an asp gridview bound to an asp objectdatasource

1935689
dictionary	map
anyway the output of map prepare_menu_item _dyn_menu_items would need to be a dictionary to be passed to your views by a helpful context processor the figuring out of which it being the slightly tedious bit here i ll leave to you

1935747
webclient	webrequest
on the other hand while making a c# crawler we found the webrequest webclient api to be very heavy on cpu usage and ultimately unsuitable for crawling

1935824
width	height
when using body factory the width height radius parameters are supplied to calculate its moment of inertia only

1935824
width	height
the body class itself doesn t have width height fields or properties

1935824
width	height
the geom class rectangles circles and whatnot doesn t have width height radius fields or properties either

1935842
gridview	repeater
if you re disabling viewstate not using any postback controls within the gridview and not doing paging sorting then you re probably better off using a repeater

1935842
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
if you re using .net 3.5 you could also investigate using the listview which to me seems like a repeater gridview hybrid

1935923
post	put
so i believe you have to set that content type and put the contents of the tracking file in the body of your post

1935978
google-chrome	firefox
you cannot do a real firefox add-on preferences box nor much serious google-chrome stuff

1935994
phpunit	simpletest
if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit

1936018
subtraction	add
don t know any specific article but i think the rationale is simply that this way you get the number of resulting elements via simple subtraction 1-0 1 instead of having to add 1 there which you would forget half of the time anyway

1936024
move	drag
i move the dialog open method from draggable drag to draggable start

1936043
redmine	trac
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

1936073
addition	multiplication
addition and multiplication is relatively straightforward here

1936127
ireport	subreports
if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later

1936151
mouse	keyboard
a push button emits the signal clicked when it is activated by the mouse the spacebar or by a keyboard shortcut

1936214
folder	directory
this will copy all .jpg files from the current folder to a new folder and preserve the directory structure

1936227
width	height
note prior to iphone os 3.0 uiview instances may have a maximum height and width of 1024 x 1024

1936282
groupbox	panel	groupbox	flowlayoutpanel
other controls which by design contain other controls like tablelayoutpanel groupbox panel flowlayoutpanel etc

1936282
inherited	properties
all have a container properties you can access to get their immediate container but making sure you have the final container in their inhertance path that s not a form requires some code to walk-up the inherited tree which is demonstrated here

1936351
cvs	svn
excellent cvs and svn plugins including diff and compare a patch creation and application utility and sychronize views that make parallel development far friendlier

1936372
awt	swing
the code is based on old awt painting techniques which should not be used with swing

1936378
sum	floor
e.g. if the sum average of the saturation is less than x it s a floor plan

1936382
boost	allocator
i should add that this is an unmanaged app and needs to stay that way - it needs to be highly performant makes extensive use of templates boost custom allocator internally developed thread serialization etc

1936395
listview	gridview
note both vb and c# never show the objects or events of elements that are placed inside naming containers gridview listview

1936415
hide	show
but the splash show up even when login show and i have told the splash to hide

1936417
nltk	opennlp
you should use a natural language parsing toolkit such as opennlp or nltk

1936423
hide	show
also the load event fires before the form is show so you re calling hide before the form is show in the first place

1936427
webkit	gecko
i would like to provide several implementations of that widget - one based on gecko one on webkit and one basic on regular gtk.textview

1936430
gif	png	tiff	png
logos are more likely to be jpg png or gif floorplans are possibly going to be tiff or other lossless format - but that s no guarantee

1936440
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
if you want the calculation to happen automatically you possibly have to subclass qscriptclass and re-implement the properties accessor function

1936480
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection implements both inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged

1936546
ienumerable	iqueryable
the difference is that linq to entities uses iqueryable instead of ienumerable

1936598
public	protected
my solution is to create an interface that provides the public access points for the protected methods and then subclass the manager class and mix in that interface

1936598
public	protected
the public method will then call its super s protected method

1936616
bash	zsh
note that afaik the construct is not standard but seems to have been supported in both bash and zsh for a while now.

1936653
width	height
a common misconception is that the rectangle defined by the swf width and height is a crop boundary

1936653
width	height
this also happens when resizing a standalone flash player window in your operating system or when embedding a swf into a html page with width and height set to greater values than what was defined in the swf when publishing from flash cs3 cs4.

1936657
width	height
that tells us that we want an image width of and similarly an image height of

1936666
post	get
my code uses http get and http post and i am using a restful service on the gae

1936686
implements	extends
create a class which extends httpservlet implements the doget method move the java code from the jsp file into this method map this servlet on a certain url-pattern and your problem should disappear

1936764
ubuntu	debian
both work well but upstart is more manageable more tools but requires a newer system ubuntu fedora and debian is switching soon

1936815
post	get
you can certainly on the server render only those interface components available to the role and restrict access to the methods actions invoked by client-side javascript or via post get

1936818
width	height
i have a number of images of very differing height and width that i need to display in a web application s dialog box

1936825
virtualenv	setuptools
activepython already includes setuptools distribute actually along with pip and virtualenv

1936827
put	get
i want to fire off an asynchronous request to go get each of whatever 1 and whatever 2 from the server and put it in place of #content#

1936870
width	height
consider forcing them to thumbnail formats of fixed width height and add a link onclick to show the full image in a dialog

1936903
ienumerable	iqueryable
if the underlying object doesn t implement iqueryable then an iqueryable is returned that proxies the calls to the underlying ienumerable

1936928
int	chars
the itoa function converts an int to chars

1936944
put	get
edit it seems i did not explain the problem enough clearly but i get nice answer about the map object which easily put together what i needed

1936960
ienumerable	iqueryable
however one difference between my use-case and rob s however is that i don t return iqueryable from my model and all queries i run with .tolist after them then returning an ienumerable to ensure that my query is executed when the model s method is called

1936979
hash	salt
if you can guarantee that all users will never reuse passwords and that none of their passwords will ever be of a form that it is computationally feasible to precalculate colliding hash for then indeed the salt is little additional benefit

1937027
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can use a skew transform in firefox safari and google-chrome

1937055
stdout	stderr
if you want to capture the output of any script then on a nix-y system you can redirect stdout and stderr to a file

1937063
stdout	stderr
just redirect the subcommand s stderr to get mixed into its stdout

1937117
put	get
also i ve put a 300ms timeout because i think it s best to have this sort of thing so that if you accidentally mouseout you have a short window to get the mouse back in before it hides

1937120
jquery	scriptaculous
drag drop mechanism is relatively easy with jquery or scriptaculous we use both so i am willing to accept an answer that uses either of these two

1937144
aggregate-functions	sum
to get the benefit of a group by clause you need an aggregate-functions max sum count etc

1937185
hide	show
one is to capture the mouse moving over it make it transparent undecorated or otherwise acceptably out of the way and when the mouse moves over it show the new frame or panel and then hide that when the mouse moves out of it

1937190
maya	blender
hello i need to implement four views splitters like in maya 3ds max blender or other similar modeling tools

1937203
ssl	https
now in my implementation security is a must which means using ssl and having https based openids

1937206
textarea	textbox
i ve included code for my textbox textarea counter i put together

1937225
width	height
basically this will create a gradient box that is the same width and height as the bounding rectangle of the line you will be creating

1937242
accessor	properties
using properties accessor in initializers is considered bad form since it can cause kvo notifications to be sent out for a half-baked instance

1937263
stdout	stderr
having the console is good for debugging since it is where stdout and stderr are output to by default

1937276
virtuoso	tdb
for example you could use a store like virtuoso or a jena based store jena sdb tdb to do this basically any store that supports the sparul language or has it s own equivalent

1937303
pbkdf2	salt
it effectively just applies pbkdf2 repeatedly with the same password and salt but also an iteration count

1937316
int	double
it s getting used to thinking about the world less in terms of primitives like double int and strings and more in terms of objects that represent better abstractions that encapsulate and hide details from clients

1937327
ferret	sphinx
it seems that the community has pulled back from ferret and the two primary contenders are sphinx and apache solr

1937340
ddms	adb
look at logcat via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

1937370
postgresql	mysql
related to your database choice i d seriously look at using postgresql instead of mysql

1937370
postgresql	mysql
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

1937440
gif	png
you can t find this in png or gif files

1937515
post	get
it cuts the browser window in half horizonally and the bottom half is also divided vertically and you can see the get and post messages as well as the complete header information that is sent to the server from the browser across the internet

1937521
hash	md5
so far i ve concatenated the information and computed a md5 hash of it using the .net classes ...

1937521
hash	salt
however i d suggest using a salt which is a cryptographically random number to add to your user data then hash that data as it makes your data much safer against dictionary attacks where hackers use well know terms and variants to crack passwords

1937585
mouseover	mouseout	ready	each
used jquery in document ready function to auto-select deselect the text inside the span each time mouseover mouseout fired

1937595
daemons	launchd
it automatically launchd a daemons and the daemons forks an instance of the shell

1937638
superclass	subclassing
as i understand it subclassing is not encouraged because objective c allows a subclassing too much access to the internal workings of its superclass

1937662
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
the other is inherited virtual public then defining a static const member that points to a dynamic memory region via new malloc calloc etc would result in a double free error

1937686
bazaar	git
bazaar has a launchpad pseudo-protocol lp that able the user to operate in remote branchs without write full launchpad location i m searching a way to create my own pseudo-protocols in a way like this similar to git

1937756
portrait	landscape
in the caeagllayer docs apple states a bit clumsily that you should make the rotation within gl itself when drawing landscape content on a portrait display you should rotate the content yourself rather than using the caeagllayer transform to rotate it. they don t explain why but i ve read in multiple places about a noticeable drop in performance

1937782
mouse	keyboard
it would be really difficult to train her to aim a mouse or find keys on a keyboard

1937803
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 safari firefox google-chrome i get a perfectly good layout ujsing an outer div to enlose two boxes

1937892
opera	safari
works in ie opera safari - basically gives you firebug s functionality in any browser

1937897
width	height
now you can set the height and width properties on the form elements so they all fit on the same line and even expand to fill the available space if needed

1937903
put	get
when i put mimetype in an if statement i don t get the desired effect

1937905
verilog	vhdl
i m pretty sure that fpgas are programmed either in vhdl or verilog

1938012
rss	feed
i m trying to publish rss feed from a site

1938012
rss	feed
googling for a solution to this problem i came upon something called mrss - an extension to rss by yahoo which allows you to embed videos inside feed

1938048
unix	solaris
i m interesting in high precision time on unix particularly solaris running on a sun sparc machine

1938068
stdout	stderr
ruby has great features for working together with other unix tools through popen stdin stdout stderr argf etc. yet it seems that increasingly rubyists are opting to use ruby bindings and ruby libraries and build monolithic ruby programs

1938071
accessor	properties
properties declares accessor and or mutator methods for the given properties

1938106
profiler	aqtime
it is actually an amazingly good profiler similar to aqtime with wonderfully great profile results

1938165
int	chars
that is call the stringbuilder int constructor instead of the default constructor passing an estimate of the number of chars you plan to write

1938192
switching	screens
it would be better to use something like gnu screens to maintain a vim and bash session simultaneously and it s easier to switching than

1938226
width	height
edit and then set the size of your frame f.setsize width height

1938284
verilog	vhdl
like others have said most fpga s are designed using vhdl or verilog

1938295
int	chars
next consider the difference between a chars and an int again

1938295
int	chars
which besides the utterly absurd but innocuous semicolon is trying to sum the chars i to the int n -- that won t work

1938295
int	chars
to turn chars 7 into int 7 and so forth

1938305
lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk
a ton of languages i use now have repls ruby python scala java beanshell or jruby jython etc. c# csharp php facebook have made a repl for it smalltalk gnu gst and obviously lisp scheme

1938319
post	get
instead you post to a page and you get a http response back instead of rendering that response to the browser you get it as a javascript variable

1938347
width	height
i am looking for a single method that will grab something like the x y width height color etc

1938389
int	chars
i am reading a stream of int chars into a string array from the console with

1938400
int	chars
for more info see partition iia of the cli spec section 7.2 built-in types. can t find a link to the particular section sorry. the built-in types are bool chars object string float32 float64 int 8|16|32|64 unsigned int 8|1632|64 native int intptr native unsigned int and typedref

1938411
inherited	properties
my question is straight why there is inherited value for almost all the properties in html-css

1938411
inherited	properties
even-though all browsers support inherited for all as per my observation yes all the properties

1938411
inherited	properties
inherited properties

1938411
inherited	properties
of inherited for any css properties thatâ s

1938411
inherited	properties
that a properties should inherited its

1938411
inherited	properties
inherited for any properties other than

1938431
inherited	properties
to me this is a better phrasing rather than increase the weight of the inherited properties

1938467
firefox	safari
internet explorer does not display different fonts while firefox and safari does

1938498
firefox	safari
however when i search the page using firefox and safari on mac the other elements are found but they are not showing anywhere

1938509
keydown	keyup
i am trying to generate keyboard keydown and keyup events programmatically

1938513
getter	setter
i ve looked at other code examples and often they re exposing the variable with a getter and setter and they are also using property

1938530
free	malloc
since you re using malloc and free you should do before calling any of those functions

1938530
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
once you free a pointer allocated by malloc or realloc using the pointer value in any way is bad in particular you cannot call free on it again

versioning	upgrade
from trac versioning 0.11 an onwards the export ... index.html as answered by gregory pakosz seems to be exactly what i need however we currently work with 10.3 with no intention to upgrade due to some broken functionality with templates

1938536
width	height
in css when you set something s width or height to 100 it really only sets it to 100 of the browser window

1938539
ftp	telnet
stateful http would probably look a lot like ftp telnet or im

1938554
width	height
when you set the width or height to 100 it s 100 of the size of it s parent element

1938557
width	height
so if you want something to cover a certain amount of space create an element a that has width and height set in pixels or ems then the elements inside of it set to 100 will fill to that

1938558
nunit	mstest
not sure about mstest but i believe you could do this in nunit using parameterised tests parameterising with the implementation class and using activator.createinstance to instantiate it

1938630
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you can do this in nginx with x-accel-redirect and in lighttpd and apache with x-sendfile

1938710
google-chrome	safari
if this is a generic debugging problem you can use the web inspector in safari google-chrome

1938741
authorize.net	ccavenue
there are many providers like paypal authorize.net ccavenue 2co etc

1938844
verilog	vhdl
the syntax has been inspired by c yes but designing electronics be it using vhdl or verilog is very different from writing software

1938859
hide	show
you can check it on launch to see if ads should display have the app hide or show ads accordingly and set it to the appropriate value when the user pays to disable it

1938866
implements	sealed
i suppose you have to implements that with a custom sealed class

1938890
submit	submission
as you don t have a submit button inside your form the user will have difficulties submission it

1938923
put	get
im assuming i need to put single quotes around where the data to the query from the php variables but when i try to put them in even escaping the quotes i get parse errors from the script

1938944
post	get
as to whether you should use get or post as a form method stick to the w3cs recommendation

1938944
post	get
1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

1938944
post	get
use http get or post please also

1939087
bmp	png	bmp	pcx	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
i think input file can be any valid format and output need to be jpg pcx png tiff wmf for dpi parameter i think may be i am wrong but when i looked at pil source files i don t see one for bmp files

1939107
paramiko	pexpect
i m going to write first code for handling ssh commands on python and i did search over the stackoverflow and can see that there are several python libraries that can be used for handling commands passed through ssh like paramiko pexpect and perhaps some others

1939134
accessor	properties	getter	setter
you can create accessor getter setter for a variable by hand no need to use properties

1939134
getter	setter
you can just have and implement your getter setter by hand

1939134
accessor	properties
you can have accessor declared by compiler by defining variable as a properties and then either use synthesize to create accessor in .m file or again you declare the accessor yourself you can override default accessor that would be generated

1939134
getter	setter
you can have readwrite or readonly property - meaning either both setter and getter gets generated or only getter

1939134
getter	setter
definition of variable defining it as iboutlet for interface builder declare variables as properties so that compiler generates getter setter for you defining type of getter setter such as access method memory management and locking

1939190
librsvg	cairo
the cairo library website has examples on drawing svg using librsvg

1939190
librsvg	cairo
both the cairo and librsvg libraries should be sufficiently cross-platform to do what you need and with wxcairo it should be possible to dock them onto wxwidgets

1939239
profiling	instrumentation
secend difference is that vtune is sample profiling and aqtime is instrumentation profiling

1939239
profiling	instrumentation
with instrumentation profiling you get exactly information how many times your function was called all caller of this procedure etc with cost of inaccurate time results - instrumentation profiling change a way processor executing code so branch predictions and cache works different that in real and tested app work slow

1939247
mvp	presenter
by designing i mean the technical design when and how to use data binding when should mvc mvp be used what functionality should go into the model the view the controller presenter how can different parts of the ui best be kept in sync ... not the screen design of which button goes where or how the interaction with the user should take place

1939254
hide	show
is that there is an input field that is show at the client that i cant hide except for the first time with the line i added maybe this is about many values return from the method getelementbyid

1939299
width	height
in this page i want a window with static height and width and inside this window put a gridview

1939344
ienumerable	ilist
i dug through the mvc source code and it looks like dictionaries are supported but not models that are ienumerable or that contain nested ienumerable objects and it s inheritors like ilist

1939346
uitableview	nsindexpath
uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

i m using cassini to run an asp.net app on a machine where i don t have access to iis

1939446
folder	directory
if you clicked properties for the web project folder click the directory security tab

1939476
int	chars	hex	binary
native dlls contain binary instructions mostly unstructured data and there is in general no way to work out what the data means - for example somewhere in the dll may be the two bytes in hex 43 23 and there s no way to tell whether the program will interpret these as the chars c# or as the int 17187 or a memory address or even an instruction to feed to the cpu

1939494
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that though the overlay is opening as expected however the text is appearing under it in ie 7 while that does not happen in firefox or google-chrome obviously not

1939502
ssl	https
first you should navigate the needed https url with your browser and export the cert using ssl properties don t remember how it is done in ie but in firefox something like security view cert details save as -- still not sure because using non-english licalization any x.509 type should work

1939526
stdout	stderr
i d not use capitalized method names those are typically c# not java and use a logger mostly log4j but pick your favorite flavour instead of stdout and stderr

1939541
width	height
#main has a fixed width flexible height and its own background image and colour

1939565
width	height
the width is fixed the height should expand if the content is higher than the div but if the content is shorter it should be placed in the bottom

1939572
hide	show
don t change the src just load the images and hide show move them into the dom

1939578
folder	directory
change directory to bin folder bin debug

1939609
ubuntu	linux
i have a curl command that i can successfully run from a linux ubuntu command line that puts a file to a wiki through an api

1939671
textview	imageview
i have used to position my imageview left and for my textview but the

1939671
textview	imageview
textview comes next to the imageview and doesn t continue underneath the imageview when i have a long text

1939817
ftp	telnet
browsers do not listen on port 80 http servers do although that s just convention you could easily have an ftp or telnet server using port 80

1939825
rss	feed
rss feed and so on not sure where you got the idea to the contrary

1939826
outputstream	inputstream
if your problem is rather that the pdf is not located in the webcontent but rather located somewhere else in disk file system or even in a database then you basically need a servlet which gets an inputstream of it and writes it to the outputstream of the response

1939838
jboss	glassfish
i am not connected in any way with redhat jboss or sun glassfish my company erudis.pl is supporting and developing for both servers

1939867
hudson	phpundercontrol
i have tried cruisecontrol with phpundercontrol and hudson

1939867
ant	cruisecontrol
i went with hudson in the end because it is a lot easier to set up than cruisecontrol and works well with either ant scripts or simple bash scripts

1939898
put	get	post	put	post	get
put the page in web-inf and use requestdispatcher#forward in the servlet and make use of post instead of get

1939903
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
it seems like i ll need to modify foo to inherit from ieditableobject and inotifypropertychanged which is kind of icky from a mvvm perspective in my mind---those seem more like view-type implementation details

1939969
helpers	actioncontroller
you could also configure the rails helpers to use a specific base path by setting actioncontroller base.asset_host in your environment s configuration file

1940026
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the weird thing is that it shows up in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

1940052
getter	setter
bear in mind that this method is a getter and returns you a copy of the list of columns on the datagrid so if you manipulate its contents you have to apply those changes back to the data grid using the equivalent setter

1940101
children	parent
in this case multiple children can point at the same parent relation one-to-many which solves your problem efficiently

1940157
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1940180
switching	screens
how do i switching between multiple uiview s using one uiviewcontroller just like the iphone home screens

1940188
accessor	properties
also note that you need to implement an accessor method properties so that the production class can actually access the powerrating member of the meter class

1940208
serializable	deserialization
this avoids all the necessary serializable and deserialization that would happen if the client and server were on separate machines

1940269
ienumerable	ilist
the assert method works with any ienumerable but when both collections are of type ilist or array of something the error message thrown when the assert fails will contain the index of the first out-of-place element

1940281
put	get
the thing is that the programme requires a csv file to run i have put it in the same directory as the .jar file but when i run from the command line i just get java.lang.arrayindexoutofbounds 0 error

1940293
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1940296
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1940303
put	get
args 0 will not contain anything unless you put it on the command line and you ll get an index out of bounds error

1940323
getter	setter
as a rule of thumb always declare class members private and access them through methods getter setter in the easiest way always

1940337
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
upgrading if all the clients access the same database then the upgrade will be an all or nothing approach - you will not be able to easily migrate some users to a new versioning whilst leaving the others as they were

1940340
redhat	fedora
i know that ext3 and ext4 in redhat enterprise fedora and centos automatically checkpoint when a lvm snapshot is created

1940351
inherited	properties
i would probably do this by having the page inherited from an interface which contains the properties that you want to set

1940386
post	get
if it s okay to have an extra round trip then consider using a post and have an action which takes the post and reconstructs the url and does a redirecttoaction to an action that accepts the values via get

1940391
int	chars
you mentioned int and chars but these are not present in many languages

1940407
cvs	svn
however using a dvcs does require a little more thought and understanding and using a standard version control system like svn or cvs so you will need to consider the training overhead if moving to a dvcs or your central repository will end up full of a lot different branches people didn t realise they were creating

1940413
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
as far as writing a bytearrayoutputstream to a dataoutputstream it looks like

1940420
width	height
here the plane is put inside the container named pivot and offset by half it s width and height

1940459
inherited	properties
i want to alter properties of a model field inherited from a base class

1940493
ant	emma
it looks like a different ant target is invoking the code coverage tool emma which is then re-running your tests

1940541
width	height
you might try explicitly setting a size height and width or min-height for the content area

1940550
wxpython	pyqt
i would suggest making your life easier and picking some ui toolkit curses wxpython pyqt to handle interaction with the user

1940555
post	get
use jquery to post get ajax and return json

1940572
versioning	upgrade
for older versioning the best thing i ve seen is to either first upgrade to 2008 then port or unfortunately to port the data using scripts as you ve suggested

1940605
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream
try using an objectinputstream with a bytearrayinputstream

1940620
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream
if the byte array was serialized normally you can use a bytearrayinputstream pass that into an objectinputstream and cast the resulting object into your message class

1940700
google-chrome	firefox
this is kind of hackish but it appears to work in firefox ie and google-chrome i don t have the other browsers to test it

1940727
post	get
if i use a post i get 405 method not allowed

1940752
post	get
another option might be using solr to retrieve your thread or post with a full-text search and then using an id from there to run a mysql query that will get you everything else you need

1940809
typedef	struct
typedef struct

1940840

ubuntu	linux
i can build a reader and compile for linux ubuntu 9.10 to be precise since i am the library creator

1940880
ienumerable	ienumerator
remember that under the hood an iterator method causes a seperate class to be created that implements ienumerable and ienumerator

1940903
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
in my application i am executing 10 asynchronous nsurlconnection within an nsoperationqueue as nsinvocationoperations

1940912
portrait	landscape
the uiviewcontroller is set to return yes for portrait and landscape orientations in the -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method

1940912
portrait	landscape
the problem i m having is that if the device is already in landscape orientation and the view is added to the hierarchy at this point the view is still in portrait orientation and doesn t auto rotate

int	chars
a chars variable can be used to hold a small int value

1940932
int	chars
in c a chars literal is an int constant

1940957
stdout	stderr
the textview gets populated as the subprocess.popen object run and display their stdout and stderr to this textview

1940964
integer	unsigned
however you may notice that adding two 8-bit unsigned integer images as i did above can result in saturation where pixels exceed the value of 255 the maximum value for an 8-bit unsigned integer

1940972
getter	setter
reqdata is a javabean it has a default constructor and it has setter and getter that the marshaller finds

1940973
int	chars
you have to discern between the plain chars type and the types signed chars and unsigned chars as well signed chars and unsigned chars are ordinary int types for which the following holds c99 6.5.2 â 5

1940991
post	get
post this data to the service end point using defaulthttpclient instance and get the response stream

if names are clashing chances are that you are violating the so-called liskov substitution principles lsp

1941043
verilog	hdl
verilog hdl by samir palnitkar is an easy-to-read introductory book for verilog

1941128
int	chars
in c a chars including signed chars and unsigned chars is used to store a byte which the c standard defines as a small int at least 8 bits in size

1941128
unsigned	short
if you re storing a very large number of small numbers 0..255 for unsigned -127..127 for signed 1 in an array you may prefer to use bytes for them rather than say short ints to save space

1941317
mouseover	mouseout
you could just create each div and a add a mouseover and mouseout listener that would change the icon and back for the markers

1941335
vsto	add-in
what are the differences in excel programming between a udf macro add-in automation add-in xll or vsto

1941338
put	get
at the very least i would put an in there so you get a meaningful error

1941340
firefox	safari
i have run the code in safari and firefox both locally and on a remote server

1941351
rss	feed
i am trying to create an xml document rss feed and have worked out all the kinks in it except for one character encoding issue

1941356
fadein	fadeout
i am having a problem with gtetting fadein and fadeout effect of jquery to work properly in ie 6+7+8

1941356
firefox	safari	hide	show
the script works fine in firefox and safari fading nicely but in ie it just show hide - no fading effect at all

1941432
fadein	fadeout
the above code will fadeout to 50 the entire span tag then changes background and fadein

1941487
ubuntu	linux
i m testing this on a linux box with gcc gcc version 4.3.3 ubuntu 4.3.3-5ubuntu4

1941567
children	parent
the parent would fade but all the children elements with positive or relative positioning would remain in view

1941568
width	height
after this you can apply a width 100 and a height 100 to every div you like

1941623
disk	ram
issue - copy of the file exist two location in the ram one when read is done from disk and other when i copy it to the buffer obtained using mmap and corresponding copying overheads

my android application has to at some point switching to landscape mode with no enunciator bar to display a screens that takes up the full display height and width

1941659
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox i get a warning in ie and it doesn t work in google-chrome document.hasfocus is alway true

1941686
getter	setter
i ve looked at other code examples and often they re exposing the variable with a getter and setter and they are also using property

1941767
firefox	safari
i am biased towards selenium but it does a good job and allows you to test your applications in several browsers firefox safari ie

1941826
for-loop	arrays
the other thing i read from this is that iterating over an arrays is as efficient as a for-loop and the code is much cleaner and easier to read

1941844
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the generated code is identical to using a for-loop and it s in recommended that you use foreach if you don t need to change the arrays element in loops

1941868
httpcontext	httpmodule
update seem to have found a solution if i create a variable for the httpapplication on init of the httpmodule this all occurs in the httpcontext can be accessed from that variable

1941871
vsto	add-in
note that add-in can be written in either vba or using vsto you can also write udfs in .net but it s atypical

1941871
vsto	add-in
personally i typically use vsto for add-in and i use it as soon as i see that lots of logic procedural code is going into macros in vba

1941876
width	height
first at all a textfield is a displayobject so it have the x y width and height

1941876
inherited	properties
you can t inherited the value of a properties at runtime you inherited the properties itself but not his value if the properties is an instance properties like x

1941876
width	height
y width and height

1941938
versioning	upgrade
while versioning 1.0 of an extension may be innocuous a users browser may suggest an upgrade to versioning 1.1 which could contain malicious code which could be used to scrape information from the screen of the compromised browser

1941971
inherited	properties
all my controllers inherited from a custom controller class that i wrote it just adds some common properties to the original controller class

1942004

and cach all the links to flv files and create a rss feed with those links

1942087
post	get
here s one post that might help you get started

1942188
width	font-size
if you wrap each tag in a frex you can measure the width of the in javascript figure out the ratio of font-size to width and then adjust the font-size so that the width is where you want

1942200
width	height
you have to give the corner div s an explicit height and width based on the image you re using for the corner so that they re large enough to show their background

1942201
uitextfield	accessoryview
then you assign each uitextfield to the appropriate cell s accessoryview property

1942215
int	double
this is considered safe if you re starting with a type having a more restricted range than the one you re ending up with short to int is ok as is float to double

1942285
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the text is red in recent firefox google-chrome ie and opera browsers

1942294
int	chars
for example isalpha has a prototype with an int argument but really expects an unsigned chars

1942326
hash	md5
we then created a new table containing md5 hash of the combos plus the id of the master record they applied to

1942349
post	get
mvc applications should be built using prg post - redirect - get which means you will have 2 actions for each form one that will display the form and the second with the same name but decorated with acceptpost that will process the form and redirect the user to the appropriate location based on the result

1942356
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
to do so set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

1942371
udp	tcp
tcp or udp or another layer - the way that information is sent at the binary level and split up into usable chunks then reassembled at the destination

1942371
udp	tcp
ip - the way that information having already been split or truncated by something like tcp or udp makes its way from one place to another by routing over one or more hops

1942419
width	height
it works fine in firefox although i had to bump the width height values to make it readable

1942505
width	margin
the default width of the body element is auto which is whatever space is left once margin padding and borders have been taken into account

1942554
short	base
this is my base user control in short so on each events callback is occur

1942586
postgresql	mysql
i am trying to find some way to relate column types across the the most used databases mysql postgresql and sqlite

1942596
keyup	mousedown	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keydown	mousedown
firstly are there any full implementations out there that raise all the usual events like keypress keydown keyup mousemove mousedown vscroll hscroll vresize hresize of the window

1942613
content-disposition	content-type
and you re exactly right - you just want to set the content-type and content-disposition just setting content-disposition will work in some browsers but setting both should work in all browsers

1942613
content-disposition	content-type
the nice part with this solution is that applications that load media files directly like let s say an mp3 player in flash don t care about the content-type or content-disposition so you can still play your files in the browser and then link to download that same file

1942631
content-disposition	content-type
you just want to set the content-type and content-disposition just setting content-disposition will work in some browsers but setting both should work in all browsers

1942631
content-disposition	content-type
the nice part with this solution is that applications that load media files directly like let s say an mp3 player in flash don t care about the content-type or content-disposition so you can still play your files in the browser and then link to download that same file

1942635
onfocus	onblur
i have a couple different things going on in there to try to get it all selected like the onfocus and the onblur which don t work

1942638
caliburn	prism
as an added bonus your application will be more suited to evolve to a more architecturally-sound composition model as that provided by prism or caliburn frameworks if the application requirements arise

1942647
onclick	onfocus
onfocus should work for tabbing into the field but you would also need to capture onclick since the click moves the cursor thus de-selecting as well as selecting the field

1942658
width	height
it appears that i get complete width and height info

1942667
width	height
you need to set the frame with a positive width and height

1942706
webrat	cucumber
cucumber + rspec + rails + factor_girl + webrat .

1942719
openssl	gnutls
googling for pycurl tls error doesn t turn up many results except one that hints that pycurl for ubuntu uses gnutls instead of openssl

1942719
ftp	telnet	tftp	telnet

1942759
content-length	content-type
from the w3c spec and wikipedia the http headers are actually content-type and content-length note the uppercase second word

1942761
children	parent
if i update the parent by registering it to an event in the child it will update once for every child when it should only update once all children have updated

1942779
tinyint	boolean	postgresql	mysql
the mysql boolean alias bool alias tinyint 1 is not compatible with the postgresql boolean type

1942779
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql the serial datatype results in an integer column and this will about the same as mysql s

1942779
postgresql	mysql
semantically varchar in mysql and postgresql and char in mysql and postgresql are the same but in mysql these types have a much shorter maximum length

1942779
postgresql	mysql
in mysql these types can have a maximum of a little less than 64kb in postgresql 1gb bytes

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the bit datatypes in mysql and postgresql have roughly the same semantics but in mysql the maximum length of the bit data type is 64 bits

1942779
postgresql	mysql
i think the mysql varbinary data type is best comparable to postgresql s bytea datatype

1942779
postgresql	mysql
the float type in mysql should be equivalent to real in postgresql and real in sqlite too

post	get
it would still be interesting to see how you can query the endpoint directly through a php class - not through a get or post request - and specify what format the results should be in

1943132
put	get
i am needing to get the key from the first each and put it into the 2nd item without having to loop a second time

1943137
division	multiplication
as others said doing 64-bit arithmetic on a 32-bit machine is going to take some extra manipulation more-so if doing multiplication or division

1943140

1943248
put	get	post	put	post	get
you redirect to a get request which is correct when it comes to rest only do updates with post put only get data with get

1943248
post	get
the entry should have some text or some other input from the user so i think from a rest and rails perspective you should actually redirect it to the new method with a get request where the user can input the additional information that one will then post the input and create the entry and after redirect to the newly created entry

1943251
coalesce	isnull
i d prefer the ansi standard coalesce function but isnull is fine

1943309
put	get
i d be tempted to do one .dll or more specifically one class and maybe put all the classes in the same .dll for each of the n sets of convertible units and within each .dll convert everything via one standard unit so that you get away with running one or two of 2 x - 1 conversion calcs per conversion say converting all input in to square metres and then out again rather than coding up every possible combination

1943346
getter	setter
properties by default will create a getter with the same name as the ivar and a setter with set prepended

1943820
width	height
this video class will probably be the fluid element in your website such that by itself it has no direct height constraints but when you resize the browser it will change in width according to the flow of the web site

1943820
width	height
make sure you also remove any explicit height or width declaration within the object and embed tags that usually come with copy pasted embed code

1943820
width	height
it tells whatever else is in video class element to take full-advantage of the real estate provided by the dynamic image by forcing its width height to 100 of the video class element being adjusted by the image

1943833
post	get
i was able to get this working - i changed the return value in my post method to return

1943844
getter	setter
that s true but in java you have to add your sysbiz member variable your getter and setter and all the other logic around sysbiz anyway so an extra line in your constructor or deserialization section isn t all that much of a nuisance

1943862
temp	tmp
probably the partition that has your tmp and temp directories is nearly full and in the middle of compiling the partition gets completely full

1943862
temp	tmp
try creating a directory for yourself on some other partition that has lots of free space set your environment variables tmp and temp to point to that directory log out and log in again so your session uses those new settings and try visual studio again

1943894
temp	tmp
most likely you are running out of space quota on the drive that your temp or tmp environment variable points to

1943918
libpcap	wireshark
use wireshark which includes the libpcap packet capture library

1943929
getter	setter
if they are not then the same can be can done with methods module mapping setter names to getter names

onclick	onmousedown
use onmousedown instead of onclick

1943990
onclick	onmousedown
the button at the top uses onclick and normal execution the one below uses onmousedown and settimeout func 0

1944029
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request-uri

1944029
put	get
so to me the representation returned by get at a given uri does not necessarily have to be the same representation that was put to the given uri it just has to be consistent

1944048
put	get
if you are transforming then it would make sense that what you put is not what you get so i don t see why it is a problem

1944048
put	get
but if you put a user with certain information then when you use get then it should retrieve that person just as when i put my 4th vacation photo when i call get i expect that photo but it may be transformed by converting to a different format or have some other transforms but if i get the 5th photo instead then that is a problem

1944049
width	height
you can retrieve the movie s nominal width and height through the loader s contentloaderinfo object

createfile	deviceiocontrol
the driver needs to be loaded when the o s boots opened and closed via setupdixxx and createfile needs to respond to deviceiocontrol etc

1944147
width	height
you can specify both height and width parameters to resize -- it will not change the aspect ratio you cannot do that with gae s images module but it will ensure that each of the two dimensions is the corresponding value you specify in fact one will be exactly equal to the value you specify the other one will be

1944147
width	height
so you wouldn t use the original provided values of height and width for the resize -- you d scale them up so that none of the resulting image is wasted aka blank if i understand your requirements correctly

1944168
hide	show
i have an upper bound on the number of years which can be returned so i intend to create that many radio buttons and do a show hide based on the number of years returned

1944211
gridview	rowdatabound
i use the rowdatabound event instead of the update event of the gridview

1944212
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout is used to make your set of code to execute after a specified time period so for your requirements its better to use setinterval because that will call your function every time at a specified time interval

1944214
int	double
this will tell you if the double represents an int

1944214
int	double
disclaimer 1 i m saying int and not int as a double can represent numbers that are int but whose magnitudes are too great to store in an int

1944214
int	double
extremely large double for example are always int because they don t have enough significant digits to represent any fractional value

1944215
altera	xilinx
if yes xilinx and altera have lots of good verilog examples and other learning resources

1944254

1944288
textview	imageview
section 1 is a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview

1944291
width	height
you can preload the image into a javascript image object then check the width and height properties on that object

1944298
width	height
remove the width and height attributes and read offsetwidth and offsetheight

1944298
width	height
create a javascript image object set the src and read the width and height you don t even have to add it to the page to do this

1944298
width	height
otherwise with big images height and width would not return anything because the image was not loaded yet

1944336
int	chars
as for the userid that s embedded in the l.name column if the digits are the leading chars in the column value mysql allows you to convert to an int value much more easily

1944351
int	double
fpus are fast enough these days that doing a double -to- int conversion or a floor really isn t that slow

1944395

1944485
width	height
like a div that can be styled but has no intrinsic display of its own though it will be the width and height specified by its width and height attributes

1944514
width	height
if you need to maintain the state of the application you can for example put it in the middle of a 3x3 table with 100 width and height and then manipulate styles of all other cells

1944598
width	height
we basically filled divs by correlating it s height width pixel count with the 0 to 100 range

1944600
textarea	textbox
if you assign the retrieve value into a textarea or multiline textbox you will have the linebreaks displayed without manipulating the string

1944943
getter	setter
obs the code above does not deal with properties that have no getter or no setter or are marked as private

1944945
children	parent
however there s a down side - if you need for some reason to delete insert a parent you may need to delete insert all of its children in order as well

1944950

1945385
rtos	qnx	vxworks	qnx	vxworks	rtos
one of the reasons i suggested that it may depend on the microcontroller is that if for example it is an arm9 with a few mb of external sdram and at least say 4mb flash also usually external - memory takes up a lot of die space then you could run a heavyweight os on it such as linux wince or symbian or even a large rtos such as qnx or vxworks

1946244
submit	submission
another thought if you are submission the form via jquery and using the click handler of an anchor tag try making sure you return false or try using a submit button and catching instead

1946263

so i use textfield to display text and try to get the width and height of the text through

1946681
width	height
why nearly 20 part of the text height width are not displayed

1946968
for-loop	loops
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate

1946971
for-loop	loops
you should be right to be annoyed at not being able to use a for-loop and have to build a collection or use a lambda to build a subcollection instead just because for loops have been banned

1946974
inherited	properties
i then added the type to the inherited attribute on the register page and in the controller added a new instance of the model to the viewdata.model properties

the key thing here is setting the width and height of map_canvas in pixels so they exceed the size of your browser window

1947243
getter	setter
if you d like to do something similar in php you d have to declare a private field and write public getter and setter methods and do some sort of null checking within the setter method

1947244
put	get
i couldn t get hooked into this without digging into the source for dnn which of course is another option but the bottom line was that all i wanted to do was put another textbox right after it and make sure that the email addresses matched

1947258
rtp	rtcp	udp	rtp
rtp rtcp over udp is normally used for delivery of the media stream

1947258
rtp	rtcp
rtp rtcp therefore provides some but not all tcp functionality

1947258
udp	tcp
one main advantage to tcp though is that it traverses firewalls more easily than udp

1947282
internationalization	translation
spring supports internationalization by registering a bean with name messagesource in the configuration file but this assumes i know exactly what is the fully qualified name of the class or properties file that contained the translation strings

haskell	ocaml
it s my understanding that structural typing is used by type inferencers and the like to determine type information think haskell or ocaml while duck typing doesn t care about types per se just that the thing can handle a specific method invocation property access etc

1948139
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
use a for-loop or a foreach loops that iterates over the arrays index...same difference

1948307
width	height
with this function you can set the image width and height

1948319

1948352
solaris	sunos
all of this is for solaris though i have no idea if it s applicable to sunos

1948426
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s important that query be ienumerable instead of var or iqueryable it s important that you call asenumerable so that you get back an as we want to force the second query to use linq to objects on the results of the first linq to sql query

1948434
children	parent
con this method requires the tables to all have the same structure or at the very least the parent must have only the common elements between all the children

1948454
onkeyup	onblur
a simple onblur onkeyup etc won t work for what you want so just combine them

1948499
associativity	operator-precedence
i m not sure exactly what you re looking for but i find it helpful to remember the operator-precedence and associativity rules

1948532
hex	binary
walsh says and check for whitespace in the file tip for binary data don t include a closing tag in your script as well as a byte order mark at the beginning of your file use a hex editor like pspad for this

i also noticed when looking at this forum and other blogs and such that most people are using nunit xunit or mbunit

1948596
nunit	typemock	nunit	mstest	mstest	typemock
to this end i ve been looking online to come up with the right infrastructure for both a build server and dev machines...i was looking at the typemock website as i ve heard great things about their mocking framework and noticed that it seems like they promote mstest and even have some links of people moving to mstest from nunit

1948638
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
what i have found over my 12 years of developing front-end interfaces is you d be better off to start development on ie and test for bugs on firefox opera safari and google-chrome opposed to going about it the other way around

1948649
maven	pom.xml
it was quite easy to download and launch the selenium-server.jar add the selenium-java-client-driver to my existing eclipse maven pom.xml driver project

the details are displayed in the tabitem using a contentcontrol

1948731
pull	push
some of the decision is just down to whether you want a push pull system though

1948762
onresume	onpause
you should try cleaning up on onpause and then onresume re-instate the stuff you need

1948763
versioning	upgrade
however some changes were made to the data access application block in versioning 3.1 may 2007 which may affect applications written for earlier versioning if you upgrade to the current versioning of enterprise library

1948765
mouse	keyboard
i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

1948782
put	get
an alternative way to solve the problem is to use an extra argument in put and get which changes the delimeter

1948827
int	boolean
also i d prefer to leave the columns as boolean bit types and not change them to int types

1948881
trie	tree	integer	radix
a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer

1948893
yacc	bison
the simplest parser generator is yacc or bison

1948893
yacc	bison
bison is just a harry yacc ie it has more options

1948927
getter	setter
i agree that getter setter are verbose

1948957
yacc	bison
keep in mind that with yacc or bison you will have to write a grammar in their language

1949010
bash	subshell
sometimes that is appropriate - but most often it is stuff that a c shell programmer wrote not realizing that the notation means run a subshell in bourne shell and derivatives - such as korn shell the posix-compliant shells and bash

1949054
button	checkbox
i also have a update button and when the user clicks it i want to insert rows into my table with the same value for the dropdown and checkbox fields in all the rows but i want different values for each row depending on the list items that were selected

1949066
textview	imageview
the app runs once fills the information on the screen layouts listviews textview imageview etc and user reads the information

1949068
try-catch	exception-handling
wrap the call that is throwing argumentexception with a try-catch exception-handling ex and step into the exception-handling block to see the raw exception-handling

1949221
bazaar	git
i generally use git but some people find mercurial a bit simpler to use there are lots of others like subversion bazaar and so on but git and mercurial are the most popular distributed revision control systems which make it easier to just version control a directory on your disk without setting up a server

1949228
rss	feed
i m planning a web application using django and it s based on a big pile of data from rss feed

1949251
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
with that approach you can do things like cache the objects using a sqldependency or sqlcachedependency to avoid round-trips

1949267
serializable	deserialization
you could use serializable into a memory stream and deserialization back to an instance

1949286
openssl	gnutls
gnutls and openssl being two of them

1949305
sorting	filtering
i would use the built-in capabilities of linq to xml to handle filtering sorting

1949324
integer	unsigned
of course if num is of an unsigned type or one of the c99 fixed-width integer types int8_t and so on which are required to be 2 s complement then this isn t an issue

1949351
getter	setter
i realise using getter setter can be useful when you need to further processing or need to be notified of when the property is changed like so

1949361
getter	setter
depending on your language you should prefer getter setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them

1949363
getter	setter
however there are often benefits when using getter and setter related to versioning and api compatibility

1949368
strcpy	strncpy
not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

1949371
getter	setter
as a side note you can start with a public var and if necessary convert it to a getter setter later in code

1949377
firefox	safari
it works both in ie and firefox and the last time i checked safari too

1949390
hide	show
this would only stop average users who run windows with the defaults hide system files and don t have show hidden files checked from copying the file and including the volume id disk size and volume name also in your check would insist that it is only allowed to a mirrored device

1949432
getter	setter
getter and setter also give you more control over what values the variable can be set to

1949434
post	get
it s quite simple to do a get or post for the template and then do another get post for your data

1949448
getter	setter
getter and setter cost more in most languages but they buy you flexibility down the road

1949448
getter	setter
in some languages you can t change a public to a getter setter without changing the code in the callers because the use syntax changes

1949448
getter	setter
getter and setter let you do parameter validation

1949448
getter	setter
but i use getter and setter only when i need them right away or when i m pretty sure i m going to need the flexibility

1949457
children	parent
the children of that parent

1949471
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have an uitableview and i did put an uisearchbar on it

1949471
uitableview	uisearchbar
what i want to achieve is that if a user is going to scroll i want the uisearchbar element to be fixed on the top plus i want the first row of the uitableview fixed as well

1949471
put	get	uitableview	uisearchbar
one way to get the uisearchbar element fixed could be if i put an uiview under both elements uitableview and uisearchbar and put those two consecutively among themselves just a thought of me don t know if this actually is working

1949493
jar	war
something like a jar hidden inside a war or something which could have been build with an earlier version of the class

1949511
bitwise-and	modulo	division	modulo
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

1949597
move	drag
so for example if the scene is one large square and the mouse is located in the center of the square the square should move in the direction of the mouse drag while the center of the square remains under the mouse

1949626
portrait	landscape
whether the iphone is in portrait or landscape the screen coordinates don t change so you ll need to adjust for that in your app

1949663
versioning	upgrade
if you port your app to another brand of rdbms or even if you upgrade to a newer versioning of mysql that may implement storage differently the rows could come back in some other order

1949666
innodb	myisam
per this thread default sort is insert order for myisam and primary key ascending for innodb

1949678
outputstream	inputstream
you ll need to create a servlet which listens on this url and get the image as an inputstream from the local disk file system by fileinputstream or from the database by resultset#getbinarystream and writes it to the outputstream of the response along with a correct set of response headers with at least content-type

1949678
outputstream	inputstream
just get it as an inputstream and write it the usual java io way to the outputstream of the response

1949680
xfce	gnome
exo-open in xfce see the comments in the gnome link

1949680
kde	gnome
xdg-open may work in many environments reputedly works in kde see the comments in the gnome link

1949739
width	height
additionally don t forget to change width height values above to whatever the new values should be

1949741
apache	lighttpd
i don t really have an answer for you but after some very basic inspection i can tell you that staging apache is returning a 200 with the entire file and stream29l lighttpd is returning a 206 with a partial file

1949749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox 3.0 and all version of ie possibly other browsers though it does not happen in some browsers i ve tested firefox 3.5 safari google-chrome

1949755
jboss	glassfish
if you want to run in container tests then you could indeed use an embedded container and my current preference goes to glassfish v3 even for java ee 5 i may be wrong but i m pretty disappointed by the starting time of the latest jboss releases so it isn t getting much of my attention

1949809
jmonkeyengine	ardor3d
ardor3d or jmonkeyengine for a higher level 3d library

1949853
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are the new boys on the distributed version control scene but all of them are mainly used in a nix environment

1949853
cvs	svn
so you may wantr to consider one of the standard workhorses cvs or svn

1949858
folder	directory
git has a very clean directory structure with all source control meta data in one folder

1949925
folder	directory
stop your service delete the artifact directory folder and restart your service

1949937
hide	show
this way you have the images and locations in the master page and can hide and show the appropriate one based on the theme

1950015
mouse	keyboard
once you re thinking of the model as a separate entity from the view it should be easier to imagine how player interactions through mouse and keyboard could trigger commands from controller to make changes to the model and notify the view of those changes

1950028
floating-point	fractions
a floating-point number specifies a fractions of the frame s height

1950098
for-loop	loops
python s iterators are great and all but sometimes i really do want a c-style for-loop - not a foreach loops

1950114
flymake	flyspell
this code provides functionality which jumps you to the next error and if it s a flymake error displays information for it if it s a flyspell error it corrects it for you

1950115
scheme	racket
if you re finding it difficult you might want to try standard ml or racket formerly called plt scheme or drscheme

1950126
udp	tcp
the app streams real-time audio data using a preexisting tcp protocol so switching to udp isn t an option

1950133
filtering	grouping
be aware that this may break queries that try to filtering grouping on the new alias wrapper i believe linq will complain that it can t find a sql mapping

1950133
accessor	properties
the properties itself will work fine as an accessor but if you need to perform lookups on the alias then you will likely need another getuserbyalias helper method in mydatacontext one which can perform the real query on aliasinternal

1950172
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
any subclassing of uiviewcontroller will inherited this properties

1950347
rss	feed
i have an iphone app where i m displaying a tableview that s loaded from an rss feed

1950367
kde	gnome
it attempts to define some basic functionality that will work in all unix-like desktops such as gnome and kde

1950367
pthreads	fork
doing fork and calling system instead of exec is undefined behavior on pthreads so i don t recommend that

1950384
hide	show
then every time someone clicks that div again it toggles hide show

1950394
hide	show
alternatively you could use hide or show instead of toggle

1950397
post	get
updatepanel s don t really help minimize the ajax footprint because again it post back the entire viewstate and all areas get refreshed

1950461
public	protected
this includes public protected default package access and private fields but excludes inherited fields

1950472
getter	setter
i suggest you use the setter getter methods instead of accessing the fields directly

1950472
getter	setter
tools like bean copy utils also use getter setter that s why they work only on beans which have getter setter that conform to the naming conventions

1950482
clang	llvm
first off â â you re referring to clang 1.0 based on llvm 2.6

1950482
clang	llvm
there is no clang 2.6 only a clang 1.0 based on llvm 2.6

1950482
clang	llvm
the clang issued with llvm 2.6 is the same as the one with xcode 3.2

1950482
clang	llvm
see wikipedia on october 23 2009 clang 1.0 was released along with llvm 2.6 for the first time

1950664
allegro	sdl
there s also allegro if you re not a fan of sdl

1950702
subtract	add
if you know the user s offset-from-utc in seconds you can just add subtract that from the time_t and pass the result to gmtime_r

1950747
portrait	landscape
your y coordinates are negative because you are doing a 90 degree rotation of the 320x480 screen probably because you re playing in landscape and not portrait

1950802
pull	push
subsequent push pull operations will presumably be less traffic-hungry

1950811
min	max
if you normalized your orderstatus.status column to a separate table say order_status_code with two columns - code and description you d have an easier time because assuming the use of an integer based key you could use max or min depending on how the column was setup to get the highest status for a given order

1950817
debian	linux
i usually use geany or hi-tide under debian gnu linux for firmware development mainly c but also reading old assembler

1950829
csv	tsv
in csv or tsv etc

1950848
folder	directory
create a new android project from the samples apidemos directory in any of the platform-version folder inside the sdk

1950852
put	get
includes a_id and a_name but there values from the get lost in the associative array so just put them back in with new unique names

1950860
folder	directory
0744 isn t a common mode for force directory mode probably a typo usually if you give read permissions to folder you want to give flag the execution bit too use 755 or 750 or 700

1950921
inherited	subclassing
if b inherited from is a subclassing of a that means an instance of b can be stored in a variable of type a and its virtual methods will call those of class b

1950953
subtract	add
add the squares don t subtract them

1950977
put	get
put your project online enable forums get it linked from at least one website so it appears in google and i guarantee that within a few days a forum thread will appear with ata in the subject alpha testers anonymous

1950977
client-side	server-side
you ll have to be more specific on what your project will do where the work comes from what processing needs to be done server-side what language runtime library your client-side app uses etc

1950981
ubuntu	linux
compiled with -i9 using gcc 4.4.1 running on an intel r atom tm cpu n270 1.60ghz 800 mhz and presumably only one core given the program in 32 bit ubuntu linux

1951023
integer	unsigned
the problem is caused by the fact that you are supplying the timeout argument as a signed integer value which has to be converted to an unsigned one for the first version of the function since the timeout parameter is declared as uint

1951081

1955593
nsis	uninstaller
also to check for your file specifically see if there s a plugin for nsis that can calculate checksums and compare that on uninstaller

1955620
class-method	delegation
i then began using class-method which i believe ruled out the possibility of using the delegation methods

1955623
inherited	properties
i am not currently planning on using inherited for conveying semantics to the said messages but rather simple properties

1955628
width	height
the playarea div in this case will not automatically expand in width height to fit the elements within and since it has no height defined it is treated as not taking up any room which means that the tag will appear at the same location as the div

1955642
hide	show
do you want to render different templates for the different users or just have conditionals in the template to hide show parts of it depending on the user s access levels

1955655
srp	ocp	srp	principles	ocp	principles
practically all the solid patterns apply here but particularly the single responsibility principles srp and open closed principles ocp

1955682
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol with two tabitem s and a listbox which is common to both tabs

1955706
keystore	jks
default jks a proprietary keystore type format

1955716
ivar	subclassing
in my uiimageview subclassing i have a uibutton ivar object added

1955738
put	get
this allows you to put them somewhere different from the pages that get directly accessed

1955763
for-loop	loops
this means that that loops is very likely to change the value of i in a completely different for-loop in another function and you ll have absoutely no idea what s going on

1955768
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller inside

1955811
put	get
however when i try to put it into an automator workflow mac os x i get this error

1955852
keystore	jks
sun s default jks keystore uses a proprietary algorithm primarily to get around exporting restrictions on standard algorithms

1955852
hash	salt
this is how the algorithm works for key protection p - user password s - random salt x - xor key p - to-be-protected key y - protected key r - what gets stored in the keystore step 1 take the user s password append a random salt of fixed size to it and hash it d1 digest p s store d1 in x

1955854
ubuntu	linux
the best 2 ways to go are os x and linux i use ubuntu just because it s the nicest package that i ve found there will no doubt be a variety of opinons on this.

1955854
textmate	gedit
i like textmate like everyone else for osx and gedit with gedit-mate

1955886
width	height
if width of shape is smaller than 5 and height of shape is smaller than 5 delete the shape

1955923
getter	setter
the dependencyproperty system operates independently of the c# property getter and setter which are provided as a convienience to the programmer

1955931
pentaho	olap
since you re using mysql you could take a look at pentaho mondrian which is an open source olap solution that supports mysql

1955940
expander	itemscontrol
use an itemscontrol and have your itemtemplate include an expander

1955940
expander	itemscontrol
the content of the expander would be another itemscontrol bound to the child items and with its itemtemplate set to the appropriate detail view

1955958
lisp	smalltalk
io is a prototype-based programming language inspired by smalltalk all values are objects all messages are dynamic self prototype-based newtonscript differential inheritance act1 actors and futures for concurrency lisp code is a runtime inspectable modifiable tree and lua small embeddable

1955958
lisp	smalltalk
ioke is a prototype-based programming language that is inspired by io smalltalk lisp and ruby

1956007
vb.net	vb6
i have to upgrade a legacy vb6 app to vb.net

1956011
public	protected
however if i change the access modifier on that property from protected internal to public it gets populated fine which tells me that it s not any obvious problem with the mapping itself

1956037
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net don t have a lot in common beyond similar syntax and a similar sounding name

1956082
centos	linux
note if you have no idea what that means then the answer is probably yes since utf-8 has been the default for most linux distributions for several years now and indeed redhat and thus centos were the very first to make the switch

1956082
ubuntu	debian
since this patch is already from 2005 i assume that it is also used in centos. this patch is also used in mac osx debian ubuntu ... pretty much nobody uses gnu grep as distributed by gnu

1956088
ready	each
since git push does not merge you could have each developer push to a branch on the central repository and then when you re ready log on to the machine that hosts the central repo and merge them with

1956096
uploadify	swfupload
if you really need to customize the look and feel of your fields try a flash based uploader like swfupload or uploadify

1956117
hide	show
this way you can pass arguments to your program or batch and decide to show or hide the executing console

1956134
post	get
you can get fancy by using a standard format like json yaml or xml within each post file and even fancier by requesting these with ajax calls in mostly client side code

1956134
rss	feed
it also builds an rss feed

1956142
stdout	stderr
also preferably i don t want to create a subprocess and read its stdout and stderr in separate thread

1956147
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
synchronous nsurlconnection work great inside of an nsoperation - and because you are using them synchronously an nsoperationqueue handed the nsoperation will automatically use a background thread to run them you have to do extra work otherwise

1956150
hash	md5
obviously this may cause collisions but the small number of machines 100 means this is unlikely and using the truncated output of a cryptographic hash say md5 makes this even less so

1956156
switching	screens
i m trying to play two videos using the mpmovieplayercontroller class and allow the user to switching between the two videos by swiping their finger across the screens

1956188
sorting	grouping
i d like to do all joins grouping sorting and advanced data manipulation using linq

1956342
queue	fifo
given only fifo support for a given single queue you will of course have to introduce either multiple queue an intermediary or have a more complex consumer

1956349
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox looks fine but in internet explorer 6 and 7 looks too tall

1956363
user-controls	tabcontrol
in this case if you only want access to a specific control on the user-controls s parent form like a tabcontrol you might consider that you want to make the property you set of type tabcontrol rather than form the same coding technique shown above can be used in the user-controls

1956376
int	chars
but int and chars variables can

1956377
for-loop	loops
unless you need to access its value after the for-loop ends leave the variable inside loops it will be closer to the code that uses it your code will be more readable and its scope will be bounded by loops itself your code will be more elegant and less bug-prone

1956387
int	chars
so for example if sp represents the memory address of the top of the stack declaring chars x results in and int x results in on a 32 bit machine

1956392
int	chars
int and chars can t change either

1956407
stdout	stderr
i would like to log the output of both stdout and stderr from a python script

1956407
stdout	stderr
also it is possible to get stdout and stderr like this

1956434
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
primitive values such as int boolean chars floats and double allow the actual value in memory to be changed

1956447
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
the same is true for all primitive types boolean byte chars short int long float and double

1956518
put	get
2 - i couldn t grasp what exactly the put and get functions do

1956525
post	get
i have a jquery ajax request in my website page and every page i need to post this request to server to get the status

1956631
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has explain analyze dunno about mysql you ll probably find you need to index columns that participate in where and join not the ones that form the result set

1956741
nsurl	nsdata
nsdata imgdata nsdata datawithcontentsofurl nsurl urlwithstring

1956749
width	height
you can t use fadeout because it sets the div style to display none and thus the div has a zero height and width making the scrollto plugin mess up pretty bad

1956784
mouse	keyboard
you can do application wide keyboard and mouse handling but you have very few options if your application is not the foreground application

1956838
width	height
i am facing a problem when gets height width of textview

1956845
terminate	timeout
for using subprocess please check this post python popen and select - waiting for a process to terminate or a timeout

1956899
superclass	subclassing
i m not going to get into detail about superclass and subclassing because other people have explained it already

1956914
dictionary	map
if you only need a dictionary like functionality go with a map for something more complex consider a database

1956968
vb.net	vb6
write code in vb6 to do what you need call it from c# vb.net

1957030
firefox	safari
i have tried using javascript to save the hash values in cookies but that isnt working with firefox and its too slow in safari the html will show first so one has to refresh the page a second time for the correct content to be shown

1957059
submit	submission
when you submit the form form method state method post so by submission to itself request_method will be post

1957091
post	get
it will equal post if they get to the page after submitting a form

1957095
post	get
get and post are the http verb s used to access the page

1957095
post	get
usually we use post to send user data back to the server and use get to well get data from the server

1957095
post	get
so asking for an index.html is a get request but posting data to something like a comment form sending data back to the server uses post

1957095
post	get
try this link to learn more about get and post

1957114
free	malloc
only free pointers obtained from malloc never adjust them prior to that

1957116
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc realloc or valloc function or if the space is deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behaviour is undefined

1957118
versioning	upgrade
3- then i build a new versioning of this program and upgrade it

1957119
free	malloc
of course other implementation of malloc free can choose other way to achieve this

1957119
free	malloc
but they generally don t support to free on a different pointer than what was returned by malloc or equivalent function

1957173
post	get
there are a bunch such as head get post delete and i believe a few more

1957185
range	max	range	min	min	max
it is doing a range select on city_id it will scan every row with a city_id value between the min and max values in your in clause

1957192
subtraction	add
if x2 is negative due to the above subtraction add n to it

1957245
mouseover	mouseleave
like when you want to hide a mouseover menu not exactly at the time when a mouseleave it but a few milliseconds later

1957245
hide	show
for example you have a function that show and hide a menu

1957251
super	self
why there is also no super instance with typical usage super self .__init__

1957251
super	self
technically you can obtain the type of an object from the object itself so the current strategy super classtype self .__init__ is kind of redundant

1957267
super	implements
i think super was implements to be explicit redundant just to be on the safe side and keep the logic involved as simple as possible no sugar or deep logic to find the parent

1957271
mouseover	mouseout
using console.log or some other logging method you should be able to determine if the mouseout is firing before the mouseover is finished adding content or if there is another problem

1957286
subtract	add
by changing the texture combiner state you can add subtract interpolate or take dot products of your texture samples instead

1957310
django-filter	django-haystack
another option separate from django-haystack and searching is django-filter by alex gaynor it allows you to filter fields based on the contents of the model and not on an index

1957314
getter	setter
getter and setter are created manually

1957314
getter	setter
the getter setter then just access that array with the appropriate key

1957437
hide	show
for example i have some general information about contacts and i want to show each row has extra information like activity for that contact and ability to hide or show extra information

1957498
hide	show
now i want to hide or show with my condition a divider when my app run

1957543
google-chrome	safari
works in ie8 ff3 but not ie7 or google-chrome webkit so probably safari too

1957571
google-chrome	firefox
personally i don t like web applications that requires a lot of user interaction there are some of them that is a pleasure to use but i think it is very easy to do it the wrong way and end up having a buggy or not so responsive application probably because of the incompatibilities in browsers i have ie firefox and google-chrome installed on my computer and i use one for some websites because they run faster on it and others for other sites because web pages show up correctly only on them

1957603
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring and nsmutablestring are part of what s called a class cluster - when you create or modify a string it may or may not be an instance of the class you re expecting

1957642
nunit	mstest
as much as the console runner is nice i enjoy the instant red green view of a graphical runner such as nunit or mstest for quickly glancing at broken tests

1957647
printf	getchar
i can only use if-else while simple math operators and printf getchar scanf - no functions arrays or pointers

1957656
public	protected
use exceptions when checking parameters passed to public or protected methods and constructors

1957717
getter	setter
this is an over-simplified example as the property simply wraps the private field by returning it in the getter and setting it in the setter

1957720
getter	setter
a property can have a setter or a getter or both and you can also specify different accessibility level for each

1957721
getter	setter
also if you use a reflection you would have to lookup for property setter and getter for the first example line and for the second you would need to directly retrieve a member variable

1957724
getter	setter
the main difference is that if you later need to add logic into your getter or setter and other dlls have already been compiled against yours you can easily change

1957741
hide	show
you can hide some portions using css if you don t want and show the others

1957786
mathml	tex
if you want typesetting then use either tex or presentational mathml as they have well-developed toolkits

1957796
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram shoud be in uml notation see this the last is uml notation

1957820
super	self
super classtype self .__init__ is not redundant in a cooperative multiple inheritance scheme -- classtype is not necessarily the type of self but the class from which you want to do the cooperative call to __init__

1957820
super	self
if you now instantiate you see that the class type is not redundant -- super self .__init__ inside b.__init__ would not really work

1957828
entity-relationship	diagram
when all you want is an entity-relationship diagram

1957833
entity-relationship	diagram
power designer - my preferred tool for working with entity-relationship diagram

1957847
width	height
i am trying to fix the height and width of image in pdf generated using fop 0.95

1957862
stdout	fflush
you should add an fflush stdout after this to make sure the output appears before scanf is called

1957876
erd	diagram
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data models

1957888
ubuntu	linux
i am ofcourse using linux ubuntu and i managed to get the source code for blender

1957893
jstl	taglib
you can use taglib such as jstl to control the flow in the jsp page and you can use el to access the back-end data

1957942
width	height
just width and height are enough

1957952
width	height
by default fop keeps the aspect ratio regardless of the image height and width specified

1957952
width	height
this will display your image.png image with height 2.00in and width 2.00in

1957987
serializable	deserialization
i m using serializable and deserialization in c# for my project which is a class

1958036
post	get
when i do a to_json on post object i get following

1958038
trie	dawg
it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient

1958066
user-controls	elementhost
and the user-controls is hosted on winform using elementhost

1958109
post	get
alternatively if you post the problem youâ re trying to solve rather than discussing issues with a solution youâ ve decided upon you might get more traction

1958132
superclass	subclassing
before_filter in your subclassing doesn t override the same call in the superclass but they stack after each other instead

1958133
children	parent
i have a data such that there are many parent each with 0-n children where each child can have 0-n nodes

1958133
children	parent
from any given node down children then up to the root up to the specific parent

1958138
postgresql	mysql
there is one dbd for mysql another one for postgresql etc

1958147
subtraction	addition
all these come with the cost of a simple subtraction addition which is really irrelevant

1958208
post	get
sounds like you are looking to do a post redirect get

1958208
post	get
advantages of redirecting a post to a get request are

1958216
public	protected
i ve been working with the prototype library for some time now and occasionally find myself wishing i had multiple access levels public private and protected

1958216
public	protected
i may post it later but in the mean time does anyone have suggestions for merging the two types of public methods into one useful type or on how to implement protected members

1958286
hide	show
therefore i want to take the headers list and check which header is visible and want to accordingly show or hide my value

1958288
post	get
i am trying to make http get post connections

1958324
children	parent
each file contains a parent and at least 4 children

1958324
children	parent
parent are called genre 1 2 3 4 and the children are artist name etc

1958328
btrieve	pervasive
it s a free download from pervasive the makers of btrieve which is what i m assuming your .btr files are

1958362
queue	fifo
waiting threads are put in a nominally fifo queue and while they re triggered with pulse they aren t fully runnable until the lock is relinquished again in part due to memory barriers

1958366
google-chrome	safari
for some reason when you apply a background image to a tr in safari google-chrome it renders it as if the rule applies to every td

1958378
gif	png
one common cause of oom while using image resources is when one is decompressing jpg png gif images with really high resolutions

1958382
valgrind	callgrind
cachegrind and callgrind are parts of the latest version 3.5 of valgrind

1958382
valgrind	callgrind
run valgrind --help it shows you how to use callgrind functionality

1958434
put	get	post	put	post	get
these names correspond to the http method names delete get post and put

1958480
uitableview	uisearchbar
as for now i have implemented this search elimination using uisearchbar and results appears at a uitableview

1958563
int	boolean
if you put the argument of the while loop in a separate variable boolean bool true the compiler will tell you to return an int in this method

1958684
set	bag
i believe that i need to use a set as opposed to a bag because my collections contain unique items

1958690
apache	lighttpd
if you don t have access to your apache lighttpd configuration file a little hack that may work is putting the script in

1958723
int	double
change your data type to float or double and write all of your numbers as 100.0 for example - otherwise it will be treated as an int

1958807
onmousemove	onmouseover
replaced onmouseout and onmouseover with the more widely supported onmousemove event

1958854
wildfly	weblogic
if you ever want to go ejb or jpa then you d like to pick another wildfly tomee payara liberty weblogic etc

1958854
wildfly	weblogic
wildfly tomee payara liberty weblogic etc as being a complete java ee implementation already ships with jsf and ejb and jpa etc out the box

1958874
freemarker	velocity
some will let you use something else too velocity freemarker etc.

1958874
getter	setter
basically it means that you are using getter and setter or some alternatives and you are following some rules

1958881
x86	64bit
the problem is that createenvironmentblock using the token of the user-session application creates a block with programw6432 c program files x86 which is a problem for 64bit applications

1958901
redmine	trac
grab redmine or trac and take on the challenge of getting everyone to standardize

1958951
width	margin
it looks like i can t set left margin to be less then 42pt width

1958951
width	height
page width and height are 6x9 in

1958997
public	protected
this way only the integrity of the public key needs to be protected

1959001
freemarker	velocity
there are few alternatives you may try like freemarker and velocity

1959011
typedef	typename
the key is the typename part of the typedef

1959031
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also this currently works best in ie google-chrome and safari - there is an issue with firefox that i am working out separately

1959068
ogre	irrlicht
see some examples using ogre and irrlicht here

1959078
onchange	onfocus	onclick	onfocus	onclick	onchange
don t use js to change the content onload rather do it only during user-controlled events onclick onchange onfocus etc

1959089
put	get
you can get round this by either using badd and then bufdo as above or by doing something like this put it in your vimrc

1959144
scrollable	panels
the panels has a few text fields and a scrollable panels below in a verticalpanel

1959144
scrollable	panels
what i d like to do is to make the scrollable panels with uibinder and then add that to a verticalpanel below is an example i created to illustrate this

1959148
google-chrome	firefox
this is an html5 api and it ll work on webkit-derivatives google-chrome and firefox 3.5 for now

1959209
min	max
this is achieved with an aggregate function like min max or group_concat

1959241
int	double
when you use f make sure that the argument is a float or double not an int

1959310
mapquest	directions
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate

1959333
pop-up	dialog
i pop-up other dialog boxes but i also want to be able to get back to the parent app dialog

1959336
opera	firefox
i don t need markup for ie firefox opera etc

1959348
put	get
this is a c# example. in this property get all that customer s orders put them in list object maintain it in a private variable in case the property is called again and return that list object

1959348
inherited	properties
then create an orders class that inherited from to replace your basic and add the properties firstorder

1959353
implements	extends
one could extends button and implements this interface to get a simple button renderer

1959388
inherited	subclassing
your subclassing of str does not override format so when you call format on one of its instances it just uses the one inherited from str which uses self s intrinsic value as str the string form of whatever you passed to offset

1959437
keydown	keyup
the ev_key key_menu 1 is keydown event and the ev_key key_menu 0 is the corresponding keyup event

1959495
getter	setter
this object may be composed of getter and setter but it is a model of a student and would thus be extremely useful in a database system

1959495
entity-relationship	diagram
to further understand this i recommend reading on entity-relationship diagram

1959517
stateless	stateful
web-servers are stateless web-application are stateful -- this leads to dependance on a data-layer to persist state

1959558
pop-up	dialog
so when you click on it pop-up a dialog box and you can fill out information

1959568
jobs	cron
it is likely that your system is using it to run hourly daily etc. cron jobs just by dropping scripts into directories such as etc cron.hourly

1959588
width	height
make sure you set all its properties x y width height before each sdl function that uses the rectangle

1959615
clang	llvm
the __llvm__ and __clang__ macros are the official way to check for an llvm compiler llvm-gcc or clang or clang respectively

1959633
width	height
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

1959688
anjuta	kdevelop
other solution is used ide like netbeans eclipse anjuta kdevelop .

1959750
airplane	roaming
your best option in this case is probably to present an alert suggesting that the user enable airplane mode or turn off data roaming

1959795
innodb	myisam
your server tuning will now necessarily be a compromise - you cannot use all the memory for either myisam or innodb nb this does not apply if they are on different servers

1959795
innodb	myisam
then you can pretty much forget about myisam and not devote resources to it and get the full benefits of using innodb

1959795
innodb	myisam
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1959816
joystick	keyboard	hid	keyboard	hid	joystick
also there s a usb hid pos point of sale mode that some higher-end usb scanners support that gives you an even greater degree of flexibility with the added bonus of driver free installation it looks like a generic hid device to the system like a joystick or keyboard but with 2-way comm ability

1959828
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
an approach i like to use is synchronous nsurlconnection calls inside of an nsoperation which in turn is managed by an nsoperationqueue

1959841
memset	calloc
i realize that the gdb output makes no sense because you do verify it s a null terminated strings but i ve had a lot of string.h bizarre problems go away with a memset bzero calloc or whatever you want to use

1959842
switching	screens
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

1959842
switching	screens
when each state handler becomes longer than a couple of screens split each event out in a separate function similar to the way that the state switching was split

1959842
switching	screens
i have used state event tables in the past but i have to say that for the simplest cases i do not find them necessary and i prefer the clarity and readability of the switching statement even if it does extend past one screens full

1959853
trie	dawg
if you need alphabetical order use a trie or a dawg like i recommended in your last question

if you get frustrated because something works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie this will happen a lot don t give up

1959968
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for me i develop in firefox then make sure that things are solid on google-chrome safari

opera	firefox
various versions of firefox opera and

1960000
min	max
so its advantage for x true wrt the expression form is 4.8 to 8.1 nanoseconds it s quite fair to restrict this latter interval estimation to 6.3 to 6.8 nanoseconds comparing min min and max max instead of min max and max min as the wider more prudential estimate does

1960075
ubuntu	linux
i am currently testing on linux using ubuntu 9.10

put	get
the main thing i think is to get the normal product s application code out of the test and put in some test code instead

1960165

ruby does however have a gem named whenever to make easier the declaration and deployment of new cron jobs

1960285
min	max
a way to determine typical size is to run some tests using various data sets and collect stats for starting size number of reallocations and min max memory usage for your data

1960300

salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
i m not that an md5 is the best way to store passwords i think the general accepted practice is to use a hash and a salt check out the way restful_authentication or authlogic does it for best practices

1960335
spaces	delimiter
so to do this in java read the file in one line at a time with a filereader or something and split on spaces or whatever other delimiter you want to use - each word is a term

1960372

client-side	server-side
the client-side application is a flex application and communicate with server-side java application using blazeds

1960447
struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes
now as i said i can already hear voices saying things like java ee is heavy use spring instead learn struts or wicket or stripes for the presentation layer learn hibernate for persistence or not because i don t like orm use ibatis or straight jdbc instead you ll see it s cool with spring spring is so cooool and use tomcat and why not jetty or jboss or just forget all this and go for grails and bla bla bla...

1960453
post	put
put or post request and the representation is in the right format but it doesnâ t make

1960518
rss	feed
i am making a dynamic image that parses off of an rss feed

turbogears	repoze.who
i m using turbogears 2.1 and repoze.who what and am having trouble figuring out how to extend the basic authentication functionality

1960761
memcpy	memset
during feedback directed optimizations the expected block size the memcpy memset and bzero functions operate on is discovered and for cases of commonly used small sizes specialized inline code is generated.

1960779
next	except
tr n next fastest except for long average line lengths

1960787
int	chars
i thought about printing on screen the chars read in the variable c before i get the error so i can understand in which part of the read file is the error located but this is an int

1960794
feof	fgetc
you should call feof or ferror to determine why fgetc is returning no more data

1960796
int	chars
to get a chars from an int use chars some_int and to output a chars use f putc or printf c some_int

1960825

post	get
the slashes are automatically added when data comes from post or get

1960938
pop-up	dialog
while download will pop-up a dialog to save that file on your disk

1960991
memcpy	memmove
using memcpy when source and destination overlap can lead to undefined behaviour - in those cases only memmove can be used

1960996
memcpy	memmove
memcpy doesn t have any special handling for overlapping buffers so it lacks some checks therefore it is faster than memmove

1960996
memcpy	memmove
also on some architectures memcpy can benefit from using cpu instructions for moving blocks of memory - something that memmove cannot use

1961005
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
you might want to look into the domnodeinserted event for firefox opera safari and the onpropertychange event for ie

1961075
post	get
you can t get the value of post variables using javascript although you can insert it in the document when you process the request on the server

1961121
memcpy	memmove
it s quite possible though unlikely that the person who wrote memmove for your particular compiler was a certified genius while the poor soul who got the job of writing memcpy was the village idiot -

1961121
memcpy	memmove
although in reality i find it hard to imagine the memmove could be faster than memcpy i don t discount the possibility

1961136
daemons	launchd
if you re looking to build such a thing on os x look up daemons and launchd .

1961168
disk	ram
the length of offline time more specifically if there s a reboot of the app determined whether your cache will be saved on disk or can be trusted to ram

1961185
post	get
i believe one of the best ways of coping with this problem is by accessing values of get and post cookie session etc arrays through a class

1961192
put	get
i want to put 1000 entities into my app engine server production server but i get timeout errors and also 500 server errors

1961200
width	height
is there a way to set the height width css properties to something like that 100 - 50px

1961231
width	height
i know the exact width height and location of each control

1961231
width	height
the width and height property of the window is including the borders

1961231
width	height
the client width and height

1961231
width	height
if i set the width and height of the window to 300 then the borders take up anywhere from 5 - 15px and only 285 or so pixels are available for the client area where you can add controls

1961237
memcpy	memmove
assuming a sane library implementor memcpy will always be at least as fast as memmove

1961237
memcpy	memmove
however on most platforms the difference will be minimal and on many platforms memcpy is just an alias for memmove to support legacy code that incorrectly calls memcpy on overlapping buffers

1961237
memcpy	memmove
both memcpy and memmove should be written to take advantage of the fastest loads and stores available on the platform

1961275
hide	show
for show and hide tabs i used this jquery code

1961286
put	get
i agree with the other answers that resource that you put is not required to be the same as the one that you later get

1961342
width	height
the issue is how to calculate the correct width height

1961342
min	max
i want to resize #frame so that it were like min size of #container max size of #frame size of #content

1961425
post	put
your most obvious choices would be to put the coordinates in the query string or in a post request

1961485
havok	physx
havok definitely uses this i think it s an option in bullet but i m not sure about physx

1961522
hash	salt
that is i take a hash of a unique code attached to each image plus some salt and pass the first few characters of that hash to the user for confirmation during retrieval

1961534
width	margin
then your third div will not float but you ll set its left margin to the width of the left column its right margin to the width of the right column

1961543
folder	directory
i have a folder in my home directory which is used as the eclipse workspace for the project

1961551
getter	setter
the compiler actually creates a private backing variable and a simple getter and setter as in your first example

1961551
getter	setter
if all you re doing is creating a getter and setter and nothing actually happens when either occurs then the concise syntax is a good option

1961621
groupbox	panel
replace the container by the name of yours it may be a form a panel a groupbox

1961633
getter	setter
getter setter wraps up an underlying data store

1961641
yacc	bison
there are many parsing rules that cannot be parsed by a bison yacc parser for example distinguishing between a declaration and a function call in some circumstances

1961641
yacc	bison
yacc and bison are lalr 1 parser generators which are not sophisticated enough to handle c++ effectively

1961646
sequence	permutation
permutation of a long sequence can

1961646
sequence	permutation
nevertheless factorials which count the permutation of a sequence of length n also grow pretty fast

1961646
sequence	permutation
the mersenne twister for example might be able to produce all permutation of a sequence of length 2080 but definitely not of one of length 2081 or higher

1961646
sequence	permutation
were it not for the lifetime of the universe issue the docs worry about even rather small len x would be justified -- we know that many possible permutation can never be reached by shuffling with such a pseudo-rng as soon as we have a reasonably long sequence so one might worry about what kind of bias we re actually introducing with even a few shuffles

1961714
vsts	tfs
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

1961729
getter	setter
after a while you can start using hide method on the getter and setter

1961749
qgraphicsitem	qobject
qgraphicsitem is not a qobject and cannot send signals nor receive slots

1961752
hash	md5
3 million strings - 3 million md5 hash

1961752
hash	md5
a good solution will include a bash perl script that takes a list of strings from stdin and outputs a list of their md5 hash

1961774
hash	md5
it s not hard to do in c or perl or python using any of the many md5 implementations -- at its heart md5 is a hash function that goes from a character vector to a character vector

1961775
fadein	hide
i tried several variations of this including hide .show and .fadeout fadein and just setting the opacity seems to have the fewest ill effects flicker changing page height etc.

1961776
hash	md5
to get better performance you would probably need to use a different program or create a c program that calls one of the publicly available md5 hash apis

1961794
post	get
when you post a form the only thing that will get passed to your post action are controls

1961805
hide	show
i am trying to create a way to show and hide a number of different elements on my page depending if the user is logged in or not

1961824
debian	centos
b debian to centos should work just fine

1961864
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
you will need something which can periodically run jobs for you like a cron daemon or windows task scheduler

1961894
cvs	svn
most commonly small companies currently use cvs or svn and there s nothing bad in that in fact i d be really worried if no version control was really used at all

1961894
cvs	svn
we currently use cvs and are looking into mercurial but we ve found that the following works as a good set of conventions when working with cvs and i d suspect svn too

1961894
cvs	svn
this is mainly because in cvs and svn branching just doesn t work as expected and it becomes an exercise in futility to maintain any more than two living branches head and any secondary branch over time

1961894
jar	war
we soon came to realize that these extra steps are completely useless since by using ant - by the way you can invoke ant tasks directly in hudson - we could tell the jar war building step to ignore everything by either file name say everything that ends with test or testcase or by source folder

1961894
maven	m2e
this has worked tremendously well and doesn t require any additional support or plugins from any of ides out there which is a great plus - number two reason we didn t choose maven was seeing how m2e basically took over eclipse

1961898
post	get
never pass them in hidden form fields via post or get

1961918
inherited	subclassing
create a subclassing that inherited from the library s class and implement reference-counting in the subclassing

1961922
hide	show
if you are using the standard cflogin built into coldfusion you can show hide elements by checking for a logged in user

1961966
directx	gdi
after that you may have to look at using gdi or directx to get closer to the hardware

1962006
postgresql	mysql
support differs between oracle 10g+ sql server 2000+ postgresql mysql 5.1+ so we d need more information before recommending a specific one

1962032
put	get	integer	unsigned
if you put u or d in it would still work and you would get out the number represented as an unsigned integer in based 10 or a signed integer in base 10

1962084
inherited	properties
well if you want to add another properties to the datetimepicker you will have to create your own control implementation that inherited datetimepicker

1962092
folder	directory
ok so i have a directory in my root folder called pages in which i keep all my pages that i include thru index.php

1962142
directx	gdi
directx bypasses everything and talks directly to the device driver thus gdi and other usual methods won t work - unless aero is disabled or unavailable all that appears is a black rectangle at the top left of the screen

1962205
getter	setter
i advise you not to fear the fact that player will be a class of getter and setter

1962228
srp	principles
in fact i d argue that s the whole point of principles like the srp - not to make it easy to design everything beforehand but to make it easy to change things as your requirements grow and change shape because you can t predict everything beforehand

1962249
getter	setter
ide netbeans for php php html css - auto-completion insert getter setter u dont have that in eclipse

1962251
put	get
now it takes some time before i get the result not instantly so i put in the return false at the bottom preventing the form to submit before i get the .post results back and do something with it

1962299
pop-up	dialog
i have a jquery dialog modal box pop-up for logging into my website

1962324
pull	push
then you can pull from them and push to your own repository

1962336
base	fractions
you want the standard posixt type from base r that can be had in compact form as a posixct which is essentially a double representing fractions seconds since the epoch or as long form in posixlt which contains sub-elements

1962346
maya	blender
i have designed several bits of these 3d objects in blender and also am aware of other programs with which to do this maya etc. however i am unsure how to use c++ to display these objects much less manipulate them in response to changing variables

1962359
post	get
there was also an option to have this automatically added to all local links as get and form targets as post

1962390
children	parent
windows only get the parent flag when they have children not because you tell them to

1962425
mouse	keyboard
as to development i d do that on a regular machine with mouse and keyboard but make everything in the software reliant on the mouse clicks

1962474
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that it works fine on firefox and safari on windows but it fails to work with google-chrome

1962474
firefox	safari
during the 10 seconds the process is alive accessing the scriptable plugin object doesn t work which works fine when using firefox or safari

1962532
jms	jta
jta transaction manager is general purpose transaction manager and can enlist other resources such as jms queues in transaction

1962566
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
note- this is for firefox opera google-chrome safari

1962584
jndi	jta
this will require some knowledge of your application server as the jndi location of the jta transactionmanager is specific to each j2ee server

1962584
jboss	glassfish
you should maybe consider moving to a j2ee app server like jboss or glassfish

1962628
filesystems	ntfs
this may be a starting point to extending ntfs in the way that the gmail filesystems used to do windows nt reparse points

1962683
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to latest versioning of rails and installs active support from gems and i still get the same error

1962727
firefox	safari
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs

1962744
width	height
i have a div with fixed height and width lets say i have width 400px

1962793
anythingslider	easyslider
i like easyslider and anythingslider

1962806
nunit	mstest
i have avoided details that are specific to unit test technology nunit or mstest

1962846
submit	submission
submit the form using post upon submission validate and if everything is fine redirect the user to a success page that way if the user refreshes the page all he ll do is see the thank you page again

1962851
httphandler	httpmodule	isapi	httpmodule
in iis6 isapi filters extensions were analogous to httpmodule httphandler

1962851
isapi	httpmodule
in terms of httpmodule they cannot deliver the exact same functionality as isapi filters

1962878
hide	show
to do what you want you will want to use dom elements like a div and show then hide it after a specified time

1962963
getattr	setattr
setattr getattr is for attribute access mc.aa

1963012
jms	jta
jta is also used for managing transactions across systems like jms and jca but that s fairly exotic usage for most of us

1963046
rtp	sip
by the way i ve even used conferencexp video rtp part with rtc 1.3 voice sip features together to improve video quality so you have wide choice of managed technologies here

1963079
width	height
just make sure that you don t have any width or height attributes in the image

1963088
codeigniter	kohana
a php mvc backend using for example zend mvc codeigniter or kohana

1963105
udp	tcp
first i tried to connect to the shoutcast via sockets tcp and udp -- failed

1963135
gif	png	decoder	encoder	tiff	png
wic has built-in support for popular formats such as jpeg png tiff and gif as well as an extensibility model so that developers can create their own wic decoder and encoder codec and get platform level support for their image format

1963149
vim	gedit
i tried many editors ides mainly gedit vim radrails with a couple of plugins

1963149
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
all i have found for gedit vim never tried emacs actually i cannot remember anyone using emacs for ruby development are plugins doing completion based on phrases in the same file

1963193
apache	nginx
it is deployed on nginx proxied with apache which handles the django app via wsgi

1963193
chunked	transfer-encoding
the j2me transfers the file with transfer-encoding set as chunked and content length set to zero

1963193
apache	nginx
the problem is that neither nginx nor apache allow zero content length chunked data and give back http 411 error response

1963193
apache	nginx
few solutions on net suggest recompiling nginx and apache but i don t want to go into that

1963222
client-side	server-side
client-side and server-side validation simply serve a different purpose respectively enhancing usability for the user and guarding logic and security of your service

1963241
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it however fails in my real use-case a npapi based browser plugin - a dll loaded into firefox google-chrome opera

1963248
accessor	properties
expose a properties that takes an object of type businessbase in it s set accessor

1963305
submit	submission
for example the code linked to by zoran will accidentally submit the form on enter press in a which wouldn t normally happen and won t catch ie s behaviour of submission the form for enter press on other non-field content in the form

1963312
ubuntu	debian
this would also need to be deployed to multiple machines running ubuntu 9.x and debian lenny so it should be simple to install

1963327
post	get
this way you could see how the received data looks like and you d know if it s passed in post or in get

1963406
hide	fadeout
for example the function below will hide the element with the class hideme then once the fadeout effect is complete the callback function removes the element from the page and dom

1963407
serializable	deserialization
i think the serializable deserialization is the easiest way to do this

1963411
google-chrome	firefox
i need a browser-independent way that works in google-chrome firefox

1963493
for-loop	loops
on isolating the error i found that if the second for-loop is not run for the last iteration i mean like in the sample test case n 5 so i run loops only till i 3 instead of i 4 then it doesn t crash and produces the expected output

1963535
post	get
i presume that you re relying on this being populated from the incoming get post data most likely via the depreciated register_globals which is bad practice

1963538
paperclip	minimagick
i ve come across rmagick minimagick paperclip attachment_fu attribute_fu imagescience

1963550
width	height
width and height are the size of the screen in windowed mode not the windows

1963582
put	get
when i put into my app i get this

1963587
opera	firefox
if then to come to look through ie opera firefox that has varied of nothing.

1963630
client-side	server-side
if you still want to serve the xml to normal users and have them perform the xslt transform client-side then you would need some server-side logic to identify the google bots and only performs the transform to return html for google requests

1963655
min	max
select rowmin min rowid rowmax max rowid from tblt

1963672
appfuse	spring
i am looking for feedback from experienced users on spring roo and appfuse

1963677
int	chars
astnode reserves nodetype which specifies given node s type i.e int op or chars and type we don t need to concern other types the other members are left and right pointers and finally we store

1963679
hide	show
i have a loadingstatus function that has two options show or hide

1963679
hide	show
the show triggers to display when the jquery post is made the hide happens after the response comes back

1963683
hide	show
you can perform this math either inside your callback or within the savebanner function itself within the show portion you would set the starting time within the hide portion you would check the difference and set the settimeout

1963690
rss	feed
well i would think you would need to do that to get the partial image url and then append the baes url from the original server unless the url in the rss feed is the full url to the image

1963696
int	chars
null checks when printing the int and chars nodes

1963709
wufoo	jotform
pragmatic approach would be using google spreadsheet s feature called forms paid services from wufoo or jotform

1963745
free	malloc
when programming in c i often use malloc to allocate memory and free to release it

1963766
free	malloc
the only thing that matters to free is getting the exact same address as what malloc returned

1963794
free	malloc
for the case of malloc the heap allocator stores a mapping of the original returned pointer to relevant details needed for free ing the memory later

1963794
free	malloc
attempting to free any pointer with a value different to those returned by previous malloc s and as yet unfreed is an error

1963794
free	malloc
it is not possible to partially free memory regions returned from malloc

1963798
free	malloc
your code calls malloc in one routine stores the pointer somewhere and eventually calls free in a different routine

1963875
addition	modulo
in both cases addition is performed modulo the array size and make sure to increment the other index when needed that is when the queue is full or empty

1963877
range	infinity
it s value range lies between 0 and positive infinity in theory

1963902
post	get
you can either submit the values with a classic post or get or via ajax but you have to wire up a server-side action that processes that input

1963938
post	get
requestscope contained the post headers sent from browsers and the get arguments

1963955
base-class	subclassing
when you specify a member function as virtual there is a chance that you may try to use subclassing via a base-class polymorphically at run-time

1963994
postgresql	mysql
you can use my online database code-generator to generate sql server ddl scripts and oracle mysql postgresql ... from uml models

1964055
disk	ram	postgresql	mysql
you don t really have a variety of choices here you can cache them in ram using something like memcached or push them to disk reading and writing them with a databsae rdbms like postgresql mysql or dod like couchdb

1964067
children	parent
all children to the top level menu items collected under their parent objects

int	chars	int	double
now the pointer ptr may point to an int or an array of int it may point to a single chars or array of chars it may point to a single double number or an array of double etc

1964092
post	get
you can only encode get values in the url and not post parameters

1964123
nunit	moq
my test code using nunit and moq

1964148
switching	screens
how do i switching between views like home screens

1964180
mouse	keyboard
on the login screen and on the security window you cannot send mouse or keyboard events

1964237
ddms	adb
you can always download the database file using ddms or adb pull and use a desktop sqlite client to examine it

1964246
free	malloc
you either need to malloc free the pixel buffer or better yet use stack

1964246
free	malloc
malloc free

1964250
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it should also demonstrate their ability to write cross-browser compatible code just open their examples in ie firefox opera safari google-chrome

1964281
folder	directory
you can then reference that external directory from within your project with a linked folder

1964282
post	get
but you can get things out of the query string if you post the form via get

1964295
post	get
javascript is running at client side so if your want to get the text area s value before post your page to serve use this

1964310
keydown	keyup
check out the form.keypreview property it will allow you to trap all keydown keyup and keypress events at the form level before allowing them to be processed by individual elements

1964327
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the pages of the web app will have some data grids some with link columns input boxes labels dropdownlistfor checkbox radio button and submit action button

1964344
width	height
the problem is i want background images for header and footer that are not getting displayed until i specify a height and width for them.moreover the height and width specified in the css inside the #header and #footer have to match the exact dimension of the original images which are dimensionally large otherwise the images are not being displayed properly parts of them get cut

1964398
g++	gcc
the default installation prefix is usr local which is why make install put gcc and g++ binaries into usr local bin etc

1964436
serializable	deserialization
performance - dcs was tweaked specifically to be as fast as possible since wcf relies heavily and frequently on object serializable deserialization - that s one of the reasons that the dcs doesn t support attributes on xml nodes either

1964495
width	height
if you want the images to automatically scale you will need to use an img tag for each image and set the width height to 100

1964495
width	height
that means if you want the images to scale according to the size of the browser window you ll need to set the parent container s width height to be a percentage and not a fixed pixel width height

1964502
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have used this successfully in firefox ie opera and safari haven t needed to test in google-chrome

1964511
folder	directory
to be more specific i have one directory the backup folder which i constantly update using findfirstchangenotification

1964514
sorting	grouping
you could create a sorting table the more sanely grouping the characters like

1964520
postgresql	mysql
you might see for mysql postgresql sqlite to use in applications for example to archive my books

1964533
hudson	phpundercontrol
phing or ant can be called from an continous integration system like phpundercontrol or hudson on a regular basis so you get regular automated feedback

1964574
openssl	libcrypto
or use the openssl libcrypto

1964588
free	malloc
afaik free usually doesn t take much time but malloc can take a lot of time if memory is fragmented

1964623
free	malloc
ok well i tried to replace the malloc free with new delete and that had no effect on the speed

1964643
free	malloc
you could turn these into a single malloc free call althought that would make the code less clear and harder to mantain

1964650
opencv	emgucv
i want to make an apps detect an square rectangle in my webcam using emgucv an opencv wrapper

1964650
width	height
if it s posible i would like to obtain the width and height of the square rectangle

1964697
onenote	ms-office
george writing a question uses word excel or onenote to create content and then inserts the content into the question area probably copying it into the clipboard and then using some paste from ms-office widget

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
and jta capable application server means a real j2ee container or a non j2ee container like tomcat with a standalone transaction manager like atomikos jotm bitronix simplejta jbossts or geronimotm jencks

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
fwiw i ve seen lots of complains about jotm i think that geronimotm jencks lacks of documentation i can t really say anything about jbossts arjunats except that it s a rock solid product simplejta and bitronix have both good documentation and atomikos is an impressive product greatly documented too

1964701
atomikos	bitronix
personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos

1964701
jboss	glassfish
or consider using a real j2ee container like jboss or glassfish as i wrote in a previous answer

1964722
boost	allocator
having one big memory pool shared by all factories of one game representation using something like boost pool with some adapter functions that way i ve got all the game objects memory allocated together and can have one bit allocator for a game that i already know the total size it s not always the case

1964731
implements	modifiers
multiple texts say that when implements double-checked locking in .net the field you are locking on should have volatile modifiers applied

1964735
webclient	httpwebrequest
since webclient is implemented on top of httpwebrequest you can do everything with httpwebrequest that you can with webclient albeit with more code

1964772
boost	allocator
when testing performance of boost pool test not only allocator but also deallocation

1964796
strstr	strcmp
even if you wanted to create strstr which is a c function and not a c++ function you really don t need to avoid using strcmp

1964804
put	get
so i could put the selectedindex in a hidden input before submitting the form and then get that selectedindex and set it with a javascript function.

1964833
free	malloc
having had a look at the code one big thing that comes to my mind is this - mixture of malloc ... new ... delete ... free ...

1964833
free	malloc
in short you are mixing the c++ s runtime in calling new ... and delete ... with malloc ... and free ...

1964836
allocator	stl
one problem that you ll run into is that stl implementations are allowed to assume that two allocator of the same type are equivalent

1964870
hide	show
this has a few caveats first of all if you have two or more places the loading image can be show you re going to need to kep track of how many calls are running at once somehow and only hide when they re all done

1964871
hide	show
let s create an element that we can show hide anytime we re making an ajax request

1964896
webclient	httpwebrequest
the answer almost certainly is to replace usage of httpwebrequest with webclient and to use the async methods of webclient

1964896
webclient	httpwebrequest
typically the lower-level classes httpwebrequest will use the iasyncresult pattern while the higher-level classes webclient will use the event-based pattern

1964896
webclient	httpwebrequest
so if it s easy to do i d suggest moving to webclient and event handlers instead of httpwebrequest and callback delegates

1964902
rss	feed
creating rss feed in rails is easy

1964902
rss	feed
i need a simple way to password protect the rss feed

1964950
free	malloc
+1 to malloc free making my eyes hurt in c++

1964950
free	malloc
roll up your malloc calls to one large malloc and free for the x y left right etc structures instead of 12

1965024
elf	coff
coff is a common file format for object modules which are linked to make an elf file or an exe file

1965040
portrait	landscape
what is nice is that an image is not needed for the watermark so i set the font size to 96pts and that seemed to work fine in landscape and portrait mode

1965072
post	get
update the solution is to use the http verb post and not get

1965081
libcurl	libssh
now i m pretty sure that mac os x does not ship with libcurl installed and even if it did it most likely wasn t built with libssh which i would also need

1965139
pull	push
push or pull

1965139
ethernet	wireless
i was planning to use a wifly or wiznet ethernet board in combination with a wireless access hub

1965242
portrait	landscape
it works fine in portrait mode but fails miserably in landscape mode

1965253
min	max
i want to specify a base value the center of the distribution a standard deviation and a min and max values

1965253
minimum	max	min	max
obviously one can use a loop and only exit if the generated number was between the minimum and maximum but that could go on for a long time if min max are too close together or too far out along a tail

1965277
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
many of these new features are not yet supported by ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1965277
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera and safari need new abbreviations really.

1965313
rubygems	rvm
unless you are using custom gem environment variables or a .gemrc or some multi ruby system like rvm then the locations where rubygems are installed for each ruby installation will be different

1965321
memset	memcmp
rtlcomparememory rtlfillmemory sound like they re probably the underlying implementations for memcmp memset

1965334
getter	setter
don t worry too much about the player class being a bunch of setter and getter

1965357
pop-up	dialog
what i m trying to get from a dialog plugin is that it can help pop-up panel like interface which allows dragging and resizing

1965392
stdout	stderr
my carefully scripted array job workers generate no stdout and no stderr when they function properly

1965392
stdout	stderr
unfortunately sge insists on creating an empty stdout and stderr file for each run

1965392
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr of array job tasks will be written into dif-

gridview	onclientclick
onclientclick of the btnyes will return false if the gridview selected index 0

1965423
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
the past week or two i ve been studying maven and i like it but there are just a few things that i require ant tasks for rather than maven s complicated and scarcely-documented pom.xml file

1965473
width	height
if i understand your preview function right it is actually already doing exactly that it should be enough to just remove the width and height settings

1965476
robocopy	xcopy
another is to try the robocopy utility which is part of the windows server resource kit and which replaces xcopy in versions of windows above server 2008 r2

1965526
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i was taught that for arrays length is not retrieved through a method due to the following fear programmers would just assign the length to a local variable before entering a loops think a for-loop where the conditional uses the arrays s length. the programmer would supposedly do so to trim down on function calls and thereby improve performance. the problem is that the length might change during loops and the variable wouldn t

1965541
int	double
however when i changed those int s to double s which is what python would probably do i got this

1965541
division	multiplication
i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2

1965541
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
it did both the division multiplication and addition in a single instruction

1965555
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in google-chrome and firefox

1965559
ssl	https
secure the transport layer use https with ssl to protect the entire pipe going from the client to the server

1965562
mouse	keyboard
for how to do this in c# see george mamaladze s article processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c#

1965573
webclient	httpwebrequest
classes inside the system.net namespace webclient httpwebrequest seems to do this automatically on the first request

1965614
jar	manifest.mf
you can also try adding class-path to your manifest.mf of the main jar see here

1965655
boost	stl
it s not practical to use stl or boost for any type of video game for starters

1965738
public	protected
the only way i can think to do this is create a public final method in the parent class that the calling code will use and a protected method which will be called by the public final method

1965738
public	protected
the protected method contains the functionality and the public final method validates the return value of the protected method

1965761
width	height
also what should the binding be for binding #2 if i want to pass the button s width and height to the converter

1965835
hide	show
i m using parent child grid and on child grid i m doing show hide threw java script

1965842
put	get
i have written code to check if it is in a number and to get the number when the button is clicked but it doesn t work correctly if i put the code in the selection changed event

1965845
config	ini
i store it in a plain text ini style config file usually above the web root so as not to allow users access to it

1965862
width	height
productbox product1 name framename width 594 height 450 scrolling no id framename allowautotransparency true iframe

1965870
listview	gridview
i have a simple wpf with a menu a toolbar and a listview in a gridview

1965873
getter	setter
i know that the logic inside the add and remove functions can be inside the setter or getter but the person wanting to add should pass only a single entry object

1965891
swt	nebula
nebula is a place where different eclipse-projects and independent developers collaborate on building custom swt widgets and reuseable ui-components useable in ui-applications built using swt and jface

1965912
mouse	keyboard
it runs after all input events mouse keyboard are processed

1965987
switching	screens	portrait	landscape
however even for the simplest of their samples the one that only renders a blank screens if you switching the orientation several times switching like 5 times between portrait and landscape is usually enough the app freezes and i need to force close it

1966030
rss	feed
i m writing a simple twitter example that reads the twitter search rss feed via

1966037
emacs	aquamacs
emacs aquamacs on mac

1966074
post	get
if you get user credentials in your iphone app you can then pass them to php using simple post or get request

1966078
fgets	feof
if you are running the above code in a loop when feof returns true no line will be read by fgets and buff will be null but newbuff will be unchanged

1966093
addition	multiplication
that s very easy for addition multiplication is a bit harder but still possible

1966187
single-quotes	double-quotes
note how i use single-quotes within my double-quotes

1966205
hex	binary
then a gap buffer model is better it is also much better if you don t have lines at all for example when displaying binary files in hex mode

1966244
children	parent
put the things to appear on top of the surfaceview later in the xml -- later children of a parent will draw over top of earlier children in the parent

1966246
lseek	posix
for posix use lseek 2 or lseek64 3 to seek ahead

1966269
lseek	posix
in posix i think you can safely seek past the end of file the idea is that if more data is written later so as to make data go past the position set with lseek you will be able to read more data now

1966285
folder	directory
using executable_path you can use paths relative to your applications executable file and then place the libraries either in your frameworks folder executable_path .. frameworks libcurl.dylib or inside the executable directory executable_path lib libcurl.dylib

1966322
ubuntu	linux
i m running a database server in a linux vm ubuntu 9.10 under vmware fusion but coding django on the mac side

1966341
g++	gcc
i couldn t work out how to get the configure script to set g++ as the compiler linker instead of gcc so ended up hacking the makefile with a sed command to do a search replace in my bash build script

1966376
profiling	benchmarking
1 by benchmarking i mean a long-running program that exercises your library outside of a profiling passing it a variety of inputs

1966398
post	get
at this stage i need some advice on how to set up the urls for files that receive both get and post requests

1966413
pylons	cherrypy	web.py	cherrypy	web.py	pylons	django	web.py
my guess is that web service apis with pretty urls aka rest are built via some kind of webframework werkzeug web.py django pylons cherrypy plain wsgi ...

1966420
django	web.py
web.py and django are nice

1966444
jboss	glassfish
jboss richfaces seem pretty good on documentation but i m using glassfish

1966444
richfaces	icefaces
being a jsf web beginner i tried some icefaces mojarra tutorials and had a go at getting richfaces working with nbeans and glassfish but no luck

1966485
richfaces	icefaces
icefaces - also very good an alternative to richfaces

1966485
woodstock	openfaces
rcfaces netadvantage webgalileofaces quipukit blueprints woodstock ilog g4jsf simplica backbase jenia4faces visualwebpack dynafaces ibm impl dinamica openfaces - never heard of those or only saw some of them once or twice probably not that popular and stable after all

1966532
opera	safari
taken from sitepoint.com works in in opera 9.5+ safari 4+ ff3.5+

strncmp	strcmp
conceptually databases compare character fields just like strcmp strncmp if you prefer from left to right

1966588
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
anything written using firebreath will work on ie firefox google-chrome safari and possibly opera opera doesn t 100 correctly implement npapi

1966618
int	chars
it can still be made more memory efficient by using unsigned chars array rather than using int array to store digits

1966621
post	get
get even if the client does a post

1966621
isapi	httpmodule
rather than creating my own httpmodule i decided instead to use ionics isapi rewrite filter to rewrite my urls

1966681
spaces	delimiter
you should have a common easy to read delimiter if they are all integers then a spaces or comma will work just fine

1966707
invokelater	invokeandwait
it would be great to avoid edt and invokelater or invokeandwait when performing an animation

1966708
restructuredtext	textile
however we want to allow multiple formatting languages markdown textile restructuredtext

1966729
int	chars
the spaces in your example impact that as well - in your example the int with a length of 4 plus the 1 chars for the space means you could have a maximum of 1 600 distinct values

1966729
int	chars
reliable data enforcement - an int column won t allow alphabet chars

1966754
multiplying	add
if step three above said multiplying instead of add then someone would be able to point out the error in the logic without having to debug code

1966878
httpresponse	request
the code would look something like the following but i need a way to pass the object id to the httpresponse request

1966899
margin	height
the margin should have a minimum size of say 10px and should shrink in proportion to the window height

1966899
width	height
i m stuggling with min-height min-width height and width at the moment

1966905
innodb	myisam
i m trying to achieve a cascading update and delete effect in a myisam database similar effect as you can create in innodb tables with foreign keys

1966912
mouseover	mouseout
consider this for a mouseover mouseout situation

1966917
int	chars
chars int long many properties of

1966925
fadein	fadeout
use fadein and fadeout to change the opacity of an element

1966926
integer	unsigned
however assuming that this is 16 bit unsigned data normalised to 1.0 so the values range from 0.0 s 1.0 then all you need to do to expand them to 8bit integer values is to multiply each sample by 255

1966926
range	max
if the range is not 0.0 s 1.0 but 0.0 s max then

1966934
inherited	properties
the page class your page inherited from contains an instance properties request

1966947
getter	setter
i m assuming it would make use of designmode - but i can only find getter and not setter for these properties

1966961
elf	coff
on linux this format is typically elf on windows and older unixes it s coff and on mac os x it s mach-o

1966968
valgrind	callgrind
it depends on callgrind and valgrind as one could have guessed so no special compiler flags required during compile-time

1966981
g++	gcc
you didn t indicate what gcc version you are using but if it is a recent enough one 4.0.0 and above me thinks you should try the --with-sysroot flag to g++ ld

1967038
pull	push
hooks triggers -- doing things on push pull including quality no tabs allowed etc. filters

1967063
google-chrome	firefox
similar functionality exists for both google-chrome and firefox as well

1967129
ubuntu	linux
right now i m using heyu with a cm11a under linux ubuntu

1967152
config	ini
except its not in ini format because it doesn t contain but just key which chokes config ini

1967189
switching	screens
on small screens i simply like to use ctrl-m to switching the editor to fullscreen mode and back without the need of minimizing single views or move them around

1967210
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i have a qtreeview subclass and qabstractitemmodel subclass which has a nice horizontal header

1967210
qtableview	qtreeview
but unlike qtableview which has separate vertical setverticalheader and horizontal headers sethorizontalheader qtreeview only allows a single header setheader

1967219
min	max
each has a different algorithm for how you get the min and max and the actual code involves some bit twiddling and in the case of floating point you have to loop unless you have a known integer type that is the same size as the float type

1967219
min	max
the min is when all bits are 0 s the max is when all bits are 1 s

1967219
min	max
for signed the min is when the sign bit is set but all of the other bits are zeros the max is when all bits except the sign bit are set

1967226
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you actually go through the entire article not just the top it allows a single font-face statement to cover ie firefox safari opera google-chrome and possibly others

1967226
put	get
working from that base font squirrel put together a variety of useful tools including the font-face generator which allows you to upload a ttf or otf file and get auto-converted font files for the other types along with pre-built css and a demo html page

1967251
public	protected
you don t specify public private or protected

1967257
gtk	cairo
i m writing an open source program key-train in python and gtk with cairo and i would like to use some more attractive fonts

1967296
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
one easy way is to write the string seperately to a dataoutputstream wrapping a bytearrayoutputstream then close he dataoutputstream and get the backing byte array from the baos and see how long it is

1967343
ftp	telnet
ftp like telnet should be avoided

those component libraries adds just that extra on top of the basic implementation often with more skinning capabilities richfaces icefaces and or ajaxical stuff richfaces icefaces trinidad and or more enhanced specialized components tomahawk primefaces

1967394
websphere	ibm
the ibm components are proprietary and ships with ibm websphere only

1967394
richfaces	tomahawk
you don t need them they re not much better than for example tomahawk or richfaces

1967406
firefox	safari
update i tested on an old powerbook after incorporating pixelbreaker s swfmacmousewheel scripts and found that while the os x version of firefox behaves normally safari 3.2.1 is doubling the events too

1967428
put	get
using the apple s pagecontrol sample code i ve managed to put several uiwebviews side-by-side and i m able to swipe left and right in order to get to each web view

1967438
socialauth	pyfacebook
notes on pyfacebook are at least a year out of date and people have pointed me to the socialauth app for django which appears to be equally out of date and focused on targeting users as opposed to their pages

1967466
vb.net	vb6
the same way you learned vb6 and vb.net no doubt

1967529
inherited	properties
both of these types have an actiondescriptor properties but they don t inherited it from a common type or interface that i can find

1967549
launch4j	jsmooth
launch4j - no new development in over a year supports 64 bit but you can t sign the exe created by launch4j so i prefer jsmooth but it does not support 64 bit

1967583
exponent	modulo
if your exponent is low and the value of m e modulo you can just take the eth root of the ciphertext to decrypt

1967585
put	get
here is the most reasonable code i have come across to get the job done so far but i don t know how to put it into practice or whether it can accomplish what i need

1967628
hex	binary
hex is a way of displaying binary data

1967640
formview	detailsview
if you have a large form detailsview allows you to specify fields and allows the control to do the work you simply specify the data and detailsview handles the form but of course with a custom ui the formview is the way to go and yes it can be tedious to have to create large forms.

1967695
freetype	cairo
you might want to take a look at this feature request it shows a work-a-round if using cairo and freetype for the backend

1967729
pop-up	dialog
you dont have enough room for the textbox its only about 1 8 of an inch wide i would somehow like the textbox to pop-up above the table maybe in a small dialog or something so i have more width to allow someone to enter longer text

1967735
g++	gcc
if you want a free alternative i have cegcc that is a gcc gnu c compiler and g++ gnu c++ compiler to compile windows mobile programs

1967747
submit	submission
i imagine there are ways you could automate a series of commands like typing in a field hitting tab typing tabbing etc. but to achieve the end result of submission the information to the server it probably would be faster and easier to just submit the http post using a tool like curl

1967749
children	parent
some browsers limit to 4096 and split longer texts into multiple text node children of the parent element

1967794
hide	show
some of the pages contain slidedown sections with trigger text - clicking this text show hide the slidedown section below it

1967835
rss	feed
i ve been looking at some different options for reading rss feed in .net

1967858
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the latest versions of firefox safari google-chrome and opera all support the nth-of-type pseudo-element but ie does not yet it is a css 3 feature which ie does not support much of

1967862
gif	png
is it gif png jpg and under the 800 kilobyte limit set by the api

1967867
rss	feed
given that rss is stateless it doesn t know when you last requested the feed and therefore couldn t provide which items in the current feed are new or not compared to the last time you queried the feed

1967876
udp	tcp
with tcp being so easy you need a compelling reason to bother with udp

1967882
free	malloc
i know that a new should match a delete and a malloc with a free

1967886
popupwindow	pop-up
invoke the popupwindow by inflating the layout xml and assign the appropriate parent view to the pop-up

1967901
textarea	textbox
you would probably want to handle keyup for textbox textarea and select elements change for select elements and probably focus on everything

1967902
free	malloc
new delete call the constructor destructor of the associated object unlike malloc free

1967936
portrait	landscape
my suggestion would be to rotate the video so that if it was being played in landscape and the device was turned to portrait it would be oriented correctly

1967960
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
realloc like free should only be used with memory allocated by malloc

1967960
free	malloc
basically new uses the free store while malloc uses the heap

1967978
accelerometer	gyroscope
i m now however in a position where i need to make use of some third-party sensors which i ve purchased from hitechnic such as an accelerometer a gyroscope and a 3d compass - to mention a few

1968002
textarea	textbox
it fires when you select text within a textbox or textarea

1968002
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome you have to hit the enter key to trigger change

1968010
antlr	parser-generator
antlr is a parser-generator but there are grammars for java available

1968063
getter	setter
if you test this function at a higher level then you just need to make certain you are testing all possible situations for this setter but testing the getter part is pointless

1968162
formview	detailsview
still there are some points to remember if you have forms with lots of controls and you need them interact with each other you need to consider playing around the straight ways of formview detailsview

1968175
integer	fractions
you can get the number of seconds as a integer whole number by dividing the milliseconds by 1000 to convert it to seconds then converting the result to an integer this removes the fractions part representing the milliseconds

1968180
post	get
i want to send xml file with userid and password over https and then send all other xml file on http using post method and get the response as a xml file back

1968226
wxpython	pyqt
go pyqt gtk or wxpython if you want the features seen in the screen-shot above

1968235
serializable	deserialization
using a web service a wcf web service you ll get serializable deserialization an infrastructure and an ability for a client to easily consume your service

1968266
mxmlc	compc
i was earlier using mxmlc but on googling i found that for compiling libraries we have to use compc

1968290
button	checkbox
i have a .net 2.0 application with several types of controls checkbox button etc that i need to enable or disable them according the kind of license that the user bought

1968314
post	get
you can use get or post to pass the data from one to another

1968321
rss	feed
if the site provides an rss feed which you ll find in the tag use the fielded information from that instead

1968345
division	multiplication
it s also probably faster than the code posted by kingnestor because it s all multiplication and division no square roots

1968421
alloca	calloc
in this case you could allocate storage with calloc alloca or with a raii approach

1968421
alloca	calloc	free	calloc	free	alloca
using calloc alloca has the big advantage that you don t have to care about calling free because the allocated memory is automatically free when the local scope is left

1968421
alloca	calloc
edited use alloca instead of calloc

1968430
mouse	keyboard
here is a library for simulating keyboard and mouse activities

1968432
wordpress	joomla
not looking for cms s like drupal wordpress joomla etc

1968439
maven	cargo
if you strongly want to automate with maven installation of jogl you can try use maven-antrun-plugin or create own maven plugin that handles installation a good example is cargo that downloads servers and unpack it

1968521
post	get
first php runs at the server prepares the html and js and gives it to the client then at clients computer javascript runs if javascript needs something from server it calls the server again either post get or ajax doesnt matter it is still a http request

1968532
internationalization	translation
the standard way of adding internationalization in webos is to use the l function where i can set a key to the translation string

1968535
mouse	keyboard
this will clear the textarea on focus using mouse click or keyboard

1968580
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
otherwise you an create a new tabitem manually with your user-controls as its child and add it in tabcontrol instead of adding data items

1968588
kde	gnome
linux imlib gdk-pixbuf gnome gtk qt image kde qt should be able to do what you need

1968592
children	parent
the proper way seems to have a configurationsection as the parent and configurationelement as each children

1968672
yacc	lemon
i would dare to say that if parsing is so prominent in your task you might benefit from using a parser generator lex yacc antlr lemon ...

1968718
apache	nginx
if it s just static html you may want to look into setting up some form of server side includes such as apache ssi or nginx ssi

1968743
client-side	server-side
i recommend you using unified server-side and client-side validation using a framework since it may avoid confronting the user to data valid on client side but rejected by the server or the opposite client side too restrictive

1968746
hash	md5
website authorizes the user and set cookie visible in website domain with user name password md5 hash and sometimes other information

1968766
jobs	cron
quartz.net supports clustering and database persistence out-of-the-box and has powerful means to schedule jobs using cron like expressions interval triggers and exclusion advices

1968769
magento	joomla
it may be interesting for you to check out the following discussion on two existing ecommerce solutions magento eav and joomla regular relational structure

1968805
put	get
later in the .m file when i try to access that variable using the debugger when i put the mouse on that variable i get the message like out of scope and than i continue to debug the program at the end it will crash and give error like exc_bad_access

1968815
union	distinct
first get a distinct list union of the ids so that you include all then left join to add the values together

1968820
for-loop	loops
well you could replace one for-loop with a foreach loops or maybe use the that does the same internally but ultimately linq is a query syntax hence the q not a mutation syntax and it isn t usually very beneficial to try to represent the updates via an anonymous method lambda

1968825
post	get
well post is basically the same as get just some random chunks of info client sended to server

1968825
post	get
mvc is not the model of everything and it doesn t say how to treat post or get requests

1968833
comparator	icomparer
alternatively you can specify an implementation of the icomparer t generic interface by using a constructor that accepts a comparator parameter

1968921
hash	salt
you should even apply a random salt that is stored with the hash password usually as a prefix string so that the same password can t even be identified across sites or accounts

1968923
hash	salt
the default answer is yes hash and salt the passwords in screaming caps

1969032
post	get
for some expert advice on how to deal with indices and how to find out which indices might not get used and when it makes sense to create an index see kimberly tripp s blog post

1969100
public	protected
of course it gets more complex if you need polymorphism and need overrides to still call the method first probably involving a public non-virtual method and a protected virtual method

1969120
addition	multiplication
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

1969120
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	multiplication	exponent	addition	multiplication	exponent	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	exponent	division	multiplication
parentheses exponent division multiplication addition subtraction

1969127
strcpy	strdup
in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup

1969142
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
that s a rather trivial approach with simply utilizing the system.windows.forms controls openfiledialog and savefiledialog

1969145
opera	firefox
firefox ie opera safri output 54321

1969164
windows	wow64
usually you will be compiling this for a specific environment windows x86 in which case it could not run under linux and would run under the wow64 emulation layer on windows x64

1969171
width	height	children	parent
for a particular node i have properties like height and width like children which is a collection and resides implicitly in the hierarchy of xml and like resources which will also be having some properties and each will be represented by nodes under the parent

1969202
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
edit 3 by using the xsd.exe tool instead of the svcutil.exe i created the datacontract class so no handcrafted work here

1969209
hide	show
i agree with tj - z-index is the way to go - using javascript and css html will allow you to hide show this magic floating box above the table

1969260
inherited	properties
but you don t see it by default since textbox doesn t inherited background properties

1969307
opera	firefox
i have a page that s working fine in firefox 3.5.6 but not in ie 7 or opera 10.01

1969339
opera	google-chrome
in opera and google-chrome they are encoded to cookie headers with utf-8

1969361
ant	maven
the maven ant tasks allow many of the

1969361
ant	maven
refer to the installation page and the usage page for instructions for installing and using the maven ant tasks respectively

1969361
ant	maven
to maven ant tasks would be apache ivy

1969373
gwt	icefaces
gwt ext-js the lgpl branch flex or jquery but icefaces still causes nightmares to some of our developers.

1969389
post	get
so we know how to do http get and post connections

1969408
facebook	fbconnect
how can i get a limited no of friends from facebook using fbconnect and fql

1969411
int	double
however i am getting an ambiguous match exception presumably because there are a lot of overloaded parse methods each taking a single object string int double etc.

1969420
ready	each
i m too wondering about ide independant projects right now we are all sticked on eclipse - eclipse project files .project .classpath .settings are even commited in the cvs repository in order to have a project fully ready once checked out - but with netbeans supported by sun and running faster and faster with each release and each new jre version the question isn t closed

1969420
ant	maven
my build system is ant launched from eclipse for various small tasks uploading a war on a remote server for example and mainly maven 2 for

1969420
ant	maven
for what i ve seen so far it s seems pretty cool there are various conflict manager for the conflicts dependencies resolutions and you can even write your own conflict manager there is no need to have an additionnal tool installed and configured as ant is running natively under eclipse whereas maven needs a separate plugin - i ve tried the 3 mavens plugins by the way and have found all the three of them buggy

1969451
multibyte	substr
instead of fulltag 0 you may want to use a multibyte substr function

1969463
folder	directory
when i create a category in my cms i want to create its directory folder in an image directory

1969468
innodb	myisam
naturally you will need to be using innodb not myisam for this to do anything

1969503
put	get
my current solution is really ugly as i need to get the ninject kernel from my mvcapplication and use it to spin up the projectdataprovider class which takes an inoterepository in it s constructor to avoid having to put the inoterepository somewhere in my dto -class

1969522
google-chrome	firefox
tested it in google-chrome and should work in firefox too

1969545
post	get
but some fundamental but very important questions are still beyond my knowledge so i made this post to get help and clarification from you guys

1969545
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
say i use some programming language as my backend language php python .net java etc and i deploy my application with a web server apache lighttpd nginx iis etc

1969548
post	get
the post located at details what i had to do to get it working

1969576
width	text-align
those css classes have got declared width and text-align and in that manner i m making sure that header and table body cells stay aligned properly

1969576
google-chrome	safari
i ve got problems with webkit browsers google-chrome and safari

1969576
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is important for me. they are rendering width of table body cells 5px less than ie and firefox

1969589
put	get
if you get more requests than you can deal they will be put on queue

1969641
postgresql	mysql
however this scenario is not supported by microsoft linq to sql server only by the devart implementations for oracle mysql postgresql and sqlite

1969641
postgresql	mysql
ado.net data providers for oracle mysql postgresql sqlite with

1969702
mp3	m3u
the problem is that you are reading not mp3 stream but m3u playlist file

1969707
int	chars
have a look at the memory layout of your structs print out sizeof float sizeof int sizeof chars sizeof md3_frame_header_t etc

1969715
folder	directory
you need to add an image list to your form add a folder icon to it there is one in the borland common files and then associated the image list with the directory treeview and the filetree treeview

1969748
postgresql	mysql
outside of using a transactional engine innodb if you re using mysql or just use postgresql etc. and wrapping the relevant atomic activities there s not a great deal you can do

1969789
explode	substr
for this i ve explode the components of the phrase into individual substr and now i am trying to compare them to the word i am looking for but it doesn t work

1969809
min	max
so i see that max min is possible to do without branching

1969853
set	bag
you have two options you must either add a bag set list to the class owner with cascade-delete

1969860
min	max
where min_max computes min and max of an array of 500 doubles 100 000 times using a naive loop

1969871
min	max
if your are using intel s ipp library you can use the vector statistical functions to calculate vector min max among other things

1969884
maven	pom.xml
i m aware that maven offers a filtering ability which makes it possible to specify the database settings as property inside my pom.xml and reference them inside my hibernate.properties as

1969886
reparsepoint	ntfs
reparsepoint means that there s a reparse point on this directory which causes ntfs to look at some special data that s been stored along with the directory

1969890
innodb	myisam
the difference will be even more apparent if you store the posts in an innodb table instead of a myisam

1969915
getter	setter
synthesize propertyname automates the generation of getter and setter methods

1970037
min	max
since you probably have many of these values there is little value in calculating and recalculating these value spans and factors for every value nor for that matter in passing those min max limits around all the time

1970060
bluetooth	usb
all the libraries i found until now support devices connected via com usb bluetooth infrared but non of them support a direct connection via ip using a com to ip redirector or virtual com port is not an option for us

1970066
joomla	phpbb
if you need user integration for joomla and phpbb you can use jfusion so people logged in joomla will be logged in phpbb

1970066
joomla	phpbb
registered users in joomla will be replicated to phpbb too and vice versa you have to setup jfusion configuration to decide which system is the master

1970068
keydown	keyup
what i usually do is start the timeout on keyup and clear the timeout on keydown or keypress

1970101
mako	genshi
mako jinja genshi all offer a more flexible alternative to django templates

1970142
getter	setter
val html methods in jquery act as getter and as setter

1970148
serializable	deserialization
it is just a holder of information using boost variant and some serializable deserialization stuff

1970151
width	height	min	max
maybe you have to manage the scrollpolicy and the max min height width values

1970160
innodb	myisam
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

1970176
innodb	myisam
imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system

1970200
put	get
and if you want to insist on typing a prefix to get completion put the above in a class

1970203
post	put
you d probably be better off in this case to put a currenttextid on your post table to avoid having to figure out which revision is current an alternative would be a flag on revision but i think a currenttextid on the post will give you easier queries

1970210
innodb	myisam
you could use innodb for your write database transactions but read back from an myisam database which is denormalized

1970210
innodb	myisam
you know you re data is safe with referential integrity from innodb and you can read it as fast as you d like with myisam

1970229
post	get
however when i post the data and use i get the other elements that were there before i dynamically added the jquery code but not the file elements

1970235
freemarker	velocity
pages could be modified using standard jsps or perhaps via apache velocity or freemarker templates

1970238
maven	m2e
i am using eclipse 3.51 maven 2.0.9 java 1.4 with the maven eclipse plugin 2.7 with wtp 2.0 not m2e

1970242
innodb	myisam
myisam is fast but may get currupted easily innodb is slow but is more stable thanks to transactions and foreign keys

1970254
stdout	stderr
this is probably because whiptail uses stdin and stdout to print the input box so you cannot redirect stderr directly to stdout but you need to swap them e.g

1970256
innodb	myisam
taken from mysql - innodb vs myisam

1970258
innodb	myisam
i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search

1970289
width	height
the div needs to be flexible in width and height

1970312
put	get	post	put	post	get
so that means show gets one the record to show index will get all a post will create new put will edit and delete will destroy

1970326
jar	.war
deploy your application as a .zip .war the archive contains your project s jar and all dependent jars

1970331
fiddler	charles
http proxies like fiddler httpwatch or charles are other alternatives

1970337
nonetype	iterable
that s the cause for nonetype object is not iterable because you re trying to iterate over it with for x in all_mods

1970340
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

1970365
put	get
when i put in import statements such as from entries.models import entry i get the models from these apps ignored by syncdb because the imports are circular or when i remove one or both of them i get validation errors

1970420
innodb	myisam
people say innodb is not so fast like myisam

1970430
accessor	properties
once you get the hang of it you ll also get a feel for when you need the test and when you don t -- automatic properties accessor for instance don t need to be unit tested imo

1970442
cpython	ironpython
i m using the same test code in cpython and ironpython in cpython it works but i m getting

1970446
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t happen in firefox nor google-chrome

1970470
windows	winpe
by doing this the dialog is not dependent on any other windows files and can be run in winpe 2.0

1970476
vimeo	flickr	youtube	vimeo
the match method looks if there are any sub-string that match the list of providers youtube flickr vimeo etc

1970535
innodb	myisam
for example - select count queries are cheap when run on a myisam table but can be really slow when run on an innodb table

1970535
innodb	myisam
also a lot of people don t configure their installation for innodb performance - especially if they re used to myisam which performs pretty well on a rather default mysql installation

1970535
innodb	myisam
my advice would be to run your own tests by taking a couple of top queries and running them against myisam tables and then innodb versions

1970588
hide	show
after the image is loaded you hide the loading gif and show the image itself

1970598
addition	multiplication
in addition to the other suggestions you might try using integer multiplication as part of the hash function for example

1970610
min	max
better to have a data base table with id min max description fields that you load when your app initializes

1970613
width	height
note height and width should be the size of the loaing image.

1970629
profiling	debugging
the one project that meets all your requirements with the exception of profiling is the excellent django debugging toolbar

1970694
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
consider using a sorteddictionary or a sortedlist instead if you need an ordered map

1970713
put	get
i at first thought it was a package issue so put the three classes in a package but i didn t know enough about packages to get it working

1970741
put	get
if you can t change the json i would put the objects into an associative array using there aid as the key so you can directly get to the objects as needed

1970755
getter	setter
the hydration process is the process of converting a plain boring mysql result set into nice objects having getter and setter

1970764
subtraction	addition
this gets complicated though especially if you want to start overloading operators to support year addition and subtraction

1970801
innodb	myisam
for instance innodb can do row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking

1970805
min	max
after that it was easy enough to join the table to itself using max min and comparisons on the line number to keep the sections together

1970832
debian	linux
i am working with an atmel at91sam9263-ek development board arm926ej-s core armv5 instruction set running debian linux 2.6.28-4

1970832
freebsd	linux
yes i realize that freebsd is not exactly the same as linux but my point is that it doesn t hurt to be carefully sure

1970866
put	get
on the other hand there s a possibility the tcl isn t the problem at all - if you can get at the tcl source put after 1000000 or the like after the tool call

1970868
comparator	comparable
users of the api can then pass in their own classes which implement those interfaces and you code will work on those classes even though they didn t exist yet when it was written such as java.util.arrays.sort being able to sort anything that implements comparable or comes with a suitable comparator

1970903
youtube	vimeo
i was wondering if anyone knew of a way to only allow embed codes like ones from youtube vimeo blip.tv etc

1970904
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

1970931
mouse	keyboard
in this case you need to put the ui thread into a busy wait loop where it calls application.doevents to keep message handling running so the progress bar will work but you need to add a messagefilter that only allows your application to respond to safe events it would allow paint events so your application windows continue to redraw but it would filter out mouse and keyboard messages so that the user can t actually do anything in the proigram while the export is in progress

1970973
jboss	weblogic
as it is written here i presume you needed it in weblogic in order for the oracle driver to participate in xa two-phase commit transactions if that s so i would suggest that you use the native xa datasource that oracle provides oracle.jdbc.xa.client.oraclexadatasource and fetch the datasource from the jndi along with jboss s own transaction manager

1970983
redmine	trac
while requisite pro enforces a standard and that can certainly help you in your task i d certainly second mark on trying to standardize the input by agreement with personnel and using a more flexible tool like trac redmine which both have incredibly fast deploy and setup times especially if you host them from a vm or even a custom one if you can get the management to endorse your project

1971005
hide	show
after viewing the adobe slideshow i think the way i would attempt to get that to work using the android java sdk would be to create a listview object with a transparent background and then dynamically hide show it in that position when the menu button is clicked by setting the view s visibility to visible or gone

1971063
invokelater	invokeandwait
if so i would recommend using invokelater to build the swing components as i have noticed that opera can sporadically crash at start up with invokeandwait

1971084
put	get
if you put in x then you should get y i don t see any issue there

1971133
jstl	taglib
jstl provides pretty everything you need in the core fmt and function taglib

1971257
hide	show
then when you want to hide flowlayoutpanel1 you can just toggle the visible property to hide show it

1971280
awt	swing
awt swing

1971305
post	get
i am trying to get this flash carousel to show up in a wordpress post

1971305
post	put
now here is the code i put in the post i am working on

1971330
for-loop	loops
that means loops control variable is initialized before the for-loop

1971332
for-loop	loops
end of loops iteration so this just means there is no initialisation of anything in this for-loop

1971336
accessor	properties
in each of your data object s properties set accessor test for a change in value and mark the object as dirty

1971339
for-loop	loops
but the value of hole just before the for-loop was already 1 then you can slip this initilization part of loops

1971371
mbunit	nunit
i d switch to nunit or personally mbunit later on

superclass	subclassing
if you want a per-subclass counter then declare a map in the superclass with key subclassing s class and value the counter value as suggested by

1971612
bmp	png
one easy way to get a hash sum of just the pixel data would be to convert the jpeg into a 32bit bmp or alternatively into png and to calculate a hashsum from that

1971721
memcached	apc
i know they are several cache systems and php frameworks already out there but my host don t have apc or memcached installed and i m not using any framework for this particular project

1971723
width	height
one way i ve done this is to grab the layer s bounds multiply the bounds width and height by the old and new anchorpoint s normalized values take the difference of the two anchorpoints and apply that difference to the position of the layer

1971795
width	height
it animates the width and or height when a boolean dependencyproperty is toggled

1971814
subtract	add
i don t know how to add subtract 1 hour in oracle dateadd hh... does it in sybase

1971822
multiplying	add
you can iterate over each bucket get it s size bucket_size size_t bucket_num multiplying that by the size of a pair of key and values and add them all up to give you a rough estimate of the memory used

1971834
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox as the main testing platform and google-chrome for mac as the secondary

1971834
google-chrome	firefox
just to be clear google-chrome is showing the textarea 20px down as compared to firefox

1971884
free	malloc
later when the pointer from malloc is passed to free a corresponding diagnostic version of free is called

1971884
free	malloc
diagnostic wrapper functions for malloc can also address other misuses of malloc such as multiple calls to free for same memory block

1971884
strdup	calloc	strdup	malloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	strdup	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
when wrapping the malloc api one must wrap all of the related functions including calloc realloc and strdup

1971884
free	malloc
if the need arises to code a call to the standard implementation for example the allocated block will be passed to a third-party binary-only library which expects to free the block using the standard free implementation the original function names can be accessed rather than the preprocessor macro by using malloc s -- that is place parentheses around the function name

1971912
ant	maven
i need to execute some ant commands depending on an environment variable passed in as a parameter to the maven build command

1971986
postgresql	mysql
im running on postgresql but i suppose the problem is the same on mysql

1972037
getter	setter
workaround rename outlet variable name or rename setter getter methods to be different from kvc notation.

1972039
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing needs to know when particular events occur withing its superclass but there are more than one ways for the superclass to break the news

1972043
for-loop	loops
i would probably give loops index in the second for-loop a more desciptive name like marblesremaining so it s clearer what it is and does not need to be explained by comments

1972048
range	max
it s in that range but it s not evenly distributed unless 90 or nbr divides max rand

1972057
versioning	upgrade
a team responsible for a project that has a reference to the library can decide on both the versioning that they are going to code against and the timing of any upgrade

1972067
nunit	mstest
i ve actually never used mstest myself since i started learning tdd with nunit right away

1972171
min	max
this is not a trivial project and you may find that a library that already does this would be your best approach but places to start would be mapping attributes to html form components and the min max occues to javascript events

1972173
spaces	delimiter
this last query assumes that you are using a comma as your delimiter and that there is no white spaces in the string

1972203
pull	push
you can then check server side if there are some new notifications and if there are then you ll push it even though it s a pull - to the client and kill the script

1972243
kde	gnome
you need to have they installed but if you re on linux using kde qt is natively installed for default the same for gnome and also the same of cocoa on mac and cocoa-touch on iphone and ipod touch

1972257
jar	manifest.mf
regarding your meta information question sometimes you get some environment information when you unpack the jar and have a look at meta-inf manifest.mf file

1972289
clearance	devise
i suggest clearance or devise if you haven t

1972294
automake	autotools
it s a bit of a steep learning curve but the most common solution for all of these problems is to use the gnu autotools toolchain autoconf and automake specifically

1972294
scons	autotools
there are some alternative build systems that support some similar auto-configuration behavior like cmake and scons that might be worth looking into if autotools feels like too much

1972303
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers google-chrome safari

1972315
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
if anyone can break this down into something i can understand with basic operators + - and functions sin cos sqrt etc. i d really appreciate it

1972317
int	double
the int local is convertible to a double the literal is convertible to a double and obviously they will never be equal

1972318
vb6	vba
vba thus vb6 doesn t have a garbage collector per se but it does use reference counting to automatically clean up after itself

1972334
heapsort	in-place
sort all sets using heapsort for in-place sorting o 1 space

1972336
tabcontrol	tabitem
i need to be able to manipulate different types of configurations in tabs in the same tabcontrol meaning that the content of the tabitem must be dynamically generated

1972336
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a controltemplate called pendantconfigurationtabitemtemplate defined in my window resources and i use the following code to apply the template which contains a named item i need to access to the tabitem and add them to their parent tabcontrol

1972339
pop-up	dialog
i ll assume by dialog you mean a pop-up that is invisible at page load and made visible by say a click on something in the existing html

1972339
hide	show
lastly you can play with the visibility of your popup div with the display none style and the show and hide methods on the widget

entity-relationship	diagram
in the past i have seen tables related to one piece of functionality represented in one color in the entity-relationship diagram

1972420
next	except
control works fine except that when the user hits tab when inside one of the value text boxes on the right the focus shifts away from my control to the next control in the hiearchy

1972424
post	put
in the future though please put new questions in a new post

1972460
free	malloc
thus a reviewer can glance at the code to make sure that each malloc has a matching free

1972475
integer	fractions
fractions are rounded up to an integer

1972490
ostream	istream	std	ostream
std istream and std ostream respectively

1972501
free	malloc
the simple advantage is this if the programmer un-intentionally introduced a memory leak the warning is there as the adage in c is this for every malloc there should be a corresponding free if you do not have it then you have a leak

1972504
for-loop	arrays
most will prefer the for-loop because that is the familiar way of doing something to every item in arrays in sequence

1972513
cpython	pypy
however the whole point is irrelevant because as mark points out you can always reverse engineer the byte code anyway especially in cases like cpython pypy rubinius yarv tinyrb rubygolightly where the bytecode format was specifically designed to be very close to the source language

1972526
getter	setter
the third option is also considered bad practice since you should not provide getter setter for all of your fields only the ones that need it

1972560
google-chrome	firefox
i have exactly the same problem as you do except i m using ie7 ie takes about 16 seconds to load localhost while firefox and google-chrome loads it in an instant

1972572
versioning	upgrade
all iphones and ipod touches can upgrade the firmware as new versioning become available

1972630
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

1972630
ironruby	ironpython
however we rarely pin ironruby up against ironpython

1972644
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
the text editors with sharpdevelop and monodevelop may be useful

1972655

1972742
lua	scheme
i use scripting languages like lua python or scheme to provide an interface for the user to extend the software

1972748
boost	stl
read sources of boost and stl try to copy and modify some of the code from them that is a good way

by default cron jobs get a minimal environment which will almost certainly not have the full path and a host of other environment variables that your login sessions have

1972763
jobs	cron
from a login session to get the full environment then make sure that my cron jobs execute that script before attempting to do the real work

1972818
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
so you loop down the digits and every time you multiplying the value so far by 10 subtract 0 from the current character and add it

1972918
concave	convex
i love that there is no real trigonometry required and it works for convex and concave and it performs reasonably well as the number of sides increases

if your objects like in an rss feed have a well defined base it makes sense to come up with a base objects which encapsulates the well defined base but also has some kind of hash map for your freedom

1973617
gif	png
for an img you could set the source of the image to be a blank png or gif style it with a css sprite background image then set the img s alt and title tags to whatever they need to be

qtabbar	qwidget	qtabwidget	qwidget	qtabwidget	qtabbar
qtabwidget associates a qwidget to each tab of a qtabbar

1973686
qstackedwidget	qtabbar	qtabwidget	qtabbar	qtabwidget	qstackedwidget
the best advantage is that qtabwidget combines qtabbar and qstackedwidget behaviors

1973744
google-chrome	firefox
everything looks fine in ie8 and 6 and firefox google-chrome etc but in ie7 the bottom 3 boxes float above some of the main content box

this makes it impossible to include and open files in folder above your in the directory structur you can t use .. to go up in the folder structure

1973926
width	height
you may have the position of the width height properties wrong

1974013
pascal	delphi
you can make it longer i think by concatinating together using + but its a very old limit based on the fact that in pascal and delphi 1 all strings were limited to a maximum of 255 characters

1974059

ddms	adt
if you develop using the eclipse adt plugin open the ddms perspective after launching the emulator and look for the emulator control view

1974506
oncreate	findviewbyid

1974516
uiview	uipagecontrol
the uiview used at the â œhomeâ screen of iphone is a uiscrollview alongwith uipagecontrol

1974521
portrait	landscape
if you have a report that can be printed both in portrait or landscape the easiest way to buid this would be a layout for portrait and one for landscape

1974521
portrait	landscape
you could show a printersetupdailog before loading the report and depending on the orientation load the portrait or landscape layout

1974528
width	height
it will work on all screen resolutions as it takes the total screen width and height then divides it in half thus giving the center of the screen then it subtracts your width and height settings to take them into account but divides them by half as well to offset the window as without the offset it will not be centered

1974563
width	height
i have used the following code to save the width and height

1974632
queue	fifo
a stack would give you last-in-first-out lifo where you would more than likely want to utilize a queue for fifo fifo as you would want to be dequeuing key characters that first came on the stack

1974735
equals	gethashcode
object identity doesn t work properly unless you abuse equals gethashcode

1974735
equals	gethashcode
clearly the definition of it as being able to persist ordinary classes is a fallacy because the nhibernate ones are only ordinary insofar as not referencing framework-specific classes whereas they are extraordinary inasmuch as they require unusual design choices such as default constructors and all-virtual members and equals gethashcode implementations on mutable types

1974744
button	checkbox
i will select the newsletters that i want to send by checking the checkbox and clicking on a send button

1975179
post	get
from the post querydicts i get the selected action request.post

1975184
maple	sage	maple	maxima	sage	maxima
if you want to do very precise arithmetic as opposed to writing c++ code to do very precise arithmetic you should look at mathematica maple and their open-source competition such as maxima sage and probably others

exif	jfif
what i have found out is that the ff d8 ff e0 magic indicates a jfif jpeg whereas the ff d8 ff e1 indicates an exif jpeg

1975247
implements	extends
just extends lazytreemodel and implements loadchildren

1975325
overwrite	preserve
i don t want to overwrite the keys numbers with new values as the code works - eval preserve this already so my new code should do the same

1975331
apache	lighttpd
i know that i need an http server such as apache or lighttpd

1975346
octal	decimal
the reason you re getting the error is that javascript treats numbers that begin with 0 as octal numbers which cannot have decimal

1975366
filesystems	hfs+
it appears that the issue is not with git but is related to case sensitivity of the filesystems hfs+

1975407
post	get
a generic handler accepts get post requests and gives you the ability to completely control the output via the httpcontext

1975434
cvs	svn
it has support for cvs svn svk git

1975449
apache	lighttpd
when the request arrives at port 80 it is collected by your http server which is probably apache but might be lighttpd or any other http server

1975449
apache	lighttpd
cgi containers do the same job in a slighly different way the reason you might choose one over the other is likely to be related to what http server you are using mod_python is designed for apache for example something like fastcgi is used more with lighttpd and to performance considerations

1975453
rss	feed
the reader re-fetches the rss feed now and then for example two times per hour or more often if the reader learns that it s an often updated feed

in the constructor of your class that extends dialog call super context r.style.customdialog

1975511
fflush	gets	stdout	fflush
i fflush stdout so the web browser gets the whole page

1975527
children	parent
you then use string or xquery functions to find children of a parent etc

1975548
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
each row contains a couple of textboxes a dropdownlistfor and a checkbox which are all .net form controls rather than plain html controls i should point out

1975548
inherited	properties
so i tried to create a custom class that inherited from checkbox and tried to override the viewstate properties to make it public so that it can be read from

1975548
public	protected
but then i basically found out that you can t override a protected member with a public one

1975641
ant	maven
i understand that you are a maven beginner but i d suggest to try to use it though instead of falling back on ant or you won t get the benefits of it

1975691
ant	maven
once you progress past hello world you ll find yourself scripting it or using tools like ant and maven that will help you set the classpath for your project

1975716
min	max
x min x max x min-max

1975725
ienumerable	iqueryable
regarding the combinatorial explosion of find methods in .net you can return an iqueryable instead of an ienumerable and allow the calling client to run a linq query on it instead of using a find method

1975748
min	max
1 min-max - same as 1 n with check n min and n max non-nullable

1975752

you could work with a ram disk if you want to have the benefits - look for instance at this article at superuser.com

1975957
width	height
you can however specify height and width for you new window

1975966
datatrigger	eventtrigger
i ve looked at datatrigger but they seem to require an equality condition to hold and eventtrigger seem to not be possible to attached to any events to do with the display of data

1975970
youtube	vimeo
another cool way is to use one of the video apis to upload encode to the cloud youtube data api vimeo api hey

1976035

you don t need to get hold of the entire inputstream in a under the hood massive byte buffer and then write it away to the outputstream

1976534

rel	alt
this doesn t work it works for other attributes such as alt rel etc

1977327
xslt	schematron
while you can validate using schema schematron just uses xslt and results in an xml document that has validation messages that you can make user friendly

1977624
anjuta	gnome
i thought that anjuta is the default ide for gnome applications

1977635

kde	gnome
on windows you will need some trickery with pywin32 and the windows api on linux the answer will depend on which desktop is running - kde gnome or something more exotic

cruisecontrol	jenkins
svn itself does not do continuous integration ci but there are many ci servers that integrate well with svn cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net jenkins hudson...

portrait	landscape
so when the phone is rotated from landscape to portrait mode i d like rectangleview and all its subviews to keep their original shape and position relative to each other but just get smaller

1978454

my understanding was that adding the retain attribute to the property declaration and using the necessary synthesize delcaration in the implementation file will basically do the following setter and getter for me

1980536

1981004
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	centos	gentoo	debian	redhat	fedora
they offer centos debian 5 fedora 10 to 12 gentoo redhat el 5 and ubuntu 8 and 9

1981050
jobs	cron
cron jobs or php scheduler

1981078
bazaar	git
bazaar get is alias of bazaar branch which is roughly equivalent of git clone

1981101
google-chrome	firefox
if i use the tag google-chrome and firefox do not render the page correctly

1981105
jobs	cron
when you don t have access to cron jobs or scheduled tasks on your server you can use online services such as to hit your script at specified intervals

1981137
actualheight	actualwidth
i have tried several ways involving bindings to actualwidth actualheight but can t get it to work

1981144
put	get
this should get called before you re put on screen in both the initial push and the pop case

1981151
maven	pom.xml
in maven multi-module projects where i want each of the modules to always keep the same version as the parent i ve typically done something like the following in the module s pom.xml

1981161
ubuntu	linux
using ubuntu linux with qt 4.6.0

1981175
width	height
my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

1981192
bazaar	svn
if you change your mind later and want it to behave more like svn you can do a bazaar bind and any commits you make will automatically be committed to the parent branch

1981215
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m not having a problem with your code in firefox google-chrome or safari

1981240
profiler	gprof
you can use gprof which is a free profiler

1981327
width	height
i assumed i can anchor the width but set the height manually anchor the left right and top edges

1981336
subclass	abstract-class
when someone wants to create a form he must subclass formviewcontroller and implement its abstract-class

1981343
width	height
i d create a calayer the width of the line and height of the view set its background color to the line color and attach it to the view at the position desired

1981383
springsource	grails
grails is developed by springsource whereas no big company is behind lift

1981388
implements	extends
if you implements runnable as well as extends activity then you could handle the code like this.

1981404
put	get
i tried clickhandler and to put the image on a pushbutton and get the element from this pushbutton but all don t work

1981406
int	double
any two subclasses of number such as int and double are expected to add together properly in an oop language

1981415
getter	setter
add getter and setter method to your class

1981427
getter	setter
this is the way but i would suggest to write a getter and setter for that variable

1981434
inherited	properties
rather than having all your gameobjects inherited properties from gameobject

1981446
treemap	treeset
if you need to iterate through the people or require them to have ordering consider treemap or treeset instead of hashing

1981485
haskell	scheme
my advise would be to learn a functional language maybe start with scheme then move to haskell

1981542
keydown	keyup
you would test for them in either the keydown or keyup events

1981543
outputstream	inputstream
note that like balusc and michael borgwardt say readers and writers are for text if you just want to copy the file you should use inputstream and outputstream you are only concerned with bytes

1981550
getter	setter
if you are going to follow the examples given using getter setter or setting it in the constructor change it to private since those are ways to control what is set in the variable

1981567
pecl	pear
it seems like pecl is using pear to perform installations

1981587
memcpy	memset
using std vector which has its own copy and assignment facilities seems like a better bet for memcpy and i ve never really believed in the magic of setting everything to zero which seems to be the main use for memset

1981590
post	get
i hesitate to post the solution because it is going to get you into enormous trouble

1981590
pull	push
there is no safe push model only pull

1981592
memcpy	memset
memset and memcpy simply take address parameters for a source and destination and these parameters can technically be to any address in your application s address space

1981593
memset	malloc
it s obvious that the dst pointer could be allocated any valid way new malloc or even statically - memset doesn t care

1981594
outputstream	inputstream
you already have an outputstream at hands so just get an inputstream of the file and pipe the bytes from input to output it the usual java io way

1981594
outputstream	inputstream	outputstream	bufferedinputstream	bufferedoutputstream	inputstream	bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
to improve performance a bit more you can always wrap the inputstream and outputstream in an bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream respectively

1981596
memcpy	memset
if you have allocated an object s then using memcpy or memset could lead to un-defined behavior

1981604
button	checkbox
how much time can be considered as acceptable time for setting value to text box like 1 sec for 20characters or what range of time will be considered as acceptable for clicking on button selecting value from combobox selecting checkbox available in grid etc

1981611
jobs	cron
the idea of cron and scheudled jobs seems to run counter to what you re actually trying to do

1981620
typemock	moles
if you absolutely need to use test doubles for unit tets involving httpsessionstate this is still possible with certain invasive dynamic mocks such as typemock or moles althought these carry plenty of disadvantages as well see this comparison of dynamic mocks

1981658
sorting	filtering
i can separately do pagination mislav will_paginate sorting and filtering but together i m having some problems combining them

1981674
put	get
so if you put something in the viewdata when a page is requested then expect your controller to be able to get it back when a form on that page is posted it won t be there

1981723
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu 9.04 g++ 4.3.3 and for memory testing mudflap library

1981778
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i make a request with firefox ie google-chrome or safari it takes takes about one second before my server sees that there is a new connection to be accepted

1981778
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using other clients wget own test client that just opens a socket than firefox ie google-chrome safari seeing the new connection is matter of milliseconds

1981785
integer	radix
it takes a string and an optional radix which should always be supplied and parses the number as an integer in that radix or a radix based on the format of the number if none is supplied which is why you should always supply one

1981814
put	get
by using explicit joins you will get a syntax error if you forget to put in a join condition and a cross join must be explicitly specified as such

1981842
implements	extends
the jdk also provides the class xmlfilterimpl which implements all of the interfaces of defaulthandler but does not extends from it .

1981845
textarea	textbox
it is impractical for me to use textarea when only 15 or 20 characters are allowed in the textbox

1981897
post	get
check out phil haack s blog post on how to get this to work

1981938
post	get
ajax requests via get and post

1981952
single-quotes	double-quotes
if you can control the input to enforce that the string will be enclosed in double-quotes and that all elements withing the string will be enclosed in single-quotes and that no element can contain a single-quote then you can split on

1981960
cpu	affinity
the thread affinity apis are generally only used when someone gets totally anal about the difference in performance in accessing cpu memory locatations from different cores

1981987
udp	tcp
if you want to fuzz the ip udp or tcp route your packets from your high level services via loopback to a process that reads them fuzzes them and forwards them

1982020
public	protected
you can then add fields and properties and methods public private or protected

1982067
put	get
now if i put immediately after the addtxn then the subsequent code does indeed get the post-addtxn acctbal value

1982137
disk	ram
by splitting it into two passes you may also gain performance even without mutlithreading by doing all the input processing and then all the output processing as separate stages which will probably reduce the disk seeking involved depending on how much ram you have available for disk caches on your pc

1982142
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari everything works perfectly

1982165
for-loop	loops
for complicated processing such as lists inside lists you might want to use a for-loop for the outer layer and a list comprehension for the inner loops

1982215
children	parent
i m unsure how to alter the ui.helper.bind so that it s binding to the clickable children rather than the draggable parent

1982230
imagemagick	im4java
i m using im4java to call imagemagick from a grails app

1982252
ati	nvidia
32 seems to be typical for nvidia chips 64 for ati

1982255
udp	tcp
also the tcp udp port numbers of ip

1982255
udp	tcp
checksums both ip and tcp udp must

1982343
hide	show
that would show one set of children the first time they hover then hide and the next time show a different set of children

1982388
system.in	system.out
see the documentation for system in particular system.out system.err system.in

1982389
stdout	stderr
use system.out and system.err to write to stdout and stderr respectively

1982394
hide	show
basically hide all the divs and un-hides the one that needs to be show passed as arg in function from onclick event

1982403
system.in	system.out	awt	swing
there s not a new console project or similar in eclipse but you d just make a new java project and read write to system.out system.in system.err and not use a gui framweork such as swing awt to be a console application

1982411
put	get
they re not just magic devices where you put in the sql and get out result sets but rather very complicated pieces of software with their own logic and quirks

1982425
webkit	gecko
the only alternatives i can think about is using any web browser engine like webkit gecko etc

1982476
accessor	properties	getter	setter
it creates accessor methods to get and set the properties it would create a getter method to return that nsmutablearray and a setter method to allow you to replace it with another nsmutablearray

1982524
udp	tcp
and then look for the referenced sockets by the inode in proc net tcp or proc net udp

1982549
int	chars
and int foo chars

1982642
width	height
you can set the div s width or height to a percentage as well and with overflow auto the div contents will scroll if the browser is sized to less than the content

1982764
pull	push
you can do a pull or push from the website database wsdb to the enterprise database edb and vice-versa

1982780
viewdidload	viewdidappear
also i d move this code to viewdidappear rather than viewdidload

1982841
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is likely the most popular os for rails probably because of ubuntu being a very popular linux distro

1982841
heroku	engineyard
i would also second other people s recommendations of heroku and engineyard as well

1982849
implements	extends
if there are common tasks responsibilities in your two timers you could create an abstract timer that implements these common tasks and extends it for more specific behavior method implementation

1982850
mouse	keyboard
then all you have to do is hook up the event handlers to deal with the mouse and keyboard

1982876
children	parent
i actually would like 4 states - checked unchecked indeterminate like a tri-state box - parent is tri-state if not all of the children are checked and notappicable this checkbox would be an x and greyed out

1982878
width	height
it represents a picture with previously known width and height

1982954
addclass	removeclass
rather than removeclass and addclass

1982980
atomikos	bitronix
the exact same error occurs when i switch from the bitronix transaction manager to the atomikos transaction manager

1982994
vmware	virtualbox
i used virtualbox when it only had linear destructive snapshot reversion -- i understand that vbox has improved but vmware still has it beat for snapshot capabilities

1983003
google-chrome	safari
but this solution works like a charm on google-chrome and safari

1983029
floating-point	integer
recent intel compilers achieve significantly better performance on floating-point heavy benchmarks and are similar to visual c++ on integer heavy benchmarks

1983053
profiling	debugging
it does a great job of helping you analyze this information including directly showing you how your code lays out showing you misses blocks and many other useful tools for debugging and profiling concurrent apps

1983120
for-loop	arrays
that tends to be less error prone since you can just use a for-loop across the arrays and not have to keep track of start and end pints which i always get wrong for what it s worth

1983147
accessor	properties
well your synthesize doesn t match properties declaration - you re declaring properties for mobinfo but generating synthesized accessor for mobinfo

1983150
jobs	cron
if the user as whom the webserver runs is allowed to have cron jobs and the system is correcty set up then its simply a matter of executing the cron program popen exec system....etc and feeding it an appropirate input file

1983150
jobs	cron
however on any sensibly configured internet connected webserver the httpd user will not be allowed to run cron jobs

1983183
cpu	processors
support cpu dispatching this is really important since it allows the compiler to target the processors for optimized instructions when the program runs

1983186
getter	setter
now i had this problem in the past and that was caused by me trying to over optimize each entity class by making the setter and getter final

1983186
getter	setter
hibernate needs to setup proxying for the entity classes so it can lazy load stuff so if i make a setter getter final it can t do that

1983239
min	max
if you want a readable format you can use a level meter uiprogressview or your own where the max is 0.0 and the min is -60.0 you can adjust depending on the noise floor

1983249
width	height
displaying a rectangle and binding width height angle to a view model class works as i expect in xaml

1983249
width	height
however when creating a rectangle in the code-behind i can bind to the height and width but not the angle

1983270
subclass	abstract-class
this is an abstract-class which you can subclass and implement the abstract method which maps namespace uris on to prefixes

1983285
qtkit	quicktime
quicktime player should use an almost identical backing as any other app on the system qtkit

1983387
pull	push
if you re not a vb expert you could mabye even do the pull push outside of excel on script level pulling the data from mysql into an excel sheet before opening excel easy and writing it back after closing it

1983410
range	max	range	min	min	max
the master qscrollarea s horizontalscrollbar s rangechanged int min int max signal to a slot that sets the main widget s horizontal qscrollbar to the same range

1983430
outputstream	inputstream
by example if you want to copy a file you need to read from an inputstream and write to an outputstream

1983529
gtk	gdk
such tests are common in gtk gdk internals - things like i m expecting this pointer to be a such-and-such but i better make sure before i treat it that way. each message pair you see indicates a pointer has been passed to such a routine but what it points to is not only not the expected object type it s not even pointing to anything the rtti system recognizes so the rtti system is throwing up its hands

1983541
erlang	lisp	homoiconicity	lfe
if you are not scared of lists you might try using lfe lisp flavoured erlang to generate code as with all lisp there is no special abstract form it s all homoiconicity and much easier to work with

1983563
free	malloc
lastly it seems that any program created with visual c++ 6 using malloc free or new delete seems to be affected on these newer platforms

1983568
nstextfield	nsimageview
i hand-wrote two iboutlets nstextfield nsimageview made sure to do the property line in the .h and the synthesize in the .m file

1983658
button	checkbox
using checkbox for radio button is there too

1983660
button	checkbox
you can place a checkbox on the form that will control the checked property of an invisible radio button

1983680
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-border-radius is for webkit based browsers such as safari google-chrome

1983708
post	get
in your tests you re sending a post request and the new action doesn t accept post requests but only get s

1983724
post	get
i get the values fine but i am having trouble to update the primary entity after post

1983727
width	height
the right second sizer is user sizable but a minimum of 960 pixels via a spacer there then a gridsizer that s determined by the level width and height in code

1983737
n-gram	words
a words based n-gram solution might also be worth investigating

1983773
put	get
all the line of code does is changes a pointer but for some reason every time i put it in i get this error

1983807
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is implemented in firefox 3.5 safari 4 and google-chrome 3 but not ie

1983840
width	height
control dimensions height and width can t be set to negative values so code like the following in your form_resize event can cause this error

1983933
free	malloc
if something malloc d memory before it started and then free d it while it was running you d get a negative count

1983943
client-side	server-side
i m using a python socketserver with a trivial message replication systemâ â â all the game logic in my case is on the client-side with some complicated javascript maintaining a consistent game world in the face of lagâ â â but even for a more complex server-side i think a scripting language will probably be just fine

1983983
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie6+.

1984066
clang	llvm
and the clang llvm reports the leak

1984079
post	put
i m looking to write some javascript which will make an ajax put or post request to an http server

1984098
post	get
there is no need for the loop really unless you are doing multiple updates with one post - you can get at any specific record via an xpath query

1984183
rdf	owl
what you seem to be talking about is semantics for which rdf s and owl can be a good starting point

1984201
udp	tcp
am doing a dll in vc++ for blocking ports like tcp sniffer .while blocking udp port in local machine its works fine.while am taking remote computer from my my system its raises on exception

1984213
codeigniter	kohana
if you read the documentation of codeigniter or kohana there is a lot of confusion about the usage of uri and url

1984227
post	get
i thought i would actually post the details of my progress so that we can get out of the comments which dont format as nice

1984228
put	get
if not - then i need to get that damn patch put in place and push 3.0.4 pronto

1984273
google-chrome	safari
by the fact that you are asking the question though i would suggest that you use jquery as testing as various browsers and getting your own framework to work across ie6+ google-chrome safari and other browsers is obviously doable but there are some issues to deal with so unless you want to test on many browsers and resolve the issues go with the one that is already tested

1984356
width	margin
sort of hard to tell without your markup but it seems that in some cases your width + margin + padding would exceed 960px horizontally

1984365
aggregate-functions	sum
also pivot requires that you use an aggregate-functions sum avg count

1984366
3des	aes
on windows you want to find a device that has an api that supports mscapi caping or pkcs#11 the first and last are all very common mscapi however does not support hardware aes 3des

1984370
tcpclient	networkstream
i create the connection using a tcpclient and get a networkstream object from it

1984378
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox safari but in ie the opacity doesn t

1984381
rss	feed
i need to find out if something has changed in a website using an rss feed

1984381
rss	feed
â it can download from any website with an rss feed

1984429
rss	feed
many rss feed use the element which is a child of to indicate when they were last updated

1984449
user-controls	elementhost
i create a simple wpf user-controls any control will do and insert it into a winform using an elementhost

1984454
inherited	properties
instead of switching styles you should use hierarchicaldatatemplate and datatemplate in order to style your treeviewitem they will work similarly unless you want to change certain inherited framework properties

1984470
sprint	branding
leading branding such as sprint verizon clearasil and snickers leverage our paid performance-based distribution solutions to engage their audiences on facebook myspace and myyearbook

1984499
put	get
but the import directives themselves do not get put into the compiled bytecode files the compiler compiles the fully qualified name into the .class file

1984519
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
array allocation should probably a call to calloc or malloc memset

1984536
jobs	cron
my web application requires 6 different cron jobs to run to update timezone sensitive data within tables at 00 01 00 of each timezone

1984544
csla	.net
i just want to add here as this seems to be about .net that you can use csla for the implementation of your model and you get isdirty funcionality and a lot of other things for free

1984636
tiff	png
i need a pcre perl compatible regular expression that will match all non -images jpg png tiff from a list of files

1984712
post	get
i ll try and post some code soon but hopefully this ll help you get some sleep

1984769
hash	md5
using some hash function h say md5 take the hash of each image and store the image with a filename equal to the digest

1984796
coalesce	nvl
coalesce is the ansi equivalent more or less of oracle s nvl function

1984866
put	get
however when i scroll the table loads the new cell s starts the nsurlconnections but when the image is finished loading in code they do not get put into the view until the table actually stops scrolling

1984870
put	get
a standard fresh ci install works perfectly but when i put my app in the same dir i get errors

1984873
tstringlist	tobjectlist	tstringlist	tlist
i would recommend against using tstringlist tlist tobjectlist because insertion deletion in very large lists millions can be painfull because the deletion insertion is o n and inserting in the middle means shifting half the data

1984917
daemon	cron
a counter-question really but i ve noticed that you ve mentioned cron meaning your app is going to be run periodically as opposed to being run continously in a so-called daemon fashion

1984917
ubuntu	debian
anyway since you ve mentioned ubuntu i must say that the script you ve linked doesn t comply with the current standard for initscripts neither for ubuntu nor for debian lenny

1984936
onmousedown	onmouseup
with onmousedown event you can get the co-ordinates of initial letter and with onmouseup the last letter

1984966
for-loop	arrays
i was once curious about this as well and wrote a simple program in java and then an equivalent in c not much more than doing some operation with a for-loop and a massive arrays

1984986
width	height
try putting a div round the silverlight control name the div and use css to give that div a fixed height height 150px and width width 250px both being the width and height of the silverlight control make it position absolute and add a bottom 0px and right 0px to the div class properties adjust the 0px to the number of pixels you want to let the control stand out

1985030
phpunit	simpletest
update it s much easier to run the unit tests with simpletest than with phpunit

1985056
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
opera firefox google-chrome safari all have the expected results of no reload

1985067
int	chars
i basically want to take int name and string age from user in c# and send it to dll method written in c which take int and chars 50 arguments in it and return string .i created following scenario but i am failed any body has the code

1985089
jms	jta
strictly speaking from java ee apis i d suggest to start with jsp servlet jpa ejb 3.0 jax-ws and then maybe jms jta and once you ll have reached this point i think that you ll be skilled enough to learn any other api if required

1985126
wicket	seam
i m partial to spring but there s also of the top of my head seam wicket struts2

1985181
wan	lan
when you switch off nat from your wireless router it can operate as a hub switch and not a router anymore so that you could connect it to the modem using one of its lan socket instead of thro its wan socket

1985199
mouse	keyboard
for example if the site uses javascript that requires the use of a mouse and doesn t have keyboard alternatives it will not be 508 compliant

1985225
try-catch	exception-handling
i can put try-catch clauses around all the calls to the service client and reinstantiate the singleton instance on communication exception-handling but that will involve a lot of boilerplate code

1985240
width	height
i have images in the columns but i include height and width tags on the images so the browser should know in advance the sizing

1985240
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in internet explorer 8 firefox and google-chrome

1985247
vim	emacs
fortunately they do this in a way that is compatible with both emacs and vim modelines

1985247
vim	emacs
both vim s and emacs coding satisfy these requirements.

1985247
vim	emacs	vim	jedit	emacs	jedit
here is a simple modeline generator which generates modelines for vim emacs and jedit

1985254
post	get
i can see plenty of post about where the field description extended property lives and how i can get it but nothing about adding these at the create table stage

1985325
firefox	safari
firefox and safari could easily handle the transparent parts but in ie these parts were just black

1985326
min	max
you can write a generic method to calculate min or max for any type provided that is set appropriately

1985332
unixodbc	iodbc
unless you want some specific features offered by this driver api you can use the php odbc module along with unixodbc iodbc driver or freetds odbc or db-lib

1985338
getter	setter
they have no behaviour but merely a bunch of setter and getter

1985359
actionscript	mxml
i am looking for a way to programmatically dissassoicate the click handler function from a button on my mxml component through actionscript code

1985385
google-chrome	firefox
the problematic part for me is the inclusion of javascript file - it works ok in firefox and google-chrome but ie 7 and 8 as i tested behaves strange

1985447
public	protected
don t forget to mark this field as protected to be visible in inheritors or public to be visible both in inheritors and from outside the class

1985448
public	protected
if the access modifier of the name field is public or protected you will be able to access it in your derived classes

1985448
public	protected
the modifier public will make it visible to all other classes while protected will restrict visibility to the derived classes

1985467
width	height
the same goes for the image width height

1985471
opera	firefox
using unshift instead of push is nearly twice as fast in opera 10 whereas the differences in firefox were negligible

1985478

to read and write ics file in python you can for example use the icalendar package which does precisely that task or vobject which is a much broader package supporting the range of vcard and vcalendar formats including icalendar

1986293
width	margin
changing only width margin padding or border will mean that you have to calculate the div s pixels again

1986293
width	margin
it s a good option to have a outer div which as width and an inner div for the padding and margin

1986364

1986564
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
i am trying to use listactivity and a simplecursoradapter to check boxes based on a query from a database

1986633
firefox	safari
in css 3 you can use border-radius which safari and firefox support currently as -webkit-border-radius and -moz-border-radius

1986641
g++	gcc
without any real life experience with gcc g++ it seems to me that it supports every major platform one can imagine so code that compiles on g++ can run on almost any system

1986678
put	get
for instance if your api has a method that will return some information about a user you ll need to build up an http request in your iphone client and send it to the server via the api url specifying whether it is a get or put or other type of http request

there s an abs int and fabs double and fabsf float and fabsl long but no mention of sign

1986755
g++	gcc
several projects use gcc g++ as a day-to-day compiler for normal use but every so often will check to make sure their code follows the standards with the comeau c c++ compiler

1986817
many-to-one	one-to-many
tables should be modeled based on either having one-to-many or many-to-one relationships depending on the context and of those options they can be either optional or required

1986861
onmouseover	onclick
strip embedded event handler attributes like onmouseover out onclick onkeypress etc

1986901
rss	feed
i m currently building an app that renders rss and atom feed on the client side

1986930
free	realloc
if realloc fails you lose the original pointer and realloc does not free the original memory so you will get a memory leak

1986948
int	chars
i ve tried all sorts of other syntax to declare the extern variable such as chars chars int int etc

1986980
put	get
it turns out that i want to also get back some db.assets that do not have relations in db.assetbundles however i am not sure how to do this i want to put empty space blank strings in the place of the bundle fields of the recentlycreatedassetviewmodel when there is no relation

1986981
distutils	buildout
distutils and easyinstall in addition to buildout

1987000

1987025
post	get
if you want to add something inside the rotation s code then maybe you should also post the code of the rotation functions in order to get help

1987055
memcpy	strcpy
in other words in some implementations you d probably have to use strcpy not memcpy to force the data into the controlled sequence like that

1987055
memcpy	strcpy
while in some other implementations you d have to use memcpy and not strcpy

1987058
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql it is easy with limit and offset clauses

1987076
jboss	weblogic
as for deploying to weblogic and jboss - as long as your code is not using proprietary stuff from j2ee containers vendors you should be fine with one project

1987087
getter	setter
if however you use a dao you end up not being able to trivially extend the data object one of the strengths of xml and you have to create getter and setter for the object that do

1987137
children	parent
write a custom class extending zend_db_table_row and write functions to retrieve the given row s parent and also a rowset of its children

1987137
children	parent
the row class should contain protected data objects to reference the parent and the array of children

1987137
children	parent
write a custom class extending zend_db_table_rowset that has a function to iterate over the rows in the rowset setting parent and children references so that you can subsequently traverse them as a tree

1987153

1987266
profiling	debugging
as far as you re allowed to install stuff on the server xdebug is the way to go for both debugging and profiling

1987308
min	max
as an aside the reason that standard linq can provide a min max is because of icomparable assisted by

1987357
throttling	throttle
i would suggest throttling the bandwidth on the network http request when connected to cellular and having no throttle on wifi

1987393
goto	break
you must use a goto statement for multi level break

1987443
goto	break
no goto needed and the break statement leaves the loop

1987456
post	get
it might be worth your while to check and monitor the http get post s when using your browser to post sample code text and intercept the data and find out..use wireshark or httpwatch

1987465
decimal	ieee
ieee 754 and related floating point numbers cannot accurately represent many decimal values

1987510
post	get
either that or get the raw post data and parse it yourself

1987519
put	get	post	put	post	get
this gets called by the process method which is in turn called by the get post head or put methods

1987538
mp3	wmv
i ve got some heavily modified code that ultimately came from the windows media sdk that works great for reading tags out of mp3 and wmv files

1987569
post	get
another way to do this by using a plugin would be to get a plugin such as recent post by nick momrick

1987591
filesystems	hfs	filesystems	hfs+
however it only actually works on a few filesystems that specifically support it such as apple s hfs and hfs+ and i haven t seen any similar system call on other systems

1987766
post	get
as jspcal suggested your post response should be a redirect to another page requested by a get

1987767
post	get
this probably happens because the post info comes from the page before and isn t really saved anywhere for longer than the transition of pages whereas get uses the url to send the info so the information is stored somewhere

1987788
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox google-chrome but in ie6 7 8 i m getting a this command is not supported error message

1987803

1987812
getter	setter
you can apply scope to property getter setter

1987845
lisp	scheme
lisp ml and scheme all permit body to have side effects

1987845
lisp	scheme
in lisp and scheme the closure stores the locations of the free variables

1987875

on linux ides like emacs vim geany code blocks netbeans use gcc as their compiler

1987887
int	chars
bitfield int chars etc.

1987932
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome and safari the pop up redirects to the canvas url and doesn t close

1987932
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have googled and it seems to be something to do with the xd-receiver.htm file however it seems weird that it is working in ie and firefox but not google-chrome or safari

1987933
subclass	abstract-class
so client can subclass from the abstract-class and just implement the abstract method

1987940
put	get
and then you wrap all your puzzles put them in a map and get them out again hellip

1987961
width	height
in my applcaiton i make grid of size grid width 1300.441 height 80

1988034
cassini	iis
cassini doesn t claim to be multi threaded or handle any of the advanced e-tags or other header control issues that can be issues with iis but are also usually set at sensible defaults in later versions of iis

1988035
getter	setter
the basic idea is to have a builder class that has setter but usually not getter for the different constructor parameters

1988061
int	chars
that said you ll give up simplicity and consistency these types may be a chars type for example which are int types in c c++ and that might lead to surprising function resolutions instead of just using an int

1988075
cassini	iis
will launch the built-in cassini web server not iis

1988109
width	height
this gives a formatting problem when an image has 100 height and width

1988150
qpainter	qtextdocument
i tried using qtextdocument in html and alternatively qpainter

1988168
multiplying	add
collect the digits into a floating point number by shifting powers of 10 before decimal point multiplying by 10.0 and add new number after decimal point divide by a growing power of 10 and add

1988193
width	height
because the p has no height the image can figure out the width but not the height of the bounding element the p

1988193
width	height
the image therefore becomes as large as the width and scales the image - creating a height of 219px

1988193
width	height
and the answer to that has to do with the way height is mangled by the browser which in turn has to do with the allowances given by the browser for things overflowing to the height before allowing an overflow to the width

1988205
strcpy	strncpy
the solution is to either make msg a pointer if your strings are all known at compile-time or if you don t mind dynamically allocating memory or to use strcpy strncpy i personally don t like strncpy because it might not null-terminate the destination

1988215
boost	allocator
i m not sure but i think most boost classes let you specify an allocator

1988242
pop-up	dialog
for example my service class has a showdialog method that takes a frameworkelement and shows it in dialog style either as a window for windows application or as a pop-up on a page for xbap

1988296
ubuntu	linux
each linux distribution has it s own set of programs and features you can change around to your liking but i doubt you want to edit everything that comes in a standard distribution like ubuntu as recompiling everything each time to see changes will take a while

1988313
width	height
it s width and height properties define it s dimensions

1988346
ord	chr
is it possible without using ascii related functions chr or ord suppose those exist

1988364
gentoo	linux
for the specifics install any linux distribution then install the kernel source package gentoo will probably install this by default

1988396
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
using nsurlconnection the timeout is set in the nsurlrequest and the default in the nsmutableurlrequest request is 60 seconds and can be changed using the settimeoutinterval method

1988516
hex	binary
by using binary integers often expressed in hex or

1988541
rss	feed
i ve been trying to grab the digg rss feed and parse its contents into a table as an intro to working with jquery xml

1988545
division	multiplication
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

1988552
division	addition
the problem with ascii is that manipulating the numbers is harder addition is fairly simple but imagine what division would look like

1988558
decimal	ieee
supplement your reading with a trip to wikipedia articles on ieee 754 floating-point number representation and on bcd binary-coded decimal -- not the same thing as your ascii but another similar approach

1988593
range	minimum
check the minimum and maximum values in a range example in you can download the same as well from the same section

1988597
width	height
to get the scale you need to compute the end width height and set it but that shouldn t be a problem

1988610
automake	autotools
if you develop for posix linux platforms or you work only with mingw under win32 that i would suggest to learn how to work with autotools -- autoconf automake libtool and friends

1988615
google-chrome	firefox
i have a div fix on bottom of the page it is working fine in ie7 ie8 firefox and google-chrome

1988625
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
as it turned out i could not achieve this behaviour by handling a combination of combobox s events such as selectedindexchanged selectionchangecommitted textchanged etc. because the combobox control would finally synchronize the textbox field with the selected item from the drop-down list without raising any further events afterwards

1988679
integer	unsigned
the length id should be a 32 bit unsigned integer

1988710
int	chars
btw this means that a lot of objects that are considered falsy in some other languages are actually truthy in ruby like the int 0 the real value 0.0 the empty string the empty array the empty hash the chars f

1988851
memcpy	malloc
if you do need to modify your vertices after initialization you ll need to allocate for each ballsprite its own set of vertex data using malloc and copy the vertex data in using memcpy

1988864
octal	binary
binary in the octal system base 2 the alien would write 1011

1988864
octal	binary
octal in the binary system base 8 the computer would use 13

1988900
width	margin
then you just fill the open space at the right of a cell with another uilabel layout it to cover the open space and set it to autoresize it s width and set the right margin to be fixed

1988903
stdout	stderr
you need to redirect stderr to stdout by using and then pipe | to your logger process

1988951
rss	feed
i m trying to load the parsed html data from an rss feed using a

1988958
width	height
when i set scale in in mxml the width and height of the canvas are adjusted accordingly

1988958
width	height
the canvas now appears on screen to have a width and height of 100 and if inside my creationcomplete callback i check the width and height property they are indeed 100

1988958
width	height
but if i do exactly the same thing except i set the scalex y property from actionscript the canvas on screen appears to have a width and height of 100 as expected but when i check the width and height property of the canvas they are still at the previous values of 1000

1991825
free	malloc
when that s not enough another trick i ve used is to run with my own custom version of malloc and free with code that takes special care to check for common error conditions like freeing something that s already been free regularly verifying freelist pointer integrity looking to see if total memory use is increasing over time etc

client-side	server-side
things to think about here would include persistence expiry both server-side and client-side

i think you may need to post snippets from your website where you include the css file and where you simulate the article so that you can get better tips

1993062
content-length	content-type
it seems that wcf already knows request headers at the point of invoking readmessage method at least content-type and content-length but i cannot get the access to the content-encoding header

1993104
post	get
i have web services that will accept http post get so ajax and other asynchronous niceties are welcome - don t worry about the details of their communication they can easily be modified to fit a solution

1993140
ienumerable	ienumerator
i was wondering why the getenumerator method was factored out of ienumerator and placed in ienumerable

1993146
serializable	deserialization
even though the name suggests the use of javascript the json.jar is a good serializable deserialization tool

1993157
ienumerable	ienumerator
because ienumerable says come enumerate me and then you say- how give me the enumerator however ienumerator says i can enumerate your collection

1993158
ienumerable	ienumerator
if ienumerable and ienumerator were the same interface they couldn t be shared or you d need to have some untyped argument on getenumerator that allowed you to pass in the object to be enumerated

1993169
ienumerable	ienumerator
the ienumerable interface is a factory that creates as many ienumerator objects as you want

1993209
setinterval	clearinterval
you could write a js function included on every page that uses the the setinterval clearinterval javascript functions to send an ajax request to your server every few seconds and could send a different response back to the browser based on whether the conditions were met or not

1993218
linqdatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
if it s bound via linqdatasource sqldatasource or objectdatasource i suggest you have a look at the updating event

1993273
post	get
all in all i think this is a post i ll likely be embarrassed about after i get it but right now i ve hit my head too many times against the wall trying to determine the best approach

1993307
margin	height
thus margin padding and height on those elements have no effect

1993308
gridview	objectdatasource
the objectdatasource does have a selectcountmethod that can be used when data bound controls such as the gridview need to access the total row count

1993318
post	get
one of the reasons you want to do a redirect here is so that the user can hit the refresh button in the browser and not get that pesky would you like to post the data again dialog

1993318
post	get
see the wikipedia article for more info on prg post redirect get

1993350
ienumerable	ienumerator
for instance - in the above link ienumerable ienumerator is collaped to a single method interface

1993364
hide	show
one consideration is that combo boxes hide potential data while radio buttons always show all options

1993372
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t even know how to open a window not to mention how to handle mouse or keyboard input

1993396
post	get
and here an example for accessing post variables cookies and get vars are similar

1993401
glut	sdl
if you used sdl or glut add their frameworks as well

1993407
disk	ram
here resources includes disk space ram and cache space

1993434
getter	setter
it s just a list of getter and setter

1993436
freebsd	solaris	unix	solaris
i don t recall what os solaris or freebsd gave me problems with my unix build system because i just wasn t doing this and wondered why it crashed until i applied -fpic to gcc

1993493
folder	directory
i have removed all other projects from the webapps folder i have taken the servlet-api.jar file that was in the tomcat6 lib directory and added that and only that to the project build path so i can t see how there is still a conflict

1993498
post	get
it looks like you were trying to combine the two methods get and post

1993515
autocomplete	typeahead
typeahead is the autocomplete effect for a combobox which you can see here in the light column

1993565
post	get
for instance i want to visit or similar with post but i get a 500 server error

1993616
put	get
however note that the first line returns a different value an instance of either get or put and this value is used in the second line

1993616
put	get
perhaps i could have some interface that both get and put implement then require a delegate-like thing that takes an instance of that interface

1993616
put	get
get and put inherit from a common base class request

1993634
nsxmlparser	nsurl
it shows how to use nsurl nsxmlparser and a tableview to do just this type of thing

1993646
hide	show
the same window in c is relatively easier in mfc as show here and it hide some of the boilerplate code

1993647
implements	extends
declaring a final __construct ensures that no one who extends your class can implements a method with the same name

1993684
put	get
you will need to change the builder.getrequest method so that it takes in a parameter that indicates whether a get or a put is what you require unless that can be deduced from either the user or name parameter

1993687
put	get
btw - i didn t read all your code you might get more bettre responses if you put a bit more effort in formatting it so that it easier to read

1993708
hash	md5
md5 is relatively fast but if you can t afford full-text comparisons on hash collisions you should probably use a stronger hash like sha-256

1993720
serializable	deserialization
i won t mind rewriting 1300 lines of xml from scratch again as long as i learn the proper way to prepare xml data for serializable deserialization

1993726
irrlicht	ogre3d
sourceforge has many including ogre3d irrlicht and crystalspace

1993739
post	get
ps this is also posted in the sun forums so i ll post the answer i get there here or the answer i get here there naturally giving proper credit once i this is solved p

1993776
post	get
this should work with the store using both get and post

1993783
hash	md5
if you care about performances i think it would be better to check for matching file size first then using a fast hash function crc32 or md5 which should be faster than sha1 and for possible duplicated files found this way trying with md5 sha1 or sha256 depending on the criticality of the task

1993809
put	get
i cannot duplicate your error when i put that code into a file and run it with no additional flags i get

1993824
width	height
in the following example i m setting the listbox.background for simplicity but you should be able to adapt it to operate on the layouttransform or rendertransform or width height or whatever you re using to shrink the listbox

1993832
epl	zpl
in zebra printers it s called epl zpl

1993832
width	height
it s possible to set the font width and height to a multiple of the original size

1993853
dictionary	map
if i understand your question correctly i believe you can accomplish this with a combination of map zip and the dictionary constructor

1993865
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to call the matlab engine programatically from a c program on linux matlab r2009a ubuntu 9.10

1993892
int	chars
in almost every contemporary application that text is expressed as a sequence of unicode code points which are int mapped to particular abstract chars

1993901
arp	icmp
then you can either user icmp ping standard ping or arp ping to list all the valid ip addresses

1993932
octal	decimal
0103 in octal is equal to 67 in decimal

1993946
sqldependency	sqlcachedependency
you can then cache all or part of it in memory with a sqldependency or sqlcachedependency so that the code receives a notification if the db table changes you can do something similar with an xml file if you must

1994034
subset-sum	np-complete
we know that since subset-sum is np-complete deciding in polynomail time probably is impossible

1994036
nhibernate	automapper
i am using s#arp architecture with fluent nhibernate and automapper on a legacy db

1994094
profiling	debugging
compared to an is_dirty flag knowing when a field was updated will help with tasks like debugging production problems knowing when a user profiling was updated and relating that to the time of the user s complaint and the validation of enhancements to your db updates

1994108
put	get
also you need to new your view and scene objects to put them on the heap so they don t get destroyed once drawscene finishes

1994126
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
get an nsbitmapimagerep from your nsimage

1994132
floating-point	integer
the argument is normally used for providing an integer for rounding from a floating-point type but you can really use it for whatever you want

1994151
dbi	dbd-pg
i ve tried installing the gems postgres dbi dbd-pg pg and ruby-pg but with pg ruby-pg and postgres it fails at the require for require postgres or require pg

1994157
stdout	stderr
i used an anonymous pipe to capture all stdout and stderr then print into a richedit it s ok when i use wsprintf but the python using multibyte char that really annoy me

1994203
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie7 the inputs all float left on a new line

1994234
width	margin
note that i hard-coded a left and right margin of 10 units on the rear textbox which assumes a particular width for the quote characters

1994234
richtextbox	textblock
the front text box is replaced with a richtextbox or textblock whose content is computed dynamically to be the text with extra characters but the regular text transparent

1994237
implements	extends
a benefit that this gives you is that you can now pass any object that extends b or implements b if it is an interface to a s constructor and it will work

1994264
folder	directory
right-click the web sites folder an individual web site folder a virtual directory or a file

1994325
g++	gcc
once i downloaded and installed that and changed my path back to the default then g++ and gcc work fine

1994332
post	get
in some browser it is not possible to store cookie to avoid this problem you can pass a sid session id or some hidden filled textbox values instead of cookies by using get and post methods

1994349
post	get
hopefully this gets you going in the right direction if so have a stab at re-writing the first class using objects - if you get stuck post what you tried if you get all the way done post it and i am sure we help you see if you got it right

1994399
accessor	properties
an event isn t an eventhandler in the same way that a properties isn t an int - the event properties defines accessor methods

1994480
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
sqldatasource objectdatasource and

1994487
accessor	properties
the add and remove accessor are equivalent to the get and set accessor of a properties they prevent code from messing with the private _someevent field

1994487
accessor	properties
one final note the symmetry between an event and a properties is a bit lost the c# compiler automatically generates the add remove accessor if you don t write them explicitly

1994523
scatter	graphing
consider a graphing of some attributes of a collection of things where one has two independent variables - to analyse the relationship on these one obviously plots on two dimensions and you might see a scatter of points

1994547
firefox	safari
also itâ s slightly faster than using the attribute not equal to selectorâ in firefox but slightly slower in safari

1994564
accessor	ivar
if you are using automatic kvo notifications you have to use the accessor instead of directly manipulating the ivar to trigger notifications

1994601
qtabwidget	qwidget
qtabwidget inherits qwidget and qwidget implements close

1994675
winpcap	libpcap
for filtering there s libraries like winpcap or libpcap

1994690
nsstring	nsdata
md5 is available on the iphone and can be added as an addition for ie nsstring and nsdata like below

1994822
mouse	keyboard
get stuff done with the keyboard more and depend on the mouse less

1994822
ubuntu	linux
i also occasionally use ubuntu linux

1994862
client-side	server-side
as far as i know there is no way to map client-side classes to server-side fms classes

1994941
serializable	deserialization
use xml serializable and deserialization on client and server side rather than doing it yourself

1994945
opera	firefox
the following code opens the new window without scrollbars in firefox ie and opera

1994948
prefuse	flare
the flare toolkit the predecessor to flare was prefuse

1995014
post	get
and do please ignore the horrible smell coming from the bizarre example i post below of what you can get away with if there were any justice in the world that example should result in a blue screen of death at least

1995014
put	get
a brief demonstration of what a monstrosity you can actually get away with in .net 4.0 this will actually compile and run and put up an instance of form1

1995147
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i m going to diverge from the other answers and say that it is a very bad idea to have a sqlconnection and especially sqldatareader as global state

1995153
children	parent
a category has one parent and can have many children

1995224
min	max
and keep the min max buttons

1995239
min	max
you could roll your own min max buttons on top of the standard toolwindow title bar but i don t recommend it

1995378
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
if you are on fat ntfs in case-insensitive mode essentially any time it s being used under windows or hfs+ in case-insensitive mode and have two files foobar and foobar then git will see two distinct files but the filesystems will only see one which will cause all kinds of problems

1995384
boost	stl
std wstring would be much more portable and benefit from a lot of existing prewritten code in stl and in boost

1995416
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore cappuccino

1995432
profiling	debugging
the eclipse plugin for the google app engine provides a local app engine environment in which you can run your program in debugging or profiling mode

1995446
serializable	deserialization
personally when dealing with network-enabled apps talking to a remote web service i use a singleton data loader class wrapping asihttprequest and handling all the serializable and deserialization which pops notifications when something occurs

1995447
hash	md5
knipknap s problem is that he has a group of cache items that appear to be related and in a hierarchy because of their names but the key-generation logic of the cache mechanism obliterates that name by creating an md5 hash of the path + vary_on

1995468
rss	feed
just came across this in my rss feed not sure if this is what you re after or not

1995475
addeventlistener	onload
well first the library iwebkit you are using is doing a bad thing by taking the entire onload event to itself instead of using the proper addeventlistener function to attach itself to the onload function

1995517
debian	linux
linux debian lenny 5.0.3

1995545
entity-relationship	diagram
you sync the entity-relationship diagram with a uml class diagram etc

1995546
int	chars
main.mm 7 undefined reference to nsapplicationmain int chars const

1995549
uialertview	uipickerview
instead of showing a uialertview you might as well show your own uipickerview and do your thing

1995555
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
if you created a salt which was an md5 of the password then it would have to stored alongside the hash and salt password value which means you have an unsalted hash which is vulnerable to precomputed lookup tables unless you plan to calculate it every time which is a small performance hit

1995555
hash	md5
by taking a sha hash of an md5 hash you re reducing the possibility of the plain text values as there s a finite number of md5 hash values as they are fixed length

1995556
mouseover	mouseout
it takes two functions as arguments mouseover and mouseout

1995556
mouseover	mouseout
or the plain mouseover mouseout equivalent

1995557
slideup	slidedown
lastly i m not entirely convinced slideup and slidedown will behave as desired with inline elements being that as opposed to block-level elements

1995589
mp3	ogg
i m attempting to embed an html5 audio element pointing to mp3 or ogg data served by a php file

1995646
hide	show
just set up the 3 divs on the page and then use jquery to hide show

1995646
hide	show
if you don t have a ton of divs to show hide ajax is probably overkill

1995658
min	max
you can also set min max dimensions so shrinking stretching to fit becomes a breeze

1995673
hash	salt
you are already salting your hash and ensuring each record has it s own individual salt which is very important

1995678
division	multiplication
same idea but division instead of multiplication

1995717
hash	salt
the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

1995790
getter	setter
an ide-independent way is to use lombok an annotation-based library that generates getter setter and even equals and hashcode

1995825
stopwatch	nstimer
the stopwatch uses an nstimer to do the counting and has a table for storing laps but when the lap table is scrolled the watch stops or pauses and does not make up for the lost time

1995828
nscoder	nsuserdefaults
nscoder nsuserdefaults

1995857
width	height
y coordinates are not given because the width is to height

1995876
spaces	delimiter
you can specify whichever symbols you need spaces delimiter but iirc is is quite forgiving

1995941
lwp	libwww-perl
one such module is lwp curl which belongs to the libwww-perl family

1996029
innodb	myisam
note that aggregates like max and count are slower when using transactional tables like innodb and faster when using myisam

1996049
stdout	stderr
the python interpreter always writes bytestrings to stdout stderr rather than unicode or wide strings

1996049
stdout	stderr
if you want to get at stdout stderr as unicode data you must decode it by yourself using the right encoding

1996062
accessor	properties
it s probably not a problem since it is in your dealloc method but if you re going to use a properties accessor you should leave the retain and release to it

1996065
addition	multiplication
the addition and the multiplication have both error approximation

1996088
jvisualvm	jprofiler	jhat	jprofiler	jhat	jvisualvm
i tried jprofiler jvisualvm jhat and a lot of google

1996133
wan	lan
an as has a unique asn autonomous system number within that as one can have networks wan lan

1996172
client-side	server-side
therefore the code is parsed as server-side c# code not client-side javascript

1996208
nofollow	noindex
the html for the history view and several others such as the logs etc. contains a noindex nofollow meta declaration

1996248
sorting	filtering
it provides full support for all app engine data types as well as provides much more pretty viewing sorting and filtering

1996275
sqldatasource	formview
in vs 2005 using vb page has a formview linked to an sqldatasource

1996301
post	get
i m building an xml-based webservice in rails to serve as the backend for an iphone app and i m wondering how i can best achieve an auth scheme that will let me use both get and post requests -- one that doesn t require auth sent in the body of an xml payload

1996316
ssms	sqlcmd
if you can t download ssms express you always do have the sqlcmd utility at your fingertips - it s a command-line driven utility which allows you to send t-sql command to your sql server - check out the msdn docs on how to use it in detail

1996354
daemons	systemd
the only difference is that in a low runlevel lots of other systemd services will not be running so if the program tries to do something that depends on another daemons that may fail

1996374
int	chars
i don t know how to convert an int say 2007 into a chars array

1996390
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have yet to test it on ie am on a linux machine but it works correctly in webkit and gecko browsers safari google-chrome and firefox as well as in opera

1996407
uilabel	uitextview
in my app i have a uilabel which is the title and a uitextview which is the description and i want the title uilabel to be the first word typed into the uitextview

1996433
mvp	presenter
if so from my interpretation of mvp the model can raise events which my presenter would subscribe to

1996462
post	get
when you create your form you set it to use post variables instead of get that way they don t go through the url that s codeigniter s default method for forms

1996484
google-chrome	firefox
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

1996486
superclass	subclassing
this way you can call what is a private method outside of the class just by casting the subclassing object pointer to a superclass object pointer

1996492
submit	submission
i m not sure search engines index form submission locations and even if they did they certainly wouldn t index a form that submit to dynamic uris in the way that you want it to

1996500
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
we don t have to worry about snprintf or malloc realloc and free combination either

1996504
hide	show
so far i ve seen and i m using the following scripts to show hide a div or other controls depending on another control in asp.net

1996526
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the latest versioning of the sdk 3.1.2 and it broke my application

1996540
stdout	stderr
then you can pass subprocess.pipe for the stderr stdout and or stdin parameters and read from the pipes by using the communicate method

1996581
sharepoint	spsite
a lot of referencing in sharepoint is done by using a url as a starting point just look at the constructor of spsite

1996592
gif	png
jpeg files don t have bit depth in the same manner as gif or png files

1996652
width	height
error shell widget xemacs has zero width and or height

1996658
multiplying	multiplication
how to multiplying two very large numbers greater than 32 characters for example multiplication of 100

1996675
width	height
you can get width and height using width and height

1996681
width	height
note that these both include the padding and border in their calculations whereas jquery height and width do not

1996714
octal	hex
if you encounter x or 0 you then need to read subsequent hex or octal digits to determine the character to insert

1996772
put	get
now to put anything new in you have to move one pile out of the way then another just to get to the shelf by the wall

1996811
hash	salt
if you make the salt dependent on just the password the same password will always result in the same hash

1996811
hash	salt
so basically the result is the same as if you d use a slightly different hash function without any salt

1996811
hash	salt
with the third method two users with the same password will usually get a different salt and the hash version of the password will look different for both users

1996815
inherited	subclassing
create subclassing that inherited from filepart called myfileheader myfileindex myfilebody etc

1996857
hash	salt
you use a salt function g hash g salt password

1996879
width	height
i am laying the divs out and specifying the height and width of each

1996904
children	parent
yes i agree option #2 is better - index the children when you re at the parent

1996950
strncmp	strncpy
write versions of the library functions strncpy strncat and strncmp which operate on at most the first n characters of their argument strings

1996956
int	double
for example you could see int and short as a restricted versions of double and a long as an extension of a byte

1996982
strncmp	strlen
in strncmp the strlen call on the input is not valid

1996983
post	put
this all worked fine until i put the system.componentmodel.dataannotations.stringlength attribute on the property in my model then when the view does a post from a submit button i got the exception

1996985
post	put
it is hard to implement and too hard to describe in a simple post and too valuable to just give away so sorry i can t provide more but searching on flood fill and dynamic programming will put you on the path if you want to go that route

1997021
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you know the range you want to look over you don t need to use the min max subquery in the cte

1997070
stdout	stderr
or even stdout and stderr

1997074
post	get
it has to be fixed at the input stage by iterating the get post cookies arrays and removing the slashes if you need your app to run on servers using the foul archaic wrongness that is magic_quotes_gpc

1997089
google-chrome	firefox
also i have ie8 firefox and google-chrome installed

1997137
daemons	systemd
in the .net world this would be many separate assemblies which represent the different logical portions of the subsystems not all of which might be needed by every webservice console application forms application web application or service daemons which comprise the systemd

1997177
ant	maven
this sort of thing is rife in the java world ant maven etc

1997197
post	get
it looks like it s designed to be called to create an object on which the get post methods are called

1997263
hide	show
then supporting show hide in wpf is extremely easy

1997278
width	height
personally i would just make a table 100 height and width of body 0 0

1997325
firefox	safari
the products on the below page are getting displayed correctly in firefox safari and ie8

1997327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tried on mac osx with safari firefox and google-chrome and on ubuntue with firefox

1997335
post	get
i manage to accept domain.com 222 but if i use url_for post i still get domain.com post 222

1997344
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work ok in firefox and google-chrome

1997349
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen it in the past using firefox and tried your example on google-chrome to the same effect

1997375
persistent	transient
to have persistent code within such a wrapper that can service http requests rather than being transient like cgi scripts

1997418
post	get
if not then use your own algorithym to get the top 5 post

1997474
ddms	adb
that wasn t happening and looking at their debugging they suggest the reset adb link in the ddms perspective in the devices panel

1997482
clang	llvm
in this case i m compiling with clang + llvm on snowleopard with xcode 3.2.1 but this also happens with gcc 4.2 on both leopard and snowleopard

1997484
width	height
with plain css you could set only one dimension of the images either width or height and set the other as auto

1997484
width	height
the images will have a fixed 200px width and the height will depend on the aspect ratio

1997490
case-sensitive	case-insensitive	hash	salt
don t store the password in the db - store a salt hash also note that default case-insensitive collation will mean that neither username nor password are case-sensitively compared - usually passwords are case-sensitive you can use the t-sql hashbytes function with appropriate salt data and appropriate choice of hash function

1997490
hash	salt
here s the code i would recommend i left off the output parameter and assume the password is not stored but the hash is - and that the password is simply salt with the username to create the hash not always the best choice especially if you allow usernames to change and don t re-get the password properly to re-store a new hash plus user names are usually not case-sensitive

1997490
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

firefox	safari
just as others said the css you posted won t work on modern browsers ie8 safari firefox etc

1997790
getter	setter
the name of the property will be the same for all of them but the type of component they belong to may vary and thus so may their getter and setter

1997792
formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview
however last time i checked this was only supported if the textbox was inside a templated control such as gridview formview or detailsview

1997822
outputstream	inputstream
yes it is possible to handle text data by using inputstream outputstream but reader writer interfaces provide useful methods to work with text data

1997911
svg	vml
it uses svg vml

1997919
firefox	safari
note this solution has only been tested on safari and firefox

1998040
fast-forward	merge
in order for the release-manager to have a fast-forward only merge after reviewing the branch

1998040
fast-forward	merge
for an automatic process i would go with a central update hook which would try to perform a merge to master and check if fast-forward is part of the output of the command

1998076
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
set the html body styles too - use 100 height and width and 0 margin

1998077
freetype	libpng	libjpeg	freetype	libjpeg	libpng
with a bit of patience it is possible to piece together the component libraries yourself openal for the sound freetype for font rendering libpng libjpeg etc for image codecs

1998132
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does the work very fast but i am having problems on firefox ie

1998170
nfa	dfa
the way i understand it re.compile or any regex system in any language converts the regex string into a finite automaton dfa or nfa and despite the ominous name compile it has nothing to do with the execution of any code

1998193
hide	show
by the way the initial dot in a file or directory name doesn t really hide the entry it s just that ls and and similar commands don t show them while these do

1998201
submit	submission
instead of calling submit in the function you should return true or false depending on if the form validates if the function returns false that is equivalent to which will cancel the submission

1998214
for-loop	loops
alternatively you may be able to rework the foreach loops to be a for-loop if possible

1998281
super	implements
i ve implements my contextinitialized contextdestroyed init and destroy methods both init and destroy call super on the base class

1998282
inherited	properties
a class may inherited from a base class on which i have no control as in hibernateâ s case on the base class properties

1998351
ant	cruisecontrol
in-house we have fully automated symbian builds using ant and cruisecontrol

1998358

public class testapp extends jframe implements actionlistener

1998467
terminate	timeout
if tomcat fails to stop within the timeout a dialog will appear giving you the option to terminate the server or continue waiting

1998483
textview	listactivity
there are textview and button in my listactivity iwant to press button then textview s text can auto add to listview but i pressed button it donot work unless after i enter content press ok key then pressed button textview s text can auto add to listview

1998486
button	checkbox
everything is working fine but on default the second radio button is checked and for the checkbox all of them are checked on default

1998511
config	ini
your config might also reside in an xml yaml or ini file but then you d have to have some sort of config class being able to read the file

1998542
portrait	landscape
the ability to swap between to landscape and portrait orientation

1998547
width	height
both have same width but the height of the first one is variable

1998572

you want the dateadd function to manipulate dates and the getdate function to get the current date

1998701
post	get
here are a couple of blog post to get you started

1998759
gif	png
to save these chunks into individual jpeg gif or png files

1998792
innodb	myisam
with innodb you don t need this anyway as the storage engine can t go into an inconsistent state unlike myisam and others

1998843
swt	swing
swing jfc and swt rcp

1998849
put	get
for example if i set my system locale in windows terms â œlanguage to match the language version of the non-unicode programs you want to useâ to â œgerman germany â and put javascript alert ã .localecompare b i get -1 but with english i get 1

1998922
implements	extends
the best solution i have found yet is to implements a fixed number of typed properties on rotation and extends the mapping with a element for each

1998930
hide	show
there you create tabs using the resource editor and hide show based on the forms you want to display to the end user

1998965
jstl	taglib
jsp is just a view technology providing a template to write client side markup style scripting languages in such as html css js code alongside with the possibility to control the page flow dynamically with help of taglib such as jstl and access to backend data with help of el

1998965
implements	extends
basically just extends httpservlet and implements the doget to preprocess data or the dopost to postprocess the data

1998982
versioning	upgrade
if a new versioning exists we need to download it and upgrade the software

1998993
dreamweaver	fireworks
whilst i would agree with all of the comments above if you want to do this yourself or don t have the knowledge funds you can do it with the likes of dreamweaver fireworks but as everyone has said you won t get good html and unless you use it properly you ll have problems if you ever make changes to your page as changing sizes will break your layout

1999026
for-loop	loops
i can understand what a for-loop does but can t really understand what a while loops does

1999033
windows	wow64
if you know you are running on 64-bit windows then if it a process is running in wow64 mode then it must be 32-bit that is what wow64 is for - running 32-bit applications on 64-bit windows if not then you can assume 64-bit

1999037
jstl	taglib
anything which isn t possible with el or taglib like jstl would then technically and semantically belong in a real java class

1999071
hide	show
i need to show hide image in html page

1999077
width	height	min	max
by default windows imposes a constraint of caption bar height for height and about 100 pixels for width min max close buttons + a few letters of the name

1999112
memcpy	memset
some c functions are already linked in to do runtime setup so the compiler have these library functions like memset memcpy available to use

1999193
inherited	properties
also how the three important components - models controllers views are inherited from classes which already have methods and properties

1999202
accessor	properties
you need to mark your properties with synthetize in order for the compiler to generate the accessor methods

1999202
accessor	properties
if you don t want to generate the accessor then use the dot notation to access the properties

1999298
implements	extends
even then that s not complete enough as per microsoft rule for extends exceptions there are minimum 4 constructors that you should implements - namely

1999314
inherited	properties
once the project has this properties then every source file should inherited this properties

1999314
inherited	properties
every source file should then inherited this properties and your .obj files should be separated

1999323
button	checkbox
as with acces the gui would mainly comprise of controls such as radio button combo box populated from a table checkbox text boxes text areas and data grids

1999378
hide	show
jquery s domready show the image and hide the div

1999397
concave	convex
the polygon may be convex but bonus points if you come up with an algorithm that works for concave shapes

1999423
vb.net	vb6
in the end i converted the function call to a vb.net lib using the automatic project converter from vb6 to vb.net 2008 and called it using c# reference

1999428
des	aes
des is the predecessor of aes and is considered broken because of its short key length

1999473
folder	directory
what you really want to do is to place the configuration file in the profile directory or in a folder you create inside the profile directory

1999497
uitableview	reloaddata
when processing the notication i will run uitableview reloaddata

1999516
ant	maven
i d really appreciate any suggestions this community has to offer such as it really is better to just stick with ant or maven cause they work already or be sure to avoid make s dependency issue

1999552
translation	localization
you may wish to read wil shipley s post on localization called lost in translation and perhaps this blog post and this screencast tutorial as well

1999556
ant	maven
i would advocate always using continuous integration cruise control for ant or hudson for maven regardless of the build tool you use

1999565
concave	convex
should work for any polygon convex concave with holes in them i think given that what exactly you do for intersecting squares triangles handles such polygons

1999569
ant	maven
cobbling together your own build tool doesn t sound like a great use of your time especially when established tools such as ant and maven exist and have such vast user bases that are finding and fixing bugs with those tools

1999604
listview	gridview
i know it deals with a gridview but i adapted it to a listview as long as the underlying structure is a table and it worked fine for me

1999679
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
in php this would be done by calling htmlspecialchars on the inbox contents when displaying the inbox possibly along with nl2br and maybe turning links to tags

1999688
hide	show
basically when i use ajax.beginform with a onbegin function and this function returns false the loading elementid is still show and it never hide again

1999689
accessor	properties
objective-c allows you to automatically generate accessor by defining them as properties and synthesizing in implementation class

1999717
free	malloc
.c clean malloc mmapped heap and stack memory once allocated written then free but not reclaimed yet

1999767
ubuntu	linux
my estimate if you have powerful hardware and a big screen the combination of atom and iptv sounds like that than using a lfs linux from scratch ubuntu or something similar and create a flashy ui on top of that using qt opengl gtk swing ... is less pain than porting your libs apps to android

1999775
daemon	cron
crontab -l spits out the line above and running ps -a | grep cron shows usr sbin cron running which i assume is the cron daemon under mac os x

1999787
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
in your case you can use java.util.calendar class instead of java.util.date

1999794
many-to-many	one-to-many
suggest you create multiple views in the database filtered on the association_name column and then define many-to-many relationships in your mapping based on these and just enforce the one-to-many semantics in your code

1999824
hash	md5
this would presumably be calculated by generating an md5 hash for every possible string in a particular character set in increasing length until a hash appears for a second time a collision

1999840
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox 3.5 etc

1999858
spweb	spsite
it s known that objects like spsite and spweb have to be dispose -d after a call otherwise memory leaks occur

1999896
width	height
object width 550 height 400

1999896
width	height
embed src somefilename.swf width 550 height 400

1999901
inherited	subclassing
languages the subclassing inherited all

1999901
width	height
a rectangle can be defined by two measures its width and height

1999901
width	height
it would be counterproductive to inherit the width and height of the rectangle class in the square class which would require extra constraints to ensure that the same value is provided to a setter for the width and a setter for the height

1999903
width	height
every div has a fixed width and height

1999950
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both firefox google-chrome but fails in ie

1999956
entity-relationship	entities
the tables that represent entities from an entity-relationship model should have a smiple pk

1999959
free	malloc
.c clean malloc mmapped heap and stack memory once allocated written then free but not reclaimed yet

1999966
installation	upgrade
we ve been considering trying out the tfs 2010 beta 2 as an upgrade from our existing installation but i cannot find anything in the docs explaining how many users are available

2000014
128bit	64bit
the mathematics of the birthday paradox make the inflection point of probability of collision roughly around sqrt n where n is the number of distinct bins in the hash function so for a 128bit hash as you get around 64bit you are moderately likely to have 1 collision

2000014
hash	md5
edit this assumes that the md5 hash algorithm causes a mapping from input bytestring to output hash that is close to random

2000023
free	malloc
.c clean malloc mmapped heap and stack memory once allocated written then free but not reclaimed yet

2000049
apache	nginx
the example configuration as shown on the github staticgenerator page is using nginx as the front-end http server and apache as the back-end http server

2000050
kde	gnome
if there is a command like the one described it is easy to add a shortcut to it from kde or gnome interface

2000065
freebsd	linux
will run on linux and perhaps rarely in freebsd

2000132
children	parent
from a select all children then select all i elements then select the parent or from a select all children then select all ii elements then select the parent

2000147
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	linuxmint
i am using linuxmint ubuntu linux 9.10

2000165
config	ini
i have used xml ini and yaml files for config in the python as well as in .net c# application

2000177
width	height
while building the flowdocument-table by code the height width of the tablerows are 0 of course

2000182
spweb	spsite
the solution i came up with involved parsing the url to figure out the spsite and spweb

2000182
spweb	spsite
since spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openweb

2000203
postgresql	mysql
if you ever port from mysql to say postgresql you will discover a very unpleasant fact that creating databases in postgresql is a comparatively very slow operation

2000205
postgresql	mysql
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

2000249
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you want some control on the order used by iterators use a treemap or a linkedhashmap

2000250
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
read the script with a bufferedreader see some examples appending each line to a stringbuilder

2000286
put	get
hashmap uses hash codes to store things so you have constant time for put and get operations but items are always unordered

2000303
post	get
it appears that you would have to have some type of application to create specific xml from your database that can be set with a post method to google and retrived with a get method for dislaying

2000311
min	max
also in this context constrained means between given min and max values

2000311
int	double
the system.random class provides random generation of int double and byte arrays

2000360
width	height
the adjustment here is to accommodate the thickness of your bold circle by adjusting the width height in the positive direction and adjusting the top and left in the negative direction by half to recenter

2000363
getter	setter
other features can t be supported simply because they would need language features like getter setter that can t be used in the browser yet due to poor support

2000377
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work fine for firefox google-chrome etc but internet explorer appears to work differently

2000379
hide	show
i d like to show hide divs based on which tags have been toggled show hide

2000379
hide	show
the tricky part is to show divs if any of its classes are toggled to show and hide if all of its classes are toggled to hide

2000431
folder	directory
i ve edit the .htaccess file in that directory to protect this folder from allowing the unwanted visitors to download the contents manually by typing the full url

2000442
hide	show
if you first hide and then show it should do the trick

2000452
int	chars
if you know what the chars are meant to be i suggest you add some logging to indicate the unicode values of those chars as int and compare them with the code charts on unicode.org

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable does not allow indexed access to the collection whereas ilist does

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
if you need to go from ienumerable to ilist you may try a cast first if you get lucky it will work

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
if not you ll have to foreach over the ienumerable collection and build a new ilist

2000458
ienumerable	ilist
ilist implements ienumerable so if you pass your method an ilist you can safely use it as an ienumerable

2000545
getter	setter
you can map the private fields so that you can provide public getter setter that provide the correct view at the logical level

2000587
outputstream	inputstream
basically just create a servlet which gets an inputstream of it with help of fileinputstream and writes it to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse along with a correct set of response headers with at least the content-type

2000595
put	get
however when i go to put it on the sql server i get the error

2000612
stdout	stderr
these allow you to control an external console program from within perl and pass and read stdout stderr stdin information from it

2000630
children	parent
a simpler way to select a parent with specific children in jquery can be written as

2000676
subclass	accessor
coredata accessor are generated at run time for each subclass of nsmanagedobject etc

2000678
installation	upgrade
i try to perform a major upgrade with my msi installer with a quiet installation

2000691
button	checkbox
i am creating a table based on result from servlet which contains a checkbox when the checked property of checkbox is true there will be one button in the bottom of the table which calls for a remove function which removes that particular row from table this function is working when the table is created inside jsp using server tags but when it is created from jquery .getjson method it is not working

2000702
des	aes
hex formating elliptic curve cryptography and any of the algorithms for encryption such as aes rijndael des blowfish etc

2000706
ant	maven
i m using ant with maven to build a multi module project

2000728
width	height
i think i solved my own problem i can check the width and height of the image

2000729
width	height
npc normalized parent coordinates which is the default treats the viewport origin as 0 0 and assigns it a width height of 1 unit each

2000768
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
i ask because if i close a sqlconnection that has a sqltransaction object the transaction is rolled back

2000808
postgresql	mysql
i have seen the mysql_insert_id function for mysql and heard that pg_last_oid is similar for postgresql but the documentation claims that it is deprecated and will be removed soon

2000863
sorting	filtering
i would use the timestamp field for dates since it will make sorting filtering faster than it would be on a text field

2000884
put	get
i want to get a nested div in gwt and be able to put a widget in there

2000884
put	get
i want to be able to get content_left and put a widget in there

2000896
postgresql	mysql
mysql has the notion of autoincrement fields postgresql has the notion of sequences

2000918
client-side	server-side
i have an asp.net webform which i want to validate client-side and server-side using the same validation controls

2000926
cstring	bstr
i personally would go with cstring s in this case since you state that you re working with bstr s using com and writing this in mfc

2000926
cstring	bstr
as you noted cstring s also have built-in functions to help load strings and convert to bstr s and the like all pre-made and already built to work with windows

2000940
width	height
the bounds and frame would have the same width and height

2000949
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i use russian words in links encoded with urlencode so links are human-readable in most browsers - firefox google-chrome opera except for ie but this is not the real problem with this browser

2000975
serializable	deserialization
there are good benchmarks from the java community on serializable deserialization and wire size of these technologies

2000989
temp	tmp
tmp c users sof appdata local temp

2001010
width	height
i think it might have to do with the fact that you are trying to set the height and width without css

2001010
width	height
i am not sure but if i was going to do it i would use the jquery .css method to set he height and width

2001054
google-chrome	firefox
adblock plus for firefox adthwart for google-chrome

2001108
haskell	ocaml
i have been programming in java for many years and haskell and ocaml for the last two years

2001118
entity-relationship	diagram
in the entity-relationship diagram a student entity has an attribute called courses but a course does not know anything about his students

2001219
min	max
so i cant define the max and min occurrences for product in a products list

2001251
multiplying	add
in general however the expression should be expected to be the more accurate in cases where they differ because it incurs only two roundings the square root and the add for any binary ieee-754 type whereas incurs three roundings square root add and multiplying

2001308
post	get
the controller has two login methods one for handling a get one for handling a post

2001308
post	get
by changing the method on the corporate site to do a form get rather than a post the username and password are preserved in the query string after the redirect and i could handle the requests that way but i would rather do a post and not pass that data around in the url

2001310
children	parent
take a binary tree for instance with references both down to left and right children and also up to parent

2001318
free	malloc
that is a potential memory leak anyway for every new there is a delete likewise same for malloc and free

2001320
disk	ram
i would recommend saving them to ram using whatever cache method suits you best and periodically writing the results to disk

2001322
post	get
it may help if you post the interfaces for monitoreddevice devicetypetoextend so we can get a better picture of what you re hoping to achieve

2001323
post	get
if you get the url to the file in the post you can propably use the simplexml_load_file function with the url but if that doesn t work you can use the file_get_contents in combination with the simplexml_load_string

2001401
jobs	cron
although the preferred method on os x for running automated jobs is launchd cron is still supported

2001415
vim	textmate
there are already plugins for all the main editors and ides to support django - from vim to textmate to netbeans - and these provide syntax highlighting indentation shortcuts and snippets for both python source and django templates

2001418
versioning	upgrade
need to be able to use dates beyond the 32-bit timestamp limit so upgrade our server to windows server 2003 64-bit versioning

2001440
width	height
i have a div with a fixed width and height and overflow set to scroll

2001440
google-chrome	firefox
it works find in ie7 8 firefox google-chrome so on

2001483
stdout	fflush
if you re writing out every three seconds and sleep 3 is a good way to do that and it s not showing up every three seconds try putting in fflush stdout

2001525
width	height
as default uicomponent width and height are set to 0

2001584
pull	push
pull parser are in my opinion a good alternative between a tree-based model and a push parser

2001643
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are already defined for your program so you can use them directly instead of opening or declaring them on your own

2001671
subtract	add
for example to tell the jvm to automatically add or subtract some offset before returning from that method

2001676
int	double
or you could cast the int to a bigint or double before the sum so you don t overflow there

2001685
range	minimum
these are the dates that correspond to the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer. additionally not all platforms support negative timestamps therefore your date range may be limited to no earlier than the unix epoch

2001729
spweb	spsite
here is a script wherein i dispose spsite and spweb objects

2001730
put	get
i ve also tried to swap out put for upload but get the same result

2001741
int	double
which will support the math and get you back the result as an int but this cast will just truncate the value and return 2 while as a double it would be 2.99 so you would also want to have sql round the number appropriately

2001757

found a solution myself the trick i did not know is that if you use a long url in the constructor of the spsite it gives you the spweb object with the deepest possible address that matches your url described here

2006696
equinox	knopflerfish
there are 4 very popular open source implementations of osgi available concierge knopflerfish felix and equinox

2006698
swt	swing
if your only goal is to let users choose between swt or swing drawing their ui then swtswing would have been an option

2006698
swt	swing
swtswing is an implementation of the swt api using swing

2006714
chown	chmod
update the chmod and chown functions return true on success and false on failure so it would be a good idea to put them in an if clause

2006761
pop-up	dialog
a minute before the asp.net session would time out we pop-up a dialog on the browser to warn the user you have been inactive and are about to be logged out

2006772
maven	m2e
i use the m2e plugin primarily for searching for maven dependencies and adding them to my project

2006772
maven	pom.xml
both these tools are great for situational awareness of the state of your maven pom.xml and or your svn repo

2006809
trac	bugzilla
in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest

2006820
inherited	properties
listener doesn t inherited the values it can get a reference to the object that dispatched the event using the event.target properties or a reference to the object with which the event listener was registered using the event.currenttarget properties

2006824
getter	setter
i m starting with java and i m learning about setter getter and encapsulation

2006824
getter	setter
container has a private int array numarray with his setter getter

2006870
onchange	onkeyup
i can use the onchange or onkeyup without the best result

2006882
decoder	encoder
i have managed to make it work registering django.utils.simplejson as a json encoder decoder

2006886
g++	gcc
i use gcc g++ for compiling linking version 3.4.4

2006886
unix	solaris
platform is unix solaris sparc if that s important

2006923
easymock	jmock	easymock	unitils	mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock	mockito	unitils	jmock	unitils
the use of di is important for mocking apis such as unitils mock easymock jmock and mockito because they always require mock instances to be passed to code under test

2006970
coalesce	isnull
you may also have to use isnull total 0 or coalesce total 0 depending on which dbms you are using and your query as stated by womp .

2007035
next	except
fadeinnew handles the new one by one fade in elsewhere but this was what i was looking for more or less with a bit of extra code around it to maybe shed some light on what was happening there s a next arrow with a url in its href if javascript is on i need the url of the next page relative to the current if it s off it follows that url as an href and loads a new page which has the same content on the page except for the new items that would have been .load-ed

2007084
rss	feed
trying to modify the rss feed created by views module in drupal

2007084
rss	feed
since there are no theme_ hooks for the rss feed rightfully as xml is theme-less i need an alternate way to modify the fields that are output into the rss preferably using template.php if possible

2007127
min	max
this can of course be modified with some simple logic to have min max or if it s a data entry type of grid length +1

2007204
srp	principles
obviously i don t want to use the customer class since that would be against srp single responsibility principles also i don t see it as a good idea to attach the method to the customerfactory class since it s only role is to get customers from the database

2007206
emma	checkstyle
we use hudson for our continuous integration which provides us with easy to browse build reports showing compiler warnings unit test results and coverage emma pmd checkstyle and findbugs violations

2007212
put	get
it operates like a regular map with get put and remove methods but has a sort method that can be called to sorts the map

2007212
put	get
i understand that it might not be possible but i m hoping for o 1 get put and remove operations

2007212
dictionary	map
data structure for efficiently returning the top-k entries of a hash table map dictionary

2007214
persistent	transient
rule #2 the object to be persistent must mark all nonserializable fields transient

2007228
getter	setter
the very fact that you are exposing state or derived state as getter and setter breaks encapsulation and implies you are implementing an abstract data type rather than a true object-oriented class

2007276
post	get
someone else posted the .text method but deleted the post which will get you all the text minus the tags which means you ll get text i m interested in other crap i don t care about -- not what you want

2007318
nswindow	nsapplication
it s a property of both nswindow and nsapplication

2007333
versioning	upgrade
so in case anyone here stumbles upon it simply upgrade to the latest versioning of the plugin either build it yourself or get it from the apache snapshot repository and the problem will go away

2007353
folder	directory
some of the directory i m checking are source-code directory and they have .svn folder

2007373
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uitableview in an iphone application which i am refreshing by calling in the action method for a uisegmentedcontrol dynamically embedded in one of the uitableview cells

2007373
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
it appears that each time the uitableview refreshes it creates a new instance of the uisegmentedcontrol and possibly the images - i m not sure over the existing one s

2007403
put	get
for o 1 get put and remove operations you essentially need o 1 lookup which implies a hash function as you know but the requirements of a good hash function often break the requirement to be easily sorted

2007416
switching	screens
so the -x switching may be to execute a screens command as opposed to a shell command

2007419
hide	show
if you want to hide it or show it you should just be able to use some jquery

2007421
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2007438
hide	show
if you need to generate result2 based on what the user selects in result1 then you need to either create rows for every possible selection then use javascript to show or hide or utilize ajax calls much better

2007460
folder	dir
but the dir folder will not have the whatever.php

2007542
httpcontext	httpmodule
seem to have found a solution if i create a variable for the httpapplication on init of the httpmodule this all occurs in the httpcontext can be accessed from that variable

2007543
folder	directory	folder	dir
lets say you are in a page at and want to access something in the dir folder you could specify .. inthedir.php to move up one directory or .. .. intheroot.php to move up two

2007545
width	height
we can actually just add any kind of control to the dialog set the height and width to 0 css and set the focus on it to get the refresh working

2007563
division	multiplication
arithmetic shifts can be useful as efficient ways of performing multiplication or division of signed integers by powers of two

2007589
allocator	stl
your can then use all stl classes giving them your allocator type as template argument

2007641
dictionary	map
this allows the order of name bindings in the class body to be preserved and used while the normal dictionary loses order which is sometimes nice when the class must have fields in a certain specific order to map 1 1 onto a c struct a row in a csv file or db table and the like -- in python 2

2007661
post	get
yes it s for java not c but the last post on this thread outlines how to get input to work in eclipse console

2007666
children	parent
the obvious answer from that is that parent blocks run before their children s but that could just be a coincidence and doesn t help if two classes aren t in the same hierarchy

2007734
rss	feed
i want to make something which parses some atom or rss feed and displays some content in a gridview

2007734
rss	feed
previously when i ve done this sort of thing in pythion i use a general purpose feed parser which can parse pretty much anything rss atom

2007775
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse that works for you

2007782
subtract	add
to move it somewhere else do a translation transform first or modify the code to subtract add in the desired origin

2007789
rss	feed
since rss atom feed are essentially xml documents you can use saxparser which is part of the standard java libraries included with android

2007820
hide	show
add the controls to the panels show hide the panels as required

2007846
width	height
i don t think you can disable the large size but you can set it s width and height to be the same as the medium size

2007895
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a popular gnu linux distro which is fairly easy to install and quite straightforward

2007895
unix	solaris
there are too many books that come to mind but what really moved me from my old dos days to unix solaris first was kernighan and pike s unix programming environment

2007900
jobs	cron
more on cron jobs

2007955
sorting	filtering
now i want to add filtering and sorting

2007955
sorting	filtering
i assume sorting and filtering are a standard practice within ddd and design patterns thus the question

2007980
int	chars	int	double
because the class contains a double it will be 8 byte aligned meaning the chars will be padded by 7 bytes and the int will be padded by 4 to ensure that in an array of some_object all elements would be 8 byte aligned

2007992
sorting	filtering
ideally you ll probably want to do the sorting and the filtering inside the repository

2007993
virtualbox	parallels
i use virtualbox free but parallels is also good though commercial

2008000
webclient	webrequest
one thing you can do is start by building a manual proxy using webclient or webrequest webresponse

2008010
folder	directory
create a temporary directory install ruby into a sbin subdirectory and chroot into the temp folder

2008048
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux is a pretty easy place to start

2008048
ubuntu	linux
i m in awe of how easy the ubuntu people have made things and having your own linux install to play with really helps

2008108
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome this works however in firefox with greasemonkey the last line fails and the protection is not removed

2008132
opera	google-chrome
you could use the greasemonkey stuff to import jquery via url at the top but this is greasemonkey specific google-chrome opera etc

2008175
width	height
assume i have a bean dialogbox with properties for height and width

2008204
mouseover	mouseout
on application mouseover call a javascript function to disable the mouse scroll wheel and enable it on application mouseout

2008209
daemons	systemd
if you really do need to do locking because you are writing to some external service like a bit of hardware then you can use a typical unix approach to locking resources and write a single-instanced daemons that runs on a local socket which all your web services can talk to - depending on if it indicates a resources is busy they could either reject requests or queue them in memory in a queueing systemd a table in an sql db etc. with a a daemons which process queued requests which also talks to the locking service

2008288
filesystems	fat
if true this option enables various workarounds to enable git to work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive like fat

2008288
git-clone	git-init
the default is false except git-clone 1 or git-init 1 will probe and set core.ignorecase true if appropriate when the repository is created

2008289
post	get
below is a list of some brief tutorials to get you started although each of these subjects could easily warrant a post as big or bigger than this one

2008315
textview	imageview
i would just show dialog with imageview photo textview information and button to close dialog

2008324
folder	directory
if the file is located in a different directory you could use server.mappath path to the file.txt where corresponds to the root folder of your web application

2008362
strdup	malloc
if i use malloc directly rather than strdup it won t crash

2008362
strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
possibly because strdup is using the default malloc while the free call is using dlmalloc s free

2008380
spaces	delimiter
the command should be spaces delimiter with each path wrapped in quotes to properly include their embedded strings

2008386
range	max	range	min	min	max
note that i have reduced the min max by assuming the next array index in the sequence is always greater than the previous range

2008389
post	get
most of the interaction in browser comes down to an http get or an http post

2008409
projectile	angle
which should give me the angle from which i can calculate the horizontal and vertical velocities needed to launch the projectile

2008416
int	chars
there is operator sizeof int sizeof chars so i think that it is possible and call probably look like sizeof myclass

2008459
int	double
but i ve used this in the past for storing int double and serialised java objects via xstream so i can confirm it works well

2008479
allocator	stl
you can define a custom allocator type see this link for a good tutorial on how to do so the interface needed etc and use that exclusively with your stl types it s a template argument

2008537
affinity	processors
yes unless you utilize processors affinity threads one or many will be scheduled on whatever processors the kernel thread management code assigns

2008551
pylons	web2py	pylons	cherrypy	django	web2py	web2py	cherrypy
cherrypy django pylons web2py zope 2 zope 3 etc

2008582
skip-lists	tree
a deterministic skip-lists has a 1-1 mapping to a 2-3 tree so with some more work the procedure described above could work for a 2-3 tree as well

2008588
getter	setter
i find making getter setter on objects is best to pass data from one object to another in cocoa-type apps

2008588
getter	setter
create a setter method on your app delegate that accepts the lat value sets it internally to the app delegate object in a protected property and finally make a separate getter method that simply returns the lat value from the app delegate

2008588
getter	setter
or put the setter getter methods on whatever object makes sense in your app

2008588
getter	setter
the naming convention is usually setnameofvar and getnameofvar for setter and getter respectively

2008599
ubuntu	linux
then i run this program with gdb by the way i m using linux ubuntu 9.04 g++ 4.3.3 gnu gdb 6.8-debian and set a breakpoint at the end of the definition of compute_n_best_parses with some conditions to locate the exact call of this function i wanted i was tracing back from a segmentation fault

2008666
accessor	properties
you can avoid having to fuss with retaining properties by using the self notation to call the accessor and setter methods created by the synthesize directive

2008679
mvp	presenter
the basic idea behind the view presenter portion of a mvp design is that view is lightweight

2008679
mvp	presenter
if you find yourself making radical changes to the presenter to reflect the new ui then likely it not a clean mvp design

2008686
ubuntu	linux
as others have mentioned ubuntu is a great distribution to play with if you ve never used linux before

2008766
gauge	progress
below is part of some code which displays a gauge which shows the progress from 0 - 100 of a word counter however i am unsure how to code the if statement to display some text to show a successful count

2008773
postgresql	mysql
i ve noticed that the connection adapters for mysql have options that specify the required info for setting up an ssl connection but there is no equivalent options for the postgresql postgresql adapter

2008845
composite	memento
i use singleton flyweight composite iterator memento observer state strategy as a matter of routine

2008873
integer	unsigned
note that you can not mix inet_ntoa inet_aton in mysql with ip2long long2ip in php since mysql uses an int unsigned datatype while php uses a signed integer

2008944
firefox	safari
i can get the ads to work when i view the site on a mac using firefox or safari

2009007
folder	directory
the embedded fonts folder is in the project directory and was copied along with it and all references to the fonts that i was able to find were relative paths

2009015
ascx	onclientclick
if you want to add your own javascript functions on the code behind you can use btn1.attributes.add onclientclick yourjs or if in aspx ascx side you can use onclientclick

2009059
post	get
the fb client tries to use available data to authenticate - post get cookies - but if it fails it will redirect to an fb login

2009067
versioning	upgrade
the script requires php 5.1.0 which is out since 2005-11-24 - time to upgrade if not yet at this versioning and gd which is rarely missing from good web hosts

2009094
getter	setter
if you want to be careful paranoid i d have an empty class with virtual getter setter methods as the base class rather than as above so compiler keeps the code correct

2009101
maven	m2e
i did that with tons of projects maven and eclipse live side-by-side without m2e

2009101
maven	m2e
a second option is to try to integrate eclipse and maven with m2e plugin as crowne mentioned but i found this unnecessary

2009133
post	get
and when a collection of workposts are lazy loaded from the owning work post sheet i get the following select statement

2009139
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it only happens on ie7+ works fine on other browsers like firefox safari opera and google-chrome

2009152
udp	tcp
if you transmit data over tcp data that doesn t match up with the crc will be rejected but the same data transmitted over udp with the same corruption might be accepted

2009257
children	parent
i am working on a c# project that has a mdi parent form hosting multiple mdi children form

2009257
children	parent
but when i close the mdi parent without close the mdi children form first the tcplistner did not get stopped

2009273
google-chrome	firefox
if i m using google-chrome or firefox i just need to be patient

2009278
centos	linux
python version 2.6.2 os is linux 2.6.18 centos release 5.4 and it s vps machine

2009293
dlsym	dlopen
use dlopen to load the library and dlsym to get the function you need

2009320
int	chars
the raw value of a chars has an int equivalent

2009332
int	chars
because in java chars is an integral data type whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

2009332
int	chars
in case you re talking about the fact that int value assignment to chars normally gives you a possible loss of precision compiler error as the following code will demonstrate

2009332
int	chars
in the second 3-line version the assignment isn t allowed because the int variable could take any value from -2147483648 to 2147483647 inclusive most of which are out of range for the chars variable to contain

2009352
html5lib	beautifulsoup
use an html parser instead like beautifulsoup html5lib hpricot or nokogiri

2009405
width	height
take all letters as divs with some background while letter e is where the content is placed and it is dynamic so it can get any height while the width will be 100 for whole window there is another div as the menu floating left of that div but i didn t consider it here

2009411
innodb	myisam
at the end it will have something like engine innodb or engine myisam

2009428
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the rtm versioning here

2009450
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the rtm versioning of powershell 2.0 here

2009513
addclass	removeclass
i don t think addclass and removeclass have duration parameters

2009535
firefox	safari
however even their demo for addclass does not work in safari 4 but worked fine in firefox 3.5

2009568
folder	directory
in the first project i upload some images to a specific folder under the project root and save just the filename in the database now i am trying to display this images at some page of the second project i know the filename from the database and the image folder as absolute pat but i have not been able to display the image even thought when looking in firebug the image src is correct the image does not display probably because it is not pointing in the right directory

2009573
put	get
i am thinking the way to accomplish this in the changeparentfunction is to call a controller action to get a new list then grab the mylistbox object and reassign it but am unsure how to put it all together

2009576
int	chars
returns nil for no match or an int chars position if there

2009584
mouse	keyboard
more specifically i need the application to stop processing all input both mouse and keyboard when the dialog is launched and resume when it s closed

2009643
uilabel	uibutton
some people write functions that add 1000 or some other integer that allows you group types of subviews together â uilabel instances get 1000 1001 and so on and uibutton instances would get 2000 2001 etc

2009676
hide	show
i am using this code to hide and show a div based on which thumbnail you rollover

2009684
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog box that pop-up you should be able to choose the php editor

2009778
stdout	stderr
you should also scan p.geterrorstream - some programs write to stderr which is indistinguishable from stdout when run from the command line

2009864
firefox	safari
when developing simple code against ie6 and safari i found that going back to firefox and ie8 is incredibly easier

2009873
put	get
2 if the .pyc files are actually bundled inside the python exe by py2exe or put in the same directory as the .exe or put into a named subdirectory which is then set as part of the pythonpath variable e.g w pylib i get importerror no module named os os is the first module imported before sys and anything else

2009917
maven	pom.xml
to do so you need to add the jboss maven repository to the pom.xml of your project

2009953
prepare	execute
prepare statements explicitly tells mysql what is sql and what is data so mysql wonâ t execute any sql in the data

2010043
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	submit	submission
once setting the action for the form in firefox safari google-chrome the submit method works fine while in ie 8 nothing happens when submit is called i am submission a form to paypal not that it matters

2010139
hide	show
the alternative is that all three steps be on the base page to begin with and you can show hide tham as required

2010140
redhat	fedora
i m trying to install ffmpeg on a virtual dedicated server with redhat fedora core 7 but get the following error

2010181
bitset	bitvector
it s often called a bitset or bitvector

2010210
sml	scheme
i mean types very broadly speaking to include such things as caml module types sml signatures and plt scheme units . to communicate how a large application works i suggest three things

2010215
put	get
if i just add an int to the structure then if i put too many objects let s say 70 so much less than the limit of the block i get a segmentation fault when writing

2010243
switching	accessory	switching	screens
you could switching to using the standard chevron for the item details screens but the i button or a custom button is perfectly acceptable as well and you could set your custom button as the cell s accessory view so it s in the exact same place

2010247
inherited	properties
because it dropped a few css properties not being inherited because of the new position in the page i used jquery to add them

2010252
division	multiplication
or will the wonders of pipelining and the absence of multiplication and division make it all come out about even

2010300
treeviewitem	listboxitem
within that datatemplate is a treeview which displays various properties as treeviewitem children of a root treeviewitem which represents the items being displayed in the listboxitem

2010316
post	get
i post all the login info and i get the response back

2010336
textchanged	keyup	keydown	keyup
i added a bunch of trace statements in events hooked by this textbox and i found that when i lost keystrokes the keyup keydown and keypress events all correctly fired but the textchanged event never fired

2010336
keydown	keyup
in case there is a suggestion that i use the keyup keydown events to determine if the text has changed there is an issue there as well

2010336
keydown	keyup
keyup keydown are called multiple times for each key press so it would be very difficult to determine if someone was typing the same letter multiple times

2010356
post	get
use jquery to make an ajax request passing parameter from 3 as get or post data

2010372
width	height
i want a internal popup or nice modal box which contains an iframe i should able to set the width and height and which is easy to install and has no too much files

2010379
merb	ruby-on-rails
i need to spend some serious time reading about changes in ruby 1.9.1 and upcoming ruby-on-rails 3 merb

2010418
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my application s root view controller is a uitabbarcontroller where each tab is a uinavigationcontroller

2010420
hash	md5
what you need to pass is the md5 hash of the url instead of the actual url

2010420
hash	md5
php has a md5 function that you can use to get the md5 hash of a url

2010420
hash	md5
the api call then would be for story.getall and you pass the previously calculated md5 hash as a parameter link_hash

2010436
put	get	post	put	post	get
i put up several other post about the problems that never get satisfactory answers but that do result in a few work arounds

2010482
cos	sin
you should replace sin and cos with math.sin and math.cos

2010494
cos	sin
you will also need to change the calls to cos and sin to be math.cos and math.sin

2010507
int	boolean
using an n bit int to represent n boolean is a special case of the data structure known as a perfect hash table

2010531
expression-blend	silverlight
on the development tools front - the best tool out there imho is expression-blend - it has an elegant and powerful ui for visually creating either wpf or silverlight user interfaces

2010537
put	get	folder	directory
just find .jpg .png gif with glob put those filenames to dictionary or array and find those filenames againt html css js files remove filename if found and you will get unused list and move those images to another folder with same directory structure it will be good for restoring for just in case

2010569
next	except
it seems to work okay except when two phrases occur immediately next to each other

2010581
versioning	upgrade
you do need to upgrade to 7.6 before upgrading to 8.0 from an earlier versioning

2010602
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i have gotten around this by animating my shutter on top of the normal shutter when the view appears using the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods of uiimagepickercontroller

2010617
gif	png
next monitor your log files for 404 s pertaining to gif jpg png files

2010631
getter	setter
you then write some inspect able getter setter methods as the public api to your component and then implement these getter setter methods to do data validation and implement the internal logic of your component

2010633
width	height
unlike css there is no unit for html width height these properties are plain integers

2010659
ant	pom.xml
if you have an existing project it likely has a build.xml pom.xml or makefile in which case you need to run ant mvn or make respectively

2010662
textview	imageview
the customview has imageview and two textview

2010662
textview	imageview
the problem is that when the background changes from the default greyish all the views in the customview imageview and textview still have their greyish background and thus creates very ugly greay boxes on top of the now redish background

nginx	lighttpd
nginx lighttpd these are lightweight event-based servers which use select epoll poll to multiplex a number of sockets without needing multiple threads or processes

2014241
apache	lighttpd
apache supported configurations lighttpd cgi this is mostly a dying-off method of hosting

2014241
fastcgi	scgi
all web servers fastcgi scgi ajp this is the external hosting model of running dynamic languages

2014241
fastcgi	scgi
fastcgi scgi ajp proxied http because your application is essentially a server in and of itself this depends on the language the server is written in usually the same language as your code but not always and various factors

2014241
nginx	lighttpd
for lighttpd nginx they can handle a large number of connections thousands in a tiny memory footprint often just a few megs per thousand connections depends on factors like buffers and how async io apis are set up

2014241
nginx	lighttpd
if you truly need to scale to 1000 connections or more and want keep-alive you will want to look at nginx lighttpd and other lightweight event-based servers

2014241
apache	nginx
it might be noted that if you do want apache for configuration ease of use or need to host certain setups you can put nginx in front of apache using http proxying

2014241
apache	nginx
this will allow nginx to handle keep-alive connections and preferably static files and apache to handle only the grunt work

2014241
apache	nginx
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

2014241
apache	nginx
for a production deployment we have been very happy with nginx in front of apache with mod_wsgi in this instance

distance	polygons
the most intuitive scale factor would be the ratio of distance from current mouse position to the polygons centre to distance from mouse position at start of drag to the polygons centre - so that clicking on a point in the polygons and dragging it twice as far from the centre as it was doubles the size of the polygons

2014899

ilist	icollection
a bag persists icollection or ilist but provides no guarantees for indexing is an unordered collection that allows duplicates

2014958

in the firewall control panel i didn t double check that the firewall had opened port 1433 tcp and 1434 udp on the public network which is what win7 treats the loopback adapter network as

2014984
int	double
you can t do anything with a struct that doesn t have a type determined at compile time so you ll probably want a master struct with lots of fields so it can handle all the int s all the bool s all the float s all the double s and so forth any of your structs is going to have

2015047
hash	salt
hash that password with a salt

2015047
hash	md5
if you have to use md5 sha use a technique called stretching and hash it s hash several thousand times

2015236
int	boolean
on a related note the java compiler uses int to represent boolean since jvm has a limited support for the boolean type.see section 3.3.4 the boolean type

2015249
post	get
the problem with your script is that though you re sending a post method you re adding the data in the url as though it were a get

2015263
short	base
but i imagine one way you could implement a short url is by incrementing the value using the characters 0-9a-za-z -- essentially using a base 62 number system

2015321
int	boolean
what i did was create a separate table called location_properties columns were id int location_id foreign key is_hidden boolean

but put the contents of a word doc in there and can t get it out

2015409
post	get
you should always check sanitize all data you get in your php code because anyone could post data to all of your pages

2015412
fast-forward	merge
the branches which do exist both in origin and upstream need to be synchronized as well rebasing your local branches on top of those from upstream before pushing your work to origin can be a good way to make very easy pull request to upstream bitprophet would only have fast-forward merge to do to include your work

2015444
post	get
so be sure to verify and sanitize all the data you receive no matter if post or get or update or whatever

2015447
ubuntu	linux
some linux distributions like ubuntu split the packages between the library runtime and the dev files so you need to install both packages

2015490
switching	screens
once you make your nice little game engine with menus and screens ready to be reused asobu the timeline seems a bit pointless for switching views

2015501
put	get
you get to put it on your resume

2015555
versioning	upgrade
i also had a really old versioning of livna already installed so i had to upgrade rather than install

awt	swing
the awt swing event dispatcher thread etc

2015624
put	get
when i try to put more than one of these controls in my main silverlight control i get a xamlparseexception with the message the name already exists in the tree

2015704
hide	show
there are different approaches that can be taken to accomplish this the application might close the window and open a new copy when restoring or it might simply hide the original window and show it upon restoring

2015715
config	ini
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

2015739
post	get
but i want to use post and not get since get is not suitable for this kind of stuff changing something

2015780
websphere	ibm
as i said above goes well doesn t really makes sense as this depends on the container you are using and containers might have different compatibility requirements for example ibm websphere s j2ee 1.4 server may not work with jdk 5

2015784
jobs	cron
this is a redesign of a legacy system that currently controls everything with a plethora of cron jobs

2015784
jobs	cron
the cron jobs currently have the ability to send sms messages or emails should one of the tasks fail

2015838
glassfish	geronimo	websphere	ibm
note that these download packages actually include sun s version of java ee glassfish these days which is different than apache s version of java ee tomcat geronimo or ibm s version of java ee websphere

2015861
decoder	encoder
apache commons offers a decent encoder decoder

2015911
jobs	cron
if so then your dba s objection is irrelevant you don t want to run the jobs when the database is offline for planned downtime and the dba ought to have something in place to alert them if the database is down for unplanned reasons rather than relying on a signal from a failing cron job

2015931
entities	entitymanager
edit additionally the persistentcontext type is transaction-scoped by default 16.11.1.1 in the spec so all entities managed by entitymanager are detached at the end of each transaction

2015940
put	get
call gettransactionisolation before the query to get the current mode so you can put it back after the stmt if you like

2016015
int	chars
you declare an int to tell the program after how many chars you wish to insert the second string into the first

2016131
post	get
your request get post hits the router then your router says that the post urls belongs to the postscontroller and the action is index

2016131
post	put
then when you edit something and click the submit button it makes a request by default a put to post passing all the values in the form then your controller gets the post values of the requests the ones you see in the server log and makes his work like saving the post s datas

2016186
width	height
say i have an .jpg image on the file server and that i need to get its height and width

2016242
addclass	removeclass
then use the addclass removeclass to finish it up

2016277
keydown	keyup
it could be that both keyup and keydown are conflicting.

2016277
keydown	keyup
my suggestion is to change the code completely in this manner as shown take out either keydown or keyup event handler as they simplistically put it are the same ok technically it is designated respectively for when a key is pressed down and likewise when a key is released

2016290
client-side	server-side
without server-side sessions you could try to achieve this with client-side session cookies or inspecting the referrer header but then it s trivial for the clients to fake as these are just strings that they send you and you accept their word for it

2016311
implements	extends
java s java.io.closeable interface implements by streams automagically extends autocloseable so you can already use streams in a try block the same way you would use them in a c# using block

2016329
cvs	svn
a dialog will appear asking weather this is a cvs or svn project

2016352
ocl	uml
it occurs in several books has a relation to ocl which is considered part of uml but the latest ocl specification by omg no longer mentions these terms

2016369
post	put
there would be no need to put the post into the same group as a user and in fact this would be a bad idea since comments posted in any of a users post would all be contending to write the same entity group

2016407
int	double
as i mentioned i assume it has to do with double precision as it also works fine with int eq 8 2 16

2016422
public	protected
the public and protected methods of the base class can still access private variables of the base class and these methods are available in the derived class

2016464
implements	extends
wnere the tank and soldier classes both extends from or implements enemy like this

2016483
int	chars
the static modifier is not necessary and you have to explicitly cast your int to a chars

2016506
getter	setter
using getter and setter is good for the encapsulation of code

2016544
post	get
lastly i switched the the methods from get methods to post methods wrote a bit of code using webrequest webresponse with the same result

2016550
hide	show
enables or disables the show hide grid button which appears on the right side of the caption layer

2016619
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
i d like to have a uiviewcontroller which has an add and a trash button both right to the title either by adding two uibutton to the navigation item bar or by adding them to a uisegmentedcontrol and then adding the segmentedcontrol to the item

2016636
versioning	upgrade
the xibs compiled fine using 3.0 but when i upgrade to 3.1.2 i started getting the error pattern colors are not supported by the iphone sdk for iphone os versioning prior to 3.0.

2016641
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
to write preference files you can use the nsuserdefaults or cfpreferences apis

2016652
tax	shipping
2.your callback server responds with the available shipping options for that address along with any insurance options and tax adjustments on the order

2016665
super	extends
extends the defaultsingleselectionmodel and overiding the setselectedindex method seems to do the job fine calling the super method only if the switch is to be permitted

2016704
put	get	post	put	post	get
i wrote a blog post on how to get around this issue and i even put up some code for helper methods you can swipe from my site

2016714
ubuntu	debian
for debian based distro have a look at packaging java apps for ubuntu slides are available here

2016714
ant	maven
this tool allows to generate a unique cross-platform installer provides native integration is highly customizable covers the uninstall part and the generation of the installer can be easily included in an automated build ant or maven based

2016745
dictionary	map
this doesn t make any less meaningful practical necessary to map dictionary to other objects

2016765
implements	extends
basically i want to know why an abstract decorator class must be created which implements or extends some interface or abstract class

2016782
hide	show
then the user can hide and show them via button clicks

2016785
public	protected
those protected or public base class methods can still invoke the private base class methods

2016788
pull	push
however i do not want all of these commits to go on github so a simple clone and then just push pull approach does not suit

2016788
pull	push
so pc1 and pc2 should be able to push pull to the local network share and thus share code between each other and every once in a while i want to push those changes to my github repository

2016788
pull	push
creating the repository on the server without --bare means that it has it s own work dir so when i git push from the pcs the server does not pick that up i m guessing i somehow need git pull from the pcs but i want to avoid that

2016828
hash	md5
i would probably base the md5 hash on a combination of unique identifier and a random number

2016855
put	get
but when i put struts in my web-inf lib directory and try to make a struts app i get the below in the log file

2016860
accessor	properties
indexers resemble properties except that their accessor take parameters.

2016864
accessor	properties
a get accessor of a properties corresponds to a method with no parameters whereas a get accessor of an indexer corresponds to a method with the same formal parameter list as the indexer

2016864
accessor	properties
a set accessor of a properties corresponds to a method with a single parameter named value whereas a set accessor of an indexer corresponds to a method with the same formal parameter list as the indexer plus an additional parameter named value

2016864
inherited	properties
in an overriding properties declaration the inherited properties is accessed using the syntax base.p where p is the properties name

2016872
pull	push
if you make a git clone --bare mygithubrepo.git on your share and then clone that sharedrepo on pc1 and pc2 you have set up for each of those pc repo a natural destination for them to push pull

2016881
pull	push
developers that don t have push access to the main remote can push pull to a separate remote

2016883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note firefox google-chrome and safari use the same service maybe it s of google too

2016891
for-loop	arrays
but i d recommend the for-loop to avoid clashing with library modifications or when firefox suddenly decide to implement its own each method for arrays some libraries have already been bitten by this

2016895
qtcore	qtgui
i m not sure why it wasn t auto-included but i think it has something to do with qtcore only being used by qtgui which is a c++ lib.

2016930
pop-up	dialog
2- the div becomes visible but no dialog window pop-up

2016947
solaris	bsd
it will only run on x86 systems not sparc etc. with directx compliant hardware rendering units graphics cards and it will not run on a system with strong hardware abstraction like most unices like bsd or linux or solaris

2016960
bash	zsh
you could switch to zsh instead of bash

2016960
bash	zsh
zsh has lots of other features that bash lacks but that one alone is worth making the switch for

2016975
ant	buildr
i have a buildr script that first loads a java properties file then creates an ant task

2016975

2017124
ubuntu	centos	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	centos
we use a mix of centos ubuntu server and gentoo which are run headless since most of our apps are java apache based

2017132
updatepanel	scriptmanager
alternately if you re using updatepanel use scriptmanager s equivalent register... methods

2017138
ubuntu	debian
in the server debian ubuntu instructions

2017207
client-side	server-side
there s no bit of client-side or server-side for that matter validation that takes longer to run than the second or so that is an acceptable response time

2017218
memset	malloc
i would equate that roughly to someone listing c c++ on their resume and being expected to write a short program that uses basic language features like sizeof memset or malloc

2017293
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
swfobject will be executed as soon as it is read and will perform all dom manipulations as soon as the dom is loaded - for all browsers that support this like ie firefox safari and opera 9+ - or otherwise as soon as the onload event fires

2017315
post	put
edit i put box-shadow in the post earlier but i meant the respective specific directives such as -moz-box-shadow

2017334
width	height
i am not sure if you need to use a particular container but in any event set the width and height to 100 and use grid gridrow and griditem to size and resize text control you can specify the width of the table or just use it just like an html table in flex to manipulate the size of controls and containers..

2017362
stdout	stderr
so you need to call createpipe twice to create two pipes one for stdin one for stdout and stderr

2017390
post	get
this means that our facebook method calls are made over the internet by sending http get or post requests to the facebook api rest server

2017398
hash	md5
at a minimum the password should be stored as a sha1 md5 hash

2017416

i have a simple dimensions class containing a width height property and a constructor to set them

2017440
gridview	detailsview
i have a gridview with imagebutton commandname insert which will change the mode of the detailsview to insert

2017467
free	malloc
our malloc sticks magic cookies before and after a malloc block of memory and checks these on free

2017502
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
then use gobjdump you might have to install that yourself from macports fink homebrew to see what s inside the files and compare the two versions

2017523
cout	cin
my students who learn cin and cout first then learn printf later overwhelmingly prefer printf or more usually fprintf

2017553
for-loop	arrays
the information received in an arrays so i use for-loop to append them to my html page in this way

2017623
getter	setter
unless i am thoroughly mistaken the getter setter pattern is a common pattern used for two things

2017623
getter	setter
to make sure that in the future if you happen to have a problem to which a good solution would be simply to treat the variable before it goes in and or out of the class you can treat the variable by using an actual implementation on the getter and setter methods instead of simply returning or setting the values

2017679
getter	setter
you can also use a getter or setter type method to get or set computable values much the way properties are used in other languages like c#

2017736
maya	blender
i am taking an opengl course and we have the option to create models to use in our assignments with a 3d modeling application like maya or blender

2017763
maya	blender
there are many options when exporting from a 3d program like maya or blender

2017783
getter	setter
the point of the getter setter pattern is to give the clas control over it s data and to decrease coupling other class knowing how data is stored

2017821
swt	swing
qt jambi is much simple and easier to use than swing and swt

2017826
post	get
it seems it was a simple error on my part something simple as checking for a post request instead of a get request here is my new code below

2017850
gif	png
these types will be automatically detected if your build of php supports them jpeg png gif wbmp and gd2.

2017860
width	height
i currently have two floating divs side by side that are the same width and height

just create a servlet which gets an inputstream of it using fileinputstream and write it to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse along with a correct set of headers

2017894
subclass	abstract-class
i will publish an interface abstract-class called thingstore and i ll subclass it to treethingstore and listthingstore each respectively using trees or linked lists

2017898
post	put
so i ll put up a link to that post as well

2017983
inherited	subclassing
the code in __new__ might also be used to allow sorteddict to be subclassing in a diamond inherited structure where it is possible sorteddict.__init__ is not called before the first __setitem__ and the like are called

2017997
interpreted-language	compiled-language
java is a statically typed compiled-language while ruby is a dynamically typed interpreted-language

2018009
inherited	subclassing
but the parent class inherited it and the subclassing inherited the parent class

2018036
testdriven.net	xunit.net
xunit.net also provides support for this and works well with testdriven.net

2018044
getter	setter
as i understand it you should and can avoid custom getter and setter and then you can leave core data to do it s thing and not worry about retain release

2018051
put	get
i would just put this in the of your document and apply the class to the html element instead of body so you don t get a fous or flash of unstyled content

2018059
for-loop	loops
i am trying to see if i can convert a for-loop to a foreach loops

2018074
urllib	httplib
with google app engine you can use any of httplib urllib or urllib2 but all of them are just wrappers for google s url fetch api

2018088
accessor	properties
the reason of that relies on the properties accessor the dot notation

2018092
post	get
use post for large data instead of get

2018126
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with your firefox or google-chrome safari etc open you will be asked to login without password enter an email as your login and tick the login as administrater box login

2018129
scrollable	panels
it worked when in design mode resizing the picture box and web browser would cause the panels to enable its scrollbars but didn t work during runtime i added code to have the picture box change to the size of the web browser control - which itself is always resized to fit the size of the scrollable contents

2018135
public	protected
there are public private and protected methods

2018227
versioning	upgrade
edit to clarify you can upgrade a project through visual studio but it can still be set to target an older versioning of .net

2018241
hash	md5
due to an absurd soap authentication scheme i need to md5 hash an api key with some other parameters

2018243
swt	swing
different toolkits i.e swing swt have their own way of doing things

2018279
identifier	ambiguous
backticks are used to qualify identifier that could otherwise be ambiguous ie

2018286
keydown	keyup
the browser will should fire a separate keydown keyup event for each key even if they are simultaneously pressed

2018288
keydown	keyup
maybe you can do it by keeping track of keydown and keyup event for each key and you ll know if two keys are being held at the same time

2018301
onkeyup	onkeydown
javascript has onkeydown and onkeyup events

2018322
cpu	processors
when tracking cpu statistics be aware that multiple processors and multiple cores will complicate any accurate statistics in some cases

2018370
button	checkbox
updated this answer works for checkbox radio button input and textareas

2018379
int	boolean
this code fails because int newid is boolean

2018384
getter	setter
false will make hibernate start faster since it does not try to build cglib-enhanced objects to access getter setter and use standard jdk reflection for access

2018385
jar	manifest.mf
put your code in a jar i ll call it app.jar along with a meta-inf manifest.mf file with entries like this

2018403
getter	setter
you would store the value internally in some constant unit presumably si and convert it in the property getter setter

2018416
hash	salt
the service will return the hash password and salt to the client the client will perform the authentication

2018507
error-handling	exception-handling
exception-handling are a way to separate error-handling code from regular code

2018563
qapplication	qwidget
the key point is using qapplication s focuschanged slot and qwidget s activatewindow

super	self
super sorteddict self .__init__ data on the other hand calls the parent class constructor

2018592
button	checkbox
i have checkbox next to every record and a delete button

2018597
width	height
i have tried giving height width etc.

2018614
post	get
i guess it s good we didn t get around to writing blog post about it as we had planned we ve accomplished some pretty impressive feats with this and the vsto but this news is disappointing

2018638
mouse	keyboard
you can easily capture dynamic ranges where you use the mouse keyboard to mark top-left and bottom-right corners as well as pre-specified ranges like same range as last time or the current window with simple key combinations this last one is ideal for our demo and documentation purposes

2018641
width	height
in fact the documentation warns about the automatic width for the columns feature and my attempts to use dynamic width and height for the table itself failed

2018662
bids	ssis
my thought after breifly looking at and playing with bids and ssis is that building a package with the gui would seem to provide a substantial productivity boost over them having to write custom reformatting logic

2018890
ubuntu	linux
i m not a big fan of it from a design perspective but historically powered the gnome desktop ubuntu s default ...and google chose it for their version of chrome for linux

2018933
public	protected
also i need to get whether function is private protected or public

2018935
innodb	myisam
it seems that mysql select content as opposed to count queries always take at least a table read lock on myisam tables and a row read lock on innodb tables

2018943
jar	manifest.mf
an executable jar has a main class defined in the jar s manifest.mf file and the manifest also allows the definition of a class path to include libraries that the code in the executable jar will need

2018943
jar	manifest.mf
and last but not least the final jar s manifest.mf file tells one-jar what your main class is

2018948
yslow	pagespeed
only way to know is to measure it with tool like yslow or pagespeed

2018965
cvs	svn
multiple checkouts can be because of working on different branches in cvs svn but in my case it is due to cloning of the master branch in git in git each clone is like a branch

2019046
pull	push
of course this kind of thing is usually fraught with browser compatibility issues and it would be an obscure push pull implementation for sure but i think javascript can access domains and urls and in some cases of usage not be restricted to the one it originated from

2019061
versioning	upgrade
this issue is partly gone in jboss 5.1 so if you can upgrade to that versioning

2019087
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i tested both bazaar and git in one working copy which was actually tracked with svn my then main vcs

2019110
innodb	myisam
i generally use innodb tables in my apps but for the log table i did it as myisam and used insert delayed

2019110
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t provide all the goodies of innodb but i believe it is slightly faster for that reason

2019128
post	get
i have to send get or post request to localhost

2019133
liferay	alfresco
i followed the steps on to integrate alfresco as a portlet in liferay 5.2.3

liferay	alfresco
i am able to add the alfresco portlet to my liferay page but it shows the message portlet is temporarily unavailable

2019218
merb	ruby-on-rails
i manage 8 different sites all running versions of our product running on a mix of ruby-on-rails merb rack and thin on all running on plain old ruby 1.8.7

2019218
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails 2 and merb 4

2019282
submit	submission
in addition http or soap adapters can be used to submit messages in order but in that case the http or soap client needs to enforce the order by submission messages one at a time

2019294
google-chrome	firefox
he has tried with a lot of browsers google-chrome firefox ie but it doesn t work in any for him

2019297
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
i would suggest storing it as a salt md5 hash

2019297
hash	md5
you could calculate the md5 hash in perl if you wish it doesn t make much difference unless you are micro-optimizing

2019297
hash	md5
another benefit of using a md5 or sha1 hash for the password is you can define the password column as a fixed width char 32 or char 40 for md5 and sha1 respectively

2019330
sudoers	passwd
you can change etc sudoers so that openvpn command can be run without giving the passwd

2019356
google-chrome	firefox
if he s trying it in google-chrome or firefox have him press ctrl+shift+j and that will bring up the javascript error console

2019358
fflush	gets
changing your sub to use print and purge instead of fflush gets around problem

2019386
button	checkbox
so i can not fix the number of radio buttons.some questions may have multiple answers.so i need to display checkbox instead of radio button

2019390
nsurl	nsstring
you are using a plain nsstring literal where an nsurl object is expected ... initwithurl ...

2019435
versioning	upgrade
you application needs to use a specific rails versioning mostly because different tiny releases might require additional steps to upgrade the framework such as changes to boot.rb

2019439
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
create a radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist for each question and use its items collection to add the answers

2019531
free	malloc
it s likely unrelated to the problems you have with malloc and free which work on raw untyped memory

2019556
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome achieves this using the open source webkit rendering engine which is also used by apple s safari web browser

2019572
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
if i m correct than you need to have an extra column like ismultipleanswers bit in the table in db or whatever the source is you need to have a flag for each question and handle a event for the detailview like databinding check the value for this field based on that either add radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist

2019621
mamp	wamp
i cant find good guides equivalent to lamp mamp wamp so i understand the parts when using either java or python

2019632
installation	upgrade
again while it s possible to build a manual protocol i d still fall back on using one of the purpose-built tools out there and both team system and sql compare will be able to output scripts that you could include as part of an installation upgrade package

2019733
hide	show
in the find a therapist box on my site i show hide other fields based on whether the user selects face to face telephone email or leaves this unselected

2019749
google-chrome	safari
works in google-chrome and safari

2019759
maven	m2e
if using maven is an option then maven overlays would be perfect here and it should theoretically be supported by the m2e plugin

2019764
spaces	delimiter
if you really did split on just the first delimiter you d see a leading spaces in your second array element

2019807
hash	md5
essentially it spins around the current script manager and appends the javascript file path with an md5 hash of the file

2019841
rss	feed
i know the wss web parts are limited so i m going to use the rss feed for the list and filter transform it through some xsl using the xml web part

2019846
mutators	setter
every setter mutators call forwards to the private instance creating it when it doesn t exist

2019866
put	get
for some reason i get this error when i put that html block into the content variable server cannot set content type after http headers have been sent

2019939
django	web2py
edit django and web2py are very very similar

2019939
django	web2py
i think i prefer web2py because it does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing

2019965
google-chrome	safari
use firebug or google-chrome safari inspector to explore the html content and pattern of interesting information

2019972
int	boolean	subobject	instances
if you want to check if a generic objects contains simple properties primitives like number int uint string boolean or complex properties subobject instances of some class that you might regards as children to that generic object you do the following

i remember reading somewhere it s a good practice to redirect pages using get to show the next page after a post request

2020809
post	get
if you redirect to the thankyou page with get the post vars are empty so the form won t be resubmitted

2020813
post	get

free	malloc
since all calls to malloc will go through your hook you can synchronize on a semaphore wait until it is free lock it juggle the hooks and free the semaphore

2021089
free	malloc
programmers should instead preempt calls to the relevant functions by defining and exporting functions like malloc and free

2021089

nfa	dfa
first this is not a question asking for the algorithm to convert a nfa to dfa

2021890
nfa	dfa
it s known and proved that the equivalent dfa of a nfa has at most 2 n states even though most of the times it will have more or less the same number of states as the nfa

2021890
nfa	dfa
which particular type of nfa will require an equivalent dfa to have 2 n states

2021954
uicontrol	uibutton
if uibutton doesn t work then perhaps try a custom subclass of uicontrol which tracks the same touch down actions etc.

2021960
nant	cruisecontrol
it s probably not the account that nant is running under but the account that cruisecontrol is running under since it s the one executing that process

2021986
range	max	range	min	min	max
by assuming the range wraps around when going below min or above max

2021986
range	max	range	min	min	max
by assuming the range wraps around when going below min or above max

2022006
nfa	dfa
if you take an nfa where each transition is uniquely determined a deterministic nfa then it is nothing but a normal dfa

2022006
nfa	dfa
as for an nfa with n states for which the equivalent dfa has 2 n states think about exploiting non-determinism

2022006
nfa	dfa
this gives you a nfa with n+1 states 1 being the starting state where the dfa requires 2 n +1 states

2022045
post	get
i ve added the else clause in hopes that i can get it to only post back when the checkbox is checked but it s posting back in either case

2022655
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
if you are using a component-based framework like tapestry jsf or wicket there might be a more high-level way of handling this

2022693

2022777
set-cover	np-complete
and the words in a2 do not contain dashes then it s a just set-cover in disguise an np-complete optimization problem

2022793
versioning	upgrade
if we could upgrade our versioning of .net i would just return a but that s not going to be an option for some time yet

2022797
int	double
but usually when it comes from sql server you should not convert it first to a string than to int double but convert it directly from object in row column1 to needed value this will save you troubles handling cultures and improve performance a bit

2022915
getter	setter
i was having the problem of wanting a property to have an internal getter and a protected setter as described in this question and i thought i solved that by doing the following

2022926
jobs	cron
if you have overlapping cron jobs you need to have a locking mechanism to control access

2022927
width	height
if you are talking about icons and icon sets used in your application the original low-density format had a size of 10 x 9 width x height

2022942

2022983
int	boolean	int	double
the entity for the records being deleted consists of just strings int boolean and double

2023000
int	boolean
java byte code does not have a datatype boolean therefore boolean primitives are converted to int 32 bit except boolean arrays where a boolean value is represented by a bit

2023008
hash	salt
use salt hash to store it and if the user forgets it generate a new one for them

2023008

fgets	strtol
but it is suggest that you use fgets and strtol instead

2023109
post	get
since this post seems to get decent amount of attention i d like to let you know that the solution ended up being to provide a proper enctype content type parameter in the declaration

2023144
post	put
put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

2023164
jar	war	cobertura	maven-antrun-plugin
unfortunately while cobertura can instrument an ear sar zip war jar i don t think that the cobertura-maven-plugin supports this out-of-the-box and it may be a better option to use cobertura s ant task with the maven-antrun-plugin

2023195
versioning	upgrade
if we could upgrade our versioning of .net i would just return a tuple but that s not going to be an option for some time yet

2023286
getter	setter
for the blobs i tend to use the canonical private attribute + getter + setter since it abstracts the actual implementation from the client

2023286
getter	setter
there is more functionality there getter setter duo

2023286
public	protected
it wreaks havoc on the accessors public protected private so it s best not to intersped it throughout the class

2023300
inherited	properties
my models all inherited from a basemodel class which also has a currentuser properties

2023318
getter	setter
read-only for a property is easy just create a getter method without the corresponding setter

2023481
post	get
i ve been through other similar post on stack overflow but would be good to get views specific to this type of common message storing

2023499
int	chars
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags

2023499
tinyint	boolean
if mysql goes so far as to equate tinyint 1 with boolean it seems like the way to go

2023520
int	chars
chars columns have encodings and collations and comparing them could involve unnecessary switches between encodings so my guess is that an int will be faster

2023544
jar	manifest.mf
when you select the main class in eclipse this is what gets set in main-class myprograms.myclass inside of the jar manifest meta-inf manifest.mf in side of the jar file

2023549

pop-up	dialog
after that whenever you use any command a dialog will pop-up first showing you the exact command line parameters tortoiseproc.exe is started with

2023845
datediff	difference
something like this should do the trick using datediff to get the difference between two dates and then dividing the product_stat column by that difference

2023873
hide	show
update i was going to implement show and hide methods although setting display to none would probably work just fine they would prefer an explicit method

2023892
getter	setter
in a well-designed application getter and setter should be rare not automated

2023901

2024109
jsf	seam
i would give seam a test drive just because gavin king is behind it but i think its jsf based

2024168

hash	md5
you do a md5 username+firstname+lastname+ mysupersecretsalt and save the value in hash

2024173
typedef	typename
typename is used to declare when you are referencing a nested type that depends on another template parameter such as the typedef in this example

2024176
width	height
edit you may have to play with the size height and width of your input files

2024189
children	parent
you need to reference what that acutal id is that s getting rendered which is availble with the clientid property on the control hfuser.clientid or access your control in a different more roundabout way like find the controls parent then search through its children to find your control

2024240
google-chrome	safari

2024337
profiler	aqtime
personally i use a code profiler that supports both managed and unmanaged and mixed mode code aqtime

2024339
getter	setter
you can still use a dp for the implementation by the way the implements directive is on the clr property and does not interfere with the do not touch implementation of the getter and setter

2024339
inherited	properties
if the class you want to implement it on already has inherited command commandparameter and commandtarget properties and you want the interface implementation to reuse those you ll need to create new properties with new names declare them as interface implementations and back them onto the existing properties

2024342
hide	show
i m using jquery s slidetoggle to show hide divs

2024342
hide	show
i tried replacing href # with href but that disables the div show hide effect

2024352
springboard	backgrounding
i ve also looked at putting this work onto a backgrounding thread and letting the main thread terminate in theory letting us go back to springboard while continuing to run for a few seconds

2024393
mouseleave	mouseenter
in parts of our program we slide it out based on a mouseenter event and slide it back in on a mouseleave event however we are currently using a 3rd party library s treeview for this which i have been tasked with replacing

2024393
mouseleave	mouseenter
the scrollbar does not fire mouseenter or mouseleave for the control and that makes using mouseenter mouseleave for sliding out the control unusable since the user can not use the scrollbar

2024421
uiview	calayer
then put each tile in a calayer and attach all the calayers to the uiview and move them around and rotate them

2024421
uiview	calayer
calayer is similar to uiview in principle but much lighter weight faster and simpler

2024427
mouse	keyboard
many of these methods involve simulating the keyboard so by far the most important thing is to consider the accessibility of your site without using a mouse

2024462
awt	swing
learning java se is not only learning to develop desktop applications or applets which are basically just swing awt

2024462
awt	swing
you can however skip any swing awt chapters

2024465
calloc	malloc
also use calloc in this case not malloc as you are basically implementing the former s functionality by multiplying the number of rooms by the size of the room

2024472
implements	extends
let s say i have a protocolcodecfactory which extends demuxingprotocolcodecfactory that has a loginrequestencoder which implements and was added via the factory s addmessageencoder method

2024503
super	implements
this makes it hard to implements any kind of super admin who can manage the members in all of the clubs

2024569
pull	push
you can t do this with sql alone you d need to pull the data from the database manipulate it and then push it back

2024627

2024701
superclass	subclassing
you re adding a new method in a subclassing which does not exist in the superclass

2024701
superclass	subclassing
there is no way to call the new method in the subclassing using a reference to the superclass

2024724
rss	feed
presumably you don t want stories users have voted on to disappear when they fall out of the rss feed so you re going to have to store a copy of said story in your database

2024768
put	get
to put it simply none of the extensibility method definitions get generated for any part of this one class

2024823

width	height
there is no width or height property for a drawing context only for canvas

2024933
int	chars

since the image is transparent we can know that its either a gif or a png yet your sending the gif header while using imagejpeg - jpegs dont support any kind of transparency

2025080
jquery	scriptaculous
your code is fine you just need to include the jquery library after the prototype and scriptaculous libraries

2025113
ssl	https
therefore if you have ssl enabled for the webserver simply adding https to the url will encrypt the connection and whatever page the url points to will be encrypted while in transit

2025116
puts	gets
to be honest many see a bunch of uris and some gets and puts and posts and think rest is easy

2025182
struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes
i think that struts 2 spring mvc stripes this one is my preferred one wicket this one is getting more and more attention are all decent choices they ll all get the job done the 2 first one being i believe more asked on the job market but not the smartest

2025182
wicket	stripes
if the popularity on the jobs market is an important criteria then i guess stripes and wicket will get eliminated

2025207
superclass	subclassing
i thought about adding a type t to the superclass that the subclassing can specify itself but that didn t seem very promising

2025216
put	get
it all depends on how much work you are willing to put into it in order to get pure mvc

2025242
google-chrome	firefox
tried in ie6 7 8 and google-chrome as usual firefox wrap my text correctly even without it

2025416
mouse	keyboard
it s a collection of computer parts in the computer but there is also monitor keyboard mouse perhaps speakers

2025423
inline	inlining
what going on under the covers is that the compiler is not inlining those functions many compilers will not inline a function unless the code is compiled with the optimizer

2025440
hide	show
what i want to do is show show hide other elements on the page based on if certain options are selected from the drop down

2025440
hide	show
if something else was then selected that would hide and the other element would show for that select option

2025481
g++	gcc
i had to compile it with gcc instead of g++ to see it fail to compile with the invalid lvalue in assignment error.

2025481
min	max
if you don t want to use the built in functions and you should because they will be optimized for whatever hardware you port to then it should be an inline template if using c++ for the same reasons mentioned when meyers sutter et al discuss re-implementing the min and max functions

2025522
freebsd	linux
if you re using a posix-based system linux freebsd mac os x etc. you ll want to check out pthreads link to tutorial

2025522
freebsd	linux
it s currently available on mac os x and freebsd and it s open source - so if you want it to run on linux you can port it

2025526
draggable	droppable
from your description it looks like you want touch - the draggable is considered overlapping as soon as it touches the droppable

2025536
postgresql	mysql
it should be capable of creating ms + mysql + postgresql + oracle databases at least

2025575
getter	setter
if the getter setter myvector is in a different class you need an instance of that class in your main class before you can access it from there

2025611
hide	show
i used jquery hosted from google apis to modify the dom taking advantage of django s own show hide script

the best is to rely on sharepoint api populate the item e.g splist and upload the file

2025695
disk	ram
large db servers typically differ from small ones in several ways more data more cpus more ram and bigger and faster disk or a san

2025740

2025849
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
it would help if you provided loops code as well as the code that is executed in loops but assuming you have a standard for-loop iterating through an arrays the following code should work

2025879
aptana	rubymine
thirdly most popular rails ides rubymine aptana etc have built-in controls for both or one of the mongrel and webrick servers

2025883
ubuntu	linux
hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

2025883
gentoo	ubuntu
the key is picking something you really personally care about -- whether you then work on it with ubuntu or gentoo or with gvim or emacs or eric etc etc it s really a very minor consideration imnsho

2025884
hide	show
show hide tabbarcontroller in iphone

2025919
return-value-optimization	nrvo
you seem to misunderstand return-value-optimization try this example actually nrvo

2025976
class-method	eigenclass
class-method in ruby therefore are just instance methods defined on the class s eigenclass

2025976
class-method	eigenclass
in summary class-method are actually instance methods defined on the eigenclass and the gives you access to the eigenclass

2026023

2026228
inherited	subclassing
i m trying to subclassing an unmanaged statusbar window from my managed com server using a class inherited from nativewindow and am running into a wall trying to make sense of how to properly marshal the contents of an lparam

2026238
serializable	deserialization
another method i thought of is to serializable lower down in my object hierarchy doing each of my lists separately and controlling the order of deserialization - i rather not do this

2026238
serializable	deserialization
another method would be to xmlignore and create an enrolment serializable helper class that initializes after the deserialization of itself is complete

2026249
put	get
within almost every area there are going to be superstars who earn shedloads of money this i suspect is the mythical better but most of us have to put our heads down and get on with it regardless of what area we work in

2026252
emacs	jedit
i find it irritating that neither emacs nor xemacs or jedit can edit any of these languages -

2026252
vmware	virtualbox
i wouldn t mind using virtualbox or vmware to boot into linux to use an linux editor if that is the only option i have

2026271

may create an intermediate format like rtf restructured text html word doc or latex

2026384
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox google-chrome webkit equivalents to the ie-specific zoom property are respectively -moz-transform and -webkit-transform

2026401
gridview	linqdatasource
you can bind the gridview to a linqdatasource control

2026401
gridview	linqdatasource
there is good article on how to bind gridview to linqdatasource here

2026423
hide	show
that said though it s better to show hide them via display none for example than to manipulate the dom as it s very expensive

2026444
config	ini
the register_globals ini setting can t be set at runtime by ini_set so if you can t do it with an .htaccess or web server config file the method provided there would be the official workaround

2026472
button	checkbox
inside the tabcontrol each tab item consists of so many checkbox and button

2026473
translation	localization
we need to find some tools to manage localization of the site - something that picks up on changes in resx files so translators will only need to translation new or updated texts

2026496
subtract	add
when you want to add or subtract do the math manually .

2026537
udp	tcp
this draft describes keep-alive techniques in section 3.5 you can use crlf pairs for connection-oriented transports like tcp or stun for connectionless transports like udp

2026546
put	get	subclass	abstract-class
edit the only approach i can think of is to put both get and set as in the abstract-class and let the subclass throws a notimplementedexception if set is called and it s not necessary

2026557
portrait	landscape
but this problem only occurs when the user take s video in portrait mode in landscape mode everything is simply fine

2026592
gridview	objectdatasource
bind the gridview to an objectdatasource and enable paging on both

2026595
getter	setter
one possible answer would be to override the getter and then to implement a separate setter method

2026610
portrait	landscape
well you can query the uidevice for property uideviceorientation orientation and let the server know if the video was captured in landscape or portrait

2026623
getter	setter
the only case i know where a getter is defined and a getter setter are implemented is by using an interface

2026647
getter	setter
the getter setter pattern likely influenced by c# s properties

2026647
getter	setter
as an aside the new ecmascript 5 spec introduced getter and setter methods for properties to the language and some browsers have implemented them but they re not yet widespread enough to use on the web

2026651
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
innerhtml outerhtml getelementbyid getelementsbytagname and many others exist along with javascript libraries that simplify document object model selection modification and insertion

2026688
put	get
you will avoid the display problem and get a much better looking result if you simply put the uidatepicker in a new view and implement the slide-up-from-the-bottom behavior yourself

2026720
int	boolean
i use encodeobject on all objects except for the boolean and int where i use the correct corresponding method encodebool forkey and encodeint forkey

2026756
subtract	add
client 1 intends to a subtract 10 from integer column_x 10 and then b add this 10 to integer column_y

2026764
put	get
when you get the innerhtml value of the body add a string to it and put it back in the body all elements in the body is recreated from the html string

2026847
pop-up	dialog
i want the function to pop-up an iframe dialog box and wait for user interaction and then submit the form via an ajax post

2026854
emacs	aquamacs
if you decide to dive into that maybe aquamacs is something you d like its a mac-flavored emacs

2026867
pop-up	dialog
my guess is that whatever library you re using to pop-up your dialog box will have some sort of callback function that it will execute based on the user action instead

2026889
pull	push
git pull and or push will help you move changes from open source repo to proprietary repo

2026928
children	parent
matches all elements that are the nth-child of their parent or that are the parent s even or odd children

2026928
children	parent
you re currently selecting the parent while you should be selecting children

2026957
macvim	textmate
xcode eclipse macvim aquaemacs and textmate not free but worth the price if you like it are pretty standard

2027107
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview with an objectdatasource

2027145
width	height
using the debugger i checked what getclientrect returned and sure enough it returns a rectange with location 0 and width height of the combined two monitors so it s right

2027166
implements	extends
so how could i go about implements something as basic as the above example in javascript where there is a base class or an interface and two classes extends from that base class each with their own specific behavior

2027173
sorting	filtering
lots of neat sorting filtering and list manipulation functions

2027294
put	get
also note that urls are of limited length so you cannot put an arbitrary amount of text into a get parameter

2027294
post	get
but as you only send it via get to your proxy and then via post to the other app as long as it works it is fine

2027314
client-side	server-side
ok if you need to get data from another server it looks like you need to create your own server-side class as an objectdatasource on the server to be the client for your wcf service because the browser s cross-domain restrictions will prevent the radgrid from making client-side requests to both servers

2027356
put	get
if i manually put in the url i get the following error

2027410
post	get
http authorization does not differ between get and post requests so i would first assume that something else is wrong

2027417
ready	each
i m working with java.nio.channels.selector and i d like to create a separate thread for each selectedkey that is ready for read write accept but i want to make sure that the same socket is never handled by two different threads simultaneously

2027438
width	height
it s nothing to dedicate a few more bytes to keep track of the width and height and it will save you from having to hit the driver or gpu to get the information

2027461
int	boolean
you were right in one of your comments that the boolean expression gets added as to the int as 1 or 0

2027461
int	boolean
if you cast a boolean value to an int then false gets 0 and true gets 1

2027535
return-value-optimization	nrvo
a more general version is nrvo named return-value-optimization which also works on named variables

2027544
junit	testng
so it seems that the problem was coming from testng jar requiring junit v3.8.1

2027573
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
i m wondering if i can change the background color of just the prompt of the uinavigationbar to red while the rest of the navigation bar stays black so i can use the prompt property of the uinavigationitem to display status error messages as a one-liner

2027633
versioning	upgrade

2027681
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml file with a plugin that runs on the test phase

2027842
division	subtraction
gcd can of course be done much faster if you use division rather than subtraction o n 2

2027842
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
2 in practice integer inputs are often fixed-size 32 bit or whatever and operations on them such as addition multiplication and division are o 1 time

2027842
range	infinity
it s usually more convenient to accept that addition is o 1 because the numbers are fixed-size but ignore that gcd is also o 1 pretend that its behaviour in the range 1 2 32 extends to infinity and analyse it on that basis

2027842
division	subtraction
again this is not ambiguous once you know what the terms of reference are but beware of incorrectly comparing the first analysis i gave of euclid s algorithm with division o n 2 against this analysis of the algorithm with subtraction o n

2027872
google-chrome	safari
safari nor google-chrome doesn t respect some attributes

2027892
firefox	safari
update didn t do anything in safari 4 apart from logging an error in firebug as per usual but shows the alert in firefox 3.6 beta 5

2027899
pow	math.h
for the power operator you want to use the function pow declared in math.h

2027991
unix	solaris
i am working on solaris unix

2028087
accessor	properties
it seems like sometimes this is done automatically on properties accessor and sometimes you must do it explicitly

2028106
hide	show
i was thinking of rendering for each field both a static and an editable version and using javascript to hide and show them as needed

2028243
nsis	uninstaller
i have written an installer and uninstaller in nsis which creates and drops an sql database which is working fine

2028336
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in ie but not firefox or google-chrome

2028368
inherited	subclassing
and the generic classes do not follow the inherited of their template type is not a subclassing of - they are completely different classes in c#

2028374
int	chars
this could hold any kind of data needed at that time ten years ago int floats chars etc

2028388
tapestry	wicket
it s borrows more from tapestry but should have similarities to wicket

2028408
profiling	benchmarking
in terms of standard definitions of efficiency one would often utilize big-0 notation however in the real world outside academia normally one would profiling benchmarking both equations and then compare the results

2028443
google-chrome	safari
in fact the google-chrome team has mostly aimed for compatibility with safari most prominent webkit user at the time and refused features on those grounds

2028457
hex	binary
i wish to open a binary file to read the first byte of the file and finally to print the hex value in string format to stdout ie if the first byte is 03 hex i wish to print out 0x03 for example

2028465
innodb	myisam
i just read a lot of stuff about myisam and innodb as i have to decide which type to use

2028474
getter	setter
in production use nothing will invoke the property setter so the first time the getter is called the controller will call out to your ioc framework get an instance and store it

2028528
public	protected
don t think of the private protected public thing as if a programmer would ever need a method

2028530
rss	feed
the web interface gives a little rss feed but it wasn t enough of a history for me

2028566
getter	setter
for example let s say you have a field called _name and a getter setter named getname setname name

2028571
public	protected
then as needed you can make things protected or public

2028629
public	protected
public and protected methods form the interface to your object public for developers using delegating to your class and protected for developers wishing to extend the functionality of your object by subclassing it

2028629
public	protected
both public and protected interfaces need careful thought especially if this is an api to be used by developers outside your control since changes to the interface can break programs that make assumptions about how the existing interface works

2028642
put	get
when i navigate to the url and put in a non existent page i get the following error message

2028694
uninstall	upgrade
note that this is more of an uninstall then reinstall than an upgrade per se

2028697
pop-up	dialog
in .net when calling messagebox.show ... that creates and shows a pop-up dialog

2028705
cos	sin
if you want the points to spiral out instead of making a circle choose a number of points per circle revolution and replace num with that number in the sin cos functions

2028715
mouse	keyboard
what i see in your problem is you are dealing more with functional things like does this follow this mouse does this respond to keyboard commands etc.

2028739
gif	png
if matlab saves the plot as an image file say gif or png or something then you can use toolkit.getimage or createimage to read it in and then

2028762
listview	gridview
i ve tried to build something with listview and or gridview and i just can t seem to get the behavior i want

2028844
agile	sprint
i thought within agile especially the scrum method that the content an iteration or sprint was decided upon at the start and then the team would deliver that content in the allowed time your example of 3 weeks is a good one then you review and adjust for changes in the next sprint

2028894
distance	polygons
the animation of the polygons consists in calculating the distance between each vertex and moving then to a position according to elapsedtime

2028918
pop-up	dialog
if it s a binary file you want to offer for download you probably also want to send the right headers so the save as.. dialog pop-up

2029047
width	height
the grid is set to 100 for width and height and it automatically adjusts to the height width of the contentpane it s placed in

2029106
g++	gcc
including that header with gcc g++ 7.2.0 generates a warning

2029153
int	boolean
to make it close to perfect it involves a couple of functions as it also should support int boolean and null values but you can take a look at the source code on the database and database_mysql classes on naturephp

2029195
uiview	calayer
the most powerful of these are imho uiview s transform property which takes cgaffinetransform structs as inputs or calayer s transform property which takes catransform3d structs

2029197
union	distinct
by using a union and not a union all you will get the distinct time stamps

2029236
implements	extends
1 if i have implements an interface with a method in a superclass where im declaring that method and then i extends that superclass in another class

2029249
versioning	upgrade
in the last week some of our clients have upgrade their system to windows 7 x64 bits versioning and start to fail when they print text via com to the printer

2029263
public	protected
it the ivars are marked as public or protected yes they will be exactly the same

2029292
post	get
don t do a google search and post crap that i already know and utilized to get the code to work

2029363
put	get
if you want to get rid of it you could just remove the reference in rails init.rb of the plugin or put an if around to check if the constant already exists

2029368
abstract-class	superclass
as mentioned in other answer by balusc if your superclass tells that it implements an interface and doesn t provide implementation of method s in the interface then you have to mark the superclass as an abstract-class

2029368
abstract-class	superclass
but you cannot instantiate the superclass since it is an abstract-class

2029424
public	protected
this is why i find it much better practise to default all methods and properties to protected visibility and only mark those methods not properties though supposed to allow interaction with my class from another class or script as public but only a few things private

2029428
punctuation	words
the article includes punctuation upper and lower case words numbers and abbreviations

2029466

hide	show
i want to dynamically hide show controls in an activity based on a button touch event when the user presses the details button i want to show more controls in the same activity

2029520
tortoisegit	svn
i m on windows and use tortoisegit which has quite nice support for git-svn but since tortoisegit only runs git svn fetch i m kind of stuck

2029596
postgresql	mysql
with a bit of luck you ll have mysql mysqli pdo_mysql and postgresql pdo_pgsql already installed -- which means it ll be ok from the php side you ll just have to use the right functions classes to connect to your postgresql and or mysql servers

2029642
folder	directory
i like winmerge because you can feed it 2 folder of files and it will traverse sub directory and tell me all the differences in all the files

2029665
delphi	oxygene
prism is a replacement for delphi .net - it has been developed by remobjects and its original names were oxygene and chrome

2029686
free	malloc
so you have to overload delete to use free and the normal new to use malloc

2029686
free	malloc
in practice though all implementations use malloc free themselves internally so even if you don t do it most likely you won t run into any problems except language lawyers yelling at you

2029694
post	get
instead of sending it as a post request send as a get request and try request.params 0 and request.params 1

2029694
post	get
now i am able to access both jhon and 8pm in the beginprocess event as context.request.params 0 and context.request.params 1 but as soon i change the type get to post both the parameters are not there

2029701
pop-up	dialog
i am assuming you re not on windows and you mean the version information that can be stored in windows executables and pop-up in the properties dialog for such a file in windows explorer

2029735
children	parent
make sure that the parent has the child in its children collection and the the child has the parent in its parent reference and that the child is removed from its old parent if it had one

2029762
implements	modifiers
the __interface modifiers is a visual c++ extension to help implements com interfaces

2029781
google-chrome	firefox
ie doesn t offer a feature to do what you re asking and i m not convinced that the firefox and google-chrome features work the way that you expect that they do

2029826
plone	buildout
however it is a production site and so i can t easily take it down to upgrade plone to 3.2+ in order to use buildout

2029826
folder	directory
what i thought i could do is add this collective folder to plone directory zope lib python as a python module

2029878
folder	directory
update for what it s worth i found the actual class files in the configuration component source folder on my hard drive but adding that to the class path as well as the components directory did no good

2029948
getter	setter
see the little manual of api design which describes the benefits of classes having minimal constructors and lots of getter setter over the alternative of using constructor methods having many parameters

2029965
for-loop	arrays
at that point you could run a for-loop on the arrays and get your properties in order

2029970
button	checkbox
accessible custom designed checkbox and radio button inputs styled with css and a dash of jquery

2029992
hash	salt
i you don t want to create and manage a salt value for each hash you could use a strong application wide salt

2030005
post	get
i had the major break through after reading post similar to this one they did not get it completely right either

2030005
post	put
to restore the tableview back you need to add observer on uikeyboarddidhidenotification not uikeyboardwillhidenotification as suggested by other post to avoid flickering where you tableviewcell appears every time and put back the tableview to where it was

2030036
jstl	taglib
badly designed .net user controls and jstl taglib

2030039
x86	64bit
check for the existence of c program files x86 - if it exists then it is a 64bit os

2030045
width	height
for gifs the height and width are 4-byte integers found in the header of the file

2030045
width	height
address 0x12 for width 0x16 for height

2030045
width	height
it passes in the jpg as an array of data and it gets the height and width

2030056
mouse	keyboard
i m fine using the managedwinapi wrappers around p invoke working in c# to record mouse and keyboard activity which works but i think that in order to make the recording more useful i need to know more about what happens when the user starts an application

2030129
getter	setter
if i had a similar problem my first instinct would be to wrap them up in some sort of collection ivar ns mutable array dictionary set and then you can have a normal getter setter on it and just do

2030176
put	get
dynamic linking means some of the required code does not get put into the executable and will be found at runtime

2030200
hash	salt
using a hash of the data as salt for the data is not secure

2030216
vbscript	jscript
windows has built in windows script host engine with two interpreters for vbscript and jscript

2030226
min	max
i can accomplish the same thing as an incrementing record version with just the recordcreated date i suppose but that removes the convenience of knowing that recordorder 1 is the current record and i m back to doing a sub-query with max or min on the datetime to determine the most recent record

2030260
hide	show
on post back you could hide the fileupload control and show a literal that displays the value of the file

2030267
hash	salt
this is not salt - you have just modified the hash function

2030280
cpu	processors
note that it incorrectly identifies my laptop s cpu as being 64 bit see intelâ coreâ duo processors t2300 mdash

2030282
put	get
if you make the combination of those two a unique constraint and put retry logic in your client code on the rare chance you get a race condition you should have no problems

2030326
pascal	delphi
delphi prism is also an adaptation of object pascal to the .net world but with more emphasis on being a fully fledged .net language even more so than c# and much less worries on being compatible with delphi

2030354
firefox	safari
firefox seamonkey and safari - see this table

2030357
firefox	safari
silverlight 3 supports firefox ie safari on the mac

ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
we make sure that the plug-in available from this site works on the following platforms suse linux enterprise desktop 11 opensuse 11.x ubuntu 9.10 and fedora 12

2030370
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this means that though it s officially supported on ie and firefox with google-chrome in experimental to be supported in v4 on windows and safari on mac it technically works on other browsers that support the netscape plugin model like opera

2030381
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to make sure that upgrade from previous versioning versioning 1 and 2 are the same in the new product versioning 4 as the old versioning 3

2030419
superclass	subclassing
imagine that a superclass a has two subclassing b and c

2030419
inherited	subclassing
we say that the inherited relationship between a b and c is disjoint when a instances cannot be at the same time b instances and c instances instances of a supertype only appear at most in a subclassing

2030420
rss	feed
i have an addon that every 5 minuets or so checks an rss feed for a new post and if there is one it displays an alert

2030428
ironruby	ironpython
if we are to make a new version of our scripting engine we would now be looking forward to using the new dlr-enabled language ironpython and ironruby

2030492
vb.net	vb6
one point of info i left out of the original question was that the vb.net projects are upgrades from vb6 projects

2030492
vb.net	vb6
so i ran reg32 u on the vb6 dlls and that seemed to fix the vb.net issue

2030492
vb.net	vb6
not exactly sure why this fixed it since i was not referencing the vb6 dlls i m guessing something to do with ambiguous entries in the registry confusing the vb.net project

2030500
delphi	oxygene
oxygene fka delphi prism replaces delphi for .net but it is not a new version of it

2030513
coalesce	isnull
isnull can easily give different results as coalesce on sql server because of data type precedence as per my answer comments here

2030609
getter	setter
you could also make getter and setter implicitly inline

2030620
put	get	post	put	post	get
as implied this particular project requires me to use get put and post requests

2030637
inherited	properties
firstly the inherited chain adds nothing in the way of properties - it simply adapts projects and accounts into a common interface so that either can be used in an allocation

2030684
int	double
i assume i should not use quotes around any of the int float double and real

2030685
getter	setter	tostring	getter
to take a simple example when you add or remove a field roo will update the tostring getter setter jsp pages etc for you automatically

2030694
post	get
in the design process of my framework i come to a point where i think about merging post and get parameters into one single parameters variable

2030694
post	get
would it be good design at any point when a post parameter has the same name as an get parameter and both are really used

2030694
post	get
i would consider post to be overriding get in any case

2030736
post	get
post and get request have a different semantic

2030737
post	get
i believe the popular ruby on rails framework combines them into a params variable technically a method... but also allows you to access the original get or post parameters through other means

2030743
post	get
ideally post has or can have to be pedantic side-effects and get doesn t

2030743
post	get
responses to get can also be safely cached under certain circumstances while post should never be cached

2030744
quicksort	heapsort
you might have an application where the sorting algorithm itself quicksort heapsort etc. may be chosen at runtime

2030746
free	malloc
first to answer the title no dynamically allocated memory with new malloc etc is not free when function exits

2030754
valgrind	memcheck
i d suggest having a test run using valgrind memcheck and helgrind tools in that order

2030758
public	protected
oncreate is public not protected

2030761
post	get
in some instances accepting a get rather than a post could make you more subject to a csrf attack

2030773
opera	firefox
ideally i would also want to keep and share settings and files for other applications firefox addons opera keyboard shortcuts mail and chat accounts eclipse settings etc but that s probably another issue

2030774
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome on mac firefox 3.5.x and safari 4 mac

2030775
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

2030775
put	get
the methods get head put

2030775
post	get
so basically get is intended to be idempotent if you resubmit the form you end up with the same result as once - you don t get your orders from amazon delivered twice as a consequence for instance. post is intended to be more liberal in how it behaves

2030788
post	get
maybe stick to literal english use get to get data use post to modify data

2030829
put	get
to do this i m running through the table looking for the event divs which sit inside td and then get the start and duration and put that into a seperate div adding them up as i go so i ll end up with 9 00 5 events 10 00 3 events.

2030838
ssl	https
i would like to use it but with https ssl for distribution

2030857
width	height
width height

2030873
ilist	icollection
i know from experience that fnh will automap ilist but don t think it can deal with icollection

2030893
textwatcher	charsequence
found a better and working way to implement this use edittext.addtextchangedlistener with a textwatcher class and implement textwatcher.ontextchanged charsequence s int start int before int count works perfectly also on the milestone droid

2030915
mouse	keyboard
it uses global system hooks to detect all mouse and keyboard events even outside your application

2030987
jar	war
say a war or a jar with winrar

2031020
ubuntu	linux
it runs on an ubuntu 8.04 server and all employees have a linux user account on that machine

2031020
hash	md5
i m storing only their user name and a md5 hash of their password

2031021
treemap	treeset	arraylist	treeset
instead of arraylist string use hashset string not sorted or treeset string sorted if you don t need a count of how often each word occurs hashtable string integer not sorted or treemap string integer sorted if you do

2031023
post	get
it actually took me quite sometime to get the post vs get question straight in my own projects - but for quite some time i do things like this i usually use post whenever forms are involved and get whenever i want to trigger something through a regular link

2031023
put	get	post	put	post	get
or to put it this way i use post for administration and get for navigation

2031023
post	get
thinking of security i suppose it actually doesn t really make much difference - attacks can come through either post or get - so be sure to always check your users input - no matter what method you use

2031038
post	get
but instead of that i want to use post instead of get

2031069
folder	directory
the templates are located in the visual studio install directory common7 ide itemtemplates csharp|visualbasic web mvc codetemplates folder

2031139
uiview	uiwindow
you may however be able to rotate the window s coordinate system around manually using uiwindow and uiview beginanimations ... in order to recreate the whole effect

2031139
post	get
please post sample code somewhere if you get it working

2031196
post	get
not quote sure the post data is how you want it formatted but i hope you get the idea

2031196
post	get
if a get works for you use that don t just switch to post it isn t buying you anything unless of course you re using ssl for the post then it d be more secure

2031235
post	get
you may have better luck with restful wcf mode since you can leverage proper http caching throughout see this blog post rest in wcf â part x â supporting caching and conditional get for a start

2031245
pull	push
if you really want to be developing on the master and a feature branch at the same time i suggest cloning your repository working in the clone and the master and then using push and pull to move changes between them

2031255
cpython	ironpython
you ll also need to copy gzip.py from the cpython standard library to the ironpython lib folder

2031259
google-chrome	firefox
it s slow both in firefox and google-chrome so it does not seem to be a browser issue

2031296
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
i would suggest merge-sort on the list as it is o n log n while bubble-sort or insertion-sort are both o n 2

2031360
realloc	malloc
a more common way is to wrap malloc and realloc and keep a list of sizes and pointers

2031378
hash	salt
roll your own database tables salt hash passwords stored in a user profile table

2031379
post	get
i think everyone s missing the point of your question or maybe i m just misunderstanding it. you re not asking the difference between get post you re wondering if its a good or bad idea for the framework that you re building to automatically merge the results of these two together into one safe variable

2031379
post	get
if someone has a reason to only get the post get the variables are still there

2031387

int	boolean
convert a list of int to a list of boolean

2031421
int	boolean
convert a tree of int to a tree of boolean

unchecked-exception are types derived from throwable including throwable which don t derive from exception apart from runtimeexception and its subclasses

2031451
jobs	cron
i don t have access to cron jobs since this is on a localhost apache installation on windows vista home edition

2031451

the text will also have another dictionary inserted to it that will map each button to its bound control a dictionary for each function this will be used when a function gets called to distinguish between buttons different bound controls

2031601
subtract	add
for now it will do simple calculator jobs 1 textbox a couple of buttons and functions like add subtract and such

2031653
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in the end i tried the jquery cooke plugin in ie 6 7 and 8 safari 4 google-chrome 4 firefox 3.5 opera 10.2 and on a few different configurations and it worked in all of them

2031658
hide	show
depending on the value chosen in the drop list i use javascript to show hide divs on the page which all contain different form inputs for the user to fill in

2031663
keydown	keyup
you ll have to use keydown in conjuction with keyup to tell if the user pressed shift to produce the letter

2031675
accessor	properties
the other model is to create an accessor properties that is virtual

2031686
width	height
i am try to increase the width size and height of checkbox but it doesnt happen yet

2031740
hide	show
currently i am using jquery to hide show select options using following code

2031748
opera	google-chrome
you don t it s not supported in ie and assumably not in google-chrome or opera either

2031765
super	implements
slightly longer answer if you make sure the methods you care about are in interfaces then you can have a class that implements the interfaces and then delegates to instances of the super classes

2031792
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
in addition to objects java also includes primitive datatypes such as boolean byte int long chars float double

2031792
int	boolean
there are also matching number objects boolean byte int long etc that can be used which like all objects are passed by reference instead

2031794
urllib	httplib
you could also use httplib which basically is the backend for urllib

2031803
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have font-face working well in webkit safari and google-chrome and opera but not in firefox 3.5 or ie 8

2031819
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
as it turns out ie and firefox do not honor font-face declarations wrapped inside media safari google-chrome and opera do

2031820
vb.net	vb6
the vb6 functions work just fine in vb.net

2031828
vb.net	vb6
if you haven t yet converted the code you could choose to buy artinsoft s vb upgrade companion which can do some of the conversions you ask for as part of the vb6 to vb.net conversion

2031853
rss	feed
everything is almost like writing yet another rss feed reader

2031893
webclient	webrequest
you can of course write a .net client for this - but you ll find it a lot easier to write it using webclient webrequest manually formatting reading the xml json requests responses or use datacontractserializer and datacontractjsonserializer to help out with that

2031913
nexus	artifactory
your best bet in this case is to use a managed proxy such as artifactory or nexus

2031917
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
you had primitives int chars byte boolean float double long and the rest in the java world were classes including the corresponging wrappers int chars byte booelan float double long

2031958
put	get
assuming that op can precalculate this array he can put any reasonable number of cars into the array and get sensible results

2031962
boost	allocator
the point of the class is to avoid a dynamic memory allocator - you can put a boost array entirely on the stack

2031964
oncreate	setcontentview
luckily all i wanted to do was to set the title text differently and i soon realized that just calling settitle inside of oncreate worked for me i called it after i called setcontentview

2031978
g++	gcc
you can also suppress using this by using the option -mno-cygwin as compiler option for gcc g++

2031984
post	get	pop-up	dialog
now i have a jquery post that goes to this method and now i am not sure how to take the outputstream result that the jquery post will get and make it pop-up with a save dialog box

2032046
opera	firefox
this works in firefox 3.5 and opera 10 however not in ie8

2032119
pop-up	dialog
you can t make a file dialog pop-up via ajax

2032209
implements	extends
solution is be a component class a class extends fl.core.uicomponent implements the icellrender interface so it can be set as a renderer and containing the label and textinput components

2032245
width	height
this sets the picture as an object and then uses the scaling methods scaleheight and scalewidth to make it 50 smaller in both height and width

2032335
switching	screens
this means that i can only keep the state for one activity when switching back and forth navigating between my screens

2032343
folder	directory
in ii6 i need to set a redirect on a parent folder using the redirect to an url option but have sub folder or sub aspx pages still point to the page in that site the designated directory

2032343
folder	directory
ii6 seems to have no problem with setting a different redirect on the child folder page but if it s set to the designated directory it doesn t take leaving and coming back to that node in iis shows no change

2032350
profiler	callgrind
if you run linux callgrind profiler and kcachegrind visualize the results will give you excellent insight into this even down to the assembler code level

2032361
int	double
i understand that int and double are not polymorphic types

2032369
int	double
please note that other varinat types int double can be successfully convert back and this error ocus only with bstr

2032377
int	double
you are right that static_cast works on types that are not related by inheritance double - int etc and the others answers point out how the casts work

2032389
many-to-many	one-to-many	children	parent
to the database there is only one-to-many or many-to-many relationships or in other words a parent with a collection of children

2032389
children	parent
the database considers the address the parent and the person as a collection of children

2032405
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my array wasn t reloaded in the viewwillappear so i copied the setup codes in viewdidload to viewwillappear and that solved it

2032444
postgresql	mysql
otherwise something like mysql postgresql or any other multi-user db

2032461
hide	show
i believe there is no .net method to do this and also i have come across a lot of how to hide and show the taskbar samples but i haven t seen anything based on what i am looking for

2032490
children	parent
if you re looking for specific elements that are children of one particular element put an id on that parent

2032500
uiview	subviews
now my confusion is that is not documented as some people may say but alertview is a subclass of uiview which has a property called subviews

2032507
freebsd	linux
for instance freebsd allows using the linux syscall abi only through an emulation module

2032557
width	height
where tb.size.width and tb.size.height returns the width and height of the taskbar and tb.autohide returns true if the taskbar is hidden and false if it is not

2032567
ivar	subclassing
as a global variable or an ivar of the subclassing whatever

2032576
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
modify for whether you want preorder inorder or postorder

2032582
nsstring	nsdata
if the data retrieve is textual and you re using the debugger you can use nslog to dump the raw data retrieved to the console after converting from nsdata to nsstring which is easy

2032584
solaris	bsd
incompatible abi is why even though osx linux solaris windows and bsd all run on intel x86 cpus a simple posix-only hello world program compiled on one os that does not use any vendor specific or proprietary system calls and or libraries generally cannot run on one os when compiled for another os

2032586
width	height
wrap the image in a div set the div s height and width to what you want

2032603
firefox	safari
i have following code which work fine in firefox safari

2032610
hide	show
most probably to be able to show the user something or hide something from the user

2032612
boost	stl
stl tr1 boost provides wrappers for both types of arrays

2032621
getter	setter
an actionscript class can include fields vars properties getter setter and methods

2032621
getter	setter
these classes act as templates to hold data and generally won t contain functions other than getter setter

2032640
google-chrome	firefox
im trying to close a child window with javascript and in firefox everything works fine but in google-chrome the window doesnt close

2032670
google-chrome	safari
you can also use the standard generic font-family monospace but be careful -- there are some severe side effects sadly in google-chrome safari and anything webkit based

2032678
button	checkbox
always use labels for each checkbox and radio button

2032707
fontfamily	font-size
changing body font-size based on fontfamily with jquery

2032707
fontfamily	font-size
css font-size changes when fontfamily falls back

2032729
groovy	gsp
i have a great one for groovy but nothing yet for gsp

2032794
int	double
it turns out that int float and double are instances of the typeclass real and any real may be converted to rational

2032837
accessor	properties
getter for your properties accessor

2032837
getter	setter
your own setter and getter

2032847
accessor	properties
properties and synthesized accessor are new features in objective-c 2.0

2032847
accessor	properties	getter	setter
then you synthesize accessor methods getter and setter for that properties

2032852
google-chrome	firefox
it works by sitting in google-chrome part of firefox which has special privileges

2032889
pull	push
but if you need git hooks on the git side i would recommend setting up an intermediate bare git repository bare for easy push pull

2032906
jobs	cron
i m running .net executables on the amazon cloud on ubuntu on cron jobs

2032989
width	column-count
use column-count and column-width to control the number of columns and width of each column

2033006
rdf	owl
i need to translate from xmi to owl xml rdf serialized in java so essentially this is xml to xml translation and most probably i could just play with regex and use replaceall to what i need but that seems very messy way to do it

2033031
stdout	stderr
originally i attempted to use system to call the lc3 assembler and redirect the stdout and stderr to a file like so

2033032
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t open on mouse over you need to use context menu or keyboard shortcut in source code

2033040
vbscript	vba
if you want to save word documents programmatically you can for example use vba macros or vbscript for it

2033053
multiplying	division
you re performing an int int division and then multiplying by 100

2033089
octree	quadtree
use proper acceleration trees such as kd-tree cover tree octree quadtree etc

2033091
stdout	stderr
your stderr output is now going be completely out of sync with the stdout output

2033098
equals	gethashcode
if you don t specify a comparer in the union extension method like in my example it will use the default equals and gethashcode methods in your person class

2033110
int	chars	int	double
the first can be either an int double or float so and the second is always a string literal my string so i guess const chars const

2033125
int	double
the first can be either an int double or float so and the second is always a string literal my string

2033147
int	chars	int	double
the first can be either an int double or float so and the second is always a string literal my string so i guess const chars const.

2033147
int	double
this would work for any type for the first parameter int float double whatever

2033147
int	double
now if you really want to restrict the type of the first parameter to be only int float or double

2033156
int	double
a better version of numtoint would be to convert to a double first and then convert to int

2033168
versioning	upgrade
most wiki based approaches just track the head and quickly become useless to anyone stuck working with an old versioning of your api ok maybe this is less of a problem if you re a webservice and just going to force all users to upgrade

2033206
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
thus it provides getelementbyid getelementbyname and getelementsbytagname

2033256
inherited	properties
however looking at the class names i strongly suspect that you might be misusing inherited and that a composition approach may be more appropriate with details exposing properties of types flightdetails and passengerdetails

2033280
jar	war
as there is no module wide .ser file i manually combine those .ser files from the ejb war jar and ear file using the commandline solution given by cobertura

2033295
udp	tcp
the best strategy to ensure no lost data would be to use tcp over udp

2033296
width	height
recently i tried to create a linearview which content exceeds the screen size so i created the new layout with parent element scrollview and set its width and height to custom values the layout has to appear as dialog - not filling the whole screen

2033299
versioning	upgrade
for now you can try to upgrade locally the pmd versioning used in the plugin with

2033353
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp	udp	tcp
possible replacements for udp include tcp and sctp

2033396
int	boolean
and the type bool is an alias for boolean in the same way that int is an alias for int32

2033417
disk	ram
you can create and mount a ram based disk as follows

2033448
hash	salt
this salt should then be stored in the database along with the username and password hash with the salt

2033448
hash	salt
what i would do when sending the password reset link is to create another salt don t give the user access to anything hash with your salt

2033448
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
the other salt which essentially is only a hash of a random string you might wanna go for md5 here as you mentioned that the length is an issue should you then save into your database

2033448
hash	salt
hash your users passwords using a unique-for-the-user salt and perhaps a global secret salt

2033474
rss	feed
i m a complete noob in all of this but sometime ago i wrote a little script in perl to parse an rss feed

2033474
rss	feed
the rss feed is alive and passes through feedvalidator.org

2033492
put	get
it seems that if you have a function and put the op s code which is a php.net example inside that function you will get answer 2

2033511
nginx	lighttpd	postgresql	mysql
this issue differs from a debian vs some other distro postgresql vs mysql or lighttpd vs nginx type choice since choosing app engine most probably will require you to write code specific to it or make modifications in your existing code base

2033515
cashapelayer	calayer
i am trying to move some custom drawing code from a view into a cashapelayer which then get added as a sublayer to the original view s calayer

2033520
awt	swing
a gui would be used to give the user something other than the command line to look at but swing or awt don t provide the functionality you seem to associate them with - namely connecting the server and client allowing the user to log into the running instance of the server

2033531
superclass	subclassing
the way ms vc++ c++ compiler used in visual studio implements none-virtual multi-inheritance you can cast back from the first base type in the list of superclass back to subclassing

2033538
post	get
i created a small php script that returns a mysql result depending on given post get parameters

2033545
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
it s impossible to tell which is the best system to run django on but imo if you anticipate lot s of pageviews go with nginx lighttpd for webserver instead of apache if you don t need those fancy apache modules

2033545
apache	nginx
however since i m used to apache it was faster for me to configure the site to run on apache and switch to nginx when performance problems occured

2033566
apache	nginx
nginx to serve static content and proxy requests to apache

2033566
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu they have great python packages

2033577
post	get
i need help with figuring out how to get hold of the redirect after i make a post to the server

2033590
rss	feed
i m getting the same error same message and line number with a fresh install of xml rss parser and the modules it uses it s just a wrapper for feed structure over xml elemental which uses xml sax to parse etc

2033598
g++	gcc
for dev-c++ see faq entry dev-c++ uses gcc instead of g++ for linking

2033599
folder	directory
anyway every user seems to be looking in the same folder c userfolder did you intend to have a separate directory for each user

2033615
innodb	myisam
it could be innodb or myisam

2033723
translation	localization
for mere translation localization it suggests either resource files which is very common for .net applications or a database

2033746
submit	submission
if you re not worried about what will happen when javascript isn t available then you can write some script to change the action attribute when one of the submit buttons is clicked prior to actually submission the form

2033749
boost	stl
you could also consider looking at the open-source project thrust which is a stl boost style template library built on top of cuda c++

2033827
memcached	apc
you could implement a caching layer memcached or apc which would allow you to store database results by key which would allow you to skip database access on subsequent calls

2033845
atof	strtod	strlen	strtod	strlen	atof
i tried to use atof strtod but they are real time consuming when the array is too huge because they will call the strlen

2033845
atof	strtod	strlen	strtod	strlen	atof
i debug into the code and find that both atof and strtod call the strlen in the visual studio we can check the crt code

2033950
implements	extends
i want users to extends the application by implements new port types and rules how to connect them through the eclipse extension point infrastructure

2033951
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
currently even browsers that do support svg firefox safari google-chrome opera don t support it directly inline in html they only support it directly inline in xhtml because the svg elements are in a different namespace

2033955
children	parent
if your parent delete rule is set to cascade all of those 1k children will be removed as well

2034007
debian	linux
edit debian linux for example has mingw in its repositories

2034023
versioning	upgrade
application expects grails versioning 1.1.1 but grails_home is versioning 1.2.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects

2034023
folder	directory
after reading around a bit i cleared out the 1.2.0 folder under .grails in my home directory from previous attempts while exploring the issue ran grails clean and grails upgrade answering y where prompted

2034043
int	chars
i am sure if you changed chars or short to int in your code would not equal when printed

2034076
versioning	upgrade
many of the applications that started crashing when people upgrade to iphone os 3.0 did so because those applications did something funky with subviews of ui elements and those elements changed in the new os versioning

2034079
public	protected
if you want a fast class then data should be protected and use protected and public methods

2034079
accessor	properties
of course if you want a constraint on some of your fields then use accessor functions or properties or something you want and make that field private because there is no other solution.

2034127
vim	emacs
i was learning vim and now i m experimenting with emacs

2034129
getter	setter	inherited	subclassing
that way subclassing have full access to their inherited variables and don t have the artificially created overhead of going through getter setter to access them

2034129
getter	setter	public	protected
in this case it can be made private and public protected getter setter can be provided instead

2034129
getter	setter
i ve seen classes whose own private methods accessed its member variables using only getter setter methods

2034130
getter	setter
there s nothing preventing you from marking a field as public although generally it is considered bad form use getter and setter instead

2034136
hide	show
edit if you want to hide the toolbar try the menu via options - show hide - toolbar

2034161
vim	emacs
this file gets loaded up when emacs starts similar to the .vimrc file for vim

2034198
int	chars
when using getchar i was told that it is better to use type int than type chars due to the fact that int can hold more values while chars can hold only 256 values

2034198
int	chars
if we can use int type instead of chars type why do we decide to use one over the other at certain times

2034228
int	chars
at the machine level the difference between int and chars is only the size or number of bytes of the memory allocated for it by the programming language

2034228
int	chars
in c iirc a chars is one byte while an int is 4 bytes

2034228
int	chars
being able to treat them as int or chars depends on how the language decides to interpret them this is also why its possible to convert back and forth between the two types

2034228
int	chars
type chars due to the fact that int

2034228
int	chars
this is why you need to store it into an int and check before casting to a chars

2034228
int	chars
most importantly you would pick int or chars at the language level depending on whether you wanted to treat the variable as a number or a letter to switch you would need to cast to the other type

2034228
int	chars
if you wanted an int value that took up less space you could use a short int which i believe is 2 bytes or if you were really concerned with memory usage you could use a chars though mostly this is not necessary

2034246
int	chars
depending on the actual encoding all values between 0..255 can occur there for unsigned chars is not enough to represent the -1 and int is used

2034247
int	chars
note that in c a is of type int not chars but it s okay to do because a is able to fit in a chars type

2034253
int	chars	int	double
anyway typical sizes in memory on 32bit intel platforms would be 32 bits 4 bytes for unsigned signed int and float 64 bits 8 bytes for double 8 bits for chars signed unsigned

2034294
yacc	bison
tools such as lex yacc flex bison

2034300
public	protected
unit tests are for testing the visible so public and protected interface of a class

2034305
apache	lighttpd
the docs seem to steer you towards running either apache or lighttpd

2034307
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-shade-plugin	ant	maven	ant	maven-assembly-plugin
this can be achieved by hand or with a build tool like ant and the optional support of a project like one-jar or maven which has built-in support for this through the maven-assembly-plugin or the maven-shade-plugin

2034342
post	get
in order to give you the correct solution it s necessary to know what software stack s you re using and how the form is being submitted get post ajax+json

2034351
public	protected
what s indeed a little bit irritating or even a design flaw in c# or the whole .net cli possibly is that you can define a public constructor in an abstract class as it is always effectively protected then in that case

2034355
internationalization	localization
are you talking about internationalization and localization

2034363
cos	sin
w out using a specialized lib you could approximate the distance a few ways calculate it just as if it were planar rectangular then use the haversine formula to sort the subset later use a lookup table that approximates cos sin etc group locations into 5 sq

2034403
google-chrome	firefox
there seems to be a hidden margin-top in my css which shows up in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2034487
hide	show
you can have the link in a div and hide it initially and start a javascript timer to show it

2034495
web.py	turbogears	django	web.py	django	turbogears
but anybody who s able to ace a more open-ended discursive interview such as this one is overwhelmingly likely to have really mastered and understood many of the layers of the relevant stack of technologies and abstractions -- i d much rather hire somebody with such a thorough deep-rooted understanding even if they ve never used turbogears but rather say django wekrzeug and web.py they ll be able to cram and get the turbogears-specific details down pat in a week tops than somebody who s committed to memory a stack of turbogears reference manuals but doesn t really understand http cookies tcp ip.

2034533
keyup	mouseup
keyup and mouseup events are enough i think

2034551
width	height
width and height are used when going the css route

2034562
width	height
i always go with height and width

2034567
invokelater	invokeandwait
to run a code on the edt you use invokeandwait or invokelater from javax.swing.swingutilities or from java.awt.eventqueue

2034572
inherited	properties
no as you said it is possible to inherited a style by using the basedon properties but it s not possible to directly inherited a template

2034573
readonly	temporary
for readonly access you can just copy places.sqlite into a temporary file then open and explore that one

2034581
pascal	delphi
i highly recommend the delphi inspiration pascal preprocessor dipp

2034598
cas	shibboleth
cas is the most common but there are others such as openid and shibboleth

2034657
int	boolean
any fields in json can be mapped as string int boolean etc javabean properties

2034664
keyup	mouseup
there s no onpaste event at least not cross browser and the middle right click paste actually happens after the mouseup event so if you just did .bind change keyup mouseup func.

2034789
hash	md5
first compute the md5 hash of each image and place it in a list of pairs md5hash imageid

2034820
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following displays tooltip in ie google-chrome safari except firefox

2034831
google-chrome	firefox
plays in google-chrome but not in firefox

2034834
xfce	gnome
today i ve switched to gnome from xfce and found some of the cool stuff missing and i would like to try to do them on my own

2034880
uploadify	swfupload
if you really need to customize your upload button i recommend a flash based uploader like swfupload or uploadify that enables you to use a custom image as button display a progress bar and other things

2034883
pop-up	dialog
i also made a dialog pop-up where i can change true a form the title and in the future some more content within the dialog for each portlet

2034888
int	double
not now and not for value-types such as int double in 4.0

2034888
int	double
which has an implicit conversion from int to double in the returned value

2034897
ant	maven
the second build can run a shell script or ant instead of maven allowing you easier control of your remote server

2034913
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
quick intro i was using a nib file for storing initial uitabbarcontroller state and to differ my tabs one from another i simply defined tag variables for uitabbaritem objects assigned to each uiviewcontroller stuffed in my uitabbarcontroller

2034914
int	double
delgates aren t convertable like this since double doesn t inherit from int or visa versa

2034962
firefox	safari
the html5 definition of appears to be implemented in firefox 3.5 and safari 4

2035021
springsource	grails
furthermore groovy and grails is now maintained by springsource so its popularity is only going to increase

2035032
ant	maven
another niggle for maven is lack of flexibility like in ant

2035069
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
built in formatters are nsdateformatter and nsnumberformatter

2035076
post	get
if you have needs in that direction post a comment and i ll elaborate but i don t want to get accused of unjustified advertising so i ll leave it there for now

2035095
width	height
suppose you want to create the box of 40pt height and 3cm width

2035097
int	chars
note i have tried deleting and recreating the column using #value #default_value and it is still submitting only the first chars of the int

2035106
post	get
usually each controller is a servlet that handles get post requests for a single page responding to them by presenting a correct view or transferring jurisdiction to another controller

2035117
getattr	setattr
for example using the getattr and setattr methods on objects you could write a class that provides a fluent way of accessing elements from an xml document

2035172
firefox	safari
it s aligning right in ie but not firefox or safari

2035250
children	parent
the way i see it a group is a parent which has topics and users as children

2035250
children	parent
therefore i was thinking of a separate parent entity which stores the user contact and login info and that user would have children containing the group id which each user belongs to so that i know what groups to fetch

2035257
firefox	safari
the code sample that you posted seems to be aligning correctly to the center in both firefox and safari on a mac

2035290
firefox	safari
...haha the box above the copyright area was not centering right in firefox and safari but was right in ie

2035341
getter	setter
example only the getter and setter could be more defensive

2035657
kde	gnome
i like the result to be gnome or kde or else

2035665
qtreewidget	qabstractitemview
you can use setselectionmode of the qabstractitemview class which qtreewidget is inherited from to set no selection mode to the component

2035679
google-chrome	firefox
what happens is that the script will be executed in firefox while ie and google-chrome will for some reason avoid running it

2035697
vim	notepad++
edit you could in fact use to cause vim to act very much like notepad++ though this mapping won t care whether you press shift or not

2035698
portrait	landscape
i could listen for a configuration_change broadcast but that will run everytime the phone switches to landscape or portrait and i only want it to happen when the homescreen is shown

2035786
int	double
now we could do the conversion by allocating a new method that fixes it up -- that takes the 4 byte int and turns it into an 8 byte double

2035815
width	height
the mostly accurate way for small angles and the camera centered on the middle is to measure the ratio of the width height between normal image and angle image on the middle lines because they are not warped

2035849
memcached	apc
i would say apc or memcached are good choices

2035899
stdout	fflush
the program outputs many lines of data and fflush stdout after each line

2035902
msg	eml
use microsoft exchange server mapi editor mfcmapi which is a great tool to retrieve msg or eml files

2035908
put	get
only when a new object is created and the pointer to it implicitly put in the array does storage for the object get allocated

2035912
wordpress	expressionengine
expressionengine cms and wordpress blog lite-cms are often used both php based but there are tons out there

2035914
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this should ensure that your site is standards compliant which will mean it will play well with firefox safari opera and even later versions of ie to an extent

2035917
ssl	https
serving static content on a cloud like amazon is an option and some of the cloud providers let you use https as well as long as you are fine with using a subdomain of their domain name due to technical limitations in ssl

2035963
min	max
group-by in sql is usually used for things like sum avg max min count etc

2035977
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in your first line you re attempting to assign an nsstring i hate... to an nsmutablestring teststring

2035978
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you need to handle the mousemove event and if the mouse button was pressed track this in mousedown and mouseup set a variable that gets read in your paint event to draw the tile

2035979
vbscript	jscript
natively you can also learn how to use vbscript jscript

2035984
disk	ram
set the limit of ram for each virtual machine say 2gb each with virtual hard disk of 10gb..now boot all vm s together at the same time that would really put a strain on the machine and it would also put a load on the network stack as well

2035996
pow	math.h
i am using the exp and pow functions in a program for iphone which would use the math.h library if i was programming in c

2036025
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
the app can run on any one of the major commercial websphere weblogic oracle or free glassfish jboss servers

2036029
awt	swing
javafx on the desktop uses java awt swing which does use gpu rendering

2036070
width	height
i know the width and height of the logo but the images vary

2036077
postgresql	mysql
other than learning java spring hibernate servlets jsp s how to use eclipse netbeans databases like mysql oracle postgresql jms junit etc

2036101
ant	maven
so get used to new tools java has different tool-set and ides as ms-tools this also includes build-envs like maven or ant

2036152
vim	emacs
i reckon the same thing would work with vim but i ve only used it in emacs

2036160
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade h2 it may not any longer be able to read the files it created in a previous versioning

2036205
cpu	processors
truth is a lot of processors such as recent x86s have hardware in the cpu that optimizes these access pretty well at least the padding and read-modify-write parts since they re so common and usually only involve transfers between the processors and cache

2036250
min	max
each variable is analysed in terms of some simple statistics min max mean stddev

2036282
hide	show
i have a list of items with some details that i would like to reveal upon clicking a show hide details link

2036282
hide	show
i m having trouble making it so that the show hide link only reveals the div of a specific item

2036282
hide	show
right now it is revealing all of the divs when clicking any of the show hide links

2036308
mouse	keyboard
the machine where the gui is displayed and which handles in the keyboard and mouse is the server

2036308
mouse	keyboard
because the server is making the monitor keyboard and mouse available to the client

2036311
stdout	fflush
you re not seeing the first printf because the program crashes before stdout is fflush

2036314
hide	show
it looks to me like all your show hide links are calling the same function show_details etc which show hide all posts because of the loop not specific ones

2036315
client-side	server-side
with connection pooling in place the one-connection-per-request model will work too with rather small client-side overhead and no server-side overhead

2036334
vb6	vba
vb6 and vba is also com based and that is a problem if you want to run as a standard user and not have write access to the registry

2036358
128bit	64bit
i am not aware of any 128bit value on 64bit systems could be wrong here but haven t come across that type in the kernel or regular user apps

2036368
rss	feed
is there some sort of rss feed from apple that i don t know about

2036423
post	get
as you reach certain milestones of functionality post some fliers advertising your super-cool site to get some traffic and momentum before your deadline

2036430
scrollable	panels
i m trying to tackle a problem that seemingly many android developers have which is how to intersperse lists with non-list data in one big scrollable panels

2036430
post	put
i ve read enough so answers and mailing list post to know not to put a listview inside of a scrollview but i want the same effect without using addheader and addfooter with very complex header and footer views

2036442
post	get
some effect with get post

2036442
post	get
a form that display the get data in your page and maybe something to write to a txt file on post

2036451
fseek	fgetc
for example calling fseek infile 0 seek_set would reset it to the beginning of the file causing the next fgetc call to start over from the first character of the file

2036452
invokerequired	begininvoke
in the clipboard operation i just used invokerequired and begininvoke when needed to make sure those ui changes happen on the main thread

2036506
interlocked	lockless
also if you can get away with an interlocked exchange that is best as it is lockless though still stalls the cpu and raises lock# for multi core memory but most locks use this anyway but need to do more

2036526
for-loop	loops
for example the if statement maps directly to a goto while the standard for-loop actually maps to a while loops which maps to a goto

2036614
caliburn	prism
regarding wpf silverlight applications i would strongly recommend to start building applications right on top of prism composite wpf and or caliburn - although it might be confusing from the beginning still it is a much better choice than with vanilla wpf speaking about practices they force you to use

2036638
submit	submission
on click of submit i call a function to validate the form and incase of error i will be setting the errormessage thru innerhtml and need to scroll to top of the page without submission

2036647
hide	show
kind of like toggle but then with some more then just show hide functionality

2036676
notepad++	textpad
i don t know if you can replace special characters in word but in most text editors textpad notepad++ you can replace via a regex so you can write r n to replace all instances of newlines with whatever you wish

2036679
post	get
i finally want to get my notifications and messages an i want to post something

2036711
mouse	keyboard
so what i do at start is clamp everything together - mouse handling keyboard handling drawing layouting - all in one function until i start feeling confident that code does what it suppose to do

2036718
unsigned	short
these functions are needed for signed and unsigned short int and long in big and little endian order

2036739
unix	solaris
i prefer a solaris unix server running the jvm but for 200 threads a modern windows machine will do just fine

2036816
stdout	stderr
fclose stdin stdout and stderr and don t write to them

2036816
daemons	launchd
it is possible when you launchd the daemons to redirect them using the shell you ll have to find out yourself how to do that i don t know

2036822
put	get
another way to get around this problem is to put a statement between the case label and the first declaration as you ve done in your working example above

2036823
aggregate-functions	sum
furthermore you can use aggregate-functions to calculate the sum for each group

2036858
post	get
i know result page that uses get method can be bookmarked while the one using post cannot be

2036858
post	get
now suppose i want to build a search engine which by default uses get allowing users to bookmark but when the length of the search phrase exceeds the limit switch to post

2036866
post	get
there is the array that merges get post and cookie values but the better way would be to handle get and post manually in your script

2036866
post	get
the only notable difference between the two methods is that a get parameter has size limitations depending on browser and receiving web server post has limitations too but they are usually in the range of several megabytes

2036875
children	parent
option s are nothing but ordinary children of a parent element and all of jquery s filtering possibilities should apply without restriction

2036901
put	get
the first is to get the values in the controller and put them into the viewdata dictionary like so

2036904
post	get
here s how you could use get and post in one

2036910
getter	setter
it hardcodes a lot of assumptions about what your application requires into the class and it also makes it the responsibility of the class to know and provide this data through getter and setter

2036910
config	ini
also have a look at zend_config as it meets all your requirements already and let s you init the config object from xml ini and plain arrays

2036937
int	double
it does not use standard function prototype syntax t foo because 2 functions with the same name differing only by the return type cannot coexist int foo conflicts with double foo

2036966
int	double
if this were not the case you could define an int conversion operator for example that actually returned a double

2036988
getter	setter
in java getter and setter are completely ordinary functions

2036988
getter	setter
the only thing that makes them getter or setter is convention

2036988
getter	setter
a getter for foo is called getfoo and the setter is called setfoo

2036988
getter	setter
they also must have a specific declaration as shown in this example of a getter and setter for name

2036988
getter	setter
the reason for using getter and setter instead of making your members public is that it makes it possible to change the implementation without changing the interface

2036988
getter	setter
also many tools and toolkits that use reflection to examine objects only accept objects that have getter and setter

2036988
getter	setter
javabeans for example must have getter and setter as well as some other requirements

2037048
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in this release a file channel can be obtained from an existing fileinputstream fileoutputstream or randomaccessfile object by invoking that object s getchannel method which returns a file channel that is connected to the same underlying file

2037058
width	height
remove the height and width from you img tags css can take care of that

2037156
junit	testng	junit	unitils	testng	unitils
i couldn t figure out how exactly you could get the junit 4 running with all of your dependencies but i did notice that you re dependency on the testng unitils artifact was what was causing the problem

2037164
nsstring	nsdata
if you want a nsstring from nsdata use

2037197
firefox	safari
in my test html file i tried both calling .hide and .css display none but none of them seemed to work in safari mac but worked as expected in firefox mac

2037205
imagick	gmagick
i m open to other image libraries such as imagick gmagick or cairo for php but i d prefer to avoid using other languages than php

int	chars
2 a sequence of chars plus a separate field either an int length or a pointer to the end of the string to tell you how long it is

2037298
mouseleave	mouseenter
then i have the mouseenter and mouseleave which are needed to yield the proper glow i want for the tiles

2037298
mousemove	mousehover	mousemove	mouseenter	mousehover	mouseenter
i tried many other things such as mouseenter mousemove and mousehover but all seem to yield the same crummy result as what i already have

2037324
firefox	safari
you need to check what your browser supports but this works in firefox 3.5 and safari on the iphone

2037331
explode	implode
but you can also use a combination of explode array_reverse and implode

2037362
rss	feed
it can parse rss feed to arrays which you can easily iterate through and build your html

2037401
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
so populating sortedlist with sorted input and populating sorteddictionary with unsorted input is both o nlog n

2037401
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

2037407
flac	speex
this doesn t seem to get me all the way there loads of formats are wrapper formats that hide the exact codec used within -- for example .ogg files can internally use the vorbis speex or flac codecs

2037416
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg includes a library called libavformat that can open and demux pretty much any media format

2037487
jar	war
where can i find short practical tutorials that actually teach me where to code what and then compile and where to put all the files war jar ear.. in glassfish to be able to see the output from a web browser

2037487
put	get
feels like i never get to know how i can put up a web server with java cause i canâ t find this kind of tutorials

2037507
ubuntu	freebsd
the code above works just fine on ubuntu 9.04 os x 10.6 and freebsd 7

2037544
rss	feed
stackoverflow.com provides rss feed

2037544
rss	feed
the simplest solution is download argotic an rss framework for .net c# and use this with your application to get the latest feed

2037546
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails merb etc

2037630
cos	sin
cos and sin in most programming languages are in radians

2037706
maven	pom.xml
now to add a dependency either right-click the project and select maven add dependency or edit the pom.xml manually

2037707
pull	push
for the push pull etc meta data i would use keywords or stereotypes to convey this

2037712
mvp	presenter
in mvp the view needs to pass itself into the presenter and i can t work out how to do this with spring

2037716
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the root of one of my uinavigationcontroller is a uiviewcontroller

2037717
packets	multicast
in particular if i could set up multicast routes that would effectively combine the two interfaces i could then look at each packets to determine which network that would be fine

2037750
children	parent
in the case of human parent each should refer to the same offspring a list of human children object

2037790
sorting	filtering
msdn has more information on filtering and sorting datasets

2037792

2037801
telerik	radwindow
i have a parent page that launches a telerik radwindow and passes it an argument

2037830
try-catch	exception-handling
this method contains a try-catch block to catch exception-handling of the type system.net.webexception and rethrow it so that the main method can catch it and act appropriately

2037830
try-catch	exception-handling
the one that was invoked didn t have a try-catch block so that the exception-handling thrown inside my class method made the app do what it was supposed to crash

2037929
disk	ram
since you cannot do much in 512 bytes of code although in fact a bootloader is not strictly limited to 512 bytes a bootloader would usually do not much more than load a larger block of code from a disk into ram and then execute it

2037956
put	get
i verified the order that the event handlers were being called by adding in alert statements actually no matter what order i put these lines of code my handler always responded first which is a bit fishy to me but no matter how hard i try i can t get the first handler to quit

2037988
for-loop	arrays
when foreach is used with arrays type compiler translates it into normal for-loop

2037989
vim	emacs
there are the two holy choices vim and emacs

2037989
vim	emacs
if so then definitely give the vim emacs approach a try

2037998
for-loop	arrays
when foreach is used with arrays type compiler translates it into normal for-loop

2038006
ord	chr
in php the strings letters cannot be used like in c you need to use ord and chr in order to convert from number to char and vica versa but

2038009
put	get
these objects get put through a â œphaseâ where all attributes must be filled out by users

2038038
getter	setter
you may also want to read why getter and setter methods are evil

2038038
getter	setter
though getter setter methods are commonplace in java they are not particularly object oriented oo

2038038
getter	setter
moreover the presence of numerous getter and setter methods is a red flag that the program isn t necessarily well designed from an oo perspective

2038038
getter	setter
this article explains why you shouldn t use getter and setter and when you can use them and suggests a design methodology that will help you break out of the getter setter mentality

2038078
width	height
its height and width are the original dimensions of the image

2038081
int	double
gives back int 2 which casts into double 2.0 when you assign it to numfour

2038087
rss	feed
i am using the wordpress yet another related posts plugin to display the related posts in the rss feed

2038090
int	double
intvalue converts your string to an int not a double

2038095
width	height
if an element is hidden you can t get its size if you want to get its width or height before showing it you need to give a negative offset like

2038105
width	height
one thing you might try as well if you re using a scripted language to generate your image sizes is to put the width and height attributes after reading the file and getting the size that way

2038148
implements	extends
saying that a class implements an interface or that one interface extends another can usefully be expressed in more human terms as is a

2038204
ienumerable	ienumerator
foreach operates on ienumerable which requires a new ienumerator class to be instantiated

2038239
post	get
i might not have known what to search for to get this answer so please point me to the correct post if this has been dealt with already

2038253
post	get
post may have side-effects per the rfc while get is defined as a safe method

2038262
rss	feed
the technical nature of cs means that all the great resources are primarily rss feed

2038262
rss	feed
i ve not come across a programming magazine i would subscribe too but i follow far too many rss feed

2038322
typedef	struct
abuse c++ struct class equivalence automatic typedef s and automatically-generated default constructors

2038322
int	chars
note that this isn t guaranteed to be portable since it s possible that some hypothetical platform could use bytes with more than 8 bits in which case sizeof chars could be the same as sizeof int

2038357
post	get
i usually use it with rest-style urls so a post request will do whatever it has to do save some data to session using prgredirect which then redirects back to the get url for the same resource page

2038362
folder	directory	folder	dir
dir will return an m-by-1 structure of information for a directory where m is the number of files and folder in the directory

2038427
int	chars
by the same token the standard has abandoned the term rvalue and just uses the value of an expression which is practically everything including literals such as int chars floats etc

2038438
nexus	artifactory
depending on your situation you may want to try running a managed repository such as artifactory or nexus

2038467

the .comment_icon element can be clicked to show hide the comments

2038512
qevent	qwidget
for an example of real world usage in the qt framework see bool qwidget event qevent and the documentation on event filters

2038527
free	malloc
furthermore if malloc failed no memory has been allocated so you do not need to free it

2038531
ninject	spring.net
i m curious to know if it s possible to replace spring.net s built-in ioc container with ninject

2038558
client-side	server-side
i understand that php processes on the server-side and javascript processes on the client-side so please no responses saying that

2038584
vim	emacs
i would suggest either emacs or vim in gui mode as an editor as they are de-facto standards on unix in general

2038585
ninject	spring.net
i can t talk specifically about converting spring.net to ninject but in general all application code should be written to be di container-agnostic

2038589
client-side	server-side
since you are aware that php processes on the server-side and javascript processes on the client-side you must also realize you can t call a php function from javascript

2038633
int	double
i have a text file which contains columns of data that are either int double or string

2038634
notepad++	textpad
if you really must use text editors i can second recomendations for notepad++ and textpad both of which i ve enjoyed at one time or another

2038648
kde	gnome	kate	gedit	kate	kde	kate	gnome
gedit gnome or kate kde + ant

2038648
kate	gedit
both kate and gedit are about as hard to learn as notepad.exe except they support syntax highlighting

2038652
ninject	spring.net
while they don t seem to have a ninject implementation they do have a spring.net implementation so maybe that can take you halfway there

2038668
folder	directory
you ve got a web pages folder which contains a web-inf directory and an index.jsp file

2038685
textmate	gedit
gedit see java compile and run howto set gedit to compile and run java source code and also pimp my gedit was textmate for linux to get some textmate features

2038686
rational-numbers	integer
coupled with bignums arbitrarily large integers integer in haskell as opposed to int which are fixed size as the type for numerator and denominator you can represent arbitrarily precise rational-numbers but at a significantly slower speed than floating point numbers which are implemented in hardware and optimized for speed

2038693
width	height
the last 2 arguments are the width an height to resize the image

2038710
googletest	gmock
at my company we use googletest along with its partner gmock for unit testing and object mocking

2038735
min	max
for instance math such as square roots trigonometry stuff sine cosine tangent powers perhaps also min max functions although they re beter off as macros in most cases would reside in their very own .h .c or .hpp .cpp pair of files

2038822
super	implements
i would recommend instead using the jquery ui dialog which you should find super easy to implements that functionality by using their beforeclose callback

2038874
subtract	add
that should add one day to 30-jun-2008 and then subtract one second in order to return a final date of 30-jun-2008 23 59

2038875
cassini	iis
this was not created in iis i was using the cassini asp.net development server at first but have encountered numerous issues

2038875

i moved my projects to another folder created my iis virtual directory pointed them at the right location updated my security settings ensured that .net 2.0 was selected and tested the site and web service

2038888
yacc	bison
however there are some languages that were specially developed for writing computer languages - namely lex yacc flex bison updated versions of lex and yacc

2038889
expression-blend	silverlight
as far as i can tell there s no visual designer in vs2008 for silverlight but i noticed the .xaml file had a reference to an expression-blend namespace in it

versioning	upgrade
see if you can upgrade your rails versioning to 2.3.4 or 2.3.5

2038969
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested in firefox 3.5.7 opera 10.10 google-chrome 3.0.195.38 ie6 ie7 and ie8 standard and compatibility modes it sort of works

2038989
typedef	struct
move typedef struct _charcoalapp charcoalapp

2039004
post	get
if i m getting either of this variables from an un-trusted source such as a post get then i can make sure they are the correct data types by replacing the final line the query set with a sprintf call like this

2039017
firefox	safari
just standard widget stuff i just want something accessible via safari firefox -- and no i don t want to run it as a java applet

2039045
textarea	textbox
clicking link creates div under link or setting focus to textbox transforms textbox into textarea and button

2039045
textarea	textbox
when textarea does not have focus it returns the textarea back to its original state as a textbox

2039045
hide	show
the box should have an in it with an attribute set so that we can hide it and show the textarea when it s been clicked in

2039045
textarea	textbox
use a jquery plugin to hide the textarea and button and revert to the textbox when the comment div has lost its focus es

2039141
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop doesn t work because there can be common songs for both arrays but not on the same arrays index

2039147
udp	tcp
i need to establish a p2p udp and tcp connection between two users

2039178
cpu	affinity
i thought this may be due to cpu scheduler affinity of the clients but they take only about 1-3 of a single core when running slowly 20-25 when running quickly

2039191
truecrypt	umount
truecrypt is free in both senses and it s accessible via command line parameters from your application mount before start umount before quit

2039213
floating-point	fractions
you can write your own pow function for fractions that doesn t use floating-point exponentiation

2039213
integer	fractions
this will raise a fractions to an integer power with falling back to float

2039264
post	get
actually if somebody has an alternative for handling foreign keys with a lot of values it would be great to get a post to another solution

2039300
uicontrol	uiresponder
this will work for both uiresponder s touchesbegan method and uicontrol s begintrackingwithtouch method

2039307
client-side	server-side
i am not sure how to change a div tag client-side with a server-side call

2039309
children	parent
i can declare it in the parent and both children but i don t have anything to return from the x implementation - the returned object is dependent on the child s re-definition

2039317
width	height
this works good for lots of stuff other center margined elements may appear #mid_con and will stack only problem is if left and right panel height are shorter than first middle panel the second middle panel will take up the whole #tub_con in width cuz is 100 appearing stacked directly under first middle div

2039346
jobs	cron
and rather than firing off such jobs as an exec have a cron job that looks for jobs that need to be started and start them

2039351
width	height
what i like about the columntext is it allows me to essential define a height width and position of the text area

2039364
post	put
i ve put the line breaks after each parameter just so it s easier to read here they are not there in the actual http post

2039388
nspopupbutton	nsformatter
this question is similar to this one how do i use an nsformatter subclass with an nspopupbutton

2039538
nsurl	nsstring
i assume you re expecting some sort of exception when you try to put an nsstring instance into a nsurl variable

2039620
charindex	substr
for this reason i cannot use substr with charindex

2039635
spaces	delimiter
if spaces are the only word delimiter you need to worry about then you can do a whole word match using ansipos by adding a spaces before and after both the keyword and the negative keyword ie

2039636
versioning	upgrade
from what i understand this file needs to be re-edited whenever you upgrade versioning of komodo as well

2039672
post	get
i know that they often convert dot s in post get to underscores

2039680
int	chars
even if you break up the ip into it s respective octets validating based solely on length of string will still produce false positives because any int over 250 is three chars long

2039701
charindex	substr
you can use substr with charindex it just takes a bit more work

2039703
post	get
i ve seen post on using prism with office ribbon to get plugins working

2039708
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
dbunit has plugins for maven and ant integration which run tests written in xml in the maven pom.xml file

2039725
uiview	subviews
low-wattage suggestion you can in fact programmatically walk the view tree from your root by getting self subviews all of which are uiview s and then do the same for each of them recursively etc

2039768
bids	ssis
the bids do not allow me to build the ssis package

2039770
setinterval	clearinterval

basically my apps an rss reader and it downloads everything and saves each item of the feed as in story 1 story 2 as currentitem

2039787
put	get
the data i want to grab and use to map the annotation can be found under currentitem.title - but i can t seem to get it to work in this tutorial s code or find the right place to put it

2039787
rss	feed
the rss feed i m using doesn t have any latitude longitude information either - making it even harder

2039802
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
you want to use the jquery mouseenter and mouseleave events not mousover and mouseout

2039846
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and possibly firefox too i havent tested that

2039901
memcached	apc
if you want server-side caching across multiple page loads or multiple servers then use mysql query caching and server-side caching apc file-based caching memcached etc

2039932
istream	getline
getline returns an istream reference

2039992

plone	buildout
buildout works just fine with plone 3.1.2

2040311
plone	buildout
i ve also done buildouts for plone 2.5.5 and even one for plone 2.1 although this last one was a bit tricky because the required python for that version doesn t do buildout

2040332
pull	push
so you still have to pull the data using dom and then write code to push this data to a java object

2040351
int	chars
if so you could cast individual chars to int to grab the unicode numbers

2040355
int	chars
on further investigation i found that there is a structure which contains some int and a chars array of 64 bytes and not all the bytes of chars array were getting used in most of the cases and unused fields from the array contain random data and that was causing the mismatch

here s a first cut which exploits the fact that cornerradius will get clamped to half the height or width in y and x respectively

2041213
autofac	castle-windsor
i don t yet know about autofac but in castle-windsor you can mix .config and programmatic configuration of the container and that s what i usually do i have a few dependencies configured in .config because i want to be able to change them without recompilation but the rest is registered in code often by convention

2041232

post	get
thank you for all answers.i understood that to get a value of post request need to read data from stdin

2041515
google-chrome	safari
i ve no idea about safari google-chrome and other minority browsers but you should probably have at least one of the three above on your machine anyway

2041532
ubuntu	linux
i m using qt under linux ubuntu 9.10

2041573
xlib	xcb
i don t know of any abstraction qt provides for this so you will probably have to use xlib or xcb

action-filter	onactionexecuting
you could create a custom action-filter for the action with an onactionexecuting method that would then remove the file after the action was completed something like

2041788
put	get
put a loop around your get method to make it repeat 1 000 times and your application probably won t slow down at all

2041796
post	get
the simplest way from the information you ve provided to achieve this would be to change the form method at run time from get to post using javascript

2041874
post	get
update i m sorry this only applies if you are using get to post your form

2041886
shadowing	named

2041929
listview	gridview
with a listview this is not as straightforward as some other data-bound controls gridview

2041972
ivar	subclassing
this may also require a custom bool ivar in your subclassing to keep track of whether you want to scroll

2042104
puts	fflush
to explain why you need to override flushbuffer - the appender puts logevent objects into a buffer which is later fflush towards the target database in this case

2042137

instead of adding methods to one class create an anonymous subclassing that inherited from the base class to which you add your methods

2042175
post	get
you will get the following output when the post is displayed

2042178
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code is working in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome and safari

2042261
rss	feed
on the other hand there are a multitude of opensource webbased subversion servers that will give everyone in your team access to your work using a simple browser rss feed included

and now i don t know how to get data from post request in rails app

2042441
google-chrome	firefox
this test html page works both in google-chrome firefox ie

2042445
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the reason this may help is because your code is not calling certain functions like viewwillappear viewdidappear etc. whereas presentmodalviewcontroller animated calls all the right functions for presenting new views

2042475
allocator	stl
usually when we want to allocate new objects on the heap you do it as part of a larger collection in which case you should just push the object onto your stl container and let it worry about allocator and deallocating memory

2042522
width	height
i believe you should be good if you call setmaximumsize on the jscrollpane with the width height of the bufferedimage but haven t tried it

2042588
bmp	png
png bmp jpg

2042645
inherited	properties
none of the elements have their width set to 100 so i doubt it s inherited properties

2042649
public	protected
as far as i know in inheritance all attributes and methods private public and protected in super class are passed child class

2042675

i am working with a pretty complicated .aspx page that is full of controls telerik ajax etc. that all expand collapse show hide etc

2042693
opera	safari
this page gives a cross-browser implementation targeting ie6+ ff2+ safari 3+ and opera

2042700
pop-up	dialog
if your dialog is a regular pop-up window it is not possible to prevent the user from closing the window

2042700
jquery	jqmodal
you could use a jquery modal dialog plugin such as jqmodal

2042704
hash	md5
i have implemented a key value file cache where i md5 hash the key to determine the file name for the hash file

2042765
easymock	jmockit	easymock	powermockito	powermockito	jmockit	mockito	jmockit	mockito	easymock

2042843
post	get
i ve already seen lots of post on the site for rtf to html and some other post talking about some html to rtf converters but i m really trying to get a full breakdown of what is considered the most widely used commercial product open source product or if people recommend going home grown

2042845
post	get
but you might get even better suggestions if you post your class es -- or a slimmed-down version of them

2042853
disk	ram
otherwise you can create a ram disk and save your cached files to that disk instead

2042909
getter	setter
in ecmascript 5 there is support for getter setter and you can spoof the document reference if accessed from within a scope which redefines it

2042935
width	height
if you want the first type of resizing stretch the content then place the canvas into a container div and set the width and height of the canvas to 100 using css

2042935
width	height
first you must adjust the width and height attributes of the canvas element

2042980
prepare	execute	client-side	server-side
generally the prepare and execute statements are client-side operations that the server-side of the dbms does not normally see

2042980
prepare	execute
however given that you have problems i recommend splitting up the second chunk of sql into two separate operations - and omit the prepare blurb and the execute blurb

2043013
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has been this way for awhile and google-chrome i believe has always been this way

2043049
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
to read a text file use bufferedreader - in this case wrapped round an inputstreamreader wrapped round a fileinputstream

2043061
onmouseover	onclick
type - can be onmouseover onmouseout onclick or onplotreset

2043075
client-side	server-side
the asp.net mvc 2 rc vs.net project template does show how to implement that on the server-side using the propertiesmustmatchattribute but not on the client-side

2043090
ssl	https
and these are all through https ssl

2043101
hash	salt
since it is common practice to prepend the salt to the password hash the salt is generally known to an attacker

2043108
post	get
if i get this to work i will have a blog post upcoming

2043120
post	get
get post and cookie data

2043147
width	height
for example you should specify swp_nosize otherwise passing 0 for cx and cy will cause the window to shrink to zero width and height at the same time

2043160
children	parent
the easiest way i can think of would be to construct a dictionary that contains all possible children for a given parent like so

2043200
post	get
you just pass an variable to the handler via get or post that tells the handler which content to show

2043207
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and so on just refresh the page like a charm but ie dont

2043248
bionic	glibc
this already runs with glibc rather than bionic

2043309
short	base
in short in catch ex as system.servicemodel.faultexception i want to examine ex and get the base real type of the exception either as a type mostly for debugging so i can add another catch block or as a string for logging

2043321
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox and ie8 but not in opera or google-chrome

2043399
folder	directory
for example in a project where foldercustomnamespaceres.resx is placed inside a directory named folder

2043481
getter	setter
you should create public getter and setter

2043511
jlist	jlabel
i created a jframe object and added a jlabel and a jlist to the frame but both objects are being placed on top of each other

2043558
int	boolean
aindex int boolean

2043574
hide	show
this should work to hide all on click then show the specific player directly following the button in the dom

2043580
outputstream	inputstream
after connecting the result i get is an httpentity which has a method getcontent which returns an inputstream and also has a method writeto which writes to an outputstream

2043609
3des	aes
i d use 3des or aes for any encryption

2043635
pop-up	dialog
if you need a more specific answer to your question you ll need to do a better job of describing what you mean by return -- do you want to see the text in a label appear in a pop-up dialog etc

2043667
public	protected
access specifiers public protected private don t control visibility of the name

2043705
children	parent
i have tried eq next parent children in several different ways to succeed but it have only given me even more headache

2043833
put	get
a component i have created works fine if i put it in the main project and reference it from any res layout xml but when i put it in a project on which the main project depends i get a classnotfoundexception in the xml

2043840
subtract	add
this way we always know the date time in the database is correct to utc and if we need to adjust for client display or reporting we can add subtract the offset for all date time values regardless of which server s the data came from

2043841
youtube	vimeo
personally i prefer to see videos on something like vimeo rather than youtube or a similar site

2043865
xpages	lotus
instead it was a lotus notes xpages question

2043878
hide	show
by using show 0 media controller will be show until hide is called by an interaction with the player

2043922
width	height
in css you have width 100 and height 100

2043961
hash	salt
if the salt in this case would be for example otazmzyzodqzmjk5ntm1ndc1n the string to be hash is otazmzyzodqzmjk5ntm1ndc1npassword which is a lot more unlikely to appear in rainbow tables

2043978
int	chars
to that address add sizeof int chars -chunks - you will get a new address

2043986
decoder	encoder
to convert an mp3 file to a file of lower bitrate you must decoder and re-encode the file so you need an mp3 decoder and an mp3 encoder

2043995
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
this would work but the purpose of using salt is to differentiate the hash key to strengthen the crypt algorithm

2043995
hash	salt
also it would be better not to include the salt and hash key in the same table

2043996
youtube	vimeo
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone

2044021
int	double
here s why many common architectures including x86 have a hardware instruction to convert signed int to double but do not have a hardware conversion from unsigned to double so the compiler needs to synthesize the conversion in software

2044021
int	double
gcc s software conversion from unsigned int to double may very well be suboptimal it almost certainly is given the magnitude of the slowdown that you observed but it is expected behavior for the code to be faster when using signed int

2044021
int	double
assuming a smart compiler the difference should be much smaller on a 64-bit system because a 64-bit signed int - double conversion can be used to efficiently do a 32-bit unsigned conversion

2044021
integer	unsigned
on the other hand if the integer variables are unsigned cvtsi2sd can t be used to do the conversion so a software workaround is required

2044056
rss	feed
i do that and a few more things in the 200-line script driving the cranberries rss feed html summary of package updates at cran which stores stateful info in sqlite

2044061
phpunit	simpletest
it can be used with any unit test framework like phpunit or simpletest

2044065
post	get
you probably want to make it just a plain function not a static member function as in your post to get a simple c interface to it.

2044147
ienumerable	iqueryable
i was also thinking that iqueryable inherits from ienumerable and perhaps that was the way to go but i have failed to find any information that made sense to me on how to actually accomplish this

2044162
width	height
lets say i have an image that has a dpi of 72 and a width height of 100px 100px

2044166
awt	swing
there is no benefit getting your head around awt as swing is essentially a replacement for it

2044178
uploadify	swfupload
i am having exactly the same problem with yui uploader swfupload 2.2 and 2.5a and uploadify

2044205
awt	swing
as for the swing vs awt - swing straight away i would say

2044267
rss	feed
you do have xmldocument or can xml serialize a class to create that rss feed

2044274
floating-point	integer
it is of course impossible to meaningfully reinterpret an integer value as a floating-point value and vice versa since their physical representations are generally completely different

2044274
floating-point	integer
when you convert an integer value to a floating-point type the original value is converted exactly if it can be represented exactly by the target type

2044274
integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
when you convert a floating-point value to integer type the fractions part is simply discarded not the nearest value is taken but the number is rounded towards zero

2044274
floating-point	integer
note also that floating-point to integer conversions and the reverse are standard conversions and formally require no explicit cast whatsoever

2044311
awt	swing
well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

2044311
awt	swing
i have used both and i prefer swing over awt

2044311
awt	swing
also you do not need to learn awt to learn swing basics

2044347
awt	swing
swing replaces a lot of awt s concepts and components but integrates many others unchanged such as layout managers

2044347
awt	swing
if you learn swing you ll learn those parts of awt that still matter and how they are used in swing pretty much automatically

2044370
width	height
it sounds like you ll want to check out the scaleabsolute method of the itextsharp.text.image which will explicitly set the height width of an image

2044401
postgresql	mysql
this is the postgresql but under mysql it is mostly identical except for the extract dow and some group by additions but that isn t the problem the problem is it used to

2044468
rss	feed
system.servicemodel.syndication contains a bunch of classes for creating and consuming rss and atom feed

2044482
udp	tcp
alternatively you could base a tcpappender class on udpappender which uses tcp rather than udp - providing a reliable delivery service

2044534
int	chars
however you may be interested in isxdigit int chars which returns 0 if the chars passed isn t a valid hexadecimal chars note that x is not included as a valid chars

2044538
x86	64bit
if you want to ensure your code works on virtually all x86 processors out there stick to the 386 instruction set if your code is 32-bit or early x86-64 instruction set if it s 64bit

2044573
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
all of the grid features supported by smartclient - inline editing grouping filtering dynamic frozen columns sorting reordering fields drag and drop

calculate the width and height will be occupied by the image after rotation

2044629
google-chrome	firefox
so when i test the webform i see it doesnt even pop up in firefox the client s browser too nor google-chrome only in ie8

2044655
rss	feed
rss is just an xml file with one item for each feed post

2044683
subtract	add
to remember whether to add or subtract just remember that its always earlier east

2044684
google-chrome	firefox
enabling cross domain in firefox and google-chrome was easy by setting the header on the handling server

2044694
sorting	filtering
querydsl is type-safe and supports filtering sorting and projecting collections

2044699
google-chrome	firefox
in ie you ll only see the elements and comments not text nodes so it ll be best to use firefox or google-chrome or something you said it wouldn t have to be cross browser

2044706
int	boolean
only a few data types can be natively accessed eg int boolean without locking assuming you re not using interlocked

2044714
stdout	stderr
both true and false are printed on stdout with an exit status of 0 the fatal error is printed on stderr with an exit status of 128

2044834
for-loop	arrays
the enhanced for-loop works over arrays and iterables separately

2044843
for-loop	arrays
java arrays are not iterable even though the enhanced for-loop can iterate over them

2044852
bazaar	git

then keep the chars as int in the rest of the number for example 5106

2048884
freebsd	linux
you don t name server type but free pascal comes with nearly every linux distribution nowadays as well in the freebsd ports and on mac os x x86+ppc + 64-bit of both via fink or standalone .dmg installer

2048960
hash	salt
sha-512 with a salt is a good secure way to hash a password

2048968
javadoc	scaladoc
however there was a request that a function be provided that translated scaladoc into javadoc format for use by ides when displaying help

2049005
hash	whirlpool
you don t have to store the full length of the hash in mysql for instance you could hash something as whirlpool which is 128 characters long and store only the first 64 characters for efficiency

2049041
hide	show
we have several places where we show hide elements using and and calling them accordingly using js function calls

2049054
jar	manifest.mf
that value can be defined in the manifest.mf file of a jar file

2049054
jar	manifest.mf
so if you have a class org.example.myclass and the jar it comes in has the relevant entries in the manifest.mf file then you can get the version like this

2049064
elf	coff
a couple of formats that have been used for storing information in an executable file are elf and coff on unix systems and pe on windows

2049065
spweb	spsite
if you want to do something using the systemaccount token you have not only to do the using spsite using spweb but also find the list and the view using the strong spweb objects

2049086
hide	show
then you would have to rely on page refreshes to show hide elements

2049086
hide	show
when you click to show hide something refresh the page and then you server-side code would perform the logic of whether the field was incldued on the page

2049091
dictionary	map
first solution would be to use a dictionary to map the loader instances to names

2049138
gif	png
but if it is a static file like png gif then maintenance will take more time as you cannot control the individual images separately anymore

2049154
hide	show
having things that dynamically hide and show on mouse move or clicking is not all that good for accessibility

2049167
folder	directory
yes it s normal and no the current directory is not always the application folder

2049177
hide	show
you can also consider to show hide the elements in the server side

2049192
mouseup	mousedown
it appears that the behavior we are seeing occurs because the click event is being fired both from the mousedown and the mouseup events instead of just the mouseup as it would in windows or previous versions

2049192
mouseup	mousedown
it will become checked from the mousedown event and will stay checked because the mouseup event is not fired when you lift your finger from a different position

2049192
mouseup	mousedown
in order to prevent the double click behavior you must suppress one of the mousedown or mouseup events

2049220
width	height
use it for fixed width height images that are less likely to be updated frequently

2049226
jtable	jprogressbar
although to make it very possible try looking at jwindow jtable imageicon dimension jprogressbar

2049249
post	get
i have a button that depending on a class value should send different values to the post however what ever happens it is only running one condition whatever i do i can only get it to send the post the method add data

2049250
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop that runs through an arrays of functions and invokes each one

2049250
for-loop	loops
other times i dont need to wait for ajax success so i would like to set a condition such as if success continue the for-loop in which success is a variable set on the success of each part of loops

2049251
width	height
css sprites are best used for elements that have a fixed width and height

2049360
superclass	subclassing
the algorithm in process is common for all subclassing xxximage of image so its right place is the superclass

2049372
width	height
i need to calculate the position height and width of every anchored link in my page

2049372
width	height
i know how to find the x y coords but i have a problem with the height and width

2049402
google-chrome	safari
at least it does in google-chrome but like i said before google-chrome and safari share the webkit rendering engine so it should work for safari too

2049444
min	max
the indicator border fills up the progressbar from min to max

2049489
qdialog	qmessagebox
i d like to avoid writing my own qdialog which would mimic the qmessagebox behavior

2049491
google-chrome	safari
not seeing this condition with other browsers ie google-chrome safari

2049505
multiplication	modulo	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	multiplication
then iteratively multiplying by j and reduce modulo n after each multiplication

2049636
int	boolean
public boolean isremoved int idx return flags.get idx

2049652
width	height
so if the image hasn t finished loading which it probably hasn t on an initial get request its height and width style attributes are small i m not sure exactly what they correspond to - perhaps the size of firefox s image placeholder though in your case it comes up 164 x 16 pixels

2049678
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i installed netbeans 6.8 on linux mint based on ubuntu 9.10 and i can see that font rendering is very weird

2049692
post	get
this just depends on whether you want to use get or post

2049692
post	get
the buttons will have php generated links if get or values if post

2049692
post	get
very important sanitize all get and post values before using them in a query

2049742
implements	extends
one reason if your class implements some interface or extends some abstract class with abstract public methods then you may not reduce the visibility of those implements methods

2049762
filtering	grouping
aggregate and do whatever arithmetic filtering grouping you can in the query in the database and then do iterative computations on the server side in php

2049807
versioning	upgrade
this has started happening since our upgrade from rc2 to rc5 we skipped all the intervening versioning

2049827
int	chars
keep in mind that the language needs a way to represent the int to you as a series of chars and that it needs to be deterministic because otherwise it would have no way to choose

2049832
post	get
it is much more convenient to get the post details and use post_id of the post to find the comments belonging to the post

2049865
versioning	upgrade
versioning upgrade scripts for each development iteration

2049869
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is based on webkit like safari albeit a different version so it shouldn t have too many issues

2049920
getter	setter
you need to add getter setter in your action class for the form inputs

2049922
titlebar	window
i have an extension for firefox written in javascript that i would like to make able to append text to the window s titlebar

2049944
boost	stl
i m really new to stl and boost programming and also inexperienced in c++ programming anyways p hope to get a convenient answer plz not suggest to rewrite libmpq and the underlying zlib architecture

2049964
getter	setter
upd the problem is even more stupid when i commented all stuff related to category class my selectmanylistbox my converter all related setter and getter and left only method action it still isn t being called

2049980
post	get
if it isn t you re going to get more than one line post that have comments with the same created_date

2050002
pop-up	dialog
i have a thickbox dialog that pop-up but my silverlight gallery is still pulling up on top hidden most of the modal dialog

2050005
children	parent
if true that s why the div doesn t show any content floating elements are taken out of the document flow and thus out of the parent element which in turn will collapse to 0 width when there are no no-floating children

2050027
titlebar	window
you can just use the document.title property to dynamically change your page s title which is what it shows in the window s titlebar

2050039
tunnel	vpn
i have a a sonicwall nsa 4500 and i would like to monitor the vpn tunnel on it

2050039
tunnel	vpn
i have walked the snmp and i didn t see anything that was related to vpn tunnel

2050062
width	margin
1 i checked that page width 8.5in body width 7.20833in + left margin 0 + right margin 0

2050079
ant	pom.xml
i d much rather write an ant build.xml file than spend tons of times writing pom.xml files

2050119
width	height
then resize the unbound textbox to 0 height and 0 width making it invisible

2050221
int	chars
it s calling a generic static method create using chars and int as the type arguments

2050233
ant	maven
it builds on ant and maven and supports all of the standard goals compile unit tests etc

2050250
int	chars
you are passing chars for k and int for v

2050257
pop-up	dialog
when i run this script locally i see a progress dialog pop-up as the files are extracted and copied

2050275
codeigniter	cakephp
if you haved worked with one of the typical frameworks codeigniter cakephp and others there are for sure quite different to work with a cms like modx or drupal but they are flexible cms es that are fearily easy to extend with new features

2050345
cpu	hyperthreading
some cpu s can do clever stuff with threads and can have multiple threads running per cpu - see hyperthreading - but check out your task manager i d be very surprised if you have more than 4-8 virtual cpus on today s desktops

2050369
directx	directdraw
i also am considering trying to use directx directdraw because apparently it is very fast

2050402
queue	fifo
use a pair of lists to represent a queue where elements are in fifo order in the first list and in lifo order in the second list

2050432
button	checkbox
the click event isnt getting attached to the next button because the checkbox is required and checked so stepisvalid is false and createnextbutton returns false before binding the click event

2050439
google-chrome	firefox
it should be also a web project and extensions for browsers like google-chrome firefox ie

2050446
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome or firefox as my browsers of choice but i d even consider using ie again if someone found a plugin that did this

2050481
inherited	properties
when you use this in a class that inherited from object your class does via movieclip- displayobject- eventdispatcher- object the compiler won t throw an error if the properties does not exist because it attempts to create that properties as a member of this

2050488
ivar	subclassing	superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you want to inherited a class the superclass s interface hence the whole superclass hierarchy must be known so that the ivar offsets of the subclassing can be calculated

2050507
width	height
i need to create a class that can be accessible through the asp classic s server.createobject method and that exposes three properties int width int height bool loaded and three methods void load string locatoin void resize int width int height and void save string location

2050525
serializable	deserialization
it s useful if you are doing any real amount 1 of serializable deserialization within a project

2050536
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
examples are cakephp codeigniter and kohana

2050536
wordpress	joomla
examples are wordpress joomla and drupal

2050600
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to versioning 3 of nhibernate and the new linq provider seems to be working perfectly well for the same query

2050664
jar	manifest.mf
i suggest that you check the manifest.mf file of your jar

2050674
post	get
where the second argument to the post dict s get method is the value to return if the key var in this case doesn t exist

2050686
vb.net	vb6
the code was converted from vb6 to vb.net and i have figured out most of things that i need to do

2050691
mouse	keyboard
it is also more consistent applies both to mouse and keyboard navigation

2050693
width	height
for instance if i have a linearlayout with the layout width and height set to fill_parent and i have a button with those values set to wrap_content it uses the value from the button like the button values overide the linearlayout

2050718
postgresql	mysql
i have experience with programming objctive-c php web development java c c++ jsp j2me and sql databases like mysql postgresql apache derby

2050718
rsa	aes
security i have knowledge in crytography network systems firewalls i did some basic implementations of rsa and aes

2050724
mouse	keyboard
the interactive window station assigned to the logon session of the interactive user also contains the keyboard mouse and display device

2050727
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code below doesn t work in ie6 7 8 but it does work in firefox safari google-chrome

2050736
versioning	upgrade
problem is when i m doing upgrade the users still use the old versioning from their cache which often breaks the application and requires clearing the cache every time to solve the problem

2050740
atomic	interlocked
this approach may be used to build a lock-free queue using two atomic single-linked list based stacks such as provided by win32 interlocked singly linked lists

2050744
vbscript	vba
i ve written vbscript but the similarities to vba cause me more angst than ease

2050790
dictionary	map
for one thing it seemed to me that r s list data type was a straightforward implementation of the map adt dictionary in python nsmutabledictionary in objective c hash in perl and ruby object literal in javascript and so forth

2050860
ienumerable	ienumerator
this is what ienumerable ienumerator does

2050881
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but without three20 you can t do this with a stock uinavigationcontroller because the uiviewcontroller that you re using is a subview of the uinavigationcontroller

2050908
maven	pom.xml
the maven-eclipse-plugin is a maven plugin run from the cmd line to generate eclipse project files based on your pom.xml

2050944
getter	setter
finally i did consider embedding code inside mapping file but overriding things like getter and setter looked pretty tedious

2050947
webclient	webrequest
i have also notice speed disparities between browsers and webclient or webrequest

2050947
webclient	webrequest
our code that uses .net webclient webrequest is totally inefficient in comparison as everything is initialised anew each time

2050950
google-chrome	firefox
the control works fine in firefox google-chrome etc

2051008
hide	show
mark s code should work but i often prefer to create the item manually then show hide it based on the need

2051032
post	get
if you add an id to a div that surrounds each blog post you can move from .parent to an id lookup which is always faster then you can get rid of the .finds which slow things down

2051084
inherited	properties
as long as the properties defined in the mapping exist in the class be it because of inherited it should work

2051198
inherited	properties
what i did was just inherited from a custom controller where i added the orderservice as a properties

2051265
postgresql	mysql
i could handle this with a habtm table but it seems inefficient to have a long table joining offers with countries when i could simply use the set column type in mysql postgresql see mysql documentation on set type here

2051384
rss	feed
today it fails to connect to the internet can t download rss feed or connect to my tfs server

2051407
min	max	min	median	median	max
i see there are microsoft provided functions for median avg max and min but nothing for mode

2051495
gradle	ivy
we use gradle for building java projects and at the moment we have ivy repositories to store third-party artifacts and also to publish our own artifacts into repo is build using gant scripts and the ivy ant tasks

2051502
superclass	subclassing
as with any class cluster if you create a subclassing of nsnumber you have to override the primitive methods of its superclass nsvalue

2051523
min	max
this heuristic alone had a tendency to collapse after the bottom right corner became part of the flooded area however so the final result was max bottom right corner min steps number of colors remaining not part of main flood

2051538
post	get
somehow you need to get a pointer back to your tableview and exposing that as a accessor from you viewcontroler could break encapsulation so it would be better to just have a delegate that you set so you could post to the delegate

2051550
packets	multicast
there is an issue that your network equipment specifically any routers possibly other equipment as well may need to be explicitly set up to allow forwarding of broadcast and or multicast packets

2051550
packets	multicast
here s another long shot - if you run both the sender and receiver on the same machine and turn off ip_multicast_loop then you won t get any packets as it disables the multicast loopback interface

2051596
vim	emacs
well you edit your files in emacs or vim

2051596
ant	maven
for java people often use ant or maven to build their software

2051616
vim	emacs
emacs vim are text editors that allow you to write your program

2051616
vim	emacs
also emacs and vim are scriptable and have routines that allow you to call a compiler directly on the file you re editing

2051622
vim	emacs
apart from what already has been said take a few tutorials to learn how to code compile with vim and emacs

2051661
nyromodal	blockui
after some research and lot of quick prototyping i feel like my old companion nyromodal is the only option left for me which gives me flexibility of controlling it using its extensive api i went through other options given by the users and topup and blockui came closer rest of them are also good but doesn t meet my needs

2051683
put	get	post	put	post	get
and then post put get that back to the server

2051693
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
instead of that though i d probably use a debugger like google-chrome s dev tools even if you don t normally use google-chrome for development or firebug even if you don t normally use firefox for development or dragonfly on opera or f12 developer tools on ie

2051712
postgresql	mysql
there are still many ways how to solve or workaround this issue either by plain ado.net mysql postgresql and sql server works perfect or nhibernate didn t test it but i saw somewhere that it works

2051712
ubuntu	linux
i m using visual studio for development and then i deploy apps to linux machine os - ubuntu web server - nginx

2051713
post	get
also obviously i understand that car.speed and car.speed 55 are the same function which makes this wrong but then in php and also in zend framework the same action is used for get post postbacks

2051739
integer	unsigned
i have a table with an unsigned integer as the primary key with values ranging from 0 to 31543

2051739
integer	unsigned
i had to modify the column to auto_increment modify column id integer unsigned not null auto_increment and set the seed in the same statement

2051744
scatter	graphing
i have a scatter plot graphing with a bunch of random x y coordinates

2051750
jquery	scriptaculous
you should probably not use as that is meant to be used as a way to make ajax calls library scriptaculous dojo yahoo jquery indifferent

2051763
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently not supported blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit

2051797
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
at first i thought i d define exceptions specific to each class however it turns out most of those exceptions are simply extensions of existing runtimeexception foonegativeintargumentexception extends illegalargumentexception foonullbarexception extends nullpointerexception with specific messages

2051823
getter	setter
on the other hand c# does have something like what you describe since properties behave differently as a getter or setter depending on the context in what they are used

2051823
getter	setter
but while it is a single property there are two seperate sections of code for implementing the getting and setting and it is clear that this is a getter setter and not a function speed because they omit the for properties

2051851
struts	stripes
stripes the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than struts

2051851
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
i m not looking for frameworks with ui state on the server like wicket tapestry or jsf

2051862
accessor	properties
11.2.1 properties accessor

2051898
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested with the following markup in ie8 and firefox doesn t work in google-chrome safari

2051906
getter	setter
i prefer active objects which encapsulate operations rather than getter and setter so you get a semantically richer objects

2051906
getter	setter
it s relatively rare to want both a setter and a getter on an object with behaviour

2051924
getter	setter
it s convention java has a convention of getter and setter c# has properties python has public fields and javascript frameworks tend to use field to get and field value to set

2051929
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using this css will get it looking like you want it to in ie safari firefox google-chrome

2051933
filtering	grouping
not entirely sure i understand your question but you can try enabling audience targeting list settings - audience targeting settings and then create a sales view with a filtering setting the target audience sales assuming you have a sales grouping

2051941
width	height
i know that i can set the width and height of each canvas panel manually in the xaml but i want them to be the same size

2051941
width	height
so that each panel is the same width and height and i only have to set it once

2051963
onclick	onsubmit
you are assigning submitsearch to the onclick event for the submit button and the onsubmit event for the form

2051963
onclick	onsubmit
since the onclick event is fired before the onsubmit event the onsubmit event will not even fire if the onclick event didn t return true

2051971
width	height
propertytype table contains various property types like name height width color maxspeed volume etc

2051992
margin	height
an alternative if both the parent and child have known height is to set a top margin on the child

2052041
keydown	keyup
if i replace keypress with keyup or keydown it works fine

2052041
firefox	safari
keypress event does work in firefox and in safari

2052046
draggable	droppable
note that i haven t used the sortable ui helper before but it should be a similar principle to draggable and droppable and i ve based my example on what i know from these other two helpers - if it s not entirely correct it should be close

2052059
goto	break
i think there are some compiler optimizations that are not available if you use early returns break statements goto statements and the like

2052076
width	height
both the canvas s will have the height of 300 and width of 300

2052081
interpolation	splines
update tom smith advises that splines interpolation is to be preferred to polynomial interpolation for this kind of thing and wikipedia bears him out

2052095
interpolation	splines	range	infinity
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range

2052133
getter	setter
fwiw i prefer the class.noun for the getter and class.verb for the setter

2052140
charindex	substr
if the field always has the number at the end with possibly one word before it and a space before it you could use charindex substr to solve this

2052166
vim	emacs
an investment in learning vim my preference or emacs will pay off

2052168
google-chrome	firefox
and i ve tried in firefox and google-chrome and i m not getting the textarea s background-color

2052188
inherited	properties
set up the post build steps in it and have all your project inherited settings from that properties sheet

2052202
implements	extends
i implements a new class which extends parameterized called labelledparameterized

2052205
google-chrome	firefox
it works in internetexplorer but it doesn t work with firefox google-chrome

2052245
opera	firefox
firefox 3.0 and opera 9.5. 14 the png

2052265
post	get
i would like to get a list of post for a tag that have some other criteria like a sort order partial title match etc

2052286
children	parent
return just the parent and children that were affected

2052321
scatter	graphing
inspecting the scatter graphing visually it s fairly obvious the data points form two groups with some random points that do not obviously belong to either

2052340
post	get
if you get an empty answer back from a synchronous http post it implies success - otherwise you will get a soap fault or other error result

2052357
versioning	upgrade
if you are using another versioning of python and installed pyobjc yourself you still may be able to use easy_install to revert to it since normally easy_install does not remove previous versioning when you upgrade

2052366
mouse	keyboard
i m building a mega menu where i want to be able to trigger the menu via both a hover using the mouse and focus such as tabbing to it via the keyboard

2052366
mouse	keyboard
this works but am wondering if that s the ideal way to handle both keyboard and mouse interactions together

2052387
children	parent
i have a parent swf parent that handles user navigation between multiple children swfs child_1 child_2 child_3

2052446
centos	linux
after upgrading to jboss as 5.1 running jre 1.6_17 centos 5 linux the jre process runs out of memory after about 8 hours hits 3g max on a 32-bit system

2052449
hide	show
i m having a problem with the jquery hide and show methods

2052449
hide	show
this code comes from a multi-page form which is loaded in it s entirety then jquery is used to show and hide the various pages

2052449
hide	show
the issue is not that the hide fails but that the subsequent show doesn t bring the desired page back

2052449
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i ve tried using different methods like slideup and slidedown i ve tried doing css display none various other ways to perform the hide show

2052449
hide	show
i ve also tried chaining methods doing callbacks from hide to then show

2052453
mxmlc	compc
the purpose of this task is to set a property that determines the name of the patternset to be used when declaring the implicit fileset on a mxmlc or compc task

2052453
mxmlc	compc
the named patternset is then referenced by the mxmlc or compc task like this

2052468
for-loop	arrays
i just wrapped your iterator generation in a for-loop and built up an arrays of iterator functions

2052475
min	max
keep track of the min and max projection on each axis

2052475
min	max
the area of the obb is max1-min1 max2-min2 and you can easily compute the points of the obb from the angle and the min and max projections

2052502
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop instead of a while loops

2052503
try-catch	exception-handling
now you just use the class and wrap the call that might throw the exception-handling in a try-catch block

2052513
client-side	server-side
my idea is to serialize the file into json client-side and call a web service to reconstitute the file server-side

2052533
junit	jmock
there are two obvious answers such as using jmock or remove the final modifier on the classes we want to test but we want to stick with one external testing framework besides junit and it may be hard to convince other developers to remove the final modifier

2052550
versioning	upgrade
use a consistent versioning on all files important for later upgrade

2052613
tcpdf	fpdf
tcpdf and fpdf can both render pdf output

2052641
post	get
you can also get the latest post from the above feed this time i ll use simplexml instead

2052648
hide	show
basically i hide all of the answer divs on the page but i want to show a div if the a user has clicked a bookmarked link to it

subclassing constructors may specify as the first thing they do which constructor in the superclass to invoke before executing the code in the subclassing s constructor

2054040
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing constructor does not specify which superclass constructor to invoke then the compiler will automatically call the accessible no-args constructor in the superclass

thesis there is no implementation of equals and gethashcode that meets your requirements

2055461
equals	gethashcode
since equals and gethashcode cannot return different values for the same arguments there is no implementation that meets your requirements

2055470
equals	gethashcode
i don t think it s possible because you could have an infinite sequence of values that are equals within tolerance to the previous and next value in the sequence but not any other value and gethashcode would need to return an identical value for all of them

try g++ instead of gcc or throw out the c++ code libraries

2056435
sorting	filtering
i think the following prinicple applies if the filtering sorting functionality is a property of the view only an alternate view might legitimately not provide such functionality then collectionviews should be used in the view with code-behind as necessary

2056435
sorting	filtering
if the filtering sorting functionality is a dimension of the model then this can be dealt with in the viewmodel or model by other means

2056454
post	get
i would however consider using post instead of get if possible to prettify the url but that s of course depends on your implementation environment

2056477

getter	setter
as others have noted java has getter and setter but there is no strict analogon

2056928
getter	setter
there is a third party library called project lombok tha uses annotation to generate the getter and setter in the .class files at comile time

2056990

folder	directory
if you need want to organise your plugin folder - use the zend underscore directory naming convention - so this

2057304
disk	ram
that s one of the main reasons why you should try and keep the clustering key small and static - small because otherwise you ll waste a lot of space on disk and in your server s ram and static because otherwise you ll have to update not just your clustering index but also all your non-clustered indices as well if your value changes

2057319
google-chrome	firefox
webgl is included in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox

2057459
textview	imageview
each view row in this listview is a linearlayout which contains 3 views - checkbox imageview and a textview horizontal

2057494
submit	submission
using a script-assisted link to submit a form instead of just having a submit button unnecessarily makes your form require javascript so it won t work where js is unavailable or broken due to other errors and makes the link give affordances like â œopen in new windowâ and â œbookmark linkâ that aren t appropriate and won t work for a form submission

2057556
tortoisegit	svn
if i do a git svn rebase on windows with msysgit and also tortoisegit i have the following error fatal write error invalid argument

2057558
ienumerable	icollection
even if you returned your list as a read-only interface say ienumerable or icollection nothing prevents a caller from performing a run-time cast and getting at the list

2057565
versioning	upgrade
to fix this problem either install wasce in a path without spaces or upgrade to the latest versioning available

2057576
hide	show
another idea i have is to use cookie s to check if a user has chosen to hide a message i think this would be faster but maybe not as good since user can log in with differnt computers and if a new message is show they may not see it right away

2057576
hide	show
however if i decide i need to post a new admin message for all users to see then even a user who chose to hide and not show the admin message will still see it again until they choose to never see it again

2057604
twitter	bit.ly
all the twitter status updates on the wordpress sidebar have bit.ly links

2057605
ubuntu	linux
i m using netbeans on linux ubuntu 9.04 to build a c project

2057673
folder	directory
however if you use compression then the current working directory will be some sub-folder in your temp folder rather than the directory where your setup.exe is

2057691
submit	submission
unless your submit function is doing something funky it shouldn t block the user from submission by pressing enter inside a field

2057765
altera	xilinx
however both altera and xilinx have had their free limited version for long enought you would be safe using them

2057765
verilog	vhdl
since you would be just writing standard verilog or vhdl you could take your source to another vendor just like c

2057778
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
hittest is used by the framework to determine which view is being hit and thus which view to send the touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended touchescancelled messages to

put	get
put it in an absolutely-positioned div then use clientwidth to get the displayed width of the tag

2057819
width	height
they are arranged side-by-side with exactly the same width height and border css

hash	md5
it calculates the md5 hash of the password after converting it to utf-8

2057836
put	get
simply put i d like someone to be able to click a link and get a one-time-use pdf

2057840
ostream	istream
when i use ostream istream i seem to be restricted to using byte aligned

2057876
post	get
here is a good msdn blog post to get you started

2057934
opera	firefox
this limit is increased to 50 by firefox and to 30 by opera but ie6 and ie7 enforce the limit of 20 cookie per domain

2057936
installation	upgrade
the only other alternative i can think of is to have the new installation stop the service of the old installation but this is undesirable because it requires the installation to have information about all old installation that it can upgrade stopping this particular service may involve more than just a simple call to the service manager to stop it

2057992
int	chars
the rules are a bit complex but basically the smaller type gets temporarily converted to the larger type so if you compare an int with a chars the chars will be converted to an int for the purposes of the comparison only

2058052
children	parent
if the updatepanel is set with some form of trigger to force it to update be it all children or just specified ones in your parent function you can force a postback on one of those controls

2058058
stdout	stderr
if you re looking at this as a diagnostic tool i recommend redirecting your application log to stdout and then redirecting both stdout and stderr into a file

2058062
objectdatasource	formview
each form is defined within an asp formview with the datasource set to an objectdatasource

2058074
profiling	debugging
also have a look at creating a debugging and profiling agent with jvmti

2058082
subtraction	addition
is it better to define the types say addition subtraction conditionals control flow elsewhere and just bring them together as predefined types in the union

2058096
int	chars
is the type of a function that takes a pointer to a bd_t an int and a pointer to a chars array and returns a ulong

2058101
int	chars
you re typecasting addr to a pointer to a function returning a ulong that takes a bd_t an int and a chars as parameters and then calling the function with the parameters bd --argc argv 1

2058133
getter	setter
which is closer to the c++ calls i guess assuming these are declared as property or have getter and setter

2058158
getattr	setattr
attribute-handling builtins and special methods getattr setattr __getattr__ __setattr__ ... work just the same way across the single namespace of the object whether referring to plain attributes or not

2058189
jar	war
also war file is about 20m including jar libs around 500 classes and 200 compiled jsp pages

2058264
swt	nattable
or ktable nattable nebulagrid but they are for swt

2058300
put	get
to get the image glued to only the last work of the link you can either take the last word out of the link or put the image in and then the same non-breaking space between the last word and the image will give you the layout you want

2058304
subtract	add
first to get the edge effects between different colored areas add or subtract some fraction of the r g and b channels to the texture image

2058328
int	boolean
just i mean _i to be class proper name not int which handle some boolean for example operations f with same meaning for all classes

2058405
profiling	instrumentation
however when i create a new profiling of type instrumentation in vs 2008 and run the profiling the report shows my main function calling run but in turn when viewing the caller callee report for my run method the report shows that the run method is the bottom of the stack

2058424
return-value-optimization	nrvo
it s also unnecessary if your compiler supports the nrvo named return-value-optimization and your function uses and returns the local variable you would have liked to return by ref in a fairly simple way

2058484
post	get
this is failing because it s calling the post method where covered can t be empty instead of the get

2058518
firefox	safari
it s works in firefox and safari but not ie 7 or 8

2058521
put	get
when i put the url in firefox i get back the .wsdl xml and it looks fine and there is no trace of an error message

2058533
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol with tabitem s the tabitem s have text and an icon

2058540
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
im trying to detect orientation changes in a uiimagepickercontroller it inherits from uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller uiresponder nsobject and i tried override the method - bool shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation uiinterfaceorientation interfaceorientation in uiviewcontroller but no success.

2058543
pull	push
i m not sure if there is a way to just pull over the whole file read the rows from that file on the local copy and then push back the changes or not

2058547
keystore	jks
the problem is apparently - i can not really confirm this that it s impossible to properly import a previously generated certificate and matching key into a jks keystore and have it presented properly by tomcat

2058547
keystore	jks
import both der files into a keystore jks file using a custom java class

2058547
keystore	jks
the end result is a jks keystore which can then be used in the tomcat connector configuration as the keystore

2058585
maven	pom.xml
the only cause of this is two maven profiles are defined without a profile id element in the same pom.xml thus the ids are treated null

2058585
maven	pom.xml
error profiles.profile.id must be unique but found duplicate profile with id default org.apache.maven.its.mngxxxx parent 1.0-snapshot users plynch dev maven core-integration-testing mytests mng-xxxx-it src test resources mng-xxxx pom.xml

2058585
maven	pom.xml
error the project org.apache.maven.its.mngxxxx parent 1.0-snapshot users plynch dev maven core-integration-testing mytests mng-xxxx-it src test resources mng-xxxx pom.xml has 1 error

2058585
maven	pom.xml
lastly in a multi-module build should a parent pom.xml define a profile with the same id as one in the child there is no warning or other indication emitted from maven

2058587
ostream	istream
also only istream support is in a separate function would be done for ostream -- i know i could pass iostream but that would not allow passing an istream to the conversion function

2058617
post	get
i ve read a couple forum post elsewhere that reference using svn ignore to avoid certain environment-specific files and directories but don t know how to get set up on my live site and ensure everything is properly synchronized

2058628
client-side	server-side
i must admit i m more of a server-side coder than client-side and javascript baffles me

2058643
spaces	delimiter
while i used an example of spaces delimiter fields there are other ways to define fields as well

2058649
google-chrome	firefox
i believe this is why it works on google-chrome but not on firefox or ie

2058701
width	height
subsequently assigned values for its attributes such as x y width height and id for temppanel and then added child instances as below

2058712
switching	screens
if the wakelock timer has expired in the background the system takes the release of wakelock as an opportunity to switching off the screens

2058712
onresume	onpause
edit i should mention that i am setting wakelock onresume and releasing onpause - as i understand it it s necessary to release then to prevent the app from leaking the wakelock

2058730
inherited	subclassing
i only use subclassing the template pattern when there s a suitable inherited relationship per the liskov substitution principle the algorithm i m varying needs access to the protected methods of the base class and i want a high degree of cohesion

2058785
post	get
there may be a way to call the method with a get i ve only ever used post

2058820
switching	screens
to switching off the screens

2058828
pop-up	dialog
once you ve added it it will be in a list and you won t need to open the select working set... dialog just select my test project from the pop-up menu

2058847
firefox	safari
the result is that safari and firefox

2058911
forth	ada	forth	smalltalk	eiffel	smalltalk	eiffel	ada
they will most probably be mainstream such as c++ c# or ada for example depending on the domain but if this is for academic interest some of the more esoteric languages might be of interest eiffel forth smalltalk and all those mentioned by others

2058931
put	get
however if you could put an app into standby whats to stop you detecting it coming out of standby and putting it back in thus making you have to do a reset or something to get out

2058935
nsstring	nsdata
tmparray objectforkey twitter username and tmparray objectforkey twitter password hold my username and password respectively as nsstrings scrapbook.short_description is an nsstring and scrapbook.image is nsdata

2058951
webkit	gecko
only gecko and webkit browsers support it currently though

2058953
integer	radix
o nk greedy solution n input size k radix of your digits based on stefan kendall s answer above but with the insight that you should probably be greedy and use the integer you have the most of first

2058994
777	tmp
the session.path is set to tmp with 777 perms

2059004
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
also if you switch from cpython to jython or pypy or ironpython all bets are off other than the documentation on id

2059033
integer	unsigned
i m trying to find databases with support for ip addresses as a native type as opposed to storing as a string or an unsigned integer which at least one commenter has already pointed out won t work for ipv6

2059059
pthreads	fcntl
fcntl is the one api to choose since it is the least broken and is pthreads

2059104
cvs	svn
i bet there is a tortoise plugin for your scm i saw one for mercurial and svn and cvs ugh

2059183
bash	tcsh
technically linux is not a shell but in fact the kernel but many different shells can run on top of it bash tcsh pdksh etc.

2059188
zsh	tcsh
ksh tcsh and zsh

2059201
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a distribution of linux which contains bash as an available shell

2059283
fadein	fadeout
i just tried this example and both a fadein and fadeout work at the same time in ie6

2059284
bindparam	pdostatement
the bindparam function is a method of a pdostatement object not a pdo object

2059284
prepare	pdostatement
you ll have to use the pdostatement from your prepare call instead

2059285
put	get
i have put debug statements in to make sure the correct proxy server is being passed to that function and it is indeed correct but the registry entries never get changed after the first time

2059293
bindparam	pdostatement
the bindparam method is inside the pdostatement class not the pdo class

2059333
range	max	range	min	min	max
the solution depends on their inter-relatedness but the min max -- range and value range -- boundedvalue examples give you some idea of the kinds of techniques to apply

2059337
ubuntu	linux
all the web projects are hosted on ubuntu linux

2059347
777	tmp
i had the chmod for the components and tmp directory set to 777 but still having the same issue

2059422
superclass	subclassing
it looks like you should be able to subclassing nspredicateeditor and override predicateforrow declared in nspredicateeditor s superclass nsruleeditor and do your substitution there

2059427
put	get
or you could put a comment inside the element and use dom methods to get the comment object and extract its data

2059465
accessor	properties
when i need to implement lsb in 5.2 i generally make a static properties and corresponding static accessor that allow me to change the class instantiated by static calls

2059519
cos	sin
sin angle disty hypotenuse and cos angle distx hypotenuse assuming x and y rise up and to the right

2059532
getter	setter
many js engines support getter and setter on javascript objects

2059539
getter	setter
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter

2059539
getter	setter
now if we wanted to instead define getter and setter within the context of our object prototype and where having private data is less of a concern we can then use an alternative object syntax for that

2059542
getter	setter
rhino versions 1.6r6 support getter and setter you could write something like this

2059547
profiler	gprof
i m looking for a statistical profiler - not gprof

2059559
inherited	properties
you need to change you properties to imagesource or bitmapsource which createbitmapsourcefromhicon returns and inherited imagesource like this

2059638
implements	extends
i think i ll have to implements one base class and then extends it using the others

2059690
try-catch	exception-handling
the advantage of this in the .net world at least is an easier-to-use domain surface and more succinct and readable code no huge try-catch blocks or roundabout exception-handling handling mechanisms

2059710
hide	show
you can create custom alerts that hide show what fields are in the alert message

2059818
octal	decimal	octal	hex
according to the documentation valueof only takes strings that can be interpreted as signed decimal values while decode takes decimal hex or octal strings prefixed by 0x # or 0 - though valueof is overloaded to also take the radix explicitly

2059832
octal	hex
the decode method allows you to specify the radix hex octal in the string itself using 0x 0x or # for hex and 0 as a prefix for octal numbers while valueof allows you to pass the radix as a number 8 or 16 as an optional parameter

2059862
post	get
i m building an android app which should perform a get on my site to get two cookies and then perform a post to the same site with these cookies

2059865
unsigned	short
at 48 bits per pixel with 16 bit per color you can t return an 8 bit value you must return a 16 bit short or unsigned short otherwise the data gets truncated

2059869
unsigned	short
simply read your data as uint16_t or unsigned short and you get the 16 bit extracted properly

2059879
post	get
first the register_globals that you disable in your php.ini refers to an old php feature where any variable sent via a query string get or form get post would be converted into a global php variable

2059882
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i can see no rendering difference with the default stylesheets in ie firefox opera or google-chrome

2059909
width	height
as far as i know you will have to compare the width clientwidth and height clientheight in your addchar function

2059924
typedef	struct
alternatively you can typedef it as datastruct if don t want to use the struct everywhere

2059938
gif	png
example or png or gif will return true

2059946
typedef	struct
c requires you to refer to it using the struct keyword or typedef it

2059948
getter	setter
note that you can distinguish between a getter call and a setter call just by checking if the value argument is undefined or not

2059997
firefox	safari
for some reason ie is adding a vertical scrollbar to the edge of the page but there is no scroller and nothing to scroll firefox and safari look fine

2060004
gridview	linqdatasource
i m trying to set the where clause on a linqdatasource object bound to a gridview programmatically on a button click but when the gridview rebinds data for instance when the user sorts the where clause resets back to the empty string

2060005
post	get
once you get the form you can add the necessary input values to the given hidden values and post the response back again

2060005
post	get
you sometimes have to do a get before a post to get values and cookies set up properly

2060009
gif	png
i suggest making a http head request so you won t need to download the entire image and then based on the string returned parse and make sure the content-type is an image jpeg image pjpeg image gif image png or similar image content-types

2060016
firefox	safari
if you need to get the exact same behaviour in all browsers and want to add the deactivated scrollbar to firefox and safari check my recent question

2060020
vim	emacs
vim emacs

2060049
hex	binary
understanding base 2 binary base 16 hex number systems is helpful a must

2060069
post	get
i m a php man so i can t help you write something off the top of my head but if you need a sample code post a comment and i or someone will get one out to you

2060071
lisp	scheme
scheme is a dialect of lisp but you probably knew that already. on this subject pull down a copy of course 6.001 from open courseware at mit.

2060095
post	get
you could try changing the domain of the cookies in the cookie store or using the same host for get and post

2060100
draggable	droppable
i m trying to use jquery ui to make a block of text draggable and later droppable and resizable

2060100
width	height
the problem is that all of the jquery ui documentation examples act on objects that have an explicitly specified css width and height

2060100
width	height
without having a css width and height specified the horizontal scroll bar in the browser shows up and starts going crazy as soon as you touch the text object

2060100
width	height
the problem goes away if you specify css width and height properties but the text i m working with is dynamic.

2060100
width	height
i can t specify width and height ahead of time

2060117
jnetpcap	libpcap
the underlying libpcap c library that they both wrap has continued to evolve so i would go with jnetpcap for that reason

2060129
width	height
you could dynamically add a width and or height once you start dragging the object and then return those styles to auto once you drop it

2060145
int	boolean
it uses the macro null which is equivalent to the int constant zero and zero in a boolean context is treated as false

2060152
actionscript	mxml
i also tried actionscript approach but with httpservice mxml component to fetch xml file

2060160
button	checkbox
there is a checkbox in column 1 of both listviews and a button on the page

2060168
sudo	passwd
i ve tried but cannot enter the sudo passwd and then execute another command on the same exec call

2060169
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote this code and it is working nicely in google-chrome but when it comes to firefox and other major browsers it is not even changing a little bit thing

2060176
hide	show
it makes sense to have the controller tell other tabs to hide and tell the new tab to show

2060176
hide	show
but it also makes sense to have the tab tell all the other tabs to hide and then show itself

2060188
sudoers	passwd
you should set up your sudoers not to require a passwd nopasswd for the user that your php is running as

2060204
post	get
a get request will be performed by default - but if you pass in any extra parameters in the form of an object map key value pairs then a post will occur

2060236
getter	setter
at first i figured that is making two calls instead a block first the setter and then the getter to gather the return value

2060236
getter	setter
however instrumenting the setter and getter methods with nslog calls proves this isn t the case

2060267
hide	show
internally it would ask the tabset to hide all other tabs and show itself

2060267
hide	show
i m assuming exactly one tab must be show at all times so there s no point in having a public method to hide an individual tab

2060282
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera have build-in debugger

2060287
rss	feed
i don t quite understand rdf but i am looking to convert rss feed from places like yahoo and google into rdf format to display on a website

2060321
bash	subshell
according to the bash man page each command in a pipeline is executed in a subshell

2060328
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
just amounts to capturing mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

2060369
awt	swing
unfortunately awt components don t have the setopaque property like swing components do so they are rectangular

2060400
fflush	gets
except in your case where you exit the program right after writing and have the unfortunate luck to run out of disk space at the exact moment the buffer gets fflush

2060421
filesystems	ntfs
local or remote files or directories on an ntfs filesystems

2060444
implements	extends
if you want to check if an object implements a particular interface or extends a particular class date use

2060490
width	height
i guess you want to change the width and or the height

2060491
rss	feed
there are a variety facebook applications however that will add posts from a rss feed however there would be a small delay since it would be polling

2060509
datamapper	activerecord
poeaa patterns that i use regularly usually unconsciously or incidentally as a part of the data access strategy or web framework i m using are activerecord application controller datamapper domain model gateway lazy load layer supertype page controller template view and value object

2060534
post	put
put post require all of the external state

2060534
put	get	post	put	post	get
you can model the basic functionality with post put and get

2060534
put	get
when a widget needs review get it and put it back with the needs-review updated

2060551
google-chrome	firefox
tried with firefox 3.5.7 google-chrome

2060565
versioning	upgrade
many vendor plugins may not work have no 2.x compatible versioning or need to be upgrade

2060569
post	get
then i loop through and run the following query to get all id s and titles of that year months blog post

2060577
thunk	trampolines
the microsoft dllimport extensions and compiler create a static library which does the loading for you and provides trampolines or thunk as others have posted

2060638
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest is easier to call http - get post put delete

2060672
folder	directory
- as far as i m aware if a program tries to save a game to the c program files directory it catches the call redirects the file to another folder meant for such changes...the c users directory as i recall

2060705
int	double
double precision can exactly represent all int up to 2 53

2060705
int	double
because conversions from int to double or multiplication in double are also correctly rounded operations will be the representable value closest to the exact square of i

2060721
stdout	stderr
i m saving the output of a command after redirecting its stdout stderr and passing it through a pipe

2060727
udp	tcp
i had pretty good luck using tcp ip and udp with android and windows java c# respectively

2060743
websphere	ibm
an enhanced ear is an ear with some xml files added to the meta-inf directory to configure specific resources at the application server or cell level see the ibm redbook websphere application server v7 packaging applications for deployment for more details on this

2060743
ant	maven
the files being located under the meta-inf directory embedding them in a standard ear from ant or maven should be pretty straight forward just put them in the meta-inf before packaging

2060743
ant	maven	websphere	ibm
update ibm provides ant tasks for websphere that you could also use from maven using the antrun plugin this seems to be the preferred way but i don t think that wsdefaultbindings is exactly what you re looking for default ibm websphere bindings don t offer the same features than enhanced ear - but they might be useful and enough though

2060814
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
they show up correctly in ie 8 firefox google-chrome opera etc

2060823
postgresql	mysql
i believe sqlyog did this for mysql in win32 but i am now on osx and using postgresql

2060842
post	get
implement the service method to lookup the action associated with the request method get post etc and pathinfo the url part after the servlet s url-pattern

struts	stripes	jsf	stripes
the more decent mvc frameworks takes most of this all into account such as sun jsf apache struts spring mvc stripes etcetera

2060885
bazaar	svn
that makes bazaar behave more like svn in that every commit automatically goes to the server and you can t forget to push

2061002
cvs	svn
the other really nice thing about git is you don t have to set up a damned server like you have to do with svn or cvs

2061007
width	height
and i ve specified the width and height of the boardview in the application s main.xml file

2061007
width	height
i m trying to get the width and height from a function that is called from the boardview s constructor

2061049
put	get
to load this code from a file you may have to file_get_bytes into a string eval that then put in in a variable but you get the point i hope

2061050
hide	show
you may also want to edit your preferences in xcode to always show the build results while the build is going on and only hide the window if there are no errors or warnings

2061087
ant	maven	maven	m2e
ant shouldn t require any seperate download installation but if you are interested in using maven then i d suggest installing the m2e plugin

2061109
maven	pom.xml
this provides nice tools like the pom.xml editor and creating a maven project from within eclipse

2061111
post	put
it is too tough to fully describe batching in this post but i ve put together some really great resources available online at

2061113
put	get
the output csv i get does not put quotes around the field names instead it puts it around the commas

2061113
put	get
how can i get the t to put quotes around all fields

2061119
getter	setter
it is a fair question to ask why would the compiler call the setter on the property when assigning the value to it and not call the getter when using the value of mcinst.foobar afterwards

2061123
cassini	iis
i had visions of complex mail server detection methods but it turns out that i just have an smtp service running that is tied in to iis on my local machine which is why localhost works as the mail server in cassini

inherited	subclassing
implementing a subclassing interface that by design does not implement one or more methods of the inherited base class or interface

2061141
bluetooth	usb
cultured code does syncing over wifi and on their wiki they ve found that you can do the same thing over usb and bluetooth provided the carrier supports tethering cough cough at t cough cough

2061141
bluetooth	usb
so basically as far as i know if you do standard bonjour syncing over a computer-to-computer network it ll work over usb and even bluetooth if the iphone has tethering capabilities

2061145
folder	directory
you can use it by just putting the folder on your path somewhere like where you project s directory is

subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
for example a basic rule is to perform multiplication before addition this is because multiplication and division using floating point numbers does not introduce inaccuracies as great as that of addition and subtraction but can increase the magnitude of inaccuracies introduced by addition and subtraction so it should be done first in many cases

2061270
client-side	server-side
but in this case i d say just use server-side validation as what you have as client-side validation is hitting the server anyway

2061308
cvs	svn
also i d go with a distributed solution so you re not tied down to a server like you would be with cvs or svn

2061319
subtraction	modulo
if x 0x02 and y 0xfe the calculation x-y as an 8-bit result will give the correct answer of 4 assuming that subtraction of two n -bit values wraps modulo 2 n - which c99 guarantees for subtraction of unsigned values

2061393
post	get
i need to control a website that is loaded into a uiwebview like sending post data and using get requests

2061473

however properties inherited from the

2061475
inherited	properties
however properties inherited from the object s prototype will be copied over

2061484
width	height
meaning i give it a set width height and the image is scaled to fit at it s same proportions within that box even if there is whitespace around it

2061526
nsnull	nsstring
when a number in coredata is not set coredata will give you back nsnull - possibly the same goes for nsstring values in coredata too

2061526
nsnull	nsstring
so in both cases you have to be careful when you are using values since the thing you thought was an nsstring or nsnumber object is really nsnull

2061545
width	height
i am currently passing in static values for the popup s height and width corresponding to the height and width of the embedded swf like so

2061545
width	height
window.open popup width 400 height 300 resizable 1

2061546
opera	safari
so if you have safari or opera installed you can test with those

2061637
prepare	execute
you can do this in a stored procedure with prepare and execute or you can do it in application code

2061645
maven	m2e
i ve used this plugin during years and was very happy with it and very unsatisfied at this time by eclipse plugins for maven like m2e

2061645
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is one of the eclipse plugins for maven

2061645
maven	pom.xml
but even if i do not use things like creating a maven project from eclipse or the pom.xml editor or other fancy wizards i have to say that this plugin is now totally usable provides very smooth integration has nice features.

2061707
ssl	https
i got the twitter widget to work over https ssl by doing the following

2061786
post	get
should just have a good interface to the basics like http headers get post values request string creation url encoding decoding sync and async requests.

2061818
fancybox	thickbox
my colleague prefers using showmodaldialog but i prefer using a jquery plug-in such as fancybox facebox or thickbox instead

2061830
jboss	glassfish
but i d simply go for glassfish v3 or jboss 5.2+ which also supports jsf 2.0 + cdi

2061848
for-loop	loops
better is to place it outside of the for-loop but in your case put it in loops

2061857
post	get
if you make your pages such that they will work with or without javascript fall back to using frames or standard get post requests to the server if javascript fails either automatically or via a display as plain html link it will be much easier for search engines to crawl the page

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
including ie firefox google-chrome opera

2061993
put	get
you can also pass arguments into anonymous functions which is something that jquery does quite a bit except it uses call but we won t go there. this is where you get the special things like where you put in a code

this site uses js xml xslt and it works with no errors in google-chrome safari firefox ie8 ie7 when accessed remotely but if i access the site through a vpn i get an error that either a document element is lacking or the xml is not well-formed which it is

2062125
firefox	safari
i am not sure what exactly you need to do but selenium remote control works with firefox ie and safari

2062143
post	get
see denny s post for a start although i don t agree with his use of get and passing json in the querystring for complex params

2062143
post	put
for passing complex objects in json use put or post as the type http method of the request

2062164
children	parent
jonathan and chetan have already given a very good explanation of why this works but to reiterate parent of floated elements are not affected by the height of their floated children

2062172
floating-point	integer
sure the range of most fp number implementations is larger than the range of most integer implementations but i could invent a language tomorrow in which i allow 512-bit integers but only 16-bit floating-point numbers 1 sign bit 3 exponent bits 12 significand bits

2062172
int	boolean
no int are not easier on the processor the processor does fundamental boolean logic operations on bits

2062207
updatepanel	ascx
if you use the asp.net ajax control toolkit you can wrap each ascx in an updatepanel so only that package is saved

2062266
width	height
you need to explicitly set the width and height for the area

2062329
realloc	malloc
you might need a function that reads full lines from a file using malloc and realloc to dynamically allocate the buffer see this for more

2062341
postgresql	mysql
dbs like mysql or postgresql have gis modules that use an r-tree under the hood to quickly retrieve locations within a certain proximity to a point on a map

2062374
bluetooth	usb
the connection between the desktop and the mobile device can be activesync over usb or bluetooth

memcached	apc
ability to store data in some caching mecanism apc memcached files ... in which you can only store strings

2062464
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
edit overall the main different the iphone has more pre-built ui classes uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc. you can use in your app to make it look nice and pretty and most importantly consistent with apple apps

2062466
children	parent
the way it works is that you click a parent node and it uses the jquery .load api to make an ajax call back to the server to see if this node has children

2062466
children	parent
when you click the parent link again it does a .remove to remove the children

2062466
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in safari google-chrome and firefox

2062466
children	parent
in the ie s the code works when expanding parent to show children

2062466
children	parent
but when i click the parent to hide the children again with the .remove it s going into the children and doing a remove of their children rather than itself

2062470
powerpc	i386
the preferred way is to use -arch arch where arch is one of powerpc ppc64 i386 or x86_64

2062470
g++	gcc
the reason for this is gcc essentially says use c rules when driving the tool chain and g++ says use c++ rules when driving the tool chain

2062470
g++	gcc
g++ knows that to create a working executable it needs to pass -lstdc++ to the linker stage whereas gcc obviously doesn t think this is necessary even though it knew to use the c++ compiler at the compile the source code stage because of the .cc file ending

2062470
clang	llvm
clang is a completely new c compiler that also targets the llvm tools as its output allowing for the same kinds of optimizations

2062470
g++	gcc
it s a common compiler driver technique to have commands like gcc and g++ sym-link to the same all-in-one compiler driver executable

2062470
g++	gcc
then at run time the compiler driver checks the path and file name that was used to create the process and dynamically switch rules based on whether that file name ends with gcc or g++ or equivalent

2062500
gif	png
the difference between gif and png actually comes from traditional conventions -- gif was traditionally saved as 8-bit whereas png which came later was often saved as 32-bit true color + alpha transparency

2062500
gif	png
hence if you were to compare a 8-bit png to a 8-bit gif the file sizes should be very similar

2062500
gif	png
the same applies with true color png vs true color gif

2062504
folder	directory
literally all i did was move the directory into my folder structure and try an import

2062517
hide	show
put some manager field as a placeholder at button position then add a focuschangelistener to label and use add delete field on focuschanged to show hide button

2062570
yourkit	jprofiler
you may use jprofiler or yourkit profilers for this

2062583
folder	directory
and put the dll under bin folder of the root of sharepoint virtual directory

2062617
src	attr
jquery argues that the src value is not equal to foo.jpg when you pass it in as part of the selector but it is equal to the string literal when you compare from a call to attr

2062623
for-loop	loops
audit login sql batchstarting rpc starting and audit logout for each loops in for-loop below

2062641
gdi	direct2d
the other way to go is to use direct2d which can be faster yet than gdi if you have the right hardware

2062725
equals	gethashcode
you should use gethashcode to rule out equality and then use equals to check the actual equality of any potentially equals values

2062725
profiling	benchmarking
now your question mentions speed - this sounds like the perfect place to use a profiling and some benchmarking tests

2062741
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the nice thing about all this is that uiview and uiviewcontroller and their subclasses all implement these as well so for instance if you encode a uinavigationcontroller you will automatically have all of the view controllers that exist on the navigation stack encoded for free as well which should get you what you need if you implement the nscoding methods in your own classes as well

2062756
directx	gdi
you won t be able to squeeze much more speed out of that code without losing quality or changing to a faster renderer gdi opengl directx

2062756
directx	gdi
but gdi will often be quite a bit faster maybe 2x and directx opengl can be much faster maybe 10x depending on what you re drawing

2062781
put	get
now what happen is if user a send request to download asset to approver and approver approves it this will update respective item in asset list and put a download url in download link column but if user b get look for the same record in asset list the download link will be visible to this user too which is wrong

2062813
wordpress	joomla
drupal and joomla and wordpress are all content management php based

if you re using a 64bit version of windows 7 make sure to compile your application for x86

2062820
stdout	stderr
try open4 which allows you to open stdin stdout stderr to an arbitrary command

2062874
min	max
instead of defining a bounding box with 4 coordinates min and max latitude min and max longitude you can define it with the coordinates of the north-west corner of the box and two parameters resolution and slice

2062874
width	height
the slice is the width and height of the box using the least significant figure as its unit

2062876
post	get
you need to get all parameters from get or post and insert it to the db

factors	mean
so there are many factors that will skew the src code cc to the byte code cc but this doesn t mean that improving the cc is not a valuable job cc evaluation of src code is vital to maintainable clean code

2063257
gentoo	linux
i tested the cable and the pump under linux a gentoo derivative where it worked perfectly albeit as root

2063278
post	get
running this as a pre post build event in your project will get you the information you need and some additional information

2063281
gif	png
the icon file itself would preferably be 16x16 pixels and in gif format ie6 wont use transparent png and under 500 bytes

2063281
put	get
most browsers check that path by default but if you like me put your favicon in a directory like images favicon.ico you would need to tell the browser to get it from there or your server will build up alot of 404-not found errors in its log

2063322
jobs	cron
however all my other cron jobs have been and are running with -q and have been sending me output emails.

2063354

min	max
for example i need only 15 digits in all queries that return decimals and don t want to manually cast every sum min max operator to decimal 10 5 .

2063463
inherited	properties
if the opacity of all other elements in the page are changed and if the #basket div is inside any other element then this div will also get the opacity properties inherited from the parent

2063463
width	height
it would be better to place another div with page height and width and then put the stacking index of the #basket div to a higher value

2063534
nltk	lingpipe
the ususal nlp libraries like open nlp lingpipe nltk gate uima

2063535

update mkreversegeocoder class is deprecated in ios 5 you should use clgeocoder class from core location framework instead

2063733
put	get
get the total number of pictures you can do that dynamically and then put everything in a for-loop as follows

2063742
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera as well however the loaded content will still be there the page will look like it did before i navigated away from it

2063766
subtract	add
basically you add or subtract 360 each time you go outside 0 360 where i m using a for an open range

2063816
folder	directory
the t4 templates in that directory need to read from any centeral file in the website project root folder

2063846
folder	directory
i recently noticed that if your app has no files which would be copied into the resources folder the current working directory is set to be that of the actual .app - eg at the level of myapp.app

2063860
hide	show
you might want to try using a tool like firefox s web developer plugin which would let you show hide various parts of the page

2063897
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the limit is in msie and safari about 2kb in opera about 4kb and in firefox about 8kb

2063913
getter	setter
1 3 in general it is practice that a setter and a getter use the same data structure

2063913
getter	setter
thus the setter and the getter seem to be incompatible

2064008
union	distinct
use the union and distinct operators

2064018
folder	directory
for example create a folder called media within your app and then require users installing your app to either add a symbolic link from their media directory or copy the whole thing

in fact no mouse or keyboard events fire for option elements

2064128
google-chrome	safari
edit - the same is true of google-chrome and most likely safari too

2064170
gmail	hotmail
think hotmail folders vs gmail tags

2064250
cvs	svn	tortoisegit	svn
in my nature is that i need to know what means cvs svn tortoisegit github and what are the differences but i struggle to find some dead simple kick-start into world of version control

2064271
children	parent
but i would like to have the children comment inside the same dom element of the parent comment

2064281
post	get
using curl for example i can post data in a get request

2064298
height	border-box
i am seeing similar issues when defining the height of a cell and it certainly appears that table s use the border-box model rather than content-box

2064298
width	margin
for example if you were to set width 100 and a border or margin then you are going to have scrolling issues assuming your table takes up the whole window

2064321
ant	maven
my boss asked me to fix this project so that it could be built with maven instead of ant

jstl	taglib
jsp is supposed to be used as a template in which you can control the page flow dynamically using taglib such as jstl and access the backend data using expression language

2064368
cvs	svn
1 centralized you store your code in a server although this may be your local machine cvs svn

2064371
onresume	onpause
step #2 have the activities call into the service during onpause and onresume

2064450
cvs	svn
svn cvs etc

2064466
jobs	cron
you ll have to set 3 diff cron jobs

2064500
portrait	landscape
there should be no real difference between landscape and portrait orientations when it comes to rendering performance

2064505
put	get
or to put it another way if you change something or more importantly accidentally delete something or do something really stupid and you get the ball clenching feeling that you ve just lost hours of relatively unrelated work that could have been committed and saved then you re not committing often enough

2064517
folder	directory
apparently there are hidden folder called .svn spread around in the working directory which i kind of knew about which contains among other things very crucial empty directory which i didn t know about

2064528
autocomplete	autosuggest
please not that certain browser such as firefox have the build in autosuggest feature that sometimes will interfere the autocomplete from plugins

2064551
google-chrome	firefox
..appears with question marks instead of the offending characters in both firefox and google-chrome

2064572
put	get
put your logic here to get the product list

2064593
free	malloc
support malloc and free

2064629
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
i ve used sourcesafe clearcase cvs svn sccs rcs and git in development and for me the tool that got me using version control on a regular basis in hobby programming was git

2064659
webkit	gecko
as javascript is really fast in webkit and gecko and still relatively fast in ie no-one will ever notice the difference

2064661
mp3	wav
try converting to a different format such as wav or mp3 then play again

2064670
versioning	upgrade
the discussion focuses on how the function can be used to upgrade versioning of custom tables but it s probably used for the upgrade of wordpress itself

2064683
phpmyadmin	heidisql
i m using heidisql to manage my databases at work i prefer this over phpmyadmin

2064685
jsf	seam
if you are that interested in jsf i recommend looking into the seam framework which utilizes jsf but also somewhat simplifies its use

2064712
for-loop	loops
the main subtlety which catches people is that in non-pure languages closures close over variable bindings rather than values which means that things like variable scoping are very important and this is where unexpected difficulties arise in the for-loop examples since the scope of loops variable is not always what people expect

2064718
x86	64bit
if the build configuration is x86 we want to copy the 32bit version and with x64 the 64bit

2064728
put	get
you haven t put any value to the showlist that s why you get nullpointerexception

crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
however when i using the php crypt function specifically the crypt_md5 and it is on i ve checked with a salt the supposed md5 hash it returns does not look like an md5 hash

2064855
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
md5 calculates a hash whereas crypt performs encryption - albeit using an md5 flavour

2064855
hash	md5
my guess is that the md5 hash rfc probably defines the result to use a-z a-z 0-9 whereas encryption has no such limitation

2064858
hash	md5
it is a md5 hash just not properly formatted as a string

2064945
redmine	trac
even if we could run a trac or redmine server here thanks turnkey i m not sure it would be much quicker as our internet connection is over-stretched as it is

2064945
pull	push
what i would like is for developers to be able to be able to push pull to from a remote repository servicing engineers to be able to pull from a remote repository and for customers both internal and external to be able to submit bug issue reports

scaling by the width and height gives the distance needed to inflate the rect to make sure it s fully covered

2065742
post	put
post and put seem like a pair as well

2065742
post	put
consequently i think both post and put should return the resulting object as created

2065742
post	put
but often the whole point of the web service is to do some value-adding calculation as part of post and possibly put

2065803
folder	directory
the problem you will encounter will be with large directory containing 65536 or more folder

2065831

2065915
google-chrome	firefox
regular desktop browsers work with all of the above including firefox ie google-chrome

2065917

to draw a trail i set a uiview trailview as mkmapview subviews with background color clear

2066276
stdout	stderr
this means you don t need to start two threads one to read stdout one to read stderr just to keep the process from blocking.

2066294
debian	linux
irb history works in debian linux out of the box

2066330
stdout	fflush
2 the i o to an output stream is probably buffered which means that if the subprocess writes some information to stdout without explicitly calling fflush which is almost always the case you might not see the output

2066423
rss	feed
i m using pyrss2gen to generate an rss feed

2066423
rss	feed
i ve succeeded in extending it to add an extra element to each item in the rss feed

2066436
width	text-align	width	margin	margin	text-align
for centering horizontally you can use text-align center on inline elements or margin 0 auto with a set width on containers and block level elements

2066438
inherited	properties
use hasownproperty to differentiate between your own properties and those you inherited from the object constructor which may have been extended

2066440
chunked	transfer-encoding
i suspect that this has something to do with the several requests recorded by firefox and the transfer-encoding chunked header i am seeing in live http headers

2066497
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead of an foreach loops

2066533
google-chrome	firefox
this actually does work in firefox and google-chrome and ie8 so long as your script block is not inside the broken element

2066588
vim	emacs
i m a long time vim user though so emacs is not an issue to me

2066613
rss	feed
i m currently working on an asp.net website where i want to retrieve data from an rss feed

2066622
hide	show
a thin resize bar with the small middle arrow icon which is clicked to hide show a docked panel on the side of the page

2066646
fflush	gets
but you ll have to come up with a way to fflush it when you change data or have it have a timeout so that it gets get d occasionally

2066721
post	get
the progress docs spill plenty of ink on soap but i m having trouble finding the example for a simple http get post with progress abl

2066786
put	get
i m wondering why when you put a system.diagnostics.conditional debug attribute on the a virtual method in a base class that you don t get compiler errors on derived classes that override that same virtual method but don t have the conditional attribute when the condition isn t met

2066803
implements	extends
extends basicfoo to specialbasicfoo and have it implements iqualifyforspecialtreatment

2066809
google-chrome	firefox
now this works as expected in firefox and google-chrome but ie has the icon showing in the top left hand corner

2066819
udp	tcp
what i ended up using was a tool called socketsniffer that peeks at winsock s calls and monitor tcp udp socket connections

2066831
rss	feed
if it s not returning from the rss feed formatted as you wish you have little other choice

2066952
disk	ram
by caching this in ram instead of writing it immediately back to disk you can limit your io to purely reading the input file and help things go much faster

2066957
inherited	properties
for example the below class inherited from a list and adds a new properties which will not be serialized by the xmlserializer since arrays consist only of elements and not additional properties

2066983
getter	setter
one huge advantage of getter setter is that you can put debug code in the functions to keep track of when values are changed and accessed when testing

2066989
int	chars
this includes any primitives such as int chars etc that may be inherited over

2067008
super	extends
the word super implies that the class being inherited from is larger but it is the other way around the inheriting class extends the class it inherits from

2067068
getter	setter
also when you use getter and setter you have control on the data if you need to you can format both input and ouput

2067087
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
because inherited breaks encapsulation subclassing that implement equals and hashcode must necessarily account for the peculiarities of their superclass

2067096
int	chars
in a 32 bit word aligned byte addressable operating system how is accessing a chars or short different from accessing an int or float

2067125
int	boolean
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

2067183
getter	setter
i use propel because among other things i like the fact that everything has its own concrete getter setter method

2067183
getter	setter
the reason i like having getter setter is that i can put all kinds of logic in them if i need to

2067197
superclass	subclassing
consider a superclass that checks for field x and y and subclassing checks for x y and z

2067197
superclass	subclassing
so a subclassing superclass subclassing where z is different between the first instance of subclassing and the second violating the transitive part of the contract

2067197
superclass	subclassing
in the above example if subclassing or superclass does an instanceof check it would break symmetry

2067224
do.call	lapply
once you have decided what to do with the multiple authors issue then it s fairly straight forward to turn your book list into a data frame with the ldply function in plyr or just use lapply and convert the return value into a data.frame by using do.call rbind ...

2067260
cpu	processors
it is managed by the processors and provides a way to ensure that data needed by the cpu is close at hand so that it does not have to wait for the bus to fetch it

2067319
idictionary	ilist
contains an array of objects that nhibernate insists must be the interface type idictionary iset or ilist

2067321

the core of it is just a struct and two typedef s

2067336
accessor	properties
i am using eclipse s built-in externalize strings wizard to extract string constants in my classes to a properties file and replace those strings with calls to a static accessor

2067340
ssd	sata
use fast disks performance wise ssd fc sata

2067362
width	height
this happens because you calculate the width and height from the first .zitem you find

2067362
width	height
when the first item is hidden due to the filtering its display is set to none so its width and height become 0

2067362
width	height
you will need to read the first visible .zitem when reading the height width like this

2067371
awt	swing
i recommend reading painting in awt and swing if you haven t

2067401
children	parent
children should not examine the private members of their parent

2067409
portrait	landscape
under my res folder i have drawable-land and drawable-port to hold landscape portrait variations then i use r.drawable.myimagename for the imageview s source and android does the right thing - yay

2067430
children	parent
if there s a following sibling that s not a bullettext element we want our list to be all of the children of the current element s parent starting at the current element and ending before the stop element

2067444
google-chrome	safari
however in safari and google-chrome 3 the handlers are never called when i press the middle mouse button

2067444
google-chrome	firefox
the middle mouse down event comes through on ie firefox and google-chrome 4 just fine

2067444
google-chrome	safari
or perhaps i need to wait until safari fixes the issue like google did with google-chrome

2067474
int	chars
convert those int to actual chars only when needed after the increment

2067504
integer	unsigned
what you want to do is view your key as an unsigned integer and view the string that you re handing out as a base 36 a-z + 0-9 representation of that key

2067545
width	height
when i set a column s width or a row s height to star and i fill in content that is bigger than the available rectangle the row keeps on growing underground

2067599
submit	submission
currently i have a custom user control and within it is a little form and a modal popup extender the idea is for the user control to be loaded dynamically in the parent page and displayed so the user can fill out the form and submit it and all the submission code be handled on the user control

2067625
post	get
i would like to intercept all the incoming requests - get or post and perform some task

2067626
post	get
this would be a topic for a long blog post but here is a brief example that you can use to experiment with this using tuple from .net 4.0 if you re using vs 2008 you can get c# implementation here in chapter03 functionalcsharp

2067672
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo just like xhtml xslt svg and other public standards may not be perfect and may not have all the traditional technologies and file formats have

2067720
versioning	upgrade
i build my own versioning because i don t want to be forced to upgrade all the dependencies of fluent when i just want to upgrade fluentnhibernate

2067721
stdout	stderr
if you choose this route and consume stdout stderr separately note that when you consume the output stdout you need to consume stderr as well and concurrently otherwise buffers will block and your spawned process waiting for your process to consume this

2067756
filesystems	ntfs
this works best on filesystems that behave like unix ones but should work on ntfs

2067784
extjs	smartgwt
except some advanced components like extjs gwt and smartgwt ee

2067803
haskell	ocaml
functional languages like ocaml and haskell actually use closures implicitly all over the place

2067808
int	double
here you can see we match either an int and then lookahead if we find a double period then we know that the int is really an int and not a real

2067852
stdout	stderr
p subprocess.popen cmd stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout stdin subprocess.pipe

2067852
stdout	stderr
p subprocess.popen cmd stdout subprocess.pipe stderr subprocess.stdout stdin subprocess.pipe

i need a way to get keydown and keyup events quickly without a gui

2067920
gif	png
i just wondered if it would be possible to create a small simple jpg png gif with a given text in powershell

2067958
interpreted-language	compiled-language
while you can certainly write scripts in those languages each is a proper programming language referred to as a dynamic or interpreted-language in contrast to compiled-language like c or c++

2067981
installation	upgrade
i have an existing bugzilla installation that i m trying to upgrade via cvs as per the instructions found here

2068023
children	parent
specify in the parent pom the directories of its modules children

2068065
httphandler	httpmodule
it s much better to use an httpmodule so that you can intercept requests for all pages and make sure users are authorized even before the httphandler has a chance to run

2068078
keydown	keyup
you can use getkeystate or getasynckeystate but that won t give you keydown keyup events

2068078
keydown	keyup
so if you really need to get the keydown keyup events you could install a hook

2068200
google-chrome	firefox
something along the lines of greasemonkey for ie firefox and google-chrome would be nice

2068212
mouse	keyboard
processing mouse keyboard input on msdn

2068226
equals	gethashcode
i m concerned about the list while trying to implement the equals and gethashcode methods

2068253
equals	gethashcode
nope equals will just do a reference comparison and gethashcode will return the standard code allocated per object

2068278
equals	gethashcode
define some kind of key class and override it s equals and gethashcode methods

2068335
hide	show
it has a lightbox show hide login menu and a slider is easy slider 1.5

2068337
button	checkbox
add a button to the window hook up a click handler to the button and in that click handler toggle flag -- i made those modifications to your original code and removed the sleep loop clicking on the button toggles the checkbox s state in the fashion you seem to desire

2068353
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
on ie6-8 ff1.5-3.5 google-chrome 2-3 safari 4 and opera 9-10 these headers caused the page to be requested from the server when you click on a link to the page or put the url directly in the address bar

2068382
move	drag
so i intend to use the svn move command or right click and drag the folder

2068386

post	put
the difference concerns redirecting post put and delete requests and what the expectations of the server are for the user agent behavior rfc 2616

2068503
hide	show
hey everyone i am trying to hide show different html elements div etc... based on whether a checkbox is checked or if a specific value is chosen from a dropdown box

2068504
post	get
307 came about because user agents adopted as a de facto behaviour to take post requests that receive a 302 response and send a get request to the location response header

2068504
post	get
only a 303 should cause a post to turn into a get

2068529
hide	show
assuming you want to show hide a with

2068538
mockups	balsamiq
to mitigate this i ve been playing with balsamiq mockups

2068544
innodb	myisam
if you are indeed just running innodb you can comment out or remove the myisam settings as you try each to save resources

2068554
post	get
there is a similiar post on this site to what you are trying to get at

2068556
children	parent
if you have a bunch of related processes that is a parent and a bunch of children and they should share a queue then you should call msgget with ipc_private which will create a queue with an unused key and return the handle to it

2068563
entities	entitymanager
this approach will improve maintenance of both the existing manager code and the messaging code you intend to write and will pay off hugely if you ever need to write new entitymanager what store your entities in jcr or tranmit them via web services etc

2068579
int	double
if your vector elements are double instead of int you can do something similar as the sign bit is in the same place you just have to convert to int do the mask and convert back

2068601
width	height
setting its height and width manually work fine but i d like it to scale to the remaining width of the statusbar

2068606
google-chrome	firefox

2068624
filtering	grouping
where in your code example is trying to be applied to filtering the results from article that will eventually be grouping to build things like tags

2068681
yacc	bison
the way that precedence works to resolve shift reduce conflicts in yacc bison is that it compares the precedence of the rule to be reduced with the precedence of the token to be shifted

2068690
ant	maven
if you are not tied to using ant and are prepared to use maven then it is simply a matter of setting up maven with the eclipse plugin which generates the eclipse projects for you

2068737
post	get
mvc will automatically match by name query parameters for get or form input files for post to the action parameters by name

2068755

2068981
int	boolean
this can be done with bitmap.createscaledbitmap bitmap src int dstwidth int dstheight boolean filter

2069008
folder	directory
however assuming you cannot do that place all of the assemblies that you need to reference from the web project into a folder somewhere lib web and add a pre-build event to your web project that copies the content of that folder into the bin folder of the web directory

2069018
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the resulting string contents includes line breaks - that is between one and two there s character code 10

when you take the object out of the collection you get the integer that you put in

2069101
udp	tcp
testing tcp and udp socket servers using c# and .net

2069371
bluetooth	usb
ethernet would be nice hmm maybe also wifi usb and bluetooth if they don t add too much to the cost

2069412
bluetooth	usb
wireless usb and bluetooth i rarely see though some have support for zigbee

2069441
serializable	deserialization
you will probably find that easier than using windows messages because it will handle the serializable and deserialization of the data for you -- but i realise this may not be an option for you or that you may have already ruled it out

2069451
int	chars
change chars c to int c

2069461
qlist	qvector
reversing a qlist is going to be o n however you do it since qlist isn t guaranteed to have its data stored contiguously in memory unlike qvector

2069952
addition	multiplication
mathematically speaking multiplication distributes over addition

2069952
subtraction	addition
any real number in your case 7 can be presented as a series of additions such as 8 + -1 since subtraction is really just addition going the wrong way

int	chars	int	double
if you have a set of int or double that terminate with a known value then you can use a technique to walk through that sequence similar to walking though the chars in a string until you hit 0

2070122
rss	feed
i ve faced the realization that an upgrade to asp.net is the best way to go to implement features that are just too hard in asp for the hobbyist consuming rss feed authentication and user profiles but which i m keen to get stuck into once i get past the redesign upgrade

appkit	nsimage
nsimage is not available on the iphone since it is part of the appkit framework in cocoa

2070218
hide	show
so that it can be show or hide this way

2070274
int	chars	int	double
looping through a chars array checking for 0 works because c-style strings have a convention that int double and most other types don t have null-termination

2070274
int	double
since int and double arrays do not have this convention you must use something else

2070274
int	double
replace double with int or almost any other type and everything here works the same

2070908
vmware	virtualbox
i looked vmware website and virtualbox and they dont have binaries to mac osx

2070915
post	get
2 my workaround is to create a temporary resource via post first and use the uri of this resource as parameter in the actual get request

2070939
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox certainly do have os x binaries

2070939
vmware	virtualbox
it s the second link in the list on the virtualbox downloads page and should come up on the vmware fusion demo download

put	get
the outlets maybe actions i still get those confused leave the curly brackets open to put your own code in

2071138
stdout	stderr
a bit ugly but if you just want to get it up and running as fast as possible you could redirect stdout and stderr to dev null which should make it a bit faster as it won t be writing to disk or console

2071143
width	height
you may need to specify a height and width for the td via css to avoid a moving effect

2071150
outputstream	inputstream
that url can in this particular case just point to a servlet which gets an inputstream of the image from some datasource from local disk file system using fileinputstream or from the db using resultset#getbinarystream and writes it to the outputstream of the response the usual java io way

2071155
portrait	landscape
however for input fields it s better to provide a landscape mode because some phones have a hardware keyboard which automatically aligns the phone in landscape and therefor makes it hard to look at the app that is still in portrait mode

2071376
public	protected
i believe you should try to structure your code in meaningfull classes and use the standard access modifiers private protected public internal

2071387
cassini	iis
this is easier with a local instance of iis than cassini though because cassini doesn t seem to do quite as good a job at detecting changes and forcing restarts

2072746
getter	setter
the easy way of using javabeans was to use naming conventions to define the attributes of a bean--hence getter and setter

2072746
getter	setter
so the getter and setter made it easy for the ui software to discover user-viewable or editable attributes

2072752

the work performed is a set of alternating calls to toupper and tolower on a string

2072790
hex	binary
converting binary into hex without ignoring leading zeros

2073188
tostring	getter
but as usual there are excemptions from my advice - what do you expect from the tostring method if you allow overriding of the getter methods do you want it use the classes fields or the result of the - maybe override - getter method

2073190
tostring	getter
using getter in tostring is an overkill

2073248
firefox	safari
i ve tested it in firefox ie and safari

2073291
getter	setter
if your class has getter and setter for fields you should be consistent throughout the implementation of that class in whether you use getter and setter or access the fields directly

2073291
getter	setter
in terms of performance it shouldn t matter - your trivial getter and setter should be final methods anyway so they should be inlined anyway

2073293
width	height
in php the getimagesize filename function will give you the height and width of an image

2073293
width	height
all you have to do is give the function the image s filename and it will return an array with the height width and image type

2073308
width	height
i have an image + text in a column.when i chaange the width of the column the row height of grid panel is changing.i think it is because of the image because when i change the width of the other columns which dont have image in it row height doesnt chage.how can i prevent this from happening.however this issue is not seen in firefox

agree with jherico s answer - the maven ant tasks

2073512
ant	maven
refer this why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

2073517
width	height
but if they have width in px the height will be identical

2073854
fast-forward	merge
another possibility is that their revision is simply a descendent of yours in which case you will by default have a fast-forward merge in which your head is just updated to their commit with no merging happening this can be disabled if you really want to record a merge using --no-ff

2073858
put	get
i personally have nothing against default_scope but it can get messy and in the few times that i have used it i ve always had to either go back and remove it or put in ugly with_exclusive_scope helper methods in my model to explicitly get around it

2073879
onchange	onfocus
you will obviously not want to call logusage on the onchange method in a textbox etc but probably all onfocus clicks or whatever you are really wanting to keep track of

implement icomparable equals method if you need to

2074010
hide	show
i want to switch the show class to a hide class depending on the clicked link

a chars is a form of int in c

2074052
int	chars
you re actually assigning a chars sort of int to an array which resolves to a simple pointer

width	height	width	margin	margin	height
as for the margin yeah that along with setting width and height are standard ways of setting spacing

2074148
boost	stl
this one illustrates the old smart pointers from the stl and the new ones from boost -- in adequate detail

2074200
int	chars
as others already noted in one case you are attempting to return cstring which is a value in this context - a pointer from a function that is declared to return a chars which is an int

2074306
google-chrome	firefox
can t comment on google-chrome but mozilla is releasing firefox 3.6 now without web sockets and it s not a feature likely to be included in minor releases 3.6.x so the earliest release it is likely to ship in is the next major release assuming the implementation is finished soon

2074319
post	get
the straightforward option is just a regular form post even if it is to the url voteup id and i m not sure why you can t do that or even the get you mentioned

2074339
accessor	properties
in your overallrating set accessor you re parsing the current value of the underlying integer variable instead of the value being passed to the properties

2074346
migrate	upgrade
unfortunately with the table in production migrating it across to this technique will take some t-sql coding knowledge and a weekend to upgrade migrate it

2074347
opera	firefox
this works great in firefox ie and opera

2074347
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome safari it gives the input focus but fails to actually put the cursor inside the input i know it gives it focus because the safari google-chrome focus borders appear

2074364
post	get
if that improves things at all enable intellisense but doesn t solve it please post any new errors you get

2074389
maven	pom.xml
so i created a pom.xml file and now maven builds the project fine and runs all the tests and everything

2074396
for-loop	loops
to create the for-loop it says create a for-loop that loops through each of the objects in the phrases collection

2074433
pop-up	dialog
there shouldn t be any issues if you are binding elements from your pop-up dialog to corresponding hidden elements in your main view

2074464
jboss	glassfish
i m currently migrating a spring application from the jboss j2ee container to sun s glassfish j2ee container and although it is the same code i am getting a confusing error during a specific point in my application

2074614
ubuntu	linux
the linked article describes how to install those in a ubuntu linux environment

2074614
gif	png
the best-known pdf generation library fpdf can do this but for jpeg png and gif only

2074703
uitableview	reloaddata
i want to do a reloaddata on a uitableview and after the table refresh is done i want a delegate method to be called when i can know that the refresh is done

2074740
post	put
i will put the whole method and accompanying function at the bottom for reference but first i d like to post the portion i think is where i need to focus on

2074793
datamapper	activerecord
it relies on the datamapper pattern instead of activerecord and uses an entity manager to handle persistence logic

2074795
rss	feed
i had this code that i wrote last year and it returns rss feed for some term i enter

2074795
rss	feed
the user enters a term and i want to display the rss feed from yahoo google or nytimes

2074800
regasm	tlbimp
being c# i ran tsuserex through tlbimp and created tsuserexlib.dll then registered it with regasm

2074806
uploadify	swfupload
an alternative to uploadify is swfupload

2074890
globalization	localization
so you can think of globalization as a strategic venue where as localization is tactical

2074969
ironruby	ironpython
i know ironruby ironpython are supported

2074976
getter	setter
usually it won t make a big difference and i settled on just accessing the variable directly from inside the class with the exception of getter and setter which do something beyond just getting or setting the value

2074983
queue	fifo
queue is fifo fifo

2074987
internationalization	globalization
read up on asp.net internationalization globalization features

2074989
put	get
use a queue when you want to get things out in the order that you put them in

2074989
put	get
use a stack when you want to get things out in the reverse order than you put them in

2074989
put	get
use a list when you want to get anything out regardless of when you put them in and when you don t want them to automatically be removed

2075008
punctuation	words
and my readpunctwords readnumwords and readcapwords are quite the same just checking if the words has digits or capital letters instead of punctuation like in here

2075024
accessor	ivar
in that case i sometimes access some private ivars through objective-c private accessor which usually check if the ivar is nil null and will load the data back in memory in a lazy loading ad-hoc way

2075029
queue	fifo
fifo for queue filo for stacks

2075045
subtract	add
this way is preferred to the multiple join against same table method as you can simply modify the in clause and the count without needing to add or subtract more tables to the query when your list of ids changes

2075051
for-loop	loops
the idiomatic way to write this loops would be as a for-loop

2075060
interpolation	splines
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

2075065
jsf	jspx
aside from the fact that you need to set the proper doctype and content type so that the browser knows what to do with the page you also should get rid of the old fashioned jspx format and use xhtml format to get the most benefit of java ee 6-shipped jsf 2.0 and facelets

2075085
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfect in ie but refuses to work in any other browser like firefox or google-chrome

2075114
queue	fifo
the stack lifo - last in first out and a queue fifo - fifo establish and order in which your elements are inserted and removed from a collection

2075129
draggable	droppable
your mileage may vary but what i did was add logic to my drag event handler that would check to see if the grid was being scrolled which is when i needed to force the droppable positions to be refreshed and if so i set refreshpositions to true on the draggable

2075129
move	drag
this doesn t immediately refresh the positions but it will cause them to refresh the next time the drag handle move

2075165
public	protected
while sensitive data is protected via user authentication the unprotected data is hardly public but as far as i can tell is totally open for public consumption

2075189
temp	tmp
the error you are seeing is likely indicating that you ran our of space in the tmp directory which is where mysql puts its temp tables by default which can cause that error

2075196
for-loop	arrays
the arrays are loaded once then accessed as many times as you want in this case i was using the for-loop that steve wortham posted as a test

2075264
inline-functions	inlining
these are good candidates for inlining whether it be as #define macros or inline-functions

2075285
min	max
take the min max of all the x y coordinates and construct a rectangle xmin ymin xmax ymin xmax ymax xmin ymax

2075376
instances	transient
in order to temporarily fix this to clean up our logs i want to intercept calls to add objects to the http session so that the class of the object being added and any objects in its object graph have their instances variable declarations changed to transient

2075385
put	get
but you don t get to put an exception handler around the wpf binding code

2075431
hide	show
use hide if you want to show the window later on

2075441
cvs	svn
my goal was to have a directory with my svn version controlled project that pointed to someone else s cvs project

2075441
cvs	svn
trouble is this isn t all too sensible and the team api wouldn t recognize that there was a cvs folder within an svn folder

2075441
cvs	svn
so i ve looked at having a project point at both a cvs and an svn repository without success

2075474
gif	png
if by flash images you mean jpg png and gif files then you use any of the standard server side software packages or language specific libraries that utilize these packages

2075526
sorting	grouping
sorting priority type name type grouping unit value

2075628
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
it gives you a chance to clean up whatever you ve been doing in touchesbegan and touchesmoved

2075633
spaces	delimiter
the second way allows you to easily change the delimiter tab spaces newlines whatever to suit your needs easily

2075676
wtl	atl
that said the usefulness of c# has made me a believer in using it for anything that either needs to be done quickly or needs a user interface because fiddling around with mfc wtl atl or com totally sucks

2075735
width	height
using yui 2 on page load i found all elements of that given classname that were either set to display none or whose height and width was 0 that s one way of measuring whether an element exists or a parent is set to display none

2075762
simplecursoradapter	spinner
the spinner is tied to a simplecursoradapter

2075782
memcached	apc
you could use apc or memcached to implement caching or various other ways to improve performance

2075783
solaris	bsd
for what it s worth there are extensions to plain old bsd sockets in some unixy systems too like the stuff in solaris and other systems

2075797
hbase	hypertable
-- but if there is a project based on hbase hypertable scalability probably won t be an issue imo

2075805
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m looking for a way to get text-shadow that looks like css3 text-shadow but that works with ie firefox opera safari etc.

2075823
hex	binary
that s binary 00010000 hex 0x10

2075906
restrict	shared
you can adapt this code to restrict the lists to be of a specific type and you can adapt it further so you can join lists which shared a common base type

2075976
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems that the sliding effect works when i run it it firefox but not google-chrome or safari

2075998
children	parent
side note the tables for the assets themselves they are hierarchal are normalized with foreign key references pointing from child to parent tier 3 contains info about tier 2 etc so once a single asset is pinned down it is very simple to locate its children and ancestors

2076004
outputstream	inputstream
i d probably just implement one or more subclasses of inputstream and or outputstream and code them up to mutate my data stream in various ways

2076004
udp	tcp
mutating the packets at different tcp udp layers using some sort of fancy tools is probably possible but kind of wanders away from the math you re really supposed to be concentrating on in a math class

2076021
put	get
you should read the core audio programming guide as well to get a sense of how the audio system is put together

2076025
calloc	malloc
you can use calloc instead of malloc to allocate memory that is already initialised

2076025
calloc	malloc
in c there is no need to cast the return value of malloc or calloc

2076025
calloc	malloc
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

2076043
fseek	ftell
in fact the return value of ftell for streams opened in text mode is useful only in calls to fseek and not to determine file size

2076095
webkit	gecko
gecko webkit and mshtml are huge codebases

2076098
onclick	onchange
that won t stop people from pasting things in with their mouse so an onchange and onclick are probably desirable too

2076098
onchange	onkeyup	onclick	onkeyup	onclick	onchange
if you re using straight js i d recommend not using straight js either use element.addeventlistener or onkeyup onchange and onclick

2076173
textmate	gedit
there are gedit plugins that get you very close to textmate - in fact i like gedit better

2076187
dlsym	dlopen
then main creates an instance of plugin_loader which actually does the dlopen dlsym and creates an instance of refptr passing create_instance to it

2076196
post	get
assuming you re sending the content via post rather than as part of the querystring in get there s no universal limit

2076260
post	get
scenario - 1 query to get 10 post and then 10 queries to get each

2076261
free	malloc
don t mix malloc free with new delete

2076281
listview	gridview
gridview listview

2076344
post	get
i would post sample code but i think that would be pointless as all the different samples have given me different errors etc here s the list of errors that we get

2076355
width	height
you need to specify the original width and height

2076355
width	height
you could try this with jquery if you don t have the width and height up front but your mileage may vary

2076392
stdout	fflush
if i understood you correctly you need to add fflush stdout

2076438
mouseup	mousedown
define mouseup and mousedown event handlers for the picturebox

2076438
mouseup	mousedown
define a boolean variable in form scope that is set to true when the mouse goes down in the mousedown event handler on the picturebox and false in the mouseup handler for the picturebox

2076461
int	chars
the c# spec states in section 5.5 that reads and writes on certain types namely bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types are guaranteed to be atomic

2076470
post	get
use post.author.get_value_for_datastore post to collect the author keys see the link above and then do a batch get to get them all - the trouble here is that we need to re-construct a template data object.

2076487
median	minimum
another approach that might work is splitting the graph up into 200 point bins and discard all but the maximum minimum and median points in each interval

2076488
opml	feed
i have a huge 5 000+ feed opml file which freezes and crashes my browser when i try uploading it to my google reader account using the following instructions

2076503
imagemagick	magick++
check out the magick++ api to imagemagick

2076572
free	malloc
you never want to use sbrk instead of malloc or free

2076572
free	malloc
finally malloc and free are not cumbersome - they are the standard way to allocate and release memory in c

2076572
free	malloc
even if you want to implement your own memory allocator it s best to just use malloc and free as the basis - a common approach is to allocate a large chunk at a time with malloc and provide memory allocation from it this is what suballocators or pools usually implement

2076575
struts	stripes
stripes programming model is more like a tuned struts - somewhat awkward

2076578
addition	multiplication
this however does not mean that operations like addition and multiplication are atomic

2076639
for-loop	loops
if you do a single query before the for-loop and then loops over the resultset and the svn part you will see a dramatic increase in speed

2076655
post	get
load is specifically for fetching via get unless parameters are provided then post is used an html page and directly inserting it into the selected nodes those selected by the portion of

2076655
post	get
is a more general method that allows you to make get and post requests and does nothing specific with the response

2076673
accessor	properties
javabeans style properties accessor or

2076673
getter	setter
there are a couple reasons why property-based access is discouraged but one is that they you re forced to add getter and setter for all of your persistent entity fields but you may not want those same fields susceptible to mutation by external clients

2076679
post	get
for example they said instead of passing json as a parameter to to indicate return data type they provided so we would all know that the return type we expected was json or instead of indicating send method as post or get you could use or respectively

2076680
getter	setter
i think you need to put the annotations on the getter and setter themselves if you want them to be used

2076720
jpcap	jnetpcap
is there any code available in java that uses jpcap or jnetpcap that captures packets and displays all header information

2076747
int	double
to elaborate on this a little more you have to explicitly wrap up non-object number types int unsigned int double float bool etc. into nsnumber when working with anything that expects an object

2076788
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
more generally if you have a potentially lengthy delegate callback either make sure that 1 the delegate is an object that won t be deallocated during the lifecycle of the delegator uinavigationcontroller managing uiviewcontroller s or 2 the delegator s delegate object is set to nil during the delegate s deallocation

2076838
subtract	add
if it has been used add or subtract one from the number and check again keep repeating until i hit an unused number

2076838
subtract	add
if it has been used add or subtract another randomly generated random number and check again problem is we re back to simply generating random numbers and checking as in solution 1

2076838
hash	md5
5 generate much larger random numbers and hash them using md5 to get a smaller numeric value we should rarely get collisions but i end up with larger than needed numbers again

2076846
put	get
if i put the two appends in comment then my linq query does work and i do get the right data

2076865
implements	extends
if for example you are using the newlib c library commonly used on bare-metal embedded systems with the gnu compiler you have to implements sbrk yourself so how it works in those circumstances is up to you so long as it achieves its required behaviour of extends the heap or failing

2076873
integer	fractions
two values are returned the integer part and the fractions part

2076951
postgresql	mysql
so i suggest you might want to take a look on how the database.yml is configured with mysql and also try that out with the postgresql gem

2076969
rar	zip
basically i want to feed the files folders to a shellscript that creates different compressed archives rar zip tbz2 out of them

2076984
mouse	keyboard
when the childwindow is active none of the controls on the underlying ui will receive mouse or keyboard events

2077013
hide	show
the view i m pushing onto this does need to display the navigation bar and i m currently using the above method to show it and then hide it again when the view is popped

2077053
post	get
then when you do something like post_path post you ll get the post baz-quux or any other relevant url that you have configured in config routes.rb file my example applies to resourceful urls

2077157
tapestry	wicket
click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket

2077167
cldc	midp
you can use the random class of midp or the one in cldc 1.1

2077173
post	put
put the following in your post model stick it at the bottom before the closing end tag

2077254
post	get
whenever i visit i get the error message at the top of this post

2077403
client-side	server-side
client server language compatibility jscript s similarity to javascript means that you can use the same include file for server-side validation as you use for client-side

2077410
single-quotes	double-quotes
other answers in this thread have minor problems the cgi.escape method for some reason ignores single-quotes and you need to explicitly ask it to do double-quotes

2077411
firefox	safari
it works in safari and firefox but it does not work in ie7

2077416
put	get
in the page with recent visited div fetch the database content that store recent visited page id use it to get the title and image contained in the actual pages then put the result there

2077418
folder	directory
the main need is to iterate through the hidden directory in the source folder sandbox tmp here

2077418
folder	directory
items with the directory attribute folder

2077418
folder	directory
directory folder

2077418
folder	directory
how can i list only the hidden folder not files in a set directory

2077459
wordpress	joomla
it can have a steeper learning curve than other systems but it is the superset of joomla and wordpress it does all what they do and much much more

2077459
wordpress	joomla
comparison of drupal wordpress and joomla

2077466
post	put
basically should should create a controller which finds all pages eg your post and put in into an xml file

2077480
post	get
the jquery .post function sends a post request to the server which means to access the value of result you need to get it from the _post superglobal

2077533
json.net	jsonfx
as an alternative to system.web or json.net there s also jsonfx and servicestack.text

2077558
implements	extends
the purchasecontroller is actually a simple managed bean not extends anything an implements only serializable annotated with controller

2077583
width	height
per pixel but color format and width height might then be hardcoded or hopefully in the dictionary

2077609
firefox	safari
edit a blogger did some tests and found that its about 30 faster in firefox but slower compared to 1.3 in safari

2077669
width	height	min	max
instead it returns an axis-aligned rectangle based on the bounds of a rectangle whose width height corresponds to the max min diameter of the ellipse and follows its rotation

2077701
folder	directory
when you build the java project in netbeans it creates a jar file on the dist folder in the current project directory

2077702
opera	firefox
in firefox it works well but in ie and opera the browser first navigates to smart url but then it closes connection and sends a postback using an asp.net form action

2077704
width	height
i m not exactly sure what you mean by height and width of the mapview but if you want to change the size of the mapview itself on the screen you can just do it like you would do for any view by setting the layoutheight and layoutwidth either in xml or dynamically in code

2077755
hide	show
1. you could store your data range in one or two variables then hide years you drew with all those date i hope you understand d add one absolute div to show current year which you ll recalculate on each mousemove

2077777
cashapelayer	cagradientlayer
i have a cashapelayer that i add a cagradientlayer to but there is no clipping about the shape of the cashapelayer

2077822
for-loop	arrays
edit you ve asked for a string arrays specifically but in case you re flexible about the requirements i would prefer a to avoid the need to determine the arrays length prior to the for-loop in the first example and simply add items to it

2077879
georss	kml
i will just add a little detail and recommend you to serve the markers in a standard format natively supported by openlayers like kml geojson or georss

2077999
disk	ram
if you understand how disk i o and caching works you can modify file operations to work well with it if you read from one file and write to another working on large batches of data in ram can help reduce i o contention between the reading and writing phases of your code and vastly improve throughput

2078024
cos	sin
center + sin angle v radius1 + cos angle w radius2

2078045
folder	directory
i want to protect the files in a specific directory so that people cannot link to them - but i still need my program to be capable of rendering them so password protecting the actual folder won t work

2078058
firefox	safari	width	height	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now this works fine in internet explorer and firefox but i just tested in safari and google-chrome and the values are zero but in firefox and it has the correct width and height

2078058
google-chrome	safari
now in google-chrome and safari this animation performs beautifully

2078119
inline	inlining
as for a workaround try explicitly adding inline or not inlining wait_what

2078130
disk	ram
the linux kernel uses a kind of ram disk to access modules at an early boot stage

2078137
16-bit	64bit
splice these four 16-bit integers together to get a 64bit integer

2078144
public	protected
put the protected resources in a different context directory from the public using servlet-mapping s in web.xml

2078144
public	protected
if the public resources are in put the protected in admin and define a security-contraint also in web.xml for that context only

2078160
folder	directory
all the directory and content apache folder wsgi-script martfiles have the permission 775 root devusers with the group devusers including my user http and root

2078162
spaces	delimiter
this will encounter problems however if your search term can occur at the beginning of the field no spaces character before it or at the end of the field no delimiter after it

2078177
hide	show
also jquery s show hide functions don t affect the visibility attribute

2078180
strcpy	malloc
then your addentry function doesn t need the malloc calls for firstname lastname and phonenumber but you still need to copy data using strcpy

2078207
istream	getline
between std string std stringstream and getline std istream std string you should be pretty good

2078214
hide	show
you are using visibility hidden to hide the div but the jquery show functions don t adjust visibility

2078225
lisp	scheme
go back to lisp or scheme since they re the source if you want to be old school

2078227
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

2078255
jobs	cron
the really processor intensive stuff is done in the background all run via scheduled cron jobs

2078266
uploadify	swfupload
if you can t alter your server environment use one of the flash based uploading solutions like swfupload or uploadify

2078277
struts	wicket	jsf	wicket
that s why you can t swing a cat without hitting another java web framework struts spring wicket jsf etc. - there s a lot more to it than just servlets

2078293
django	turbogears
django and turbogears are frameworks for using python more easily on the web

2078293
django	turbogears
currently it supports python even with django or turbogears and java

2078368
lisp	scheme
i think lambda is simplest in lisp since it was designed for that kind of thing and of the dialects scheme tends to be the simplest

2078406
width	height
i have image in container and i have set width and height attributes for this image in css

2078406
width	height
but when i set width and height attributes image is shown in size that is set in css

2078445
width	height
the only unit for the width and height attributes is a percentage â

2078477
disk	ram
using a ram disk you can force a cache to use ram instead of a slow disk drive

2078481
jruby	mri
try testing your buildfile under mri 1.8.6 rather than jruby

2078502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so my guess is that what you are dealing with is something like this a uinavigationcontroller with you uiscroll-uiview-uibutton uiviewcontroller as a root view controller

2078502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
after being tapped the uibutton pushes a new uiviewcontroller to the uinavigationcontroller

2078502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then you go back to the previous uiviewcontroller in the uinavigationcontroller stack and this is when you lose you scroll position

2078508
vsto	add-in
i often work with clients who have large financial models with heavy vba and when i can i like to extract the vba code to c# and make it a vsto add-in

2078530
hex	binary
if you look into the options for bulk insert and find no way to tell it to interpret hex as binary i recommend using ssis for this

2078549
chown	chmod
check the permissions on the file use chmod or chown and see if that makes a difference

2078596
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
if building something is truly not viable your other option is to either virtualize windows using vmware fusion or parallels desktop or to use bootcamp and create a windows partition

2078645
vb6	vba
the vba library itself actually got an for the first time since vb6

2078654
ppl	tbb
if you arent tied to pure c i would encourage you to look at the c++ tbb library and particularly the ppl subset you will find more generality and composability like for nested parallelism

2078682
ssl	https
hello i m trying to fetch data from a https web i m not behind firewall or proxy however even accepting all certificates it keeps throwing system.net.webexceptionstatus.securechannelfailure with the message shown cancelled the request unable to create a secure ssl tls channel

2078687
hide	show
manipulate the text links via css to hide the text and show a background image instead color transparent

2078709
children	parent
because it seems like this is a full binary tree assuming your triangle is wrong and the third row is actually supposed to be 3 4 5 6 you could maintain a parent queue whose head is the next parent that needs children

2078710
pull	push
basically i want to pull a database from my app on a non rooted phone modify it and push it back on

2078741
maven	m2e
to make all this easier i would quickly learn maven and then use the m2e plugin

hide	show
i ve been trying to make an option show and hide possibly toggle in my browser action popup without success

2078824
hide	show
the body appears in my popup but the show and hide actions do not work

2078826
client-side	server-side
there s essentially two ways to do this completely client-side and server-side with async postback

2078836
salt	md5
it has no salt added but you could easily add one by taking md5 password

2078836
crypt	hash
however the php crypt function can use a variety of different hash to compute the hash

2078836
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
when you prefix your salt with 1 you get a hash with an md5

2078836
hash	salt
so to verify a hash you take the password provided by the user as the password and you take everything up to the third dollarsign as the salt and you see if the results you get match the results that are stored

2078836
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
the next part of your confusion is that the md5 function is giving you a hex hash whereas the crypt function is giving you a hash coded in base64

2078944
uiview	caanimation
caanimation has a delegate method animationdidstop finished and uiview has setanimationdidstopselector

2079034
dpkg	apt
on debian that would include dpkg pre-installed on any debian system or apt-file not pre-installed necessarily or other apt tools

2079048
ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
like the java collections c# has a hierarchy of interfaces that includes collections icollection lists ilist and map idictionary semantics

2079060
post	get
if you do then you need to check your createuser.php file and see why the post request returns no json but the get request does

2079138
outputstream	inputstream
the load inputstream store outputstream string methods work the same way as the load reader store writer string pair except the input output stream is encoded in iso 8859-1 character encoding

2079164
post	get
using the ajax method really shouldn t take much more than using post get

2079168
free	malloc
malloc will then look at this list for a free block that is the right size or larger

2079178
free	malloc
the answer is that it depends most of the potential slowness rather comes from malloc and free in combination and usually #1 and #2 will be of similar speed

2079178
free	malloc
writing my own almost standards compliant malloc replacement tool malloc free times from 35 to 3-4 and it seriously optimised those two factors

2079178
free	malloc
it would likely have been a similar speed to use some other high-performance malloc but having our own was more portable to esoteric devices and of course allows free to be inlined in some places

2079181
free	malloc
malloc has to run through a linked list of free blocks to find one to allocate

2079181
free	malloc
in addition if you malloc many small blocks then as you free those blocks you will fragment the heap much more than if you only allocate and free a few large blocks

2079191
width	margin
just remove the 100 width for ul element and add a right margin like so

2079201
strsplit	substr
i have tried to use strsplit and substr methods but i can t get it to work for me

2079261
free	malloc
of course this completely depends on the malloc implementation but in this case with no calls to free most malloc implementations will probably give you the same algorithmic speed

2079268
hide	show
i have 3 button-images in one page such that when you press 1 it should show the iframe related to it and hide the others

2079282
sorting	filtering
it expects primarily numbers because you use this stuff for sorting and filtering after sphinx has already done the search

2079309
filesystems	ntfs
the .net version is however going to work without trouble for a while though the current windows filesystems ntfs version 6 limits the file size to 17 592 185 978 880 bytes well south of 2 63 - 1

2079404
uiview	subviews
uiscrollview is just a subclass of uiview so it s possible to add and remove subviews at runtime

2079529
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby will be the only officially supported dynamic languages

2079562
mvp	presenter
i have been using mvp for a while .sometimes i get confused what actions can be performed inside the presenter

2079582
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
regarding filtering sorting and grouping as per aron s answer these are not available on a view over a compositecollection

2079590
hide	show
i m doing this to show hide the navigation bar

2079631
webkit	gecko
you might want to consider using a canvas to do this which works cross platform very well with explorercanvas included for msie compatibility and of course is supported natively in webkit gecko

2079648
nsformatter	nsnumberformatter
the proper way to validate user input in cocoa is to use an instance of an appropriate subclass of nsformatter in this case something like nsnumberformatter

2079653
int	double
however i want this to work for double or int or any arithmetic type

2079682
awt	swing
but if need to look for alternatives and evaluate them before you decide how to write a gui check out this list of alternatives to swing and awt

2079733
width	height
os scrollbars are uniform in width whether displayed vertically or horizontally so you can use the width returned as the height of a horizontal scrollbar

2079757
vmware	virtualbox
the easiest way is to simply install virtualbox or something similar vmware install centos 3 or any suitable old distro with a 2.4 kernel and build test your app on that

2079760
rss	feed
for example reading a large rss feed and attempting to parse every item in it

2079765
accessor	properties
implement and use array accessor for this array properties

2079773
innodb	myisam
doing a sort like this is useful only when you want to backup a myisam table and restore it to an innodb table

2079774
ubuntu	linux
install ubuntu linux free as another partition on your hard drive

2079780
librsvg	cairo
librsvg - uses cairo as a primary backend to render svgs

2079784
int	chars
but i want a vector that is 98 elements long with each element being an int from 0 to 5 telling me how many chars strings there are in each list item

2079799
do.call	lapply
not the last do.call rbind somelist as we got a list back from lapply

2079893
int	chars
that means it is expanded to it s largest generic size bytes chars and shorts are converted to int by sign-extending or zero padding

2079915
folder	directory
as a result in my solution i have the main web site as well as the virtual directory website which is actually a folder inside this main web site

2079919
rss	feed
i m trying to find a way to split a single rss feed into separate feed based on keyword matches

2079958
width	height
did you record and export for width 1024 height 768

2079991
mouseover	mouseout
you just need to add a few more mouseover s and mouseout s

2079996
folder	directory
it is necessary to put all .elc files i a folder or just in the same directory has their original .el

2080033
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the each method for arrays just loops through all the elements using a for-loop i think

2080034
awt	swing
in turn several implementations would be defined to produce swing widgets or awt or whatever

2080060
post	get
you shouldn t do steps 1-3 because facebook will proxy the calls to your application so they can send your application session information about the user through a post or get params

2080090
post	get
but if the user has to click 10 different places to post a comment they re going to get sick of my interface pretty quick too

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
i write scientific software in numpy scipy matplotlib

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
example user uploads image or audio file my program processes it using numpy scipy and output is displayed on the browser using matplotlib or perhaps the user can download a processed file

2080110
matplotlib	scipy
for those interested in numpy scipy matplotlib audiolab here is my ubuntu cheat sheet whenever i launch an ec2 instance

2080138
matplotlib	scipy
app engine does not support any of numpy scipy or matplotlib alas

2080149
lambda	first-class-functions
but from the list you give it sounds like what you want is how to program effectively with first-class-functions values which is what lambda evaluates to

2080149
lambda	first-class-functions
most people use first-class-functions heavily find lambda rather annoying and hard to read

2080149
lambda	first-class-functions
schemers like first-class-functions and scheme s notation forces more explicit lambda on the programmer than many other functional languages

2080166
cos	sin
consider a math class that contains some common values like pi or e and some useful functions like sin and cos

2080170
sorting	filtering
i would approach a pipeline design with processors implementing sorting filtering aggregation etc

2080170
pull	push
consequently the ui needs to be implemented in a pull style rather than push you only want to update it every second

2080211
post	get
this means you will get the .net framework 2.0 sp2 3.0 sp2 and 3.5 sp1 plus a few post 3.5 sp1 bug fixes if you have installed windows 7

2080265
prepare	execute
i ve written a sql query based on qt assistant and it says that you can use the prepare method instead of execute then you can pass your parameter by the help of two methods called

2080312
unsigned	short
the nsevent class has a keycode property which is defined as unsigned short

2080358
perl	tcl
perl python c php and tcl are reference counted and have mechanisms to destroy an object once its reference count goes to zero which can happen as soon as a variable goes out of scope

2080360
cpython	ironpython
python the standard cpython not variants like jython unladen swallow and ironpython uses reference counting for its objects

2080373
prepare	execute
if a prepare query with placeholders is execute on a dbms that does not support it the preparation of this query is emulated

2080381
disk	ram
on a single dedicated server like core2duo 8gig ram 750gb disk 100mbps

2080436
equals	gethashcode
unfortunately doesn t override equals or gethashcode

2080441
put	get
highlight a shell command or just put your cursor on it call up the man bundle view man page and you ll get the full text of the man page for that command in an html window separate from your script with proper headers and other formatting so that you can actually read it--no rtf symbols no scrolling etc

2080482
implements	extends
this not meant to write your own host you can to implements ioperationinvoker as in this sample extends wcf with custom behaviors

2080486
userid	usergroups
usergroups userid groupid groupkey

2080486
userid	usergroups
the manytomany mapping in usergroups mapped by userid and groupid

2080488
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
for ie there s trixie or ie7pro there s built-in opera support for userscripts and for safari there s greasekit and for google-chrome you can enable user-scripts as well

2080493
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter is whitespace spaces tabs or newlines

2080530
postgresql	mysql
i know this has changed much in recent years as mysql postgresql and other more open less costly products get mentioned in management business news articles and used successfully in critcal systems.

2080574
awt	swing
a lightweight framebuffer-based peer implementation for awt and swing

2080580
textarea	textbox
textbox when multi-line renders a textarea that does not contain a maxlength property

2080581
getattr	setattr
what you want is similar to python s getattr setattr functions

2080581
ironruby	ironpython
the outer layer of the dlr which ships w ironpython and ironruby in microsoft.scripting.dll includes a set of hosting apis which includes an objectoperations api that has getmember setmember methods

2080590
children	parent
if maybe the parent class should manage initializing it s children

2080611
inherited	properties
another option would be to use composition instead of inherited such that a student had a person properties instead of deriving from person

2080632
public	protected
see php visibility for details on the difference between private protected and public

2080711
versioning	upgrade
in opencv 2.0 the equivalent kmeans function takes a cv_32fc1 matrix but opencv 2.0 is quite a substantial upgrade to the old kmeans2 function so i cannot be sure if the cluster centers datatype would still be the same for the opencv 1.1 versioning

2080718
min	max
it works by using min max ordering alternating between min and max heap comparison between consecutive tree levels

2080746
viewdidappear	performselector
if you want to do something after the table view is loaded use your view controller s viewdidappear and if this is too early enqueue a selector using performselector withobject afterdelay

2080764
treeview	tabcontrol
for the simplicity of this example i have removed the treeview mentioned above from the documentview and replaced it with a tabcontrol containing 3 fixed tabs

2080766
hash	md5
i m aware that the password column is just a md5 hash of the user s password but inserting the user with md5 userpasswordhashere doesnt seem to work the user just gets redirected back to the admin interface

2080780
client-side	server-side
in most web projects we do both client-side and server-side form validation

2080780
client-side	server-side
the client-side and server-side form validation library probably have implemented this for us

2080830
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but the css is clearly abstracted from the html and with this code i have full page columns #footer at the bottom even when more than a page of content is added to either column above it and it behaves the same in the latest versions of firefox safari opera google-chrome and ie8 at any resolution tested down to 800x600

2080881
datamapper	activerecord
in terms of storing the data for these objects using an orm such as activerecord or datamapper makes this very easy

2080885
submit	submission
it s hard to really describe one as being more or less secure than the other but http post data is not visible in the url and when submission data to a website an http post can usually only be performed as a result of user interaction for example clicking on a submit button

2080885
post	get
in general post should be used for requests that potentially modify state on the server and get should be used for read-only operations

2080887
google-chrome	safari
i don t know if it s available in any stable builds yet but i d suggest downloading latest safari or google-chrome and if it s not there then get a webkit nightly from

2080891
sorting	filtering
i m using nhibernate s icriteria interface to supply paging sorting and filtering for my listviews

2080891
sorting	filtering
but in order to use the paging filtering sorting code i d like to use the icriteria interface

2080898
subtract	add
what follows is my first cut you may want to add to it or subtract from it

2080899
width	margin
here s the scenario in my footer i have 4 box which will be my joomla modules and each module has a width of 220px with a margin of 10 in each side

2080899
width	margin
for example if i only got 2 boxes module in my footer they would divide the 940px width 960px-10px margin and they would be have 460px of width each

2080901
post	get
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

2080901
post	get
unless you re using https both get and post will transfer data in an easily accessible form

2080911
post	get
chances are that either you have a mistake in your code you must post a sample here to get any help with it

2080940
post	get
get requests can easily be foreged see cross-site request forgery by just placing an image on a page while forging post requests is not that easy this is also a reason why you should only allow authorized post requests

2080951
post	get
the http specification differentiates post and get in terms of their intent

2080989
uilabel	nsstring
we have an nsarray with nsstring instances inside as data model there could be potentially thousands of nsstrings in it and we want to show each one in a uilabel using horizontal scrolling

2081019
folder	directory
then add a folder named deploy into the config directory of your rails app

2081088
post	get
thats because the default url directly points to a file in the webserver whereas the the url you ve mentioned is a http post get operation which the application may not be designed to handle

2081228
titlebar	window
as you may know using formborderstyle fixedtoolwindow with the text property of the form an empty string you ll have a window with no titlebar and caption

2081253
multiplying	subtract
the strangest thing about it is that when multiplying samples by whole numbers like 1.0 2.0 or adding or subtract from them the playback sounds as expected

2081287
aggregate-functions	sum
that condensing effect would have occurred also for other aggregate-functions like min sum group_concat and friends see

2081287
filtering	grouping
you can also apply specific grouping using the grouping by construct but if you don t the occurrence of the aggregate function will just bunch up all rows into one row but this bunching-up occurs after applying the where condition so only the filtering rows are aggregated

2081298
getter	setter	public	protected
since the class itself is only visible in the declaring assembly due to the implicit internal access modifier just make the getter on the property public and the setter protected

2081322
post	get
my multiselect takes a list of favouritegenreviewmodel s to select the options in the genreslist it does this using automapper in get action but obviouslly i can t use automapper on the post because it will forget my posted values

2081331
hide	show
here s a blog article which describes it well then you just use css to show hide submenus

2081367
postgresql	mysql
i am trying to move from a mysql set to a postgresql one and one of the fields that i m having trouble moving is a mysql lblob

2081374
vb6	vba
however before i do this perhaps someone has an link to a vb6 or vba library code example that will capture save a given named application window to a bmp or some type of image file on the hard disk

2081374
vb6	vba
an link to an vb6 or vba solution is just fine here

2081405
min	max
if min max is your band and min min max max then obviously min max can be solved only if min max can be solved

2081446
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
also you should be calling it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

2081465
int	boolean
that int would determine which int uilablels and boolean get worked on

2081466
google-chrome	safari
this problem occurs only with safari and google-chrome webkit browsers the server sends the headers correctly

2081491
pop-up	dialog
if you have the permission the post action is something invisible if you don t have the permission then you have to pop-up the facebook dialog and ask for that permission but you have to use also javascript and not only php

2081501
rss	feed
parsing transforming xml data such as an rss feed

2081538
thin	webrick
i ve tested it with webrick and thin

2081561
profiling	instrumentation
this is actually nicely captured by the wikipedia page on profiling which mentions that instrumentation can causes changes in the performance of a program potentially causing inaccurate inaccurate results and heisenbugs due to the observer effect observers affect what they are observing by the mere act of observing it alone

2081592
getter	setter
the myentityfilter class would be a simple class with getter and setter for each parameter of your possible search filter

2081639
g++	gcc	pascal	delphi
i have only tested turbo pascal and free pascal with fpc objfpc tp delphi model .also the gcc g++ and msvc produce the same result.that is assigment from int which is size of 4 byte on my computer to short int size of 2 will not triggger any compile errors while you could set proper options to make the compilers generate possible lose of data warnings

2081711
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
doing a little investigation with class-dump and friends it looks like apple has a private class called nsautounbinder that takes care of this dirty work for classes such as nsviewcontroller and nswindowcontroller

2081716
cvs	svn
first of all i suggest you forgo cvs and instead go with svn cvs successor or perhaps git

2081735
ia-32	x86
edit some good information about the x86 architecture can be found in volume 3 of intel s ia-32 architectures software developer s manuals

2081737
hash	salt
i d create a salt hash for each user saved in the db

2081743
trac	bugzilla
you have to define it manually or you can also connect to some servers bugzilla jira trac to get the tasks

2081747
implements	extends
threads are often designed in two ways see java tutorials either by extends the thread class or by implements the runnable class

2081761
folder	directory
note that the css files need to go in a css directory within the feature folder 12 template features so.question

2081780
google-chrome	firefox
note that this behavior is not consistent between browsers and between browser versions ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome they all behave more or less differently see cookies in firefox and internet explorer or browsers processes cookies and session state or session cookies sessionstorage and ie8

2081796
post	get
if you still get a weird result post the code or url here so other so member can help you more accurately

2081901
children	parent
ok so lets say i have 3 jpanels - 1 parent and 2 children

2081925
post	put
i think you re mixing your verbs - put is for putting a file post is for posting variables although you can post a file

2081967
for-loop	loops
the prohibition on modifying what pascal calls the control variable of a for-loop combined with the lack of a break statement means that it is possible to know how many times loops body is executed without studying its contents

2081967
for-loop	loops
clearly we never need to be able to modify the control variable in a for-loop because we can always rewrite using a while loops

2082023
hex	binary
right now araxis treats the jars like files and i just see a lot of binary hex stuff

2082030
width	height
any other approaches to make the larger ones fit into the screen without affecting the smaller ones would be appreciated cause if i just use width 400px and height 400px all images will be at that size and the proportion will be wrong

2082055
public	protected
like a private or public or protected variable

2082059
disk	ram
django middleware looked promising but on a close inspection it appears that by the time a request hits the middleware it s already too late and the entire upload had been buffered somewhere typically ram or disk

2082075
width	height
anyway in javascript you can implement your logic depending on the width and height properties of the image object

2082120
post	put
typically there are two conventions you can use to mimic put delete via post

2082120
post	put
_method put which overrides post

2082130
for-loop	loops
it s probably safe to conclude that pascal was designed to prevent modification of a for-loop index inside loops

2082140
client-side	server-side
it is an ide that enables you to easily write the markup html xhtml the formatting css the client-side code ie animations etc through javascript and it is really well integrated with common javascript frameworks as well as server-side code in a very professional way php ruby and many others

2082169
getter	setter
if i understand you correctly and you want a way to key dictionaries in a non case-sensitive fashion one way would be to subclass dict and overload the setter getter

2082197
width	height
btw set width and height to 0 to just use the window you are setting the device too s size .

2082198
regasm	tlbexp
to create the com-callable wrapper use the tlbexp and or regasm command-line utilities

2082256
bazaar	git
maybe you need source control system like git or bazaar - they have local branches each dev may have his own and allow sync ing code with centralized repositories

2082262
ssl	https
note that what i want to do is -not- merely to have an encrypted connection using ssl https

2082279
folder	directory
we are following the zend modular directory structure currently and we have our models folder in each module directory with a base directory like this

2082337
freemarker	velocity
with googling i ve found freemarker velocity and tiles which seem to be very famous

2082355
freemarker	velocity
freemarker started where velocity left off

2082405
rss	feed
in addition to all of the other answers it s also used for rss feed

2082527
ethernet	wireless
i was able to easily complete the task but when i tested my application over my wireless connection and tried communication with my desktop computer ethernet on the same network i found some odd behavior

2082541
freemarker	velocity
i have worked with both velocity and freemarker along with spring mvc

2082570
inline	inlining
the compiler will make up its own mind whether to inline a function or not - it might take the programmer suggests inlining this into account but on most compilers simply declaring a function as inline doesn t guarantee it will be

2082587
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you have an nsdate you can use the current nscalendar to retrieve that date s nsdatecomponents

2082587
nsdateformatter	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nscalendar	nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
then use the nscalendar to convert both the nsdatecomponents back to their respective nsdate objects after which you can use an nsdateformatter to create your string representation

2082598
submit	submission
you should be actively checking for duplicates at the ui level and warning the user that s he is about to submit a duplicate entry and disabling the submission if duplicate keys are not allowed

2082613
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to play with the new web socket support in google-chrome and soon firefox but have been unable to find a wcf implementation that will act as the server

2082625
javadb	hsqldb
hsqldb h2 javadb derby and mongodb do not support this feature

2082669
nsmutablestring	nsdata
i m not sure what kind of data you re putting in your xml file but i d just create it with an nsmutablestring then change it to an nsdata when you re ready to upload it to the server

2082760
fseek	fread
use fread to read the next character and fseek to go back to where you were before the read

2082847
postgresql	mysql
the syntax you quote for mysql should work just fine for postgresql as well

2082878
google-chrome	safari
it also isn t supported properly in google-chrome and safari

2082900
getter	setter
so i create an instance of that class somewhere and now i want to change position.x that would be impossible now because the getter and setter set and get the whole object

2082910
firefox	safari
so i have a signup form on the top of my website and in safari firefox it looks perfect but on ie7 for some reason it is pushed down so it does not look right

2082958
post	get
i also realize that a parameter is always going to be a string in the http get or post so i m not really passing a java object

2082994
ubuntu	debian
i know there are ppa-repositories for ubuntu and maybe for debian also

2082994
bazaar	git
neither mercurial nor bazaar or git does encoding conversion like subversion see characterencodingonwindows

2082994
bazaar	git
mercurial is not designed for this purpose and i don t think bazaar or git would be more fun on this

2083000
post	get
once the record has been successfully saved i typically use the post redirect get method to avoid the common multiple submit issue

2083008
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
look up user agent strings for ie firefox opera safari and you ll start to see what s going on

2083055
hash	md5
as a simple example you could add a md5 hash of the id parameter and the current session s id and recreate compare that checksum during a postback

2083122
firefox	safari
it s like firefox is getting some sort of 301 but safari works just fine

if you really have your heart set on actionscript javascript-style syntax then you should look into haxe

2083487
codeigniter	kohana
kohana as well as codeigniter and most of other frameworks relies on the front-controller pattern index.php so unless you deeply hacked it i cannot see how you don t need to rely on it

2083517
range	max
for example with cd quality audio your highest possible absolute value for a sample is 32767 fudging this to make the example easier the real range is -32768 to 32767 but treating 32767 as your max makes things much simpler here so if you scanned through and the highest absolute value you found was 18000 than your amplification factor will be 1.8203888.

pic2 would check its children if any if it finds the target it goes there otherwise it calls its parent gallery s checkchildren passing itself to the parent won t bother checking it and passing itself to the parent in an array so the parent knows what path has been taken

2083665
children	parent
the parent checks its children if any of them is the target if it is it adds itself and the child to the path array and that s the path

2083665
children	parent
if none of the children find the target gallery calls its parent home page s check children passing itself and the adding itself to the array of the path

2083665

alternatively you can choose not to pass the path as an array but instead just transition to the parent page if none of the children or the children s children match cause you re sure the target is not under this page

2083693
bluetooth	usb
the external accessory framework is for communication with custom hardware via the usb dock connector on the iphone or through bluetooth

2083832
g++	gcc
compare gcc -v file.cpp gcc can work with c++ files and g++ -v file.cpp to see the difference in linker commands that often causes the first to fail for example

2083832
g++	gcc
you are better off not using the linker directly because it is much simpler to use either gcc or g++ and give them specific linker options if required

2083891

this error means you are trying to post put delete to a path that only accepts get requests

2084473

2084989
google-chrome	firefox
your code works correctly for me in firefox 3.5.5 and google-chrome 4.0.249.64

2084990
public	protected
i would say that most often it s not good to change public members to private or protected members in the derived class because this will violate the substitution principle you know a base class has some functions and if you cast to a derived class then you expect those functions to be callable too because the derived class is-a base

2085023
width	height
my guess is i would need to create a containerview with the total size width height for the top center and bottom imageviews and add the containerview to the cell but this didn t seem to work

2085031

it is preferable to draw text in drawrect using nsstring s drawinrect method which will give the look of a transparent uilabel

2085152
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works all well and good in browsers such as safari google-chrome and firefox but come to internet explorer 7 and it s a no-go

2085158
ant	maven
why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

a second note instances of printwriter never throw ioexception you should test for errors calling checkerror which also flushes the stream

2085516
versioning	upgrade
i may not be able to just update upgrade the perl versioning easily due to policies in place in my organisation that s just the way it is i don t want a side discussion on this

2085540
accessor	properties
secondly although you have declared a matching properties nonatomic retain tabbarcontroller and implemented via sysnthesize you are not actually using the properties accessor and its corresponding retain release behaviour during assignment to do this you need to use self.tabbarcontroller rather than just tabbarcontroller which will refer to the class variable not the properties

2085572
getter	setter
in the withevents case will in fact call a property setter and will fetch the value from a property getter while in the second case there will be no property created for the value but the code will access the field directly

2085626
dlsym	dlopen
the closest would be through dynamic loading of library dll such as with dlopen dlsym on linux

2085641
dlsym	dlopen
library binding or dynamic linking as it s called is done via dlopen and dlsym on nix and loadlibrary and getprocaddress on windows

2085646
dlsym	dlopen
many systems will provide deferred binding as a feature of the linker loader and you can also use explicit calls such as dlopen to open a shared library and dlsym to get the address of a symbol within that library so you can access it or call it

2085691
width	height
there are issues with page layout like width height scrollbars etc

i keep finding plenty of info on height based expansions but not much on width

2085820

get rid of code resetting the filename to the post one the second line in your original function and you should be fine

2086356
sunos	aix
on sunos the latter path is on aix it is and on hp-ux it s

2086361
hash	salt
salt hash are one of the better ways of dealing with storing passwords you re not really storing it as such

2086372
stdout	stderr
there is no way to keep output on both stderr and stdout synchronized after it is buffered and redirected

2086376

2086670
rel	attr
i tried to just add attr rel to the string but that didnt work

2086683
concave	convex
i don t know the tool and data structure you re working on but for example in matlab when you intersect n polygons the result is a new polygon of intersection and if you can easily find the closest point on the surface of a single convex object then if the intersection polygon is concave you can triangulate for getting your convex objects

my application works on both - landscape and portrait mode - but since it s opengl view i handle rotation of the view by myself so to display uiactionsheet i use empty view and add actionsheet to it

2087593
put	get
but i get a error c2108 subscript is not of integral type when i try to put something in it like

2087593
int	double
if i interpreted the error right then i have to replace my double with an int

2087596
free	malloc
returning an array also means the memory clean up has to be done with a function compatible with the function you used to allocate the block your implementation will likely use malloc and not new to allocate this block so that the caller can later use free on the block

2087635
submit	submission
after one submission every form has two functions bound to the submit event after two submission three and so on

2087692
move	drag
what i m trying to say is that if you were to drag the green over the ones after in the left column will move to fill the empty space

2087747
jsf	seam
it can be triggered by jsf page i am not sure whether you must enable seam transaction management in order to get this feature

2087754
put	get
but also put a #define class struct to get implicit private class data public too

2087778
google-chrome	firefox
haven t tested it with firefox but assume google-chrome compatibiity

2087789
post	get
if you get to a query that does not make sense seems to complicated or such you can post it here and get feed back -- having real code always gets better comments

2087849
hash	salt
use an n-bit serial number r combined with an m-bit hash h of the concatenated pair r s where s is some secret salt s which you do not publish

2087849
hash	md5
if you like algorithms like md5 or sha but the bit count is too high then just take the m least significant bits of a standard hash algorithm

2087849
hash	salt
if you feel paranoid pick two salt values sprefix and ssuffix and calculate the hash of the concatenated triple sprefix r ssuffix

2087870
inline	inlining
what i want to find out is how much time the inline functions are taking preferably without disabling optimization or inlining in my build options

2087898
cpu	affinity
develop a few macros using the high performance timing mechanism of your cpu x86 -- the routines that don t rely on system calls and bind a single thread running your core loop to a specific cpu set the affinity

2087929
udp	tcp
i want to write a library c c++ which would be able to monitor network traffic tcp and udp as well as limit bandwidth to a particular network area apply different traffic shaping rules to different network zones

2087943
inline	inlining
btw inlining is of significant value only if the routines being inline are small and don t call functions themselves and if the lines where they are being called are active enough of the time to be significant

2087951
profiler	vtune
you can use a more powerful profiler such as intel s vtune which can give you assembly line level of performance detail

2087972
int	chars
obviously the console.writeline int must internally convert the int to a string of decimal chars but this is not obvious from the il.

2087972
tostring	string.format
using jon s example with string.format the first case w o the tostring the value is boxed..

2088047
post	get
if i get that working i ll post it

2088066
versioning	upgrade
for anyone who have happened to meet with this similar issue as mine it s either you upgrade the latest jave 2 sdk and tomcat or downgrade your script to the old versioning compatible

2088089
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer
multiple linq queries would be run against the ienumerable to filter out the options we wanted including a .distinct iequalitycomparer and .sort x x rowname

2088089
google-chrome	firefox
now if you ll watch the following video you ll see that the code above works very well in both firefox and google-chrome and yet it blows in ms ie

2088094
put	get
to get specific start with the following visualization imagine the triangle flat in the x-y plane and it s normal along the z-axis and put a sphere here that touches all corners of the triangle with everything centered at the origin

2088152
profiling	debugging
to debugging issues like this you can attach a profiling ie8 has one and see which function is taking a long time to execute

2088172
gif	png
png gif or jpeg graphic as a different file format for example

2088172
gif	png
emf a png a gif or a jpeg graphic is inserted into a word document

2088172
gif	png
graphics are saved in the applicable emf png gif or jpeg

2088187
filtering	grouping
my application collects business data from various sources aggregates it grouping and filtering and needs to display it

2088194
cos	sin
i have the following code doing sin cos function using a pre-calculated memory table

2088194
cos	sin
in the following example the table has 1024 128 items covering all the sin cos values from 0 to 2pi

2088194
cos	sin
i know i can use sin cos symmetry and hold only 1 4 of the values but them i will have more ifs when computing the value

2088206
agile	sprint
option 3 seems to be against the spirit of agile - you are putting the next sprint at risk by not allowing the results of the prior one to guide the next iteration of development

2088213
vbscript	jscript
jscript has a special function in it for converting vbscript arrays to jscript arrays as they are stored differently which is the vbarray function in your code

2088225
cos	sin
when you need both always compute the sin and cos of a value at the same time

2088269
postgresql	mysql
it s completely annotation based and currently supports mysql postgresql derby and h2

2088276
hide	show
you also need to use the right selector in your hide show calls namely it needs to include the # before the div s id in the selector

2088360
put	get
if i put a break point at the showdialog line i get a fatalexecutionengineerror

2088405
int	chars
main difference is instance variables get default values like int value get zero chars gets null but not the local variables

2088438
cos	sin
one thing you could try would be to use the fact that cos x sin x + pi 2

2088439
public	protected
if you have an access specifier public private or protected between members even the guarantee about order is lost

2088458
google-chrome	safari
however on safari and google-chrome the updateprogress control remains visible after the postback completes

2088470
initializer	class-method
static class-method can also be passed without initializer an object of that class by passing the class name instead of an object at index 0

2088476
dlsym	dlopen
have it open the real implementation with dlopen and link with dlsym

2088482
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when you leave the page in firefox or safari but not google-chrome it keeps the old page still loaded just hidden

2088482
firefox	safari
unfortunately it seems safari also doesn t implement the onpagehide function firefox introduced to go with the bfcache so you can t catch that

2088482
firefox	safari
firefox and safari take this as a signal that the page wants to be really unloaded on leaving

2088519
hash	md5
i need to create a hash key on my tables for uniqueness and someone mentioned to me about md5

2088528
public	protected
the generate javadoc command gives me an option to create javadoc for members with visibility private package protected public

2088530
mapquest	directions
mapquest open offers an open directions service and an open guidance service

2088596
mvp	presenter
i just wrote a blog entry on the mvp model view presenter - passive view pattern

2088602
min	max
an example for this are the unfortunate min and max defines somewhere in windows.h

2088602
min	max
okay there are ways to turn off min max macros in windows.h but it s still poor design

2088631
width	height
my first attempt at this was to create a control called a group which had width height 0

2088666
httphandler	httpmodule
after thinking about what was going on and realizing that issue probably had something to do with nhibernate i refined some of my google searches and found a post httpmodule and httphandler sections in iis 7 web.config files

2088764
width	height
you d need to have a container with overflow hidden and a set height and width with position relative set

2088779
width	height
it only has to do with the content of that tag being limited to the width and height which you haven t even specified

2088779
width	height
if the content overflows that width and height scrollbars are inserted on the container

2088834
hide	show
i have an ibaction on this button and i would like to click on it to show hide the uitoolbar in photoviewcontroller

2088837
post	get
so when the user post the form i get a parent instance with the id and field2 filled i think the mvc framework dont matter here all behaves mostly the same when binding

2088849
int	double
if you pass in a nullable int and a non-nullable double expression bad things happen

2088926
put	get
the problem is that the regex is matching as early as possible - one solution is to put a greedy quantifier at the start so that it gobbles up all the possible early matches and you get the last one

2088959
stdout	stderr
note also that you have to consume stdout and stderr concurrently otherwise your spawned process will block waiting for your process to consume the output or errors

2089023
easymock	jmock
such frameworks exist for java - check out jmock or easymock for example

2089037
hide	show
what i ve done in these situations is used the xaml hierarchy to determine which element to show hide

2089041
put	get
or to put it another way what else could i add to my class library project to get this feature working

2089105
int	chars
chars int

2089106
for-loop	arrays
they re collections in natural language terms and you can use the enhanced for-loop over them - but if you want to use an arrays within the collection api you ll need something like arrays.aslist which wraps an arrays with the interface

2089174
swt	swing	awt	swing
so unless you have a specific requirement to do work in awt i would recommend you to check out the modern replacements swing or swt - much more comfortable flexible customizable and predictable in their behaviour than awt

2089176
public	protected
a derived class can explicitly call the base class implementation if access permissions allow it by using a fully-scoped name by calling a f in your example - if a f were public or protected

2089226
int	chars
even though memory on an x86 is byte-addressable so you can have a chars pointer to any address if you have for example an pointer to a 4-byte int that pointer must be aligned

2089242
inherited	properties
if you really want to inherited from member you ll have to copy all the properties off the passed argument to the new instance manually

2089246
maven	pom.xml
though when maven release is performed the pom.xml is allowed to be released with snapshot version in dependencymanagement

2089265
mouseup	mousedown
i m trying to enable a double click event on a flex control without disabling the default mouseup mousedown behaviors

2089272
hide	show
you can use datatriggers in your datatemplate.triggers collection to show and hide elements depending on the content data

2089277
jobs	cron
i have written a set of rake tasks which are kicked off by whenever-generated cron jobs

2089295
put	get
as you already have an ibook g4 you could as well put xcode on it you can get the mac sdks - even for powerpc - for free from apple

2089357
for-loop	loops
the second for-loop shows that first for loops correctly sets to i for i in

2089364
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

2089379
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
please don t use alert install firebug into your firefox or enable the javascript console in google-chrome or safari

2089395
many-to-many	one-to-many
i found a lot of examples that show only how to create one-to-many or many-to-many

2089411
hash	md5
ideally i d make checker swf that would load app swf and called its function that would return something from the database a naive service would count rows in table and hash it with md5 but security constrains won t let me call loaded swf s function

2089435
hash	salt
obviously however if you have access to the program generating the hash and you can provide input then you can compare with some result you also calculate assuming you know the salt

2089438
verilog	vhdl
if you re looking for more examples of concurrent languages there is myhdl and the xmos xc which are other attempts away from the traditional verilog and vhdl

2089459
int	double
if we knew the declaration of arrayofnumbers we would further know its type an int or a double

2089463
daemon	cron
a cron daemon fulfills this purpose on unix-derived platforms

2089533
hash	md5
md5 and sha-1 account for the vast majority of hash you ll find in the wild

2089570
put	get
you can usually get away with fairly simple parsing most programmers use a similar style - for example it s uncommon for someone to put blank lines between the class fred and its open brace

2089740
unix	bsd
if you were using bsd unix you would link with the standalone library

2089755
inherited	properties
sessionid is an inherited properties from an interface

2089775
ati	nvidia
another big plus to this approach is that nvidia ati can release a newer more efficient version of their drivers and you automatically benefit with no effort on your part

2089812
union	distinct
you d have to probably do a select distinct on the data set produced by the union

2089824
versioning	upgrade
has this problem and i cannot find a way to upgrade to a versioning of ftp7.5 that does not have this issue

2089852
pop-up	dialog
a simple solution would be to pop-up a dialog asking the user to restart the program in the correct space but for the life of me i can t figure out how to tell which space my target is in either through nsworkspace or the accessibility api so that i can compare it to the space that i m in

2089872
floating	right-align
| left-aligned right-align | in one cell then you can use floating divs inside the td tag

2089907
union	distinct
if you just use union without the all it will filter duplicates and therefore be equivalent to a full join but the query will also be a lot more expensive because it has to perform a distinct sort

2089974
post	get
webinvoke with method get is the same as webget but since some of my methods are post i use all webinvoke for consistency

2090011
oncreate	setcontentview
as i mentioned in a comment your view hierarchy should be working after your call to setcontentview early in oncreate

2090066
hex	binary
i would suggest that to be absolutely sure that your encoded binary is cookie-compatible then basic hex encoding is safest in java

2090107
notepad++	jedit
you should use notepad notepad++ jedit and whatever you want but if you want to be productive a serious ide is the best choice and adobe win by far

2090108
folder	directory
when you install moss 2007 using the default install locations the moss 2007 log files will not reside in the â œprogram files microsoft office servers 12.0 logsâ directory folder as expected

2090108
folder	directory
they will reside in the wss directory folder â œprogram files common files microsoft shared web server extensions 12 logsâ

2090116
decoder	encoder
base64 wins because it s so common that i don t have to ever worry about rolling my own encoder decoder

2090123
implements	extends
i ve implements a hibernate save-update listener by extends org.hibernate.event.def.defaultsaveorupdateeventlistener.defaultsaveorupdateeventlistener and overriding onsaveorupdate saveorupdateevent e

2090134
superclass	subclassing
create a field for the superclass adjust methods to delegate to the superclass and remove the subclassing

2090137
union	distinct
if you have duplicates and need to factor them out you can use a union instead but that does an implicit distinct aggregation so will be much less performant

2090160
rss	feed
having had a very quick look at the cc docs i imagine if you were writing your own cruise control dashboard you could consume the rss feed of build results parse in all the date times and success failure states up to your threshold then sum up the totals

2090161
sorting	grouping
creating string userattribute or key value columns sounds appealing at first but it leads to the inner-platform effect where you end up having to re-implement foreign keys data types constraints transactions validation sorting grouping calculations et al

2090171
hash	salt
at the very least concatenate some salt such as the username plus some constant string for your site and store the sha-1 hash of it

2090177
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller aviewcontroller added to a uinavigationcontroller which in turn is added to a uitabbarcontroller

2090185
width	margin
make the left and right columns fixed on the same width margin and padding so the center column has the right offset from the left and right

2090234
put	get
i am not sure what to put with the get and end get

2090250
hide	show
so rather than just reading logs directly consider using a log-viewing application that can show and hide details

2090276
lisp	scheme
guy steele pointed out that its the same thing in lisp and scheme

2090286
nsurlcache	uiwebview
uiwebview asks the nsurlcache for assets if you load it up with a request but when loading with html or data it bypasses the cache completely and requests it directly from the remote server

2090287
rdf	owl
in order to accomplish this you have to use the owl rl profile of owl full which treats all things in owl equally thus allowing the use of an inference over rdf type

2090349
punctuation	words
they re actually mostly concerned with punctuation characters and do not try to keep words unbroken at all

2090386
inherited	subclassing
i can think of a couple of hackish ways of doing this inherited from a resource subclassing that handles the logging logic but it just seems like this is something that should be built-in to the framework

2090414
put	get
the solution is to put the alert in your callback function which doesn t get executed until after the response has been received

2090426
setinterval	settimeout
regular javascript animations using settimeout setinterval don t work very well in mobile safari

2090460
int	chars
the safe way to extract a 32-bit int from an arbitrary memory location is to declare a temporary 32-bit int and perform a copy to it treating the source memory as a raw chars array

2090468
war	manifest.mf	jar	manifest.mf	jar	war
you don t use a manifest.mf to put a jar in the classpath of a war file

2090478
post	get
at any rate you should post what you get

2090498
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder of a division

2090500
division	modulo
the modulo gives the remainder of the division so number 6 is the amount left over when dividing by 6

2090569
dictionary	map
use tuple or array instead of dictionary map - tuples and arrays keep their sequence but do not allow using keys dictionary do not keep their sequence but allow using keys

2090597
children	parent
when dealing with foreign keys populate the table the foreign key references first - start with the parent and then tackle its children

2090628
profiling	benchmarking
you need to be in release mode to profiling benchmarking or modify your build settings

2090636
getter	setter
this is most commonly done through setter and getter methods

2090647
solaris	aix
i have a scenarios where i have a java agent that runs on a couple of platforms specifically windows solaris aix

2090665
post	get
in your magento index.php file and post here any error messages you get when trying to access magento connect

2090765
tripledes	aes
i ve found plenty of examples how to do encryption in c# and a couple for android but i m particularly looking for a way to handle encrypting using something like aes tripledes etc. from android and eventually wind up being decrypted in c#

2090777
firefox	safari
seems only in firefox 3.5.7 mac - works as expected in safari

2090828
folder	directory
you can either pull from the network location or copy the entire directory containing .git folder accross to the other computer

2090829
post	get
now without jquery submitting this form should get you could change it to post if you like on the current page

2090845
width	height
i ve go the code working except that my components that used to fill the entire space using width 100 and height 100 appear to display just using the default sizes

2090857
width	height
i might be missing what you are asking but all you should need to do is just set a height and width on both the embed and object tags to be the height and width you want

2090857
width	height
the following uses a width of 50px and a height of 40px but remember to omit the px when declaring it

2090898
firefox	safari
everything is working great in firefox safari ie6 well-i am getting a horizontal scrollbar there in ie6 for some reason and ie8

2090905
chgrp	chmod
if you re hell-bent-for-leather on doing it what chacha102 said plus you ll also want to chgrp it and chmod it so that only the internet user and your user can view it

2090928
gif	png
so the condition is if a string in post_content ends in jpeg jpg gif or png replace

2090941
sphinx4	htk
i want to use either sphinx4 or the htk toolkit to build me a speech recognition application that aims to estimate ones age from voice

2090965
gif	png
if you want to limit the updates to rows containing jpeg jpg gif and or png add

2090980
kerberos	ntlm
- internal users should be authenticated using ntlm with the ad to ensure a kerberos encrypted login while forms would be usable for the adam instance

2090981
folder	directory
you should use the applicationdata directory for your app data in delphi you can find this folder programatically using the shell api function shgetspecialfolderlocation

2090989
width	height
the web site was designed to be fluid width height so it would fill the screen on any resolution so because of that i m using a lot of percentages for height and widths

2090989
width	height
i ve set the height to 100 and width to auto

2090989
width	height
i expect it to scale the image to 100 the height of the div and then adjust the width accordingly

2091042
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
as has been pointed out there are free hdl simulation tools like icarus verilog and ghdl a vhdl frontend for gcc

2091042
altera	xilinx
xilinx and altera have free web editions of such tools but they are definitely not open source

2091064
ubuntu	debian	komodo	aptana
stay in windows and use aptana or komodo with another git client or switch to debian ubuntu and use the tools there

2091073
webkit	gecko
webkit and gecko are two different rendering engines that browsers implement to display html

2091073
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome use webkit

2091081
webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari
mozilla uses the gecko engine google-chrome and safari use webkit

2091081
webkit	gecko
as would the explanation of gecko and webkit

2091108
webkit	gecko
while webkit tends to have a speed advantage gecko has been making great strides in this area since version 3.0 as well as minimizing resource requirements tending to require less memory over time than webkit depending on implementation

2091118
notepad++	sublimetext
honestly i tend to do classic asp in a straight text editor like sublimetext or notepad++

2091144
dpkt	scapy
i think they are not at the same level if you want to manipulate the raw package take a look at dpkt scapy

2091157
udp	tcp
udp packets have a theoretical limit of circa 65kb and tcp no upper limit but you ll have flow control problems if you use packets much more than a few kilobytes

2091158
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i would think the simplest method to achieve your goal would be to use a custom png image with transparency and set the image property of a mkannotationview that you add to your current mkmapview

2091172
post	put
i have put web.xml in which httpmethodfilter is used for converting post methods to put and delete but not working with urlrewrite

2091250
google-chrome	firefox
i do not think firefox or google-chrome have special applescript support but you can send the keystrokes cmd-r to refresh the page

2091255
post	get
the post would be to submit a query and in response you d get a queryid something relating to what you ve submitted

2091259
deselect	multi-select
his solution deselect all other items when an item is clicked so you have to ctrl-click items to multi-select

2091289
disk	ram
suppose you have some of the data you need in ram while the rest is on disk still

2091304
fseek	ftell
normal file related functions like fseek ftell etc in windows msvc6 can handle files only upto 2gb as per my current understanding please correct me if i am wrong

2091324
fseek	ftell
the ftell fseek functions are using 32 bit integers so you won t be able to handle file bigger than 4gb

2091324
filesystems	ntfs
last word you have be aware that some filesystems limit the maximum filesize the fat32 won t handle file bigger than 4 gb by design ntfs would handle any size but the api generally is made for 4 gb or less big file

2091344
filesystems	ntfs
so the size of the file you can handle will depend on which filesystems the hard disk has been formatted with and which operating system you are using although you are almost certainly using an operating system which can handle the upper limits of ntfs windows 2000 or above

2091425
queue	fifo
you can use a queue which will ensure fifo for all your data packets

2091434
floating-point	integer
note the use of .0 at the end of all numbers this ensures that floating-point math and not integer math is used when combining them

2091454
outputstream	inputstream
i have a blob column in my database table for which i have to use in my java program as a mapping and to use this data i have to convert it to inputstream or outputstream

2091473
valgrind	glibc
there are many programs to help you do that such as valgrind glibc mcheck dmalloc electricfence etc

2091483
comparator	comparable
comparable interface contains a method called comparator obj which takes only one argument and it compares itself with another instance or objects of the same class

2091490
vb.net	vb6
i notice when you import a vb6 project the forms come in as friend but when you add a new form in vb.net it is public

2091502
hide	show
you may have 3 dialogs i defined an additional logged out dialog here for each state connect the state entered signal to dialog show slot and connect state exited signal to dialog hide slot

2091502
hide	show
in this way you don t need to worry about when to show hide a dialog just focus on the transition of states

2091502
hide	show
after log in information has been verfied a loggedin signal emitted and the state of the machine will change from guest to logged in so the loginwindow will be hide when guest state exited and your taskswindow will show up when logged in state entered

2091516
uitableview	reloaddata
you should use reloaddata on your uitableview

2091524
outputstream	inputstream
assuming that you are using a jdbc driver that implements the standard jdbc blob interface not all do you can also connect a inputstream or outputstream to a blob using the getbinarystream and setbinarystream methods 1 and you can also get and set the bytes directly

2091527
outputstream	inputstream
there is no conversion between inputstream outputstream and the bytes they are working with

2091540
outputstream	inputstream
there are many types of inputstream and outputstream for different data sources and destinations

2091540
outputstream	inputstream
lastly you would write the inputstream to the outputstream

2094407
width	height
in silverlight you would do this with a custom user control with it s width and height set to auto

nunit	moq
this seems to be a common error when installing using addon nunit or moq but i have yet to find a link that has a solution

2094525
children	parent
if you have potentially many children per parent then you might want to limit by the date to start with for example include criteria in the left outer join and subquery such that it limits to only children within 3 days of my_date as an example

2094538
post	put
i would let the button post to an .ashx-handler here s a tutorial on those and put the code you have written in your post with some small changes perhaps in the processrequest method in the handler

2094542

google-chrome	firefox
i have had a little scoot round the web and have found this ie solution which works on ie however it does not on google-chrome or firefox

subtract	add
to be sure there are no rounding issues each time a add the padding to a button i subtract it from the totalwhitespace and on the last li i add the totalwhitespace

2094936

class designer should know that declaring a member function or variable though all variables should be private really as protected is mostly the same as declaring it public as you showed it s easy to get access to protected stuff

inv is not primitive of altera max+plusii neither xilinx webpack

2095059
firefox	safari
when viewing specific htmls that has several iframes firefox ie8 safari doesnt print all content

2095076
margin	font-size
the problem some of the time is that different elements such as p h1 h2 etc are all affected by line-height font-size etc so just doing padding 0 and margin 0 won t guarantee a full reset

2095089
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2095089

2095367
ant	maven
so i tried to explain the maven ant tasks in detail with examples here

2095367
ant	maven
why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

2095396
ant	maven
here s my take use the best of both worlds maven just for dependencies and ant for your day-to-day build heavy-lifting

2095396
ant	maven
why you should use the maven ant tasks instead of maven or ivy

2095450
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome support are coming soon

2095522
width	margin	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to measure an elements width from the inside of the margin including padding but firefox and ie measure the boxes width where the border is not including padding but inside margin

2095522
google-chrome	firefox
measuring the elements width from the border makes sense to me and is also helpful when coding because turning on borders will let you see the width of the element very easily but my question is what the css specification says is the correct way to measure the width of an element and if google-chrome is wrong or ie and firefox are

2095563
nginx	lighttpd

2095650
width	margin
the w3c css 2.1 box model specification says that the width of an element does not include margin border or padding

2095650
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in fact by specifying the css width or height properties you specify the space available to the content of a box that is called content area in the specification which does not include padding margin or border

2095661
hash	md5
another obvious answer is to take the same concatenated string and take the md5 hash - quick and easy but runs the granted small risk of collision

2095670
post	get
disabling ini_set typically is good security practice since you could easily have an eval statement in your php code that uses a get post session variable as input for example

cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
i ve got existing experience with svn cvs git perforce and pvcs but have always worked with individual dev environments

so if a given element contains only floated elements it will not have any height or by extension width -- unless it has an implicit width that is default on block elements

2095808

getter	setter
if we follow your logic through then getter and setter violate encapsulation too

2096222
tortoisegit	svn
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same svn central repo

2096234
width	height
i see they have a set height and width

2096334
multiplying	add
it would be quite trivial to rewrite in c but i am not sure whether doing so will make any significant difference as all it really does is call the underlying math functions add multiplying or divide

2096345
filtering	grouping
if you have a huge project i would suggest making a smart grouping as opposed to xcode s normal dumb grouping which will let you filtering only .m files

2096359
coalesce	isnull
you can use coalesce or isnull on your payment.statuscode field this will allow you to do a substitution for null with a specific value

2096382
inline	inlining
it can be aggressive in inlining and the hotspot jvm actually can inline non-final methods

2096387

if you dont necessarily need restructuredtext but markdown or textile is just as fine then check out jekyll

2096731
spaces	linefeed
the s matches a single white spaces character including spaces tab form feed and linefeed

2096746
folder	directory
would it not be more appropriate to install the files to c program files myapp create a virtual directory and then point that virtual directory to that folder making sure that the proper permissions have been assigned to the folder as it will not inherit any permissions from c inetpub wwwroot

2096771
filesystems	ntfs
this works precisely like a normal file however it only works if the filesystems used is ntfs

2096784
post	get
arkin is a good starting point but by googling some keywords from my post you might get to some interesting places as well

2096803
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
localstorage globalstorage firefox 2+ google-chrome 4+ safari 4+ internet explorer 8+

2096806
width	height
you actually need to specify the width and height manually

2096806
width	height
in order to do this during load time you would need to load the rdlc file into memory alter the value for width and height then load the report with the altered report definition

2096848
ubuntu	linux
i want to port my .net application on linux ubuntu which calls native libraries so i have dllmaps to make my code work

2096861
int	double
the type scala.numeric provides the ability to write code that abstracts over the numeric system -- it could be called with double int or even your own exotic numeric system such as complex numbers

2096898
children	parent
i also want the parent to be no wider than it needs to be to contain the children

2096899
mod-alias	mod-rewrite
after your realize the difference it is easy to understand exactly why mod-rewrite processing takes precedence before mod-alias - filesystem mapping is just about the end of the road in the long chain of apache finding what to do with an url and since the latter maps an url to a file it has to follow not precede the rewriting of an url by the former

2096899
mod-alias	mod-rewrite
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course

2096933
hide	show
then when the user clicks next it hide the first and show the second and so on

2096951

when you call strdup it uses regular malloc but then when free is called it is using dlmalloc

2097047
aho-corasick	rabin-karp
the two most popular and effective methods for this are the aho-corasick algorithm i d rcommend this one and the rabin-karp algorithm

2097074

the problem only occurs when the downloaded image is of type png or gif works fine for jpeg

2097172
pop-up	dialog
while it isn t ideal the default modal overlay was nice and smooth looking it s better than leaking that much memory per dialog i pop-up

2097197
chr	multibyte
for fixed-size multibyte encodings careful use of struct.pack in place of chr should work

2097244
post	get
the difference between and is then that makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload while the makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field from a file

2097275
hide	show
the simplest way to accomplish this is to forget about fading and use sliding to hide and show everything

2097287
min	max
one at min z one at max z

2097287
min	max
2 with these two values calculate the vector that goes from min z and point to max z

puts	gets
i d then like to run a batch file that gets several files including that one from the repository puts them into a local temp folder runs them then deletes them

2097367
setinterval	settimeout
this cannot be done using settimeout or setinterval since these functions execute the code thats given to them asynchronously

2097369
stdout	stderr
i do believe that my problem is arising because i am using pthreads and the threads share the same stdin stdout stderr

2097466
udp	tcp
they have udp and tcp ports open and using a packet sniffer i can see there is not much udp communication but mostly it is the tcp communication going on

2097466
udp	tcp
thats why yahoo have mentioned in their documentation that yahoo messenger switch to tcp if udp communication is not possible

2097534
udp	tcp
sip is a voice media standard that supports udp and tcp

2097534
udp	tcp
the skype protocol prefers udp where possible and falls back to tcp

2097549
filtering	grouping
now i want to filtering out anything that doesn t start with record and grouping it by the name column jason devon sherrie and then cross join it by name so it looks like this

2097553
gridview	linqdatasource
it should not be needed but it seems that a gridview with linqdatasource can t function without it

2097616
versioning	upgrade
if the module was already installed and is being upgrade from 04.09.04 it would skip the previous versioning scripts assuming they have already been executed and just run the newer 05.01.00 script which should bring everything up to date

2097628
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested in firefox 3.5 ie7 ie8 google-chrome and safari 4

2097655
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve already tried this on multiple computers and on ie 7-8 google-chrome safari and firefox 3.5

2097656
fast-forward	merge
if the merge wasn t a fast-forward then you ll have generated a merge commit

2097656
fast-forward	merge
if the merge was a fast-forward then you just need to know what the sha1 of your branch was before the merge and compare that to the current

2097670
inherited	properties
because manager inherited from emp it has a .manager and .assistant properties

2097685
mouse	keyboard
once you determine what it means to be inactive you can clear your timer when the opposing events occur mouse is moved clicked scrolled window is focused keyboard event is a received etc

2097732
jstl	taglib
a well-known taglib is jstl

2097732
post	get
a well-known example is the httpservlet which provides methods to hook on http requests using the popular http methods such as get and post

2097750
equals	gethashcode
my interpretation of the nhibernate documentation lead me to believe that once you override the equals and gethashcode methods nhibernate can load entities into the same reference

2097840
put	get
i am trying to get it so that when a certain value is put into a textbox the focus will stay on the textbox and an alert will be shown in production

2097853

i ve got a list with checkbox one per row and i d like to have a link button not a common button or submit so when i click it i call an action from a controller

2097866
cassini	iis
if you are using the vs in built dev iis server cassini then it should trying to connect as the current logged on user from memory

2097872
ssl	https
when an ssl connection https is established apache mod_ssl has to negotiate the ssl protocol parameters with the client

2097919
post	get
the route i went down i needed fail-proof monitoring was to use the watin recorder and then port those to htmlagilitypack with linq querying with hand-coded get post stuff using webrequest which works quite well but obviously doesnt handle javascript which obviously renders it academic for many scenarios

2097933
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to newer versioning of c++builder have a look at tms advsmoothimagelistbox from tms software

2097955
post	put
as to encoding the string if you must convert the string into ascii text base64 is as good a way as any but i would suggest you investigate use of http put or post to spare you this additional step

2097959
int	boolean
it has one string key one boolean key one function key one non-integral key one table key and five int keys

2097999
onchange	onblur
and also i had to catch it when the focus was lost not necessarily when the text was changed so i had to use onblur instead of onchange

2098063
memcached	apc
memcached apc cache file cache sessions cookies

2098077
post	get
ps this is not such a big issue for get requests but consider form-based uploads post data should not be sent twice to the server

2098154
temporary	tablespace
this creates a temporary tablespace an area on disk where the intermediate sort results will be stored

2098154
temporary	tablespace
temporary here means that the data that is stored is temporary by nature not that the tablespace itself is temporary

2098154
temp	tmp	folder	directory
think of it like of tmp directory in unix or temp folded in windows the directory folder itself is permanent but the data stored within it are temporary

2098154
temporary	tablespace
not sure about 11g but in previous versions of oracle this option was not available for temporary tablespace

2098154
temporary	tablespace
this makes the user me to use the newly created temp tablespace as a temporary storage medium

2098154
temporary	tablespace
this drops the temporary tablespace

2098158
getter	setter
dot notation is intended for setter methods named setsomething that take a single parameter and getter and can also be used for any method that takes no parameters though it s very poor style to use it for an action like myobject.dosomething

2098158
getter	setter
properties are designed to declare getter and setter more easily and even generate the code for you

2098158
getter	setter
so the two concepts are related but it s entirely possible and not always poor style to use dot notation with your very own getter and setter that you wrote by hand

2098158
getter	setter
to use properties even with getter and setter generated for you with normal bracket syntax and not dot notation

2098160
memcached	apc
in php if i create a singleton method for like 5 different caching classes memcached apc session file cookie

2098173
keydown	keyup
i have the same code for keyup and keydown events is there any way that i can pass the element to the function so i can call it like element.addevent keyup function event element

2098245
pascal	delphi
the following is taken from the delphi encryption compendium by hagen reddmann an thus in pascal but i guess this can be translated easily

2098264
post	get
post a follow up on the mod_perl list if your problem is related and you want it to get attention

2098308
firefox	safari
please look at the home page in firefox or safari first then look at it in ie8 and you ll see what i mean

2098344
jar	manifest.mf
i d like to get confirmation of these points but the final answer is that you should use a manifest.mf in the jar of your startup class to reference third party libraries

2098387
width	height
i have many elements floating href tags in a div with a set height width with scroll set to overflow auto in the css

2098387
draggable	droppable
worthy to note if i am dragging one of the draggable elements and move the mouse over the droppable div with id tf_dropbox then the hoverclass is fired i just can t see the draggable element any more

2098459
minimum	max
limits.h lists a minimum size of 8 bits but the definition leaves the max size of a char open

2098459
unsigned	short	int	chars
if you use for instance a uint16_t then you can be sure that this value is an unsigned 16-bit value on whatever architecture whether that 16-bit value corresponds to a chars short int or something else

2098471
width	height
usually this is because the content is hosted in a container which has an explicitly set width and height - like grid for example

2098471
post	get
post your xaml or that answer is the best you will get

2098476
kerberos	ldap
it stores everyone s usernames and passwords and implements ldap and kerberos

2098489
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
-cmatch is always case-sensitive while -imatch is always case-insensitive

2098510
kerberos	ntlm
iis only supports kerberos for ntlm authentication as far as i know

2098510
kerberos	ldap
true kerberos i mean now you could use the ldap libraries in .net to communicate between the servers in a kerberos fashion but the connection between user client and asp.net server would still be an ssl plain text connection

2098510
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
if the asp.net server had a trust relationship with the apple open directory server with an ldap connection made between the two it might be possible to enable the ntlm authentication at the iis level and that would in theory extend the kerberos connectivity to the aod through the trust

2098510
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
i have successfully used directoryservices to connect to other active directories through the ldap protocol but i still have not found a way to embed the kerberos connectivity between client and authentication server without ntlm

2098518
hide	show
if you have a lot of ajax communication and need the loading often it might be better to hide it so you can just show it later instead of creating the html again

2098518
hide	show
statement1 would be uset to create the loading element statement2 with hide instead of remove to hide it and statement3 with show instead of hide to show it again

2098528
for-loop	loops
the for-loop present in c doesn t technically count as a for-loop because you don t necessarily know how many times loops will iterate before executing it

2098528
for-loop	loops
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

2098528
for-loop	loops
you can find out more about while loops computability and for-loop computability in these cs lecture notes csjvt jvtteaching tpl.html

2098550
versioning	upgrade
nobody likes to be told please wait while we upgrade you to versioning 3.0.1

2098691
bazaar	git
you may want to have a look at this question for some views on the modern source controlsystems git mercurial and bazaar

2098712
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari and firefox show this google-chrome however doesn t

2098712
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
again safari and firefox show this google-chrome not so much

2098719
filtering	grouping
some people do not want a page flow paradigm some people do need advanced widgets a grid component with advanced filtering grouping excel like features like basic formulas etc or low latency or real time etc things that a rich internet application - or ria - is not really made for and is thus not the right tool to choose

2098726
resx	csproj
the resx file entry in the csproj file looks like

2098727
button	checkbox
attach imce button in button checkbox you ll see in image insert form browse button where imce show to you form of uploading

2098744
width	height
i would also have the width and height constraints of the entire shape

2098751
int	double
well i can understand what int double precision is

2098763
hide	show
gwt doesn t provide similar features to show hide a loading frame on the fly

2098769
mouse	keyboard
i can add a watch by right-clicking in the expressions view but having go back and forth between the keyboard and mouse cuts down on efficiency

2098819
width	height
you should first find out the center of the circle cx cy and the radius r by the width and height constraints which is trivial

2098824
post	get
the get request method woks just fine but when i am using the post method i get the message

2098825
width	height
i think i explicitly set the width and height of one of the other components in the viewstack and i think that affected the viewstack itself so that all of the other components that were added to it also go those dimensions

2098827
memcached	apc
the bottom line is that you could create a plesk 8 centos 5 apache 2 php 5.2.6 mysql 5.0.45 memcached apc ami and run as many of them as you want

2098840
ienumerable	iqueryable
but if i do have extras i put everything into a viewmodel class and project that viewmodel instance or an ienumerable or iqueryable of them into the view

2098886
post	get
the helper class creates the client and has convenience wrapper methods for get post etc

2098893
put	get
to get smooth resizing i presume i should put some change to the label s properties in an animation block

2098910
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
free is used to deallocate memory that was allocated with malloc calloc like so

2098932
temporary	tablespace
the hwm high water mark increases which depending on how you calculate usage appears full - to view the proper usage of temporary tablespace use the v sort_usage and v sort_segment views

2098936
put	get
the application object is another way though and it is sometimes easier when dealing with the same state across multiple activities as opposed to having to get put it everywhere or objects more complex than primitives and strings

2098939
integer	unsigned
each column row and 3x3 was represented as an unsigned integer and as i set numbers i d flag the appriate bit for the number set in the relevent column row and 3x3 square

2098940
multiplying	add
add ints from last to first multiplying tens by 10 hundreds by 100 and so on and so on and store it as long

2098958
put	get
if we put a println into our functions so we can tell if they re called we get

2098975
button	checkbox
i would wrap the checkbox in a form and then submit this form using the link either with javascript or change the link to a form button and style as a link

2098990
hide	show
if you store user specific data in tables then you can show each user what he earlier posted and can hide other users data

2099001
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome safari firefox opera and ie6 7 8 should all display this behavior

2099003
hash	salt
the passwords for each user has been hash using sha1 plus a bit of extra trickery including a randomly generated salt

2099010
uiview	subviews
i m using a subclass of a uiview to programmatically contain and manage numerous subviews mostly uiimageviews that are to be positioned adjacent to each other such that none are overlapping

2099055
versioning	upgrade
the reason i don t want it to overwrite is so the user s command line options aren t cleared when they upgrade to a new versioning

2099066
sum	coalesce	coalesce	nvl
i wrapped the sum in an nvl rather than coalesce because i didn t catch what version of oracle this is for

2099080
treemap	linkedhashmap
you can actually implement this totally by wrapping a linkedhashmap and having the implementation of sort transfer the entries from the linkedhashmap into a treemap and then back into a linkedhashmap

2099109
filtering	grouping
your query with grouping by is fetching records having distance because there is database rule that first of all it takes data with matching records then it will perform grouping by on it after it it is filtering records by having cause

2099177
sorting	filtering
this page also has an postmodel that contains information for filtering sorting etc

2099197
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux current version 9.10 and use eclipse galileo pdt to develop web application using codeigniter

2099219
postgresql	mysql
it s my first time using postgresql 8.4.2 with django i have always used mysql or sqlite3 in the past

2099273
int	boolean
extension method public function where predicate as system.func of diel_inventorymodel.partlist int boolean as system.collections.generic.ienumerable of diel_inventorymodel.partlist defined in system.linq.enumerable nested function does not have the same signature as delegate system.func of diel_inventorymodel.partlist int boolean

2099273
int	boolean
extension method public function where predicate as system.linq.expressions.expression of system.func of diel_inventorymodel.partlist int boolean as system.linq.iqueryable of diel_inventorymodel.partlist defined in system.linq.queryable nested function does not have the same signature as delegate system.func of diel_inventorymodel.partlist int boolean

2099279
int	chars	int	double
int chars float double etc

2099294
next	except	hide	show
i can almost achieve what i want to do except when i hide the first dialog and show the next one the underlay disappears

2099305
int	chars
in the same way that would treat the number np points to as a chars rather than as an int

2099380
google-chrome	safari
this will only look right in safari or google-chrome

2099382
mouseover	mouseenter
click mouseover mouseenter etc

2099398
int	boolean
that works you can take advantage of the fact that boolean conditions in mysql can be directly mapped to int

2099398
int	boolean
in postgresql you have to do this need to cast the boolean to int

2099402
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you should be able to use action-filter onactionexecuting to parse related sets of incoming data and optionally validating and assign them to action parameters

2099409
accessor	ivar
makes sure it has an ivar and accessor for setting your table view s data container setdatacontainer nsmutablearray datacontainer

2099436
quicksort	timsort
in addition i plan on porting timsort which is a merge sort i believe and the optimized dual-pivot quicksort from the jdk 7 source

2099439
pull	push
push to central storage then pull when needed

2099443
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
bazaar vcs has checkouts model similar to one in svn cvs

2099453
stdout	stderr
i think the latter refers primarily to multiple processes appending to stdout or stderr

2099463
post	get
i can t seem to call a web service method from ajax with both post and get

2099463
post	get
initially only the post would work and get would causes this error

2099475
post	get
you can configure an asmx service to respond to both get and post but i don t believe there s any reasonable way to make them respond to gets with json

2099521
getter	setter
if i understood correctly you need to convert rct into getter setter pair

2099534
entity-relationship	diagram
you can use visio with an odbc data source oracle plugin to generate entity-relationship diagram - works well

2099573
for-loop	loops
the short answer is that allowing assignment of a loops variable would require extra guard code and messed up optimization for-loop variables which could ordinarily be handled well in 18-bit index registers

2099573
subtract	add
the b registers can be used in virtually every instruction as a value to add or subtract from any other a b or x register

2099576
put	get
the class i m using seems to think it is doing a put but the endpoint is treating it as if i did a get

2099605
versioning	upgrade
8.1.19 is current and even 8.3.5 is already several useful versioning upgrade behind current

2099608
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere application developer

mbunit	nunit
i am sure mbunit would have attributes that are similar to nunit

2100141
bazaar	git
i suggest distributed version control like mercurial bazaar and git because it is very refactoring is not exactly structured like adding features

2100209
lisp	scheme
however from what i ve read scheme might not be the best dialect to use for a project and it might instead be better to use common lisp

2100209
lisp	scheme
i also considered the option of first learning scheme and then common lisp but apparently there are some subtle difference which could be very hindering

2100226
equals	gethashcode
the most obvious way is to implement equals gethashcode by comparing the identifier value of both objects

2100226
equals	gethashcode
we recommend implementing equals and gethashcode using business key equality

2100311
mbunit	nunit
mbunit doesn t have excessive documentation but quick googling gives this article from which i can tell that mbunit has similar attributes to nunit setup and teardown

2100318

my base class is overriding equals and gethashcode but the linq query is not returning distinct results

2100498
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals or gethashcode doesn t make any difference

2100500
ienumerable	ienumerator
so aside the class implementing ienumerable you still need to implement a class that implements ienumerator specifically movenext reset

2100502
minimum	max	min	max
let s say that r min is the minimum possible value of r that results in f and r max the maximum possible value of r for which this holds then you got an interval r min r max where any number in that interval can be your actual number r

javascript variables are not typed so f can be assigned an int value even though it s been assigned through boolean operators

2100802
google-chrome	firefox
i had noticed that in ie the pages were taking a very long time to load when i had a lot of hidden nifty players i looked closer using fiddler and found that each instance of niftyplayer was preloading the mp3 in full rather than loading on demand as with firefox and google-chrome etc

2100824
inherited	properties
each viewmodel class should be inherited from workspaceviewmodel that has requestclose envent and closecommand properties of the icommand type

for instance i have a checkbox that allows me to show or hide certain rows in the advanceddatagrid

2101137
cvs	svn
in the older systems with a central repository like cvs svn and clearcase then it s a much more serious issue which needs to be decided at a team level and the answer should be more like to maintain an old release whilst allowing development to continue on the main line or as part of a major experiment

2101145

looks like you need to do it in the set accessor of your properties

2101164

how to get current date from windows and put into my textbox

2101217
innodb	myisam
however in this special case i ll stick to myisam and leave the foreign key relations outside for now because i want to auto increment the second attribute in that multi-key and that is not supported by innodb and that s a bit more useful for this application than having foreign keys especially when having data where updating and deleting will be done very rarely

2101257
width	height
the simplest tiling is simply to roll through each view lining it up to its height for the given width then line up the next one after it.

2101264
put	get
of course i m over-exaggerating it but you get the point - it s easy to imagine that an unexperienced programmer could put a full-blown widget with lots of handlers in every cell of a flextable .

2101264
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
oophm - out of process hosted mode with this they fixed one of the biggest disadvantages of gwt - now you get to use hosted mode in the browser of your choice if that choice is firefox safari ie or google-chrome but at least you can use any version you want

2101264
extjs	smartgwt
the result is a kinda sluggish ui at least imho - check out for yourself projects like smartgwt or extjs gwt

public	protected
the creator of the subclass chose to expand the contract and now that protected method is public

2101290
public	protected
if you do make the protected method public then make sure you properly provide internal documentation for the maintainer explaining the rationale of why this particular decision is made

2101293
postgresql	mysql
smallint is part of the sql standard and certainly mysql and postgresql both have small integer types that go from -32768 to +32767

2101342

min	max
steps av even 100 min a max are recalculated to even hundred most of the case somewhere between 300 and 4800

2101421
min	max
the slider values and settings are fine but when i move the handle i can t get it all the way out to the ends it stops a few steps from min max values

2101488
post	get
i think redirect option is ugly for both server and client as in this case you first post on the page and than get that page

2101504
post	get
i would also use the prg post request get pattern so that each next link post the form data of that step to the session then redirects the user top the correct next url

2101511
folder	directory
directory or folder and drive

2101514
put	get
in theory you could also put code there that you get to using goto

2101523
decoder	encoder
does this require the implementation of a encoder decoder

2101535
hash	md5
you could generate a hash such as md5 and store the hash value in the db

serializable	deserialization
in the signature pass xml and not objects yuck pass escaped xml in xml double serializable deserialization parsing unparsing

2101607
srp	principles
in regards to crud operation responsibility - that should belong to your data layer not any of your objects see srp - single responsibility principles

2101623
children	parent
the way i do it is each object that has children objects contains a list of them and each object with a parent contains a property with its type

2101631
width	height
stackpanel makes its own decisions about its width height depending on its orientation and its children

2101670

2101674
getter	setter
getter and setter and as such is considered bad practice

2101697
webclient	webrequest
all you need to do is to replicate those requests form posts using for example the webrequest class or the webclient class in the .net framework

2101707
int	chars
unsigned int convert unsigned chars original

2101708
getter	setter
but if you are thinking of objects as a bunch of getter setter you should check the classical discussions about the topic

awt	swing
it s important understand that as a programmer in awt swing your context and realm and power lies only within the application window

2101824
lan	localhost
the publicly routable ip address is obtained server side and the lan address will be obtained from the localhost

2101843
folder	directory
if there s a simple .ini or .cfg or .xml file somewhere in my user folder or even the application directory if it is a portable app migration is easy

2101860
versioning	upgrade
make sure that you name your .sqldataprovider file with the appropriate versioning prefix if your module versioning in 01.00.01 then your sqldataprovider file name should be 01.00.01.sqldataprovider -- dnn will install upgrade based on a comparison of what you are already have installed vs what you are installing and it will execute the appropriate script to bring the module up to date

2101862
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
so ad could be authenticating with kerberos or ntlm or ldap bind

2101862
kerberos	ldap
so maybe your application in question is multi-protocol capable and because it is operating in an ad domain it is defaulting to kerberos but if it were operating in an ldap only environment it would default to ldap bind

2101894
kerberos	ntlm
the windows authentication provider in iis7 must be set to negotiate kerberos not ntlm

2101901
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	icollection	icollection	iqueryable

range	max	range	min	min	max
currently i m joining a range of dates that covers the full range of possible dates select min start date max end date

2102060
fdt	swc
you need to include the -library-path parameter when you call the application and include either users mga documents fdt workspace vgline libs or the locations of each of the swc or swf files you re referencing

2102084
inherited	properties
this usually means that your properties is not thread-safe doesn t inherited from system.windows.freezable

2102109

this approach assumes you are using an uinavigationcontroller with a stack of uiviewcontroller instances each of which having a managed object context instance as a part of a core data application

2102169
width	height
element element_id image width height

2102212
mvp	presenter
to me it seems that it would be against the mvp pattern to bubble a display control up into the presenter but it seems that trying to map all the properties to dtos or similar would be a lot of work that would add a lot of complexity and while the solution would be somewhat more loosely coupled i m not sure the gain would be worth it in this case

2102229
bash	zsh
i use bash and zsh as shells

2102261
put	get
you can certainly write perl scripts that provide a tk gui that will work on any platform and you can even package the libraries they need to work with par to put together an application that will run anywhere with an appropriate version of perl installed without requiring the end use to install a bunch of stuff from cpan to get it to work

2102261
solaris	aix
edit following daotoad s response it does appear that activestate s perlapp can build cross-platform binaries for for windows mac os x linux solaris and aix

2102280
super	abstract
what i want to do is to let the abstract super class do something like this

2102367
gridview	rowdatabound
now i could simply handle the gridview s rowdatabound event and change the css class of the row there...but i m trying to keep a clear separation between the ui and the page business logic layers

2102382
multi-query	mysql
you re right multi-query does not work by default and it s not supported at all by the plain mysql extension in php

2102399
lua	scheme
the functional features of lua have the same semantics as scheme but lua has a unique implementation of first-class functions which i think they ought to submit for publication in the journal of functional programming

2102402
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested it on my test page with firefox 3.5.7 and google-chrome 4.0.223.11

2102445

2102478
width	height
maybe this is because chrome has problems with height and width pased widh img

2102516
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been testing in various browsers since my return home and it seems that firefox 3.5+ gives the same behaviour -reporting button one on both windows xp and ubuntu 9.10 all webkit browsers midori epiphany safari and google-chrome fail and report button two.

2102517
width	height
i think that changing the height and width from 80 to the actual pixel values above will fix it in webkit

2102528
jfreechart	jchart2d
the one i ve used are jchart2d and jfreechart

2102528
jfreechart	jchart2d
jchart2d is supposed to be very fast so if you need to do live plotting have a look at it although jfreechart didn t have any problems doing a plot a few times per second

2102534
translation	localization
the example given on msdn is really insufficient for serious localization it assumes every string is entirely present and has no parameters the reality is you will have values you wish to embed within the string but need placeholder to mark the location of that variable in the string so a translator can move the marker as they translation

2102534
converter	multibinding
you can achieve a more advanced mechanism by implementing multi-binding yourself into silverlight - colin eberhardt did a nice implementation silverlight multibinding how to attached mutiple bindings to a single property - adjusted a bit and combined with a multivalue converter you can perform multiple bindings allowing the first binding to be to the language file and subsequent bindings to be to the parameters to be embedded

2102626
getter	setter
simply to distinguish them by more than just case from corresponding getter setter

2102658
lisp	scheme
the differences between common lisp and scheme are over-rated

2102690
width	height
for example an instance of image will always contain it s current state its new width height if resized the original image data etc

2102744
hash	md5
normally tfs will check the contents of the files uploaded and will only include a file in the changeset if the md5 hash of the file is different to the last version that was in version control

2102789
factors	matrix
conversely if you use maximum likelihood factors the choice of either covariance or correlation matrix does not affect the results

2102801
post	get
my problem is that where more than one reply has been made to the original post i naturally get more than one result for that discussion id

2102813
vb.net	vb6
the key to shifting it from vb6 to vb.net for example is to use the interop library - here s one article

2102950
put	get
get some complicated constants nearby which cannot be written in 1 simple instruction mov r3 #0x12345678 is impossible to complete in 1 instruction so the compiler may put this constant in the end of the function and use to load it instead

2102973
hide	show
another thing you could do is make sure you have a unique viewmodel for each of these views you want to show and hide

2102973
hide	show
then from your parent or main viewmodel you show or hide the views you want by virtue of having them in a collection of viewmodels

2103010
post	get
this question is a result of a post by jeffery palermo on how to get around branched code and dependency injection

2103029
associativity	operator-precedence
here s an article listing operator-precedence and associativity

2103029
int	double
alpha is being declares as an int but you seem to be comparing it against a double

2103040
int	chars
like yuriy faktorovich said value types like int chars bool ecc. are passed by default by value unless you specify ref

2103043
hide	show
initially only show the first tab content and hide all others using css display none

2103049
system.in	system.out	awt	swing

2103093
int	chars
and not all primitive wrapper types just the supported ones - byte short chars int

2103122
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

2103124
free	malloc
it is hard to say but i think at the heart of the problem is that there are two heaps in your application which need to be maintained -- the standard java heap for java object allocations maintained by the jvm and the c heap which is maintained by calls to malloc free

2103165
xen	openvz
often you have to use more expensive hosting to get something like xen rather than a more efficient vm system like openvz that doesn t let you use swap space

2103178
hex	binary
to show the binary representation of the floating point number in hex

2103205
associativity	operator-precedence
the following is more concise but it s hard to remember the c language s operator associativity and operator-precedence i prefer the extra clarity of some added parenthesis and whitespace provides

2103242
bazaar	git
also for various reasons i won t be able use git unless there is a bulletproof strategy to convert this specific repo from subversion to git to hg bazaar

2103245
lattice	plotrix
some other options include levelplot in lattice or color2d.matplot in plotrix

2103303
put	get
a good hash function is supposed to more or less randomly distribute the hash values so that when you put the hash values into a binary tree you get a good evenly distributed tree and not one that is just a linked list down one side

2103355
int	chars
int types have a small list of 10 chars that are valid 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

2103381
post	get
edit i forgot to post that my current workaround is setting the selectedindex -1 after i get my node xml

2103392
lisp	scheme
sicp is more a general book about programming and computer science not so that much about scheme or lisp programming

2103442
post	get
unfortunately to use jsonp you need to submit the form data as a query string get request instead of a post request

2103452
put	get
the problem i am having is filtering out the users that come to our homepage just to login since we have the client button on the homepage and yes i ve tried to get them to put it somewhere else

2103625
folder	directory
the recommended strategy is to put your resource files under a resources folder in the root directory

2103688
firefox	safari
this works on firefox safari etc

2103695
serializable	deserialization
i want to save deserialization time and send the serialzed string directly it has to be the same method though because when i haven t got the serializable cachestring i want to normally build the serializable object by some sql statements.

2103705
put	get
so if you put the function definition in some separate .cpp file you ll get a linker error

2103789
packets	multicast
the oid part of the mac address you give 01 00 0c isn t the same as the one used for ipv4 multicast 01 00 5e so you can t use anything in winsock to send this packets

2103849
uilabel	uitextview
between uitextview uitextfield uilabel and uiwebview you can find a few different ways to do this

2103849
uilabel	uitextview
one nifty trick is to use either uitextfield or uitextview as a clearcolor input and render what you want to change in another field that is composed of multiple independently formatted uilabel or piecewise as uitextview

2103914
post	get
how do you set the result of an action result to use post and not get

2103917

arduino	avr-gcc
if you re not interested in going the arduino route i m sure the source code wouldn t be too hard to port to something like avr-gcc

2104020
gridview	rowdatabound
it s best to handle this via code-behind in the control s rowdatabound event assuming it s a gridview

2104048
folder	directory
i have set up the folder structure such that all of the binaries and config files for the mvc app are correctly located in the root directory while the rest of the content is in the subdirectory

i ve worked with svn cvs vss and now i m working with perforce

2104081
cvs	svn
it s model it s much more twisted than svn cvs git

2104093
octal	decimal
here s the catch - the export process dumps out pipe delimited files while the system that is doing the import expects files delimited by the ascii group separator character which is decimal 29 hexidecimal 1d or octal 35

2104093
octal	hex
i ve tried all kinds of combinations of single quotes double quotes backslashes and the octal and hex version of this character

2104098
int	double
note the cast is framed as int double

hash	md5
if they don t have to be friendly to read you could use an md5 or similar hash

2104179
width	height
since the text is not on the display list it is never validated and hence has 0 height and width

rss	feed
if you are adverse to all the xml parsing in your code you can also run the rss xml schema through xsd and generate a topic and feed class in you code

2104331
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade patch cannot be installed by the windows installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade patch may update a different versioning of the program

2104353
children	parent
not all parent are going to have the same number of children

2104427
google-chrome	safari
on webkit google-chrome safari it looks fine

2104432
maven	pom.xml
everything works nice but when maven installs jar in repository it creates pom.xml like

2104434
expression-blend	silverlight
i am having a strange issue opening up my usercontrol in expression-blend when using a silverlight toolkit control

2104463
width	margin
set a width on your #intro_container container otherwise margin 0 auto

2104469
post	get
in rest the http verb is used to denote the operation type you won t be able to express all the crud operations with only get and post

2104478
put	get
is there a better place to put domain-specific code that won t get wiped out if the db table changes and i have to delete and re-drag the table over

2104505
width	margin
you can put everything within a container div with something like width 900px margin 0 auto or you can simply apply these styles to intro container

2104509
put	get	post	put	post	get
in rest only get post and put delete are defined

2104562
post	put
if you don t have ability to make put and delete requests it s considered a good practice to tunnel them through post

2104569
centos	linux
i am trying to install the perl module font freetype on a centos linux box using cpan

2104590
pascal	delphi
the lazarus ide is an ide for the free pascal language this is very similar to that of delphi i must admit that i am not a delphi guy myself so i am unable to go into too much detail about this

2104655
next	except
but when i use the first of the next two lines my script issue a http 500 error and nothing is displayed except the 500 error and nothing is logged in my php.log

2104688
min	max
this matters because the definition of max and min for floating point arguments is more complex

2104717
websphere	ibm
i am not sure of how it works with above app servers you mentioned but given below are links for geronimo wasce ibm websphere

2104717
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere

2104735
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i think it would be better to create a pointmarker instance within the for-loop and then push it onto the arrays at the end of each run in loops

2104751
rss	feed
i have been using lxml to create the xml of rss feed

2104890
width	height
you page width and height must match the one the one you re aiming for

2104901
sortedmap	sortedset
use a sortedset or sortedmap specifying a comparator class in the sort attribute or or

2104912
sorting	filtering
i ve been looking in some of the latest grails books and many open source projects for samples and best practices for adding search filtering functionality to scaffolded list.gsp s eg making it work with pagination and sorting etc

2104966
postgresql	mysql
current_timestamp is ansi standard supported on mysql sql server oracle 9i+ and likely postgresql

2104974
getter	setter
the getter and setter for hours minutes and seconds are deprecated

2104992
qthread	qobject
one potential issue you could run into is that normally to get full signals and slots support working across threads you need to start an event loop in the child thread using qthread exec or the pyqt equivalent so that signals can be delivered to slots in the qobject that live there

2105041
backtracking	greedy
the greedy version will find the first alphanumeric match all the way to the end and backtracking to the last alphanumeric finding the longest possible match

2105052
portrait	landscape
anyway crash occurs if i change portrait landscape mode several times

2105108
mouseover	mouseenter
i ve tried using hover mouseenter leave and mouseover out to no avail

2105115
versioning	upgrade
you will save yourself of countless problems with things like installed jre versioning distributing upgrade application permissions disappeared shortcuts.

2105135
put	get
an easier quick and dirty way to get notified of every exception that is created at runtime is to hack some tracing code directly into the constructor s of the throwable class compile it and put it into the bootclasspath before the rt.jar

2105145
lxml	beautifulsoup
use beautifulsoup or lxml to parse it

2105146
put	get
it operates like a regular map with get put and remove methods but has a gettopkentries int k method to get the top-k elements sorted by the key

2105146
put	get
i m hoping for o 1 get put and remove operations and for gettopkentries to be dependent only on k not on the size of the map

2105178
google-chrome	firefox
however it does not work in firefox it works in google-chrome i don t really care about ie and i ve tried all sorts of combinations to get it right but to no avail

2105206
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in every other browser i tried firefox google-chrome safari it works fine

2105220
hide	show
in my case i choose to show or hide based on an expression to which i set the expression to the value of a parameter which is a boolean type

2105220
hide	show
the visibility dialog has three options show hide show or hide based on expression - if i explicitly set hide option the csv export does not include the column as you would expect however if i use an expression it will - i even went so far as to make the expression explicit like true and still it was ignored

2105247
hide	show
a workaround would be to hide the columns by default and show all others using the expression

2105247
hide	show
it seems what you will have to do is make a parameter that will show which columns to hide or display then when the report runs just don t display any data in those columns

2105256
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseout	mouseup	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown

integer	unsigned
i have an unsigned integer and i am trying to extract each individual digit

2105272
division	modulo
don t use the modulo floating point division is fine

2105272
integer	unsigned
the value in question is a 32-bit unsigned integer

2105276
post	get
if you can get the contents of the ckeditor as some other post describe i have an idea about how to get the count of the characters entered

2105294
chunked	transfer-encoding
if using rest you don t need to define your own chunking protocol as the http headers content-length content-range and transfer-encoding are all used for sending chunked data

2105361
width	height
i have a worksheet with cells that may contain text that sometimes exceeds the width and height of the cell

2105367
allocator	stl
the dynamic library uses the default stl allocator so it doesn t do anything funky

2105389
width	height
you will see the same effect if you place an element with a fixed width and height in a viewbox

2105389
width	height
the viewbox doesn t change the width height or fontsize properties themselves but the final rendering appears different

2105443
children	parent
i have a parent class that contains a list of children

2105477
post	get
if some test are done using a get then your post vars will be empty

2105518
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
if it s a list why you re assigning onclicklistener - use onitemclicklistener

2105583
versioning	upgrade
at first i tried using a properties file that lived inside the jar but i was concerned if someone were to upgrade to a later versioning replace the existing jar they would loose all of their settings

2105605
hide	show
you could hide the object from the interface indefinitely or you could choose to show it - depends on usage needs

2105633
children	parent
there is nothing wrong with aggregate roots having other aggregate roots as children or even with children with a reference to the parent

2105646
put	get
so you can use startup to get and set your data for views and if you need some initialization before like getting reference to controller put it in component s initialize method

2105686
uilabel	uitextview
i set + 30 because over the message uitextview is a uilabel

2105759
width	height
one possibility is you have set the cgsize width to be different in each function for row height you have cgsizemake 268 max_height and for settweettext it is cgsizemake 262 max_height

2105874
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2105917
lift	wicket
even dave pollak once suggested this combination if you prefer wicket to lift or have an existing wicket application you want to retrofit scala with

2105946
hide	show
then use jquery to show hide each of the questionnaire pages

2105980
getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
so what appears to be happening is that ie-up-to-7 redirects all use of attributes called name to an otherwise-invisible property internally called submitname that for form fields changes the data the field will generate as part of a form submission but which doesn t change the real name attribute used for htmlcollection indexing radio-grouping getelementsbytagname or in the case of i frames targeting

2106108
put	get
if i put the arrayquerystring behavior first i get no results

2106108
put	get
if i put it second then i get the same results as the xml endpoint

2106138
google-chrome	firefox
the behavior i m looking for is that similar to tabs in firefox and google-chrome

2106140
google-chrome	firefox
otherwise it works in google-chrome but firefox shows a blank screen

2106140
width	height	youtube	vimeo
as vimeo unlike youtube doesn t allow url parameters to be passed for determining the video size and percentage widths apparently have quirks my only other suggestion would be to specify a fixed width and height on the video object like on this page see the page source set the visibility of the content div to invisible use a javascript or jquery function to determine the page width change the width height attributes of the object tag accordingly and set the object to visible again

2106157
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
the primitive types in c# are boolean bool byte byte sbyte sbyte int16 short uint16 int32 int uint32 uint int64 long uint64 ulong intptr uintptr chars chars double double and single single

2106176
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
subframe refers correctly to the iframe alert subframe returns object htmliframeelement and the function runs in both ie7 and opera 9.23 but not firefox 3.0 google-chrome 3.0 or safari 3.03 beta windows

2106224
stdout	stderr
a reasonable default to stdout or stderr would make more sense

2106225
implements	extends
will i have to extends bunglows also and implements the same function again

2106230
subclass	abstract-class
constructors for abstract-class are used by subclasses invoked from subclass constructors using super params

2106234
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	perforce	cvs
this extension is distributed with mercurial and understands cvs subversion git darcs monotone bazaar gnu arch perforce and mercurial as source formats and mercurial and subversion as destination formats

2106252
tabcontrol	tabitem
i cannot figure out how to bring a tabitem to the front of a tabcontrol in a visual studio 2008 wpf project so that i can see the controls i m editing

2106270
children	parent
the parent s job is to control the queue to make sure the same data isn t processed twice and also to sanity check the children better kill that runaway process and start over...etc

2106274
subclass	abstract-class
you don t instantiate abstract-class but the constructor is invoked when a subclass is instantiated

2106278
nsstring	nsdata
i suggest looking into the nscoding protocol and examples which will allow you to use nskeyedarchiver and nskeyedunarchiver to serialize your objects to nsdata for transfer or base64 encoded to an nsstring if necessary

2106302
integer	unsigned
the maximum for an integer int 10 is 4 294 967 295 unsigned ofcoarse

2106311
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	mouseup
if you want to listen for any mouseup event you ll need to register an onmouseup listener on the page body in your onmousedown callback and then unregister the onmouseup listener from within the onmouseup callback so it only happens once

2106321
maven	pom.xml
i ve found a workaround using maven and the javadoc plugin with the following configuration pom.xml

2106321
maven	pom.xml
once this pom.xml is in your project root directory you will be able to run as - maven build .

2106328
servicepoint	webrequest
i m still trying to figure out this whole thing and i m really stuck on the servicepoint as well as webrequest because really i m using a proxy class in paypal which does the under the hood sending of the request

2106406
rss	feed
his website offers rss feed but i don t think that this would be a good idea

2106442
gridbaglayout	miglayout
i would avoid gridbaglayout as much as possible - use a nested jpanel or miglayout if you can external jar

2106443
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql use backslash-escapes for this by default

2106443
postgresql	mysql
i would presume the simple backslash-replace method also goes wrong if you turn off the backslash-escapes which are themselves non-compliant with ansi sql using no_backslash_escape sql_mode in mysql or standard_conforming_strings conf in postgresql which the postgresql devs have been threatening to do for a couple of versions now

2106443
postgresql	mysql
this gets used instead of the backslash-escape in mysql and postgresql making them conform to what everyone else does and giving a guaranteed way to include the out-of-band characters

2106443
postgresql	mysql
this works on postgresql mysql and ansi sql-compliant databases modulo the paramstyle of course which changes on different db modules

2106471
haskell	ocaml
have a look at bnfc which can generate working code and the makefile from labled bnf for a number of target languages like haskell ocaml c c++ and java

2106503
min	max
i would like to generate some pseudorandom numbers and up until now i ve been very content with the .net library s random.next int min int max function

2106584
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari and google-chrome all fail to run the function

2106612
apache	nginx
as an aside i see you ve tagged apache but i would really like to recommend that you serve static content through something like nginx

2106630
lxml	beautifulsoup
try beautifulsoup or lxml

2106853
sorting	filtering
table sorting paging and filtering with jquery

2106868
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
always have your nibs file s owner be a subclass of nswindowcontroller or nsviewcontroller on mac os x or uiviewcontroller on iphone and use property retain iboutlet for all of its outlets doing appropriate releases in your controller subclass -dealloc method

2106868
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
this pattern will work fine on both mac os x and iphone os because nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller on mac os x take implicit ownership of top-level objects for you and relinquish that in their own -dealloc methods and iphone os doesn t take any implicit ownership of top-level objects for you during nib loading

2106887
min	max
i need to generate a bounding box of min and max latitude and longitude values so i can return addresses within a given radius

2106906
performselector	dealloc
i just don t understand i thought when you dealloc it the object everything associated with the object should be removed or canceled even the performselector with delay

2106972
nosuchmethoderror	verifyerror
button i get a nosuchmethoderror or verifyerror

2106977
getter	setter
potentially you could also use this method to store the statuses as integers in the database by changing your strings to integers in the hash converting your column types and adding a getter and a setter

2107007
prototypejs	mootools
other frameworks like prototypejs and mootools also provide similar functionality

2107014
width	height
i am trying to load the dynamic swf file which has 100 width and height generatd by my flex 3 in a div

2107014
width	height
i have tried to provide fixed height and width to div but no luck

2107147
post	get
vim doesn t have support for the squiggly underline we re all so used to but you might be able to get the red marker in a column effect used in eclipse with help from this blog post

2107157
ironruby	ironpython
you can t really do this easily and if it s really something you need to do consider using a .net language more in line with your needs like ironpython or ironruby

2107159
jar	war
the problem is that to re-install them on the new server the websphere dialog asks me for the jar ear war file which i don t have

2107159
jar	war
in the install section it doesn t even mention ear or war only jar

2107159
folder	directory
i am currently thinking that perhaps the best thing to do might be to just copy the directory over to another was 3.5 system and then upgrade that system and hope it converts the folder structure and updated the config as part of the upgrade

2107187
versioning	upgrade
does the table have an entry for your upgrade code does the product versioning of the currently installed versioning fall within the range of versioning specified for upgrade do the attributes look ok for instance is the msidbupgradeattributesonlydetect attribute not set and so on

2107229
downloadify	jszip
i am trying to put together a test case using jszip and downloadify together the end result being that a zip file is created dynamically in the browser then saved to the disk using filereference.save

2107238
jobs	cron
a real limitation of heroku currently is that the most rapid frequency they support for cron jobs is hourly

2107256
memcached	ncache
there are many free distributed caching solutions in the market like memcached or ncache express

2107256
memcached	ncache
dont know much about memcached but i ve used ncache express by alachisoft it lets you use asp.net caching without requiring any code change

2107363
button	checkbox
cast control property on the eventargs to the type you want textbox checkbox or button

2107372
submit	submission
you can tell the validation plugin not to operate on form submission then manually validate the form when the correct submit button is clicked

2107377
mouse	joystick
if yes how we can read the user input using input devices like keypad mouse joystick from dlls

2107386
vim	gedit
vim gedit also has such plugins i think

2107457
fancybox	simplemodal
i ve looked at fancybox and simplemodal but as far as i know these are positioned relative to the viewport only

2107461
django-extensions	django-evolution
basicly this error is because your code in models orm change but your database isn t and django-evolution doesn t fix many problems with changes in the database i suggest you look for django-extensions and the command sqldiff but look my another answer

2107508
try-catch	exception-handling
now onwards start putting your code in try-catch block and handle exception-handling if any in catch block

2107525
width	height
where sample.swf is generating dynamically and has 100 height and width

2107544
unsigned	short
short int - 2 bytes - signed -32768 to 32767 and unsigned 0 to 65535

2107556
public	protected
and automatically all public protected methods properties fields etc of the super class become a part of the sub class which can be overridden if necessary

2107565
wordpress	joomla
i don t mind whether it is joomla drupal or wordpress

2107586
inherited	properties
this technique can be better than simple object augmentation because the inherited properties aren t copied over all the new object instances since the base object is set as the of the extended object in the above example subinstance contains physically only the member3 properties

2107593
yslow	pagespeed
have a look at the w3c qa toolbox for markup links css validation and the popular yslow firefox extension pagespeed another firefox extension and speedtracer sort of like yslow

2107643
affinity	processors
also i agree all others answers such as processors thread affinity

2107677
int	chars	int	double
performance is identical to making specialized classes except in cases where you are using what would have been a raw data type int float double chars bool short

2107677
int	chars	int	double
in these cases the value types must be boxed to their corresponding reference types int float double chars bool short which has some overhead

2107710
gif	png
set this flag to true when you are loading an image jpeg gif or png from outside the calling swf file s own domain and you expect to need access to the content of that image from actionscript

2107718
rss	feed
it is now default behaviour for most browser to apply their own xslt to any atom rss feed they come across very annoying

2107718
rss	feed
a feed is identified through the application atom+xml mime type for atom and application rss+xml for rss

2107829
superclass	subclassing	super	abstract
i use generics as i have 2 models one model s superclass is a generic abstract subclassing by 35 classes and the second model actually has 2 different super classes which combined are subclassing by again 35 classes

2107829
superclass	subclassing
the parameter type can be a generic superclass or one of it s subclassing

2107830
disk	ram
my colleague insist that as dom could only support about 1 million times of write operation we should running our database entirely in a ram disk and backup the database to dom

2107842
post	get
i am not writing this to get a load of people react on my post i am trully interested in knowing how much work and money it will cost a webdeveloper when starting from scratch

2107968
rss	feed
to the application itself requires very little user interaction just a initial list of rss feed and some parameters

2107974
backgrounding	multitasking
there re rumors though that multitasking and backgrounding processes will be allowed in iphone os 4.0

2108014
inherited	properties
disadvantage popup is not connected to button or surrounding elements so it won t inherited properties datacontext from them

2108014
width	height
instead wrap the button in a alongside a with zero width and height and the desired position

2108027
junit	jmock
the runwith runner as defined by the jmock guys is only valid with junit 4.x

2108050
mouse	keyboard
the control is visually unchanged but you can t interact with it using the mouse keyboard or stylus

2108109
int	chars
prefer passing primitive types int chars float ... and pod structs that are cheap to copy point complex by value

2108151
spaces	delimiter
as it seems the delimiter should be not spaces

2108171
inject	interceptor
in this case we inject different spring mvc interceptor for one client or for another

2108229
post	get
obviously to get 256x256 we need to get the w to be 3 so that post w divide we have those coordinates a 3rd of the size xscale 1024 256 should be equal to yscale 768 256 to get a square projection

2108255
post	get
when i get the value from the select field to post back to the server it correctly has an integer value which i persist

2108255
put	get
if i put the tag in my i get the page code as text in the browser

2108358
mouseup	mousedown
it is very simple to make your items draggable without a thumb by just intercepting mousedown mouse move and mouseup events

2108358
mouse	keyboard
by doing this thumb won t be intercepting keyboard and mouse clicks and messing with your listbox

2108366
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
you can access the harddisc sector by sector but then you would have to interpret it s structure which obviously depends on the filesystems fat ntfs hpfs etc

2108437
width	height
if the change is less than both the width and height of the map the transition will be smoothly animated

2108482
bash	subshell
one that uses shell specific stuff like redirects job ids etc. you d have to either run that command in a subshell using or using the -c option to shells like bash

2108492
post	put
i see the convention is to have the post action be the same name as the page but to put a

2108492
post	get
this seems clearer to me as compared to having the edit get and the edit post

2108499
folder	directory
there will be no clash because they are in different folder and they are not compiled simply copied to the folder structure under the output directory

2108504
post	get
but now i am trying to connect to a sql-server 2005 and i get an error something about a database vendor code 17 it s a german version so i won t directly post the whole error message

2108530
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
alternatively you could try using the new as of java 6 grouplayout instead of the gridbaglayout - it s imo much easier to use and almost as powerful

2108538
free	malloc
then i can go through my code and replace all calls to malloc free with my_alloc my_free

2108646
pascal	delphi
pascal and also delphi is more centered on readability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible

2108648
width	height
you can confirm this by adding the iframe with non-zero width and height and set the src to a correct url

2108684
createelement	domdocument
in your case you first have to create a document then use domdocument createelement domelement appendchild to append that element to another element

2108721
children	parent
in your context to give a parent element a class when it or one of its children is active the opposite of what i ve done you d do

2108769
postgresql	mysql
most mainstream databases are good for that including mysql postgresql oracle etc

2108769
postgresql	mysql
be sure look at licenses as well mysql is gpl the database and the connectors postgresql is bsd oracle and a few others you need to pay for

2108778
trie	tree
the trie ternary tree .

2108806
post	get
i have disabled http post and http get for webservices in my web.config file

2108831
serializable	deserialization
i suspect but can t say for certain that this may be some strange issue in xsd datetime serializable deserialization

2108845
int	chars	int	double
the only things that are value types are the simple numeric types int long short byte float double chars bool etc.

2108845
x86	64bit
bools are stored as word-size on the stack 32 bits on x86 64bit on x64

2108885
keydown	mousedown
take the code that changes the button color from the mousedown event refactor it into it s own method and call it from the keydown event as well

2108908
jstl	taglib
one is to use the jstl taglib as described in the docs

2108950
filesystems	ntfs
for example i have done a hg clone to get the source for mercurial itself and it is only 34.3 mb on an ntfs filesystems compared to the source code download which is 1.8 mb

2108950
pull	push
that mean we push pull changes from

2108954
jobs	cron
day-to-day operation what cron jobs need to run frequently are there caches file lists or other things that need to be taken care of frequently

2108959
websphere	ibm

if you have other module ejb jar they will not be visible from it and you ll get classnotfoundexception or if you have the class in multiple places classcastexception

post	get
it also gets complicated if you recall that not all page requests are get bit include some post and possibly other verbs

an autoconf test could check whether dprintf 1 blablabla writes to stdout or stderr and whether dprintf -1 blablabla fails in an interesting way or writes to stderr

2113896
folder	directory
you can also use bash commands within the php code if you would like to avoid having your server aka www-data create the directory but you ll still need to place the correct permissions on the folder to allow www-data to then write files to the directory

2113898
komodo	scite
to check what opening matches what closing i use a folding text editor like scite or komodo edit so i can browse the properly indented code by opening and collapsing sections

2113900
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
use a fileinputstream to read the file and a fileoutputstream to write it

2114003
children	parent
usually you term the other entities children instead of parent but that is just a matter of style and convention

2114014
firefox	safari
i ve only tested this code to work in firefox 3.0 or more recent versions - in fact aside from possibly safari it s unlikely to work elsewhere as it doesn t honor cross-browser differences in dimension properties.

2114052
width	height
create a controltemplate for your button with a storyboard to animate height width or transform properties and a trigger to fire the storyboard on mouseenter event

2114101
subtraction	addition
this would considerably simplify addition and subtraction

2114124
superclass	subclassing
classes can be subclassing to make them serialisable though you will need to manage the superclass data or use a serial proxy see effective java

2114143
gif	png
you could prepare animation as a bunch of images wximage loaded from png gif jpg or whatever files and then use a timer and paint them on a control

2114183
for-loop	loops
if you will be updating often on the other hand it might be much easier to use a preparedstatement object especially in situations where you can use a for-loop or while loops to set a parameter to a succession of values

2114188
hide	show
it s quick and dirty i know but...alternatively set the foreground colour of the window to the same colour as of the background in order to hide the texts flashing by see here for an example of how to do this its in the 7th posting on that page that show the code to do so

2114233
int	double
ibpp exposes those via c c++ double but also via 16 32 64bit int

2114246
children	parent
group has a to-many relationship with group named children group also has a to-many relationship with group named parent and they are inverses of each other

2114246
children	parent
or if your data model only calls for one parent group has a to-many relationship with group named children group also has a to-one relationship with group named parent and they are inverses of each other

2114274
subtract	add
getting a result of either -1 or 0 or of either 1 or 0 for that matter from your comparison operations is impossible if you are using only bitwise logical operators and add subtract where the carry is lost

2114315
hide	show
i haven t done this myself but you could layer a uiview at the top of the view hierarchy and use sethidden to dynamically show or hide it

2114332
strtok	strcmp
strcmp when fed the results of strtok in the following code seems to be blatantly lying to me

2114387
implements	extends
alternatively if the third party class isn t final you could just extends it have that implements serializable and write your own writeobject and readobject methods

2114395
stdout	stderr
it also provides options for generating xml files that includes collected stdout and stderr from these tests which is big plus for automated tests and can also generate html reports though you would need to install additional packages

2114415
getter	setter
whether that involves reflection or just getter setter and constructors depends on the class

2114422
ubuntu	linux
i ve also reproduced the problem on two different linux machines albeit both running the same version of ubuntu one 32bit the other 64bit

2114448
post	get
this post i know its vb but just to get an idea has an example

2114454

hit the show hide code button and it will show you the code required to turn the original into the filled in version

2114505
innodb	myisam
convert 5 write-intensive tables to use innodb engine and keep the rest on myisam engine

2114537
innodb	myisam
cons memory must be shared between the innodb buffers and myisam key buffers

2114537
innodb	myisam
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

2114550
innodb	myisam
these days i always default to using innodb especially on the write-intensive tables you mention where myisam suffers from full table locking

2114550
innodb	myisam
automatic crash recovery â in case mysql shutdown was unclean innodb tables will still - recover to the consistent state- no check repair like myisam may require

2114553
mvp	presenter
another alternative to mvc is mvp model view presenter

2114627
jython	pypy
now there is jython ironpython and pypy and the pydâ s do not work with any of them ironclad aside

2114627
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
you could also program a pyd for cpython a similar c# dll for ironpython and a java class or jar for jython i m not sure about pypy

2114720
dsn	dbase
dbase files is an odbc data source name dsn i believe its installed by default with ms office

2114759
robotlegs	puremvc
i have looked at some puremvc robotlegs but our flash projects are usually relativly small so i wonder if it is not a overkill

2114761
uiview	subviews
the nsinteger value exists in the view controller and the uiview subclass is implemented as a subviews in the same view controller

2114789
int	chars
i don t think strcspn is going to help - it works on a string chars array but you say you have an array of int

2114793
profiling	instrumentation
once you have your app working profiling it using shark or instrumentation to find where it really is slow

2114809
imagemagick	mogrify
i would suggest that you use -d and -q and then post-process the generated image using imagemagick s mogrify or something similar to scale the image back

2114819
lisp	scheme
to begin not only are there two main dialects of the language common lisp and scheme but each of the dialects has many individual implementations

2114826
toolbar	tabs
you can hide the tabs then implement your action methods for the toolbar items to act as the tabs changing the selected tab view item to whichever one corresponds to the pressed toolbar item

2114827
mutators	setter
the difference is that the self dot version goes through the synthesized mutators setter method which would perform a retain before assigning to the ivar

2114846
profiling	debugging
this is generally used for debugging and profiling and not as interprocess communication but its a possibility

2114847
post	get
a week of searching and all i can really do is create a resource that handles get and post all to itself

2114851
lisp	scheme
you get scheme common lisp elisp arc

2114878
tostring	icomparable
and myobject has overriden tostring and has implemented the icomparable interface

2114881
floating-point	integer
all the function does is copy some data but uses floating-point registers to do it when you could use the integer registers just as well

2115012
put	get
get a job as a junior developer that will put you on a project that is developing a web application

2115015
strcpy	strncpy
firstly strlcpy has never been intended as a secure version of strncpy and strncpy has never been intended as a secure version of strcpy

2115015
strcpy	strncpy
some programmers today get confused by its name and assume that strncpy is somehow supposed to serve as limited-length c-string copying function a secure sibling of strcpy which in reality is complete nonsense and leads to bad programming practice

2115019
nswindow	nsapplication
see for example nsapplication s and nswindow s methods relating to that concept. accessibility uses the same name so to make a single window frontmost set the value of its kaxmainattribute to kcfbooleantrue

2115021
lisp	scheme
i m wondering if it would be beneficial to start with scheme read the little schemer and sicp or some other lisp variant

2115030
apache	lighttpd
most web servers like apache lighttpd are configured to serve .html files as static files while .php files will have to first go through the php engine to be interpreted and only then delivered to the client

2115043
lisp	scheme
scheme is among the simplest of lisp variants and it s well-documented

2115068
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you don t want the things provided by qmainwindow you don t have to use it - you can use any qwidget subclass

2115070
lisp	scheme
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

2115070
lisp	scheme
in addition there are plenty of excellent resources on either common lisp or scheme so that shouldn t be the deciding point

2115072
strcpy	strncpy
when people say strcpy is dangerous use strncpy instead or similar statements about strcat etc. but i am going to use strcpy here as my focus they mean that there is no bounds checking in strcpy

2115077
memcpy	strcpy
drepper says we should somehow know the length and use memcpy and avoid string functions altogether the standards committee argues that the secure strcpy should return nonzero on truncation unless otherwise stated by the _truncate flag

2115099
lisp	scheme
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler

2115099
lisp	scheme
as you are new to lisp a good starting point will be teach yourself scheme in fixnum days by dorai sitaram

2115101
lisp	scheme
there really only are two common variants scheme and common lisp

2115113
division	multiplication
division and multiplication have the same precedence and have left-to-right associativity so this is parsed as

2115118
division	multiplication
since multiplication and division happen left to right that works out to

2115145
lisp	scheme
scheme and common lisp are standardized

2115188
beyondcompare	winmerge
then go on and call diff tools like beyondcompare or winmerge on the two temp directories

2115207
stateless	stateful
how about what is a session bean and describe some differences between stateless and stateful session beans

2115218
integer	unsigned
any code that uses a recent version of python extracts an integer in range 256 from each byte sums those integers and finally does should do the job assuming that your unsigned long is 32 bits wide

2115247
division	multiplication
now division and multiplication both have the same precedence in c but the associativity is left to right for both

2115247
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
also if u remember the old arithmetic rule of bodmas bracket off division multiplication addition subtraction this is the order of precedence then we do division first and then multiplication

2115253
yacc	bison
i am trying to build a parser with bison yacc to be able to parse a flow of token done by another module

2115317

my sticky footer works great in all the browsers expect safari google-chrome particularly the work.html page itself

2115339
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
afaik webkit-based safari google-chrome etc. firefox opera and ie 8 support some not all of the html 5 features

2115377
public	protected
fields are typically private or at the most protected internal or protected internal the term field is typically not used for anything public

2115394
division	modulo
so have looked at the obvious ways to recover i j from ij using division modulo expensive operation and using if statements breaks vectorization branch prediction problems .in the end i came up with the following using c-style comparisons

2115410
httprequest	httpresponse
httplib now http.client and friends all have conn.getresponse and an httpresponse class but the server-side operations of conn.getrequest and an httprequest class seem to be lacking

2115437
erlang	lisp
choosing lfe will give you both erlang and lisp at the same time

2115449
width	height
basically just setting the width and height attributes btw if it s opening in a new tab it s your browser that opens it that way not the javascript

2115475
octal	decimal
regular expression of nonnegative integer constants in c where numbers beginning with 0 are octal constants and other numbers are decimal constants

2115479
selecteditem	selectedindex
also you are setting both selecteditem and selectedindex

2115479
selecteditem	selectedindex
so to fix the problem after setting itemssource set either selecteditem or selectedindex depending on your requirements and your data model

2115483
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve got this working with xhtml 1.0 strict in firefox 3.x+ opera 9.x+ ie6+ but not in google-chrome 3.0.195.38 or safari 4.0.4

2115524
firefox	safari
the word-wrap property is supported in ie safari and firefox 3.5

2115527
google-chrome	safari
figure out where google-chrome and safari go silent by putting alerts before this ajax call

2115543
min	max
you can do this if you can keep track of the min and max value of the price during the time interval - this assumes that the time interval is not being constantly changed

2115543
min	max
one way of keeping track of the min and max values of a changing set of items is with two heaps placed back to back - you could store this and some pointers necessary to find and remove old items in one or two arrays in your store

2115543
min	max
min and max are available at constant cost

2115595
getter	setter
in order to provide a read-only property provide a getter use propget attribute and don t provide the setter propput

2115615
int	double
int double or string

2115645
client-side	server-side
the vs designer is not good at handling cases where your markup jumps between server-side and client-side script

2115689
cpu	hyperthreading
if you have a cpu with just one core leaving aside hyperthreading then your observation that only one thread is executing at a time is completely correct

2115701
post	get
first of all autocomplete calls a service uing get not post

2115705
cpu	hyperthreading
as well like others have suggested you probably have two cpu or a hyperthreading cpu at least

2115719
draggable	droppable
you would think that the draggable s stop -event would be called before the droppable s drop event though.

2115738
postgresql	mysql
db mysql server 5 postgresql server 8

2115816
put	get
if i use a different jpg i get the same kind of window and if i put an invalid filename in i get a very tiny window expected

tcpdf	fpdf
i thought all was lost until i learned about tcpdf and fpdf

2115856
button	checkbox
upon clicking the add row button i m able to create the second row dynamically which contains the checkbox state select and city select fields

2115862
selecteditem	selectedindex

2115880
factors	matrix
i m trying to do factors analysis for a co-occurrence matrix c which is computed from the term-document matrix td as follows

2115881
apache	nginx
afaik the only thing that is not server-independent is the rewriting of links as apache nginx iis and others all have different rewriting engines syntax

2115904
bluetooth	usb
what i ve found so far is that one just can send an at commands directly from terminal to special ports like dev ttyusb0 if modem is connected via usb port or dev rfcomm0 if connection is handled via bluetooth

2115935
cakephp	yii	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii
i have worked on many php frameworks such as zend framework cakephp codeigniter and yii

2115935
codeigniter	yii
yii unlike codeigniter works on php 5 only which gives it capabilities like auto loading of classes

2115956
eigenvalue	diagonal
if your matrix really is positive semidefinite then all of the eigenvalue the entries on the diagonal of d should be non-negative

2115956
factors	matrix
this is probably the test that your factors analysis algorithm is doing as well to see if the matrix is positive semidefinite.

2115995
width	height
my dilema is that the first time i load the page it works 100 but when i refresh it it seems to ignore the width and height set in the css file

2116067
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this same code works fine in safari firefox and opera

2116082

punctuation	words
the was removed stopword cat is now singular stemming punctuation is gone and the words are lower cased

2116138
post	get
then i have a couple of get post actions that deal with the dictionary

2116221
int	chars
a table of chars with their corresponding int values

2116221
int	chars
i can t really think of any other way the above can be done apart from having the chars value being converted to it s int counterpart opposite of current method or simply not having the conversion at all and have letter store

2116268
int	chars
there is nothing particularly inefficient about the way you are doing it but it certainly is possible to just convert between chars and int a chars is an int type

2116333
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby is great for being able to create applications that run on the clr because they give you the .net goodness with the speed of writing python or ruby

2116344
for-loop	loops
note that using a for-loop keeps all the logic of setting up testing and incrementing loops variable in one place

2116349
move	drag
now let the user drag on the screen and move the point the uiscrollview is looking at

2116378
int	chars
now to get an int value for a chars c you can do

2116400
vb.net	vb6
this msdn page seems to confirm that support was dropped from vb6 to vb.net

2116400
tolower	toupper
you would have to implement it yourself look around on the internet for some 3rd party code or preferrably rewrite the code to use string.format and or toupper tolower

2116414
folder	directory
if you mark rsc as a source folder eclipse will copy its contents to the output directory

2116415
udp	tcp
udp hole punching and tcp hole punching

portrait	landscape
however sometimes if i open the app holding the device in landscape then rotate to portrait launch the vc and then rotate the device no rotation occurs

2116484
inherited	subclassing
hibernate allows you to map inherited relationships like this in a number of ways - what you have here is called table per subclassing

2116514
uploadify	swfupload
i have tried two flash upload components swfupload and uploadify and both seem to generate posts with a filename parameter

python may have a main site but there are several slightly different implementations cpython ironpython jython python for s60 pypy unladen swallow cl-python .

2116517
lisp	scheme
at some point in time some dialects appear that pick up the state of art scheme for everything with functional programming in lisp in the 70s 80s and common lisp for everything maclisp-like in the 80s - that causes some dialects to disappear mostly namely standard lisp interlisp and others

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
this essentially causes the sql server to effectively bypass the rdbms storage sub-system and store the binary data directly on the underlying ntfs filesystems whist maintaining transactional integrity for this data from the rdbms perspective

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems instead of in the

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
this essentially says that using a sqlfilestream object will act almost identically to a standard filestream object except that sql server for transactional integrity purposes will act as a very lightweight gatekeeper or wrapper for your reading and writing of binary data to an underlying ntfs filesystems file

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
since no previous version of sql server has offered such functionality and direct integration with the underlying ntfs filesystems i d say that it would not be possible to implement a sqlfilestream against any version of sql server prior to sql server 2008

2116546
expander	grid
i ve just tested this method to retrieve the parent expander for a checkbox on one of my usercontrols it s several levels up the visual tree nested in a heap of stackpanels grid and dockpanels worked a treat

2116557
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
the cleanest approach would probably be to port cpython to produce native ironpython jython pypy extensions

2116561
maven	pom.xml
actually starting with version 2.0.9 maven uses the pom.xml order to build the classpath so you can manipulate it now

2116572
nunit	mstest
specflow depends on a unit-test framework and currently only nunit and mstest is supported

2116583

2116728
geocoding	geocode
that will set the base country for geocoding so that if you try to geocode plymouth it will distinguish between the uk and the massachusetts cities

2116807
implements	extends
you need to implements a tablemodel for example by extends the class abstracttablemodel or by to using a defaulttablemodel

2116831
children	parent
my problem is that the parent modules need to be included before the children

2116836
disk	ram
while writing code that doesn t waste resources is good craftsmanship and should be a human right ram and disk space are awfully cheap these days

2116907
children	parent
my problem is that the parent modules must be instantiated before the children

2116915
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
try pushing the child view controller from viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear

2116976
twitter	bit.ly
it uses bit.ly to shorten urls and forwards the user to their twitter login page

2116978

you probably want add the fadein fadeout effects you used and you might want to check the results of the http post request before deleting the form from the page

2116981
vb.net	vb6
i want to develop a software which restricts users internet access using vb6 or vb.net

2116988
octal	hex
by the way it is simple to convert hex x format or octal o format in mind

2116988
octal	hex
just place before eyes simple table of octal or hex symbols

2117049
capitalize	toupper
rewritemap capitalize int toupper

2117072
profiling	benchmarking
i d benchmarking it if i knew what to measure but my fear is that the problems may be more subtle than can be measured with a profiling

2117077
udp	tcp
grep cvs etc services says 2401 both tcp and udp

2117136
tabcontrol	tabitem
this is ok as it gives me a button in the tabcontrol to allow for deleting the current tabitem

2117143
serializable	deserialization
the java implementation in gwt of the rpc protocol in the packages com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc and com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.impl unfortunately only covers deserialization of requests and serializable of responses

2117144
vb.net	vb6
vbmigration.com have a commercial solution for migrating vb6 to vb.net

2117144
vb.net	vb6
their website documents various differences in behaviour between vb6 format and the vb.net versions including the ones in this question

2117170
profiling	benchmarking
for your benchmarking you can use jmeter + a profiling which should give you direct overview on the behaviour in such a heavy-loaded environment

2117268
websphere	ibm
migration between different versions of websphere might be somewhat more tricky but i m sure ibm published at least one redbook on that topic

2117295
put	get
if we were to put up a white flag and draw a line in the sand over such simple issues nothing would ever get done in large data processing projects

2117372
postgresql	mysql
i m used to using relational databases like mysql or postgresql and combined with mvc frameworks such as symfony ror or django and i think it works great

2117382
pylons	turbogears
frameworks like pylons turbogears and bfg use it as part of their api

2117406
folder	directory
if it is difficult to become that user you will want to copy the authorized_keys file and id_rsa or id_dsa file to the .ssh folder of the home directory of that user

2117415
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari end up on top in 5 out of 6 tests while ie8 ranks last for all tests except one

2117497
int	chars
by far the easiest solution is to realize that you can convert chars s to unsigned int s and unsigned int s to zz numbers

2117506
post	get
he suggests using two filters to handle data transfer between the post and the follwing get using tempdata

2117520
post	get
first you should follow the post redirect get pattern by returning a redirect result instead of a view after a successful post

2117523
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
update 2017-06-28 a good article from google-chrome developers discussing the state of math.random prng quality in google-chrome firefox and safari

cakephp	yii
anyone who disagree just can try a demo project with cakephp and yii and he will see how things are easier with them as crud form validation etc

2117655
cos	sin	cos	math.h	sin	math.h
functions like cos sin and tan are in the standard library and can be used by including math.h

2117688
cvs	svn
with the cvs and svn approach to merging if you did not manually copy your files before the update and it scrambled them on merge you have to manually re-edit to get back to a good state

2117697
getter	setter
of course things change when the property setter or getter does a little more than just wrapping the instance variable

2117723
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
making subclassing inherited superclass

2117723
inherited	subclassing
in the latter example assuming subclassing is a function you are saying that all new instances of subclassing should inherited ie

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
when i wrote above that subclassing inherited supertype using prototypical inherited i mean that all new instances of subclassing inherited from one particular instance of superclass not from the superclass type function itself

2117739
groovy	gpath	rss	feed
while trying to parse rss feed in groovy i found a gpath example using wildcards

2117749
dictionary	map
it needs a much larger dictionary to map backwards and has a lower chance of collision

2117802
hash	md5
bruce schneier wrote of the attack that w e already knew that md5 is a broken hash function and that no one should be using md5 anymore.

2117808
hash	md5
second off md5 is no longer secure as a cryptographic hash function indeed it is not even considered a cryptographic hash function anymore as the forked one points out

2117808
hash	md5
so if you ve got a ssl certificate with a md5 hash on it i can generate a duplicate certificate that says what i want that produces the same hash

2117808
hash	md5
thirdly similar to messages you can also generate different files that hash to the same value so using md5 as a file checksum is broken

2117826
post	get
here s a blog post to get you started on webcenter 11g

2117837
vim	textmate
a good solution which i use is to print from textmate via vim which gives you a syntax-highlighted and line-numbered result or however you choose to configure it. in addition to vim it requires ps2pdf but these are easy to install with macports etc

2117842
gif	png
i don t know the rest of your code but maybe you want someone to allow uploading png or gif images

2117847
implements	extends
its not abstract because whenever we create a new class it extends object class then if it was abstract you need to implements all the methods of object class which is overhead.

2117853
yslow	pagespeed
you re better of training them on yslow or pagespeed

2117877
width	height	min	max
min max width and height are accounted for as well as variable borderwidths

2117878
getter	setter
this gives you the freedom to change the simple field access to a more sophisticated getter setter method lateron without changing the interface of your class

2117879
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i modified the ajax call to grab a static html which i edited to various scenarios using 0 1 ... and it worked perfectly opera google-chrome firefox

2117882
google-chrome	safari
i have found that jquery window .width return a wrong value in safari and google-chrome

2117895
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but not in safari google-chrome

2117895
google-chrome	safari
what happens in safari and google-chrome is the handle of the slider when the page loads is non existent until you click on the slider rail and when it does appear it cannot be dragged hower you can still scroll by clicking along the slider rail

2117971
user-controls	tabcontrol
also you can have many user controls on one form so if you have a form with a tabcontrol that has 5 tabs the content of each tab could be a user-controls so instead of having hundreds of controls all mixed up in one form each user-controls has its own controls and validation logic and you end up with just six controls in the form the tabcontrol and the 5 user controls

2118040
getter	setter
doing this means that i only have to put a breakpoint in the getter setter of the property if i need to debug an issue with the instance variable rather then having potentially a lot of breakpoints scattered all over the code

2118041
post	get
i recently wrote a blog post on how to get mercurial running an http-based repository under nginx with fastcgi ubuntu 9.10

2118041
pull	push
just make sure that you pull changes down from the repository before you start your work and then push them back when you re done

2118050
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

2118080
children	parent
but that only works because reflectedclass has a parent object which is 1 concrete and 2 has a field to store the type for its children

2118246
inherited	subclassing
not only is there no need for it to be concrete but after some more reading i am convinced that object not being abstract is in conflict with the basic inherited model - we should not be allowing abstract subclassing of a concrete class since subclassing should only add functionality

2118255
free	malloc
as an alternative you can allocate the space you need with malloc as long as you will remember to free it when you don t need it anymore

2118259
hash	whirlpool
there is a hash function called whirlpool which builds on a derivate of rijndael rijndael being the initial name of what became the aes

2118264
apache	nginx
edit a quick http head request of one of the sites you listed shows me they are using nginx and not apache

2118264
apache	nginx
nginx probably has similar configuration capabilities as apache

2118294
cout	cin
you should look at how the and operators work for the stream classes cout and cin for example

2118358
hide	show
add each of the views in ib and lay them out on top of each other then show hide them

2118403
min	max
a backwards loop is one that goes from the max to the min

2118406
multiplication	modulo	addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	division	addition	division	modulo	division	multiplication
most typical operations like addition and multiplication can be reversed while modulo division can not be reversed

2118406
division	modulo
modulo division

2118406
division	modulo
with that being said one-way hash functions have the same mathematical quality as modulo division

2118406
division	modulo
first i found two numbers that when divided using modulo division gives me a number in the range between 1 and 1000 second i erased the original number and written on it the divisor from the pair of numbers second i chose a bus terminal that has a guard protecting the lockers from miscreants by only letting people try one locker a day with their key third the banker already knows the dividend so when he gets the key he can do the math and figure out the remainder and know which locker to open

2118560
firefox	safari
on the newest browsers firefox 3.5 safari 4 this works fine

2118582
post	get
if magic quotes are on php will automatically escape quotes coming in post or get variables and automatically un-escape them when pulling data out of a database for example

2118583
vbscript	jscript
your application can expose its properties through active scripting and write rules in vbscript jscript

2118607
gdal	ogr
currently ogr from gdal does not perform any recoding of character data during translation between vector formats

2118650
hide	show
the way around this is hide the select boxes when you want to show the overlaying div and un-hide them when the overlaying div goes away

2118719
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
firebird it s easier to administrate than postgresql and it does have various linux ports ubuntu fedora debian if you need n secure os selinux

2118734
post	get
if you still can t get it to work i would post a new question with the specifics of your problem - what you ve tried what you re expecting and what s happening instead

2118765
int	double
use the type double instead of int to get the value you re probably looking for

2118772
int	chars
the user should be able to enter as many chars as he wants as long as the text fits the decimal or int mold

2118831
inherited	properties
what you may have seen is different flavors of attempts to simulate class inherited by using the available inherited mechanism in javascript which is based on prototype objects sharing properties with linked instances

2118831
inherited	properties
very important the prototype properties used in this inherited mechanism is set on a function not directly on objects

2118831
inherited	properties
in simple english if you call new constructor where constructor is a function the operator creates a new object with a link to inherited properties from the constructor applies the constructor function to it and returns either the value returned by the constructor or the new object in case the constructor returned something else which is not an object

2118831
inherited	properties
second i want instances created with customarray to inherited array properties

2118852
profiling	debugging
i ve not used the remote debugging element of xdebug see above but the profiling code coverage and - in particular - improved browser error messages i find helpful

2118884
maven	pom.xml
what i have is maven pom.xml files which are set up when the branch is created and updated for each release from the branch

2118896
firefox	safari	safariwatir	firewatir	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it provides an abstract interface to browsers for testing including interfaces to internet explorer by default firefox firewatir google-chrome chromewatir and safari safariwatir - ie only on windows obviously and safari only on os x i m not sure i don t think they ve made it work with safari for windows

2118909
post	get
working with get and post data among other http communications is inherent in php development

2118916
int	double
that s accomplished by double clicking clicking the middle mouse button or using the dive option on the context menu -- all after having placed the mouse cursor on the variable int he source code pane or the stack frame pane

2118922
qtkit	quicktime
i currently have an application that should capture real-time video from a camera via qtkit which is based on quicktime but is cocoa and i would like to further process the frames via core image glsl shaders etc.

2118987
public	protected
a public makes a class member available to everyone protected makes the class member available to only itself and derived classes private makes the class member only available to the class itself

2118998
ubuntu	linux
note that to use this older version of ipp in a modern ubuntu you may need to get older versions of other libraries it depends on the requirements are listed in the release notes or even just run it under a chroot of a supported linux distro at least to test if it fixes your issue

2119016
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on mac it works great in firefox safari google-chrome

2119016
google-chrome	firefox
on windows i get a flickering effect on firefox and google-chrome

2119025
pdfbox	itextsharp
i m currently using itextsharp but i m open to other .net libraries pdfbox pdf clown etc...

2119057
int	double
is there some handy way to declare an int long double float string literal without having to use this format

2119060
audiotrack	audiorecord
i currently have code that reads a recording in from the devices mic using the audiorecord class and then playing it back out using the audiotrack class

2119061
int	chars
basically i want to convert a chars array containing 5 chars into an int however the 5th chars in the array is always a letter

2119063
salt	md5
this is relatively easy as the username is there in plaintext and the password is just md5 ed so no salt or anything to muddy up the waters

2119116
16-bit	64bit
all of the parameters are identical so it doesn t have anything to do with 16-bit vs 32-bit vs 64bit as far as i can tell

2119127
ffmpeg	libavformat
you could use libavformat and libavformat libraries behind ffmpeg to do the same thing but unless you need to do some processing on the raw audio before outputting to wav there would be nothing to gain except for knowledge

2119164
int	chars
atoi requires one chars argument and returns an int

2119166
int	chars
if you want to convert the first four chars of a string to an int do this

2119185
cout	cin
if you say its a pure console app i assume you re using std cout and std cin or other stuff from the c++ standard library

2119245
int	chars
if your compiler treated chars as signed by default the cast to int could result in negative values instead of the values from 128 to 255 and this is assuming that your chars s are 8-bit too

2119262
folder	directory
instead of adding a resource fork to the executable file you can simply create a special directory folder

2119267
int	chars
i think you re thinking about an int value overflowing a chars and therefore convert it to an int

2119268
int	boolean
int 0 is not strictly equal to boolean false even though they have the same value of 0

2119351
folder	directory
however i don t see my war file inside the webapps folder of tomcat home directory or for that matter its exploded format

2119394
pull	push
there is a git-to-svn bridge called appropriately enough git-svn which allows one to use git locally and then push pull to a remote svn server

2119424
mouse	keyboard
all of the keyboard and mouse messages fit that category

2119440
hash	md5
you may also try to generate file hash based on md5 and use it as checksum to validate jpeg data on various steps

2119472
subtract	add
if not what s the simplest way to add subtract an hour

2119478
sorting	grouping
add order by null to avoid the implicit sorting mysql does when doing a grouping by

2119488
min	max
so x y are given by the arg min of max d_i

2119498
integer	fractions
this will put brand new entries right at the top of the first page and then they will move slowly down the list over the course of the next 5 days i m assuming age is a fractions number not just an integer

2119524
jqplot	flot
flot is an open-source plotting library based on jquery like jqplot

2119575
nsstring	nsdata
if your plist data is not in a file you can also convert an nsdata object containing plist data to a dictionary with or convert an nsstring to a dictionary with

2119590
free	malloc
edit 2 fixed there was two free calls before and after malloc _ i feel so stupid now

2119621
pop-up	dialog
so when the user clicks into the color cell on a given row the dialog pop-up like this

2119701
textview	imageview
i have a simple linearlayout with one textview and one imageview

2119775
degrafa	flex
axiis - open source flex + degrafa - demos

2119820
multiplication	modulo	for-loop	loops	division	modulo	division	multiplication
to generate the multiplication table of 1-9 with a single for-loop you could loops 81 time and use the division and modulo to get the two operands

2119889
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
in all the source files where you use malloc realloc and free

2119889
free	malloc
based upon your edit it could be that you re changing tex after malloc and then passing that value to free

2119892
google-chrome	firefox
it s quite a bit faster in google-chrome than firefox i haven t tested it in any other browsers

2119895
put	get
using hashmap would destroy any attempt to order by in your sql since you are not guaranteed to get back the order you put the items

2119896
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so if they are using ie8 without the latest security patch or if they are using firefox 3.0 instead of 3.5 or 3.6 at this point or using an older version of safari google-chrome when a newer stable version has been released

2119936
maven	m2e
the maven plugin m2e integrates most poorly with eclipse

2119951
ggplot2	lattice
adding direct labels to ggplot2 and lattice plots

2120017
serializable	deserialization
they handled xml serializable and deserialization of the actual values that were stored in the properties they were representing

2120069
jython	jacl
don t use jacl since was 7 only uses jython

2120113
ant	maven
.you need to hire a special maven guru which you don t for ant

2120113
versioning	upgrade
i personally don t upgrade to newer versioning of open source frameworks blindly without seeing the need to do so

2120130
16-bit	64bit
my word list is about 100 000 words so about 16-bit per word which for four words gives a 64bit keyspace

2120171
interbase	firebird
my understanding is that in keeping with interbase v6 firebird 2.5 does not support the sql-92 interval keyword

2120175
dlsym	dlopen
on windows this is done using loadlibrary getprocaddress and on posix systems using dlsym dlopen

2120183
onclick	onsubmit
the onclick attribute of the uicommand component and the onsubmit attribute of the uiform component should not return false or cause a javascript error

2120183
primefaces	tomahawk
for tomahawk check this answer and for primefaces check this answer

2120283
fseek	ftell
if the line-size if fixed then you could use fseek and ftell to move to the end of the file

2120286
put	get
in oracle the constraints get default names if not specified however in mysql i don t know i think i heard once that if you don t specify a name for the constraint mysql will not put a default one

2120291
put	get
i couldn t get this to work so i put alert imagebrowsercontent

2120339
min	max
aggregates part 1 count sum max min

2120340
int	chars
unfortunately two of the return types are chars and int which are not classes in first place

2120422
config	ini
as for your config i would suggest using an .ini file for your config because php has a built-in ini parser see the parse_ini_file function

2120422
config	ini
this would be consistent with php s choice of ini file format for its own config php.ini

2120424
config	ini
and lastly we test storing config parameters in an ini file or in a php file as an associative array

2120443
wordpress	joomla
just read about a benchmark where joomla drupal wordpress plone3 4 had been tested

2120499
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.6 and google-chrome error out on this line and refuse to include the rest of the combined css file

2120499
google-chrome	firefox
i m developing a webapp for ie6 unfortunately but also using firefox and google-chrome on the side

2120499
google-chrome	firefox
they were rendering fine in ie6 ie7 and firefox 3.5 but after upgrading to firefox 3.6 it now looks the same as google-chrome

2120499
google-chrome	firefox
and here s what it looks like in google-chrome and firefox 3.6

2120499
firefox3.6	google-chrome
firefox3.6 google-chrome vince so firefox.png

2120527
int	chars
in c single quotes are used to denote single literal chars constants and the resulting type of such constants is int

2120533
vim	emacs
i ve tried to migrate to emacs several times for clojure development following a variety of blogposts screencast and tutorials but somewhere along the way something always went wrong - keybindings that didn t work incompatible versions etc and i found myself scrambling back to vim

2120533
paredit	slime
but i know i want paredit and slime

2120554
getter	setter
of course if you want a getter and a setter and you don t need any extra processing just pure java-bean-like get set youc an do this

2120596
firefox	safari
to work in safari and firefox but not ie7 or ie8

2120637
config	ini
this is not answering your question but in my opinion a better way to deal with config is actually to use a real config file like an ini or xml file

2120645
cvs	svn
as there is a base copy exists while merging files in a repository cvs merge svn merge can auto-merge the changes

2120660
addition	multiplication
i would first implement addition as your algorithm for multiplication might use addition as an auxiliary

2120674
multiplying	addition
multiplying as your example by appending zeroes and calling the addition method per step so for multiplying with 20 append the 0 and addd that number twice

2120674
addition	multiplication
implement multiplication by repeated addition like in your example

2120695
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i don t think asp.net asp.net-mvc assembly itself has html.actionlink with the control as its template the template version you are using it only has html.actionlink you may need to find some other assembly to support that function

2120723
int	double
what s much worse is that you re then passing those double to printf with the d conversion so it s trying to treat the as int instead of double you d print a double with f

2120743
prepare	execute
logging prepare statements will not contain the bound data and if more than simple inserts are execute you might be forced to implement parts of sql to reproduce what you recorded

2120804
fossil	git
from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database

2120842
maven	pom.xml
when i merge maven projects i use tortoisesvn and deselect the changes to the pom.xml done by the release plugin so it does not try to merge in the version changes

2120846
sorting	filtering
i also require the sorting and filtering apply to the parent elements only based on their own data

2120846
children	parent
any visible parent can show their children and the children never sort

2120846
children	parent
my two-stage solution is first to process the data by iterating through it and creating an array of parent elements and adding a children array property to them that holds the child elements

2120846
children	parent	sorting	filtering
next i apply any sorting and filtering to the parent array perhaps by using an arraycollection wrapper and iterate through the parent copying the visible ones and their children if the parent is marked expanded to a display array

2120846
children	parent
a custom item renderer will indent the children and change the expanded property of the parent elements which will regenerate the display array

2120958
hide	show
im trying to show and hide a div element with the jquery toggle method

2120963
bluej	jcreator
you d better use an ide - for educational purposes there s bluej and jcreator

2120978
int	chars
parse it into an int using integer.parseint string 16 then cast it to a chars

2121008
stdout	stderr
a somewhat a better option is to let nohup run your script and redirect the output both stdout and stderr to nohup.out

2121008
put	get
make sure you use proper shell escaping there i just put it between apostrophes but the braces might need other escaping this way you only suppress occurences of this particular message from stdout but let all other messages get through

2121046
int	chars
apparently there s a view function expecting a string containing only digits but for some reason that string contains literal chars and made his way to a int constructor

2121091
hash	hmac
i notice for instance that the java code implies you are using a sha1-based hmac whereas the .net code implies you are using an unkeyed sha1 hash to generate the key

2121093
sorting	grouping
this file is used to grab multiple items of manufacturing flows up to 4 different set ups with a total of up to 10 distinct flows of up to 1000 steps each with the information being flow specific sub-flow specific for grouping sorting purposes and data such as movements inventory ct ...

2121129
getter	setter
the contenttemplate can be an itemplate property with a getter setter while the other you could maybe take advantage of the listitemcollection class

2121132
client-side	server-side
i am using client-side and server-side certificates with message security

2121177
getter	setter
a simple set of public variables in a class is faster than using getter and setter

2121182
int	double
in fact a double sounds like it d be double the regular size and if you think of int as a good baseline than a double is indeed double the size of an int

2121195
int	chars	int	double
note that both alice and bob changed the type of bar from int except alice made it chars and bob made it double

2121202
equals	tostring
it can be tempting to use case classes because you want free tostring equals hashcode

2121299
width	height
width 100 height 100

2121325
pull	push
only use git push and git pull to synchronise with repo

2121325
pull	push
that s the usage of git pull and git push

2121325
pull	push
before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean

2121459
atomic	interlocked
the interlocked operations the lock prefix allow multiple operations to be atomic

2121466
accessor	properties
instance variables can be turned into properties by adding accessor mutator methods as follows

2121475
switching	screens
remove current window address bar and tabs switching browser to full screens view equivalent to pressing f11

2121481
post	get
i ve managed to get it serving up get requests just fine but post continues to elude me

2121499
hide	show
the content script has full access to the page dom so you can easily hide or dim it and show a warning

2121501
post	get
now that your data transfer object is serializable into at least one xml based format you could do a post translation step to get it into the format you want using xslt transforms

2121609
yslow	pagespeed
edit i should have mentioned that i ve been through yslow pagespeed and chrome s developer tool

2121639
mouse	keyboard
you don t want to stop accepting keyboard input or mouse input and tell the user just a moment i want to finish this computation it will only be a few more seconds. and yet its amazing how many times commercial programs do this

2121648
opera	firefox
normal browsers like opera or firefox supports w3c event model while ie supports its own - so once again - google for cross-browser solution

2121656
jstl	taglib
i am not sure how i should interpret your wording coding horror application but i bet that you already know that using jstl sql taglib for other purposes than quick prototyping is considered a very bad practice

2121670
ant	maven
and please don t ask me to use maven ant or any project-building tool unless it is the only way to do this

2121695
apache	nginx
the https configuration you need to change is in your web server apache nginx etc config

uilabel	uitextview
i have a custom uitableviewcell with a uilabel and a uitextview in it

2121759
uilabel	uitextview
it s obviously very simple to set the highlightedtextcolor of the uilabel but the uitextview doesn t seem to have any similar type of property

2121785
textview	imageview
my layout design is a textview with long text and a imageview to the right of the textview

2121814
clisp	ecl
free common lisp implementations include cmu cl sbcl openmcl clozure cl clisp gcl and ecl

2121814
lisp	scheme
with regards to scheme and common lisp although admittedly an inaccurate analogy there are times when i would consider scheme is to common lisp what c is to c++ while scheme and c are small and elegant common lisp and c++ are large and arguably more suited for larger applications

2121836
trojan	virus
to sum up i do not think you can and it would be unwise to do so it could be perceived as if the system is under a threat by a trojan or a virus as a result if attempting to do so not alone that as a user i would not like for a program to modify the system environment variable without my consent

2121871
google-chrome	firefox
on the homepage i have two videos #intro_video #video_container which under google-chrome i have no problems but in firefox and ie the video doesn t play

2121874
folder	directory
i ve recently changed my program s directory layout before i had all my modules inside the main folder

2121913
salt	md5
and i am aware i shouldnt do md5 salt + password

2121916
getter	setter
the value object is a custom class with some setter and getter and i want to set a property based of the value of the selecteditem of the combo so inside the value object i have something like this

2121961
onresume	onpause
the strange thing is that all of that happens despite the fact that i do not intercept any back key hits or override any onpause or onresume methods

2121972
disk	ram
the sql engine is just one part of the equation ram disk io subsystem san cpus fibre etc etc all have to be included

2122055
getter	setter
you can create pseudoproperty getter and setter which accepts returns the serialized form and annotate the familymembers with transient

2122147
put	get
before posting the form get the data from the editor and put in the hidden field

min	max
from what i understand the values of any parameter example stringlength min max value have to be truly static

2122237
maven	m2e
look for something like that in your settings.xml or in global settings used by m2e windows preferences maven installations or in a project profile

2122283
memcached	apc
combining technology like the apc cache or memcached with php and mysql is also practically required for high-performance php applications

2122378
inherited	properties
therefore as long as the basic elements are there inherited class properties etc it will always be viable to write in that coding style

2122379
iboutlet	ibaction
i have a logcontroller that has access to all these items via iboutlet and ibaction

2122428
clang	llvm
while xcode tools still has a command-line c++ compiler i recent versions of os x i think 10.7 and later have switched to clang llvm mostly because apple wants all the benefits of open source without having to contribute back and clang is bsd licensed

2122428
fink	macports
so in order to get g++ you ll have to use something like fink basically debian s apt system for os x darwin or macports basically openbsds ports system for os x darwin to get it

2122526
versioning	upgrade
however the more you delay the upgrade of the versioning you use the harder it is the next time round a new release comes

nunit	moq	nunit	mspec	moq	mspec
i m currently working on a project where i m unit testing with nunit mocking with moq writing specifications with mspec and playing around with testing the ui with webaii

2122588
int	double
i would also suggest using int instead of double if possible

2122589
post	get
if you think you are maybe using too much you could identify the larger allocations using the instruments tools run with performance tool from within xcode and then post that chunk of code here to get ideas of how to reduce it

2122613
client-side	server-side
no matter how you decide this for the server-side you can easily consume webservices and wcf services using only wcf on the client-side

2122614
int	chars
be aware that types like int or chars aren t necessarily the correct bit-width

2122698
client-side	server-side
you cannot mix server-side code php with client-side code that way

2122826
treelist	grid
dev.express quantum tree list if you know the grid component you can use this component as well treelist and grid combined

2122878
getter	setter
so annotate it s getter with lob i would make the getter and setter private to not expose them

2122878
getter	setter
then expose fake getter and setter to return or set a from the

2122917
width	height
you could also have a look at the buttontext buttonimg hidebutton rollover width height cancelimg options that should allow you to style the button according to your requirements

2122918
submit	submission
how do i make it so that the vote submit button go away after submission it once

2122945
post	get
if your server has magic_quotes_gpc enabled disable it or at least filter your get post cookie data to its raw value

2122952
firefox	safari
this has worked fine on many permutations of firefox safari windows and mac os x but then yesterday we discovered problems with ie 7 on windows xp

2122956
affinity	processors
use powershell to set the processors affinity for one or more running processes

2123074
put	get
either set the highlighted selected color code or ib or do what the above poster suggested except you need to put it inside an if statement since that code sets the text even if the cells get sent a deselected value

2123081
vim	notepad++
i recently changed from notepad++ to vim

2123081
vim	notepad++
in vim there are also tabs but when i use them i feel like i m just going back to my notepad++ way of managing my files

2123084
innodb	myisam
mysql works with two known db engines myisam and innodb

2123113
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve tried this but cant seem to get it right i get a iqueryable - ienumerable cast error

2123169
nerdtree	fuzzyfinder
now i ve returned to buffers and for navigating files and buffers i use only the nerdtree and fuzzyfinder i guess ex textmate users may prefer fuzzyfinder_textmate plugins both are great

2123169
nerdtree	fuzzyfinder
for locating files i use either nerdtree bound to n or fuzzyfinder s file mode

2123213
post	get
this change causes the autocomplete script will now send form data by post rather then get

2123282
post	get
the trick is to use post instead of get when using get gets erased but when using post complete thing is passed so the autocomplete needs some adjustments extra one line here it is

2123345
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve tried this but cant seem to get it right i get a iqueryable - ienumerable cast error

2123414
int	boolean
incremented boolean decremented boolean changed_by int user_id post_id int

2123430
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i know about wsdl.exe and svcutil.exe - but not too familiar with what s what

2123439
put	get
the funny thing is if i put a file in the same directory with a different extension .txt for example and try to load that it doesn t get treated as an action

2123453
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
the wsdl.exe is the deprecated utility to convert a wsdl file into a asmx asp.net webservice stub - don t use that anymore use svcutil.exe or visual studio s add service reference for wcf

2123490
elf	coff
some compilers spit out coff others spit out elf etc

2123527
hide	show
on the show function i am trying to hide the txtemail box but it doesnt seem to be able to find it

2123528
stdout	fflush
stdout is line-buffered when connected to a terminal but i remember reading somewhere that reading at least from stdin will automatically fflush stdout

2123528
stdout	fflush
would need an extra fflush stdout

2123543
put	get
this can happen when you attempt to put get or delete too many entities or an entity with too many properties or if the datastore is overloaded or having trouble.

2123545
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout

2123547
stdout	fflush
to answer your question you do need the extra fflush stdout

2123547
stdout	fflush
reading from stdin doesn t fflush stdout

2123560
hide	show
i believe that the ajax call hasn t completed by the time the show method is invoked and thus the element doesn t exist at the time that you are going to hide it

2123572
stdout	fflush
you need to explicity fflush stdout in order for the buffered data in the video memory unix terminal s memory to be pushed out on to a view device such as a terminal

2123572
stdout	fflush
edit thanks jonathan to answer the question reading from stdin does not fflush stdout

2123575
pull	push
application instance may pull data from sensor or sensor can push data to an application instance but controller is the one who will control which application instance is linked to which set of sensors

2123649
nunit	mstest
normally with nunit i d use a generic or parametrised fixture but i m not sure whether mstest has similar capabilities

2123725
folder	directory
how would i take a file in the application s directory the same folder the .app is in and get it s absolute path

2123728
width	height
i have 2 sections of my website i am developing a reference box that has a fixed width and a working box that has the same height as the content

2123760
min	max
this article gives a detailed explanation of min max and the alpha beta search algorithms including c# code examples of both

2123784
drive	createfile
with the right permissions administrator has them you can use win32 createfile and related functions to access physical drive and logical partitions directly

2123825
g++	gcc
also see this duplicate similar question for g++ gcc

2123837
inherited	subclassing
version is a class method of nsobject so all subclassing of nsobject inherited it

2123870
jar	war
your last assertion is wrong your exported resources can and should be copied to b war web-inf lib as a jar file

2123888
equals	gethashcode
i have a class a that implements iequatable using its fields say a.b and a.c for implementing overriding equals and overriding gethashcode and everything works fine 99 of the time

2123888
equals	gethashcode
they can all be stored together in a dictionary dictionary thus it s convenient when they all carry their own default equals gethashcode

2123888
equals	gethashcode
in that case i don t want to use the default equals gethashcode overrides provided by a

2123888
equals	gethashcode
thus i was thinking of implementing a referenceequalitycomparer that s meant to force the use of object s equals gethashcode

2123888
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
one way of course would be for a to not implement iequatable and always supply an iequalitycomparer to any dictionary that i create but i m hoping for a different answer

2123916
post	get
you could also do this in r with a combination of something like rcurl or xml to get the blog post and something like igraph for the sna

2123918
rss	feed
i know that rss feed is news...is it possible to get rss feed s from yesterday or day before yesterday... more exactly archive of rss feed

2123928
rss	feed
your rss server might be configured to let you have more posts by supplying arguments to the feed url - but thats unlikely

2123938
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit i want a fix on ie so it does the same thing as firefox google-chrome safari etc

2123971
zlib	libz
libz zlib compression headers

2123972
ready	each
it looks strange to me to include each request parameter on each answer but it is the only solution i found to create a stateless api ready to be called asynchronous

2123977
width	height
where w and h are the width x and height y of the grid respectively

2124022
many-to-many	one-to-many
a has a one-to-many relationship with b and b has a many-to-many relationship with c

2124023
jar	war
the advantage of this approach is that you use the ivy conf attribute of each project dependency to ultimately decide if the jar gets included within the war file or not

2124046
portrait	landscape
i ve seen references to being able to specify two separate layout xml files for an activity one for portrait and one for landscape

2124065
spweb	spsite
i want to know whats the best method of instantiating spsite and spweb objects

2124104
rsa	aes
if jce supports the algorithms you want to use and it does support aes and rsa switching to bouncycastle is extra hassle with no benefit

2124138
width	height
i have a requirement to have a small form with some text boxes on them and a button at the end which with a specified aspect ratio in hidden textbox enable the user to type in a value into the width box for example and when the user changes the value the height textbox will change also..also when you type in the height box the width will change

2124143
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the text links are correctly vertical aligned in safari and google-chrome and so are the image links but in firefox 3.5 the text links are slightly out of position a bit towards the bottom

2124212
post	get
but shows how to get the post data during an input stream after the initial http headers

2124231
google-chrome	firefox
this was tested in firefox google-chrome and ie 7 but it should work all modern browsers

2124247
strdup	strncpy
you need to copy the string using strncpy or duplicate it using strdup

2124364
multibyte	substr
the reason is that you use utf-8 it s multibyte encoding and substr works with singlebyte only

2124415
abc	subclassing
another usage is if you somehow want to specify that an object implements a specific interface and you can use abc s for that too by subclassing from them

2124459
ninject	spring.net
ninject or more advanced frameworks enterprise library spring.net

2124468
hash	md5
i am so convinced that i saw an override of a hash function that allowed me to calculate a md5 or other hash at the same time as writing ie calculating the hash of one buffer then feeding that resulting hash into the next iteration

2124476
inherited	subclassing
the more tragic flaw however is the new subclassing brings with it all the baggage and opinion of the inherited chain

2124563
folder	directory
the .subversion directory in you home folder is only intended for settings

2124609
int	chars
static void uinttobytes unsigned int theuint chars bytes

2124609
int	chars
static unsigned int bytestouint chars bytes

2124630
width	height
i have a with table-layout set to fixed so that all explicit width height definitions are respected no matter what

2124645
spaces	delimiter
this is a spaces delimiter list of elements where each row represents something i don t know and it just gets forced into a fortran model shudder

2124649
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick multi-threaded derivative from imagemagick

2124675
width	height
you can use height and width attributes

2124691
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
check graphicsmagick which is multi-threaded toolkit derived from imagemagick available under x11-style license

2124775
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there are two browsers or http clients in this scenario the one that is giving you the result you want ex. firefox ie google-chrome or safari and the one that is not giving you the result you want ex. lwp wget or curl

2124782
cvs	svn
i adopted the technique of using source control first with cvs and then with svn to synch and backup my environments around ten years ago probably more

2124923
chown	chmod
should it try to chown chmod the file

2124938
post	get
when i get this working i ll post the code to my blog and an update to this thread

2124958
vim	emacs
simply edit and save the file in vim or emacs switch back to your editor and hit compile

2124962
implements	extends
the other problem with using abstract classes is that you can then no longer implements mixins that is you can implements multiple interfaces however you can only extends one abstract class

2124967
udp	tcp
you have unix functions for tcp udp communication and you have windows functions for tcp udb communication

2124970
int	chars
just like after declaring the value of an int you might later set its value after declaring a pointer to chars you might later set its value to be a valid memory address that contains a chars -- or sequence of chars -- that you are interested in

2124978
subclass	abstract-class
i would advocate the use of abstract-class more in situations where you wish to provide a partial implementation of a class possibly delegating some behavior to concrete subclass implementations

2125020
joptionpane	jdialog
so we have to create the joptionpane and the jdialog by hand

2125022
chown	chmod
i would go with eilon s answer for the most part but would add the following caveat - i would not try to chown chmod a file unless you really need to if the purpose of your program is managing file permissions or acting as an installer of some sort

2125022
chown	chmod
this is because a your attempted chmod chown may not work and b your application should respect the user privileges with which it is run - if these are not sufficient you should inform the user via whatever mechanism you do this

2125126
min	max
i want to define a min and max methods in a utils class

2125145
min	max
time shows total for 100 000 10 calls avg min max show time for 100 000 calls

2125150
folder	directory
extracted the downloaded archive into my home directory ungzipping untarring the archive will create a folder called libmagic

2125203
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick multi-threaded derivative from imagemagick

2125204
width	height
the constants were all legit so i cranked down the width and height params to very small and succeeded here

2125215
maven	pom.xml
i ve just recently started writing maven plugins and was wondering if there is a common way to modify the values within the pom.xml file changing an artifacts version number

2125236
lisp	scheme
i was in your position and split my attention between scheme and common lisp

2125271
min	max
since you aren t using the os x implementation of objective-c you may not have access to the predefined min and max macros

2125302
min	max
as richard corden pointed use c++ functions min and max defined in std namespace

2125302
min	max
if you find that c++ library you use defines min max as macros as well it may cause conflicts then you can prevent unwanted macro substitution calling the min max functions this way notice extra brackets

2125329
put	get
we are going to put the stdgen instance in a state monad then provide some sugar over the state monad s get and set method to give us random numbers

2125329
put	get
we use get to get the stdgen and we use put to install a new state

2125330
put	get
if i put the has_alpha at location2 i get

2125337
organization	naming
subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organization s own internal naming conventions

2125356
google-chrome	firefox
this works great on firefox and google-chrome but ie gives me a javascript error

2125386
hash	md5
i should add however that md5 is a hash algorithm which is a one-way process which generates a unique string on each input collisions aside

2125401
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 and google-chrome and firefox but ie8

2125412
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
other browsers firefox opera google-chrome ignore the css file and render the page without styling

2125424
webkit	gecko
same goes probably for the other gecko webkit based browsers

2125429
int	chars
that is simple enough furthermore with the ansi c standard the size of a chars data type is 1 byte which can explain how the runtime can obtain the value of this semantic assuming cnt is an int eger and has a value of 3 for example the runtime steps up by one automatically and counting from zero the value of the offset is t

2125429
free	malloc
yes the block of memory is free up and handed back to the runtime environment for use by another upcoming code execution of malloc

2125429
free	malloc
also remember this for every malloc there is a corresponding free if there is no corresponding free you have a memory leak in which memory is allocated but not free up

2125445
post	get
using sessions you can store the parameters on the server and avoid sending sensitive data with get or post both are insecure

2125481
postgresql	mysql
if you use sqlite as a database you don t even need to setup mysql or postgresql

2125485
int	boolean
derived1 has a constructor taking a int and derived2 a constructor taking a boolean

2125491
config	ini
i have put a config ini file config.ini for reading and writing to from my c# program the thing is if the user has uac enabled then for some weird reasons the program doesn t read or write to the file but it managed to create the file but cannot read or write to it

2125532
width	height
what i mean by victim is that the height and width of a text box is the sum of the height width properties assigned above in addition to the padding height width and the border width

2125534
width	height
elements can be sized with the height and width attributes

2125536
ienumerable	ienumerator
recently erik meijer and others have show how iobservable iobserver is the dual of ienumerable ienumerator

2125552
cvs	svn
select a version control system cvs or svn to be honest cvs would suit this particular use case better by the sounds of it and then set up build triggers on finalbuilder so that checkins cause a compile and send the results back to you

2125591
int	double
value types such as int etc live on the stack reference types live on the managed heap however if a reference type has for example has an instance variable of type double it will live along with its object on the heap

2125633
int	chars
two and this is something weird i ve tried out once if and only if your identifier strings fit in 4 chars as in all your examples and they are ansi strings not unicode strings you can map strings to int directly

2125639
accessor	properties
properties accessor

2125643
post	put
the documentation says that the file should reside on the pythonpath and i ve seen several blog post inviting to just put the file in the root directory of the project

2125649
many-to-many	one-to-many
you can form a one-to-many in one of the two directions but in order to get a true many-to-many you need something like

2125674
int	chars
i see this line the type a where chars is substituted for the type parameter a and i want to know why i can t substitute it for this the type a where int is substituted for the type parameter a

2125681
typedef	struct
you don t need to typedef struct in c++ just is sufficient

2125698
integer	unsigned
this declares a function that takes two arguments - an integer and a pointer to unsigned probably large integer and returns an integer

2125698
integer	unsigned
size_t is unsigned integer type usually a typedef returned by sizeof operator

2125743
datamapper	activerecord
it would need to be significantly more sophisticated than that since the apis are quite different between datamapper and activerecord

2125769
int	chars
here s what ghci says about int chars and string

2125769
int	chars
int and chars are both simple types without type variable parameters

2125865
web.py	pylons	django	web.py
i ve looked at the full mvc frameworks such as django and more basic ones such web.py and pylons

2125916
simplecursoradapter	spinner
i would query your database and get a cursor wrap that cursor in a simplecursoradapter and call setadapter on your spinner instance passing it the simplecursoradapter instance

2125936
installation	upgrade
so i started about a week ago learning x86 assembly in that time i upgrade my computer to 8gb ram so obviusly my x86 windows xp installation was wasting up all that memory now i m running a x64 windows 7 copy so the question is

2125953
button	checkbox
i have several checkbox 4 and only one at all times can be selected to show off associated radio button as a group of 6

2125965
pop-up	dialog
a virus checker needs to be able to access every file on the filesystem which the current user may not be able to do but it also needs to provide info to the user in the form of notification dialog pop-up and a tool tray icon

2125972
hash	md5
as far as i know using sha-2 is a better more secure way than md5 or even sha-1 to hash your passwords

2126025
jobs	cron
unfortunately that s probably not an option you d have if this is on a managed host that doesn t give you the ability to set up cron jobs

2126028
firefox	safari
these two documents display differently in firefox even though they have the same contents safari appears to treat them the same so this extent of this problem varies between different browsers

2126052
nant	cruisecontrol
a previous poster mentioned using cruisecontrol with nant

2126064
ienumerable	ilist
i would recommend typing your properties that you expose as ilist or ienumerable generic or not your choice rather than observablecollection since it ties you into that implementation and there are a number of situations that this becomes annoying

2126070
inherited	properties
or you can use the user properties of system.web.mvc.controller that is inherited to your controllers note be sure to call formsauthentication.setauthcookie method when successfully validate your user login

2126075
hide	show
i have a ajax.request in which i use onloading and oncomplete to show and hide a load animation gif

2126099
datamapper	activerecord
i m in the process of replacing activerecord with datamapper in one of my apps

2126099
datamapper	activerecord
since there aren t any authentication solutions that are compatable with datamapper i m thinking that i could use activerecord just for user authentication and then use datamapper everywhere else

2126115
libevent	epoll
i have searched for support for libevent libev raw epoll kqueue but i don t see much

2126138
implements	extends
i built a plugin that supplies a custom artifact call it foo and supplies a script to let the developer make new instances myfoo yourfoo and i have the artifact template extends a base class could implements an interface

2126164
children	parent
the reason for this is there are numerous such relationships and explicitly specifying the relationship for all these children will mean continually updating and polluting the parent objects

2126173
datamapper	activerecord
however when you use them on the same table you should be aware that the caching mechanisms that are used for loading records may break if you modify a user with datamapper and then access it again with activerecord

2126190
int	double
try to convert int type to double type using cdbl function

2126208
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
over the years i have used rcs cvs and - for the last 5 years - svn

2126208
cvs	rcs
back 13 years ago when i primarily used cvs and rcs large projects went into cvs and one-offs were edited in place on the specific server and stored in rcs

2126253
textile	bbcode
other sites support textile or bbcode

2126268
virtualenv	setuptools
additional packages virtualenv setuptools easy_install pip

2126345
mouse	keyboard
using event taps for this purpose is inherently a bad idea because the user can change where he she is typing with the mouse as well as the keyboard

2126370
textarea	textbox
if you want multiline text input you should be using textarea not input textbox

2126382
children	parent
children of a given parent and replace

2126401
cpu	processors
cpu utilization in this context is the proportion of the total available processors cycles that are consumed by each process

2126435
integer	unsigned
this resulting value is printed as unsigned integer which works because int and unsigned are same size

2126488
width	margin
work out how many li s would fit into that width taking into account the margin and padding of #list-wrap

2126494
cpu	affinity
for example say you wanted to make sure that an application is never using more than 50 of the computing power of a dual-core machine i m not saying it s a good thing to do i m just giving an example then there s a very easy way to do it you could set the cpu affinity of your program to only one of the two cores

2126494
cpu	affinity
note that i don t recommend to do it in your case all i m saying here is for the sake of completeness that it exists it has valid uses and there s a reason why both linux and windows developers have written apis and end-user commands allowing to set the cpu affinity on a per-process basis these functionalities are fully available both to programmers and to end-users

2126503
mouse	keyboard
if the application don t process wm_char etc windows messages xinput directinput your best bet is to make a dll to inject into the app overriding some of the functions cause those use directly the system resources to access the keyboard mouse gamepad

2126524
profiling	debugging
beside using print_r or vardump you should consider using firephp or php quick profiling to help you debugging and displaying variable s value

2126526
profiling	debugging
beside using print_r or vardump you should consider using firephp or php quick profiling to help you debugging and displaying variable s value

2126531
wicket	appfuse	appfuse	spring
so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse light but you didn t mention them and they are third-party projects

2126541
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu and tried to use xerces

2126545
ubuntu	linux
in x ubuntu s file manager my application appears with the default linux executable icon which i would like to replace with my own

2126564
webkit	gecko
i mean it wouldn t be that hard to slap whatever interface you want on your browser so long as you plugin gecko webkit presto trident whatever to handle the backend.

2126614
x86	64bit
the alignment of 32 bit numbers with x86 architecture or 64bit with x64 architecture is called data structure alignment

the empty httpresponse at the end there sends back a status code of 200 ok so that the browser or other server that connects to your endpoint knows the request was completed

2131303
wordpress	joomla
i ve tried joomla drupal and wordpress but still had a dirty feeling in my mouth that i was failing by using cake just for the sake of it or vice versa

2131333
wsimport	jaxws-maven-plugin
the jaxws-maven-plugin wsimport mojo is bound by default to the generate-sources life cycle phase so running any phase posterior to generate-sources will trigger the jaxws wsimport goal

ubuntu	linux
since i m in ubuntu i could create them on tmp whatever but what would work only in linux

2131365
jdom	xom	xstream	xom	xstream	jdom
my idea if there is no code for this is to search for the pom dictionary to cover all elements and create a xml file with a given pom object that i had previously filled with the data i am provided using an xml generator such as jdom xom or xstream

2131365
maven	pom.xml
ps i have read that the eclipse project is doing some maven things and that has an api that generates a pom.xml file for the actual project you have

2131375
vim	emacs
rails doesn t really need an ide for development you can use any decent text editor but there are rails plugins for ides like eclipse and editors like vim or emacs

2131384
mockups	balsamiq
the above mockups created with balsamiq mockups is a great example all the most common components are available to use and best of all there is only one good-looking style to choose from

2131384
extjs	qooxdoo
after a very careful consideration of all the ui libraries suggested i ve come to the conclusion that extjs and qooxdoo are the ones that most closely fit my needs

2131397
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen and dlsym don t provide any facilities for assigning where to load the so file

2131445
put	get
i ll put in the stacktrace it is really any of the databound controls from what i understand out of the stacktrace it is a textbox - i do not get framework source stepping enabled so i can not figure out what textbox breaks here

2131549
m2e	pom.xml
see guide for creating a pom.xml for an existing project using m2e

2131625
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you will have plenty of choices to replace iis for example apache with mod_mono nginx or lighttpd

2131625
postgresql	mysql
instead of sql server you can use mainstream rdbmss like mysql or postgresql

2131625
ubuntu	linux
and talk about development is here how to development in visual studio and then deploy apps to linux machine os - ubuntu web server - nginx

2131645
testunit	webrat
what i m trying to ahieve is to do integration tests with webrat in rails3 like yehuda does with testunit in minute 34

2131650
firefox	safari
now if i click a link on that page go to the linked page and then hit the back-button firefox and safari are able to read out the values of the hidden fields

2131661
firefox	safari
afaik only firefox and safari do this by default

2131663
apache	nginx
some python webapps aren t launched from an apache or nginx module at all they have their own persistent server and if you want to have them on the same server as something else you configure your other server to proxy to your python server

2131694
uiview	subviews
i am trying to fade in a uiview as a subviews of my main view

2131712
hide	show
so i can show or hide each row

i m writing received date on the memory ram and after a while unknown and depends on received data write a block of received data unknown size and depends on received data into hard disk and free the memory ram

2131804
children	parent
a hybrid solution is to load in the tree so that the path down to the parent page only contains the current path and then display all the children of the parent

2131805
jsf	jspx
i integrate a flex app in a jsf-icefaces app in a jspx site with the ice outputmedia-tag and want to access the same instance of a bean from flex by remote that jsf inject

2131805
richfaces	icefaces
i know exadel fiji and flamingo but i couldn t work with fiji because my jsf app include the icefaces components and then it doesn t work with richfaces which fiji needs

2131879
innodb	myisam
it only works in myisam which is in all other respects a much worse database engine than innodb

2131879
innodb	myisam
a common alternative to this which you might also consider would be to keep the â canonicalâ copies in the main table potentially in an acid-safe innodb table and store a separate copy of all the title desc and tags together in a fulltext-indexed myisam table purely for fulltext search bait

2131890
textblock	itemscontrol
ch.5 - elements - a look at textblock and their properties images content controls buttons tooltips and popups itemscontrol listbox combobox tabcontrol textbox passwordbox autocompletebox 6 pages slider progressbar calendar datepicker

2131953
post	get
this can be done several ways doing a window.location to do a synchronous get request or doing a form.submit to do a synchronous get or post request or doing a xmlhttprequest#send to do an asynchronous request also known from ajax

2131960
expression-blend	silverlight
i ve made a fresh install of expression-blend 3 on windows 7 64-bit ultimate and every time i create a brand new silverlight 3 application + website project in expression-blend 3 then try and run it i get the error

2131970
int	chars
why should the size of the pointer to the datapage in the non-clustered index increase if the sizeof int is the same as the sizeof chars

2131986
rfcomm	l2cap
if you find a handset specification that actually says it supports j2me bt push you then need to check whether that is supposed to work using rfcomm l2cap or both

2131991
ubuntu	linux
compare the linux version taken on ubuntu 9.10

2131992
int	chars
for chars vs int there are other considerations collation at least which determines case accent kana and width sensitivity

2132077
rss	feed
wordpress is rendering an rss feed at but of course there s not actually a file there

2132077
rss	feed
warning file_get_contents news feed rss function.file-get-contents failed to open stream no such file or directory

2132088
vim	emacs
choices would be vim or emacs

2132156
sorting	filtering
i ve looked at jquery tablesorter and quick search plug-ins but they work just on the currently-fetched data and won t help in real sorting and filtering that may need to touch the database

2132156
sorting	filtering
i know implementing filtering and sorting for an individual case is simple although it has some issues like using dynamic linq which is not yet a standard approach but creating a sorting or filtering tool which works in all cases is the idea i m looking for

2132201
button	checkbox
what i d like to do is to have multiple ajax submit button to perform different actions for a list of items with checkbox

2132265
post	get
use form.submit to fire a get or post request

2132273
realloc	malloc
would the answer be same for realloc malloc 0 0

2132290
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a silverlight user-controls where i have a tabcontrol which uses a couple of tabitem

2132298
hide	show
or if possible to hide the page numbers which show at the top

2132311
vim	emacs
answering on the ide part besides a good plain text editor vim and emacs have been suggested already i found the netbeans ide to work really well especially on windows

2132312
daemons	systemd
if same daemons i m running from terminal then its working properly and also systemd function is getting success with return value 0 and gui is getting popped up

2132318
realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc functions is unspeciï ed

2132319
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is valid for all three allocation functions ie calloc malloc and realloc

2132387
getter	setter
at that point you still have a public getter and a private setter but the backing field and property implementation is generated for you behind the scenes

2132443
min	max
indeed aop would be the right tool here and i would write a little aspect to use jamon which can precisely gather statistics such as hits time statistics avg total min max concurrency statistics and more

2132454
getter	setter
in eclipse there is a source- generate getter setter can you do something similar to synthesize properties in xcode

2132454
getter	setter
i do know that synthesizing properties will generate getter setter for me but i am looking for a way to generate the property synthesize code by selecting the variables

2132517
getter	setter
generating getter and setter for properties is done with the property and the synthesize keywords

2132523
getter	setter
in eclipse there is a source- generate getter setter can you do something similar to synthesize properties in xcode

2132523
getter	setter
in your implementation if you want to generate getter and setter for my_array

2132524
prepare	execute
i m writing a semi-simple database wrapper class and want to have a fetching method which would operate automagically it should prepare each different statement only the first time around and just bind and execute the query on successive calls

2132537
jar	manifest.mf
when you use -jar then only the class-path attribute defined in the meta-inf manifest.mf file inside the jar file will influence the classpath

2132555
jar	manifest.mf
you could unpack the jar file with jar -xf mainprog.jar and look at the meta-inf manifest.mf file

2132571
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i think recent versions of safari opera and firefox support the nth-child css selector so thatâ s another option

2132599
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
how malloc realloc free do this is implementation-specific

2132599
free	realloc
you should never do this from your code it s only for use by realloc and free

2132638
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout or setinterval again

2132643
floating-point	fractions
and using floating-point values is more realistic - you need fractions values because when you rotate something the new coordinates will nearly always be non integral

2132670
mvp	presenter
q2 model view presenter mvp and model view controller mvc are two or one depending on your view common design patterns which help design guis so that everyone has the data they need

2132682
jstl	taglib
best is to create your own custom taglib which does exactly the same as jstl fmt formatdate

2132694
accessor	properties
properties hide implementation details not all properties are just trivial variable accessor

2132696
qmail	exim
on a linux server you will have something like sendmail qmail exim or postfix installed

2132729
width	height
i have a database table where i store the height width state et cetera of windows

2132743
sorting	filtering
automatic requests sorting filtering paging handling

2132750
webkit	gecko
if you are willing to go with another non semantic method for ie you could simply use css 3 for current webkit and gecko based browsers

2132791
inherited	properties
i have an instance of system.type that represents an interface and i want to get a list of all the properties on that interface -- including those inherited from base interfaces

2132804
hash	md5
the following compares using the plain query string vs first creating the md5 hash

2132805
jquery	anythingslider
i am using the fantastic jquery anythingslider by css tricks

2132887
hash	salt
how do i create a mysql user with hash â sha256â salt

2132887
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

2132887
hash	salt
non-random salt for password hash

2132942
post	get
i have this function to get the first image from a random post in wordpress

2132958
ant	maven
i have an ant build that is currently being converted to maven

2132958
ant	maven
in ant it s easy to have multiple build targets to handle this but i m trying to determine the best way to handle this in maven

2132975
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

2132984
getter	setter
generally you want to use getter and setter for public field access and you don t want to have global public variables

2132987
equals	tostring
you can make sure that hashcode equals does what you want can override tostring for sensible logging and it probably reads much better anyway

2132999
jar	war
the maven philosophy is that each project should build one and only artifact jar war whatever

2132999
ant	maven
you can call ant from maven so if you really want to do this then i suggest you start looking at the maven ant plugin

2133058
inherited	properties
see here getproperties to return all properties for an interface inherited hierarchy

2133077
inherited	properties
you can define additional dependencies and libraries in them an make your projects inherited these properties

2133107
integer	unsigned
my opinion is for readability think about it if you were to look at 0 what does that mean does that mean its a unsigned integer or if it was 0x0 then instinctively it has something to do with binary notation more likely platform dependent

2133107
pascal	delphi
since the tag is language agnostic and the word null pointer in delphi object pascal it is nil in c# it is null in c c++ it is null

2133126
children	parent
example for a parent object with a collection of children the parent can have a addchild method that ensure the coherence of the bi-directional relationship

2133126
children	parent
add the child to the collection of children of the new parent

2133142
postgresql	mysql
we re on a linux apache postgresql php stack but a mysql supported installation is not the end of the world

2133147
min	max
i d just make two properties min max assign them the value of the first item you add to the array then each time you add a new item just check if its datetime is less or greater than the min max ones

2133147
min	max
its nice and fast and it will be much faster than iterating through the array each time you need to get min max

2133161
client-side	server-side
there is already a customvalidator validator control which can fire a client-side javascript method to evaluate the value or a server-side method to compare the values

2133206
setinterval	settimeout
n.b. don t pass strings to settimeout or setinterval - best practice is to pass an anonymous function or a function identifier as i did above

2133217
setinterval	settimeout
note that settimeout and setinterval are very different functions

2133229
google-chrome	firefox
the submit only works random in google-chrome and dont work in ie and firefox

2133238
sorting	grouping
sorting makes same elements grouping together and so makes checking for duplicates easy

2133383
stdout	stderr
instead read from the stdout or stderr attribute to read the output

2133383
stdout	stderr
if the process outputs to both stdout and stderr and you want to read it separately you will have to be careful to actually read from both without blocking or you can deadlock

2133386
cpu	processors
processors make and cpu type

2133388
free	realloc
one point nobody cared to talk about yet in your first program is that realloc with length 0 is the same thing as free

2133464
folder	directory
now i create an entry in the sites-available sites-enabled folder of my apache directory etc apache2 sites-available called mydomain.com

2133495
put	get
you are using double quoting you put quotes around _post email and inside it making it get interpreted the wrong way

2133538
ssl	https
the responsetext will be a valid xml that i can manipulate but the webservice can be accessed both via http and https ssl and i must do it over https because authentication is required to do some stuff

2133562
inline	inlining
to avoid inlining along a deep call chain inlining stops when the accumulated inline bytecode size along the call chain exceeds 40 bytes. although they have runtime profiling information method call frequency they are still careful to avoid inlining large functions or chains of functions to prevent bloat

2133567
yslow	pagespeed
you can also test your page using yslow or pagespeed add-on for firebug

2133585
free	realloc
when you pass in a non-null pointer and size of zero to realloc realloc behaves as if youâ ve called free â

2133585
realloc	malloc
when you pass in a null pointer and size is non-zero realloc behaves as if youâ ve called malloc â

2133595
children	parent
practically i have a tree of elements like parent and children with a dept of more levels

2133643
width	margin
i have a block of jquery javascript code that sets the left margin of an image depending on the browser width

2133643
google-chrome	firefox
this works on ie firefox google-chrome

2133643
google-chrome	firefox
then firefox and google-chrome work fine using diff as a value for the images left-margin as i intended but ie throws a run time error and stops running the script citing an invalid argument in jquery file

2133644
move	drag
users would choose from the first box and either drag value items to the second for selection or would select items and then click a button to move them over to the 2nd box

2133679
versioning	upgrade
to test this we have an ant target that install an older versioning upgrade it and compares the schema to a newly created one

2133689
hide	show
i have a jquery function which hide the smaller div and show the larger div when clicked

2133740
width	height
image dimensions 109 width x 34 height

2133776
google-chrome	firefox
using firefox or google-chrome the file is downloaded properly and our application is launched via a custom mime type and all is well

2133805
std	ostream
simple reason there is no std ostream operator with cstring.

2133805
std	ostream
std ostream operator std ostream s const cstring str

2133833
put	get
if anyone would like to see my java sample i can put a zip up here after i get home from school.

2133864
mp3	wav
it can play many of audio file formats including mp3 wav midi etc

2133880
tinyint	varchar
hi i m working on my first sqlite project and i was just wondering if sqlite supports all the same field type that mysql does e.g - datetime tinyint varchar ect

2133882
mouse	keyboard
besides the fact that you don t have to check for the specific mouse key it also has the advantage that this enables the user to create the context menu using the keyboard or maybe to use a totally different way if the user is working on a platform where context menus are requested via other means

2133905
put	get
it doesn t hurt if you put in more sections than these but this is enough to get dynamic linking working

2133961
stdout	stderr
that will start the process redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null

2133971
versioning	upgrade
that will effectively make your schema harder to upgrade when that versioning of sql server will be released

2133975
accessor	properties
the best way to do it that i ve found is actually to build a custom class that is based off of usercontrol give it a master properties with a get accessor that fishes through the this.page.parent until it stops encountering master pages if you are nesting this step is unnecessary otherwise and then return that web control as the type of the master page you want to use

2133995
vmware	bootcamp
i have the wcf service running on windows vista in a bootcamp partition on a macintosh hosted in vmware fusion self hosted mode

2133998
perl	tcl
perl tcl python etc

2134021
submit	submission
with the key scheme when the submit is received by the server submission for that key can be locked

2134022
post	get
need a function call that is designed solely to get the count of post matching a criteria

2134034
put	get
later within the body i manually inserted rows into a table so i could get rid of textfields content and put their contents in the table

2134056
post	get
but now i m trying to use it in a form and confused by post get etc

2134076
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are shared

2134076
stdout	stderr
process share the same stdin stdout and stderr filehandles

2134083
ienumerable	ienumerator
of course it will blow up at runtime because it returns a null ienumerator . but note the absence of ienumerable or any generics

2134096
richfaces	icefaces
however either of these would require you adding and setting up another library richfaces or icefaces which is probably not what you want

2134102
postgresql	mysql
i have confirmed as much on postgresql and mysql but i cannot find a resource for sql as a whole

2134150
jscrollpane	jviewport
given a vertical orientation it may be convenient to make the preferred size of the jscrollpane s jviewport an integral multiple of the message pane s height

2134152
put	get
put timers around so that you get a good feel of it

2134170
postgresql	mysql
unlike mysql and postgresql in oracle and sql server no internal datatypes can be used as boolean values in where clauses or when predicates

2134217
client-side	server-side
i guess i d suggest writing a procedure that takes a lower and upper bound for selecting records then writing a client-side program that forks off a few threads allocates a db connection per thread then calls the server-side procedure with appropriately-sized bounds say five threads with four million rows apiece

2134331
trojan	virus
edit from the link given by dth it appears that code downloads and executes a trojan virus called sinowal

2134341
button	checkbox
those checkbox can then be checked and then the button accept to group is clicked

2134375
children	parent
raveren s approach will stretch the parent div if the children are float right or float left

2134378
hide	show
you can then use javascript the smart way to show hide row details

2134381
public	protected
you can create header files in which you only declare the public and protected api

2134391
switching	screens
i m trying to create a utility similar to microsoft s abandoned super fast user switcher download which allows fast user switching without going through the welcome screens

2134403
ironruby	ironpython
apparently its against our corporate standard to be using ironruby or ironpython right now

2134461
min	max
is allowed why not min max i m looking for explanation.

2134465
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
the matrix multiplication should use and for multiplying and or for add

2134494
min	max
aggregate functions like min max aren t supported in indexed views

2134494
min	max
you have to do the min max in the query surrounding the view

2134494
min	max
the avg max min stdev stdevp var

2134500
post	get
the only way i can get it to return the correct value for the post count is to change the myrecentposts2 calculation as follows.

2134509
opensymphony	webwork
webwork is part of the opensymphony set of components and is considered to be a nice and simple framework

2134524
xstream	dom4j
you can use dom4j xstream to read the xml into an equivalent java modal and then use jsonlib to convert into json

2134532
stdout	stderr
if you are unfortunate enough to come across an error in the ls command say the path doesn t exist for example or any other system command the output will be displayed to stderr causing it to display to the screen whether you like it or not which the backticks won t capture they will only get stdout

2134549
inherited	subclassing
my idea is to create an account models.model model with the following custom manager and subclassing it using multi-table inherited with all of my models

2134557
pop-up	dialog
we can t import a targets file without adding its path to the registry otherwise visual studio pop-up a security dialog asking for confirmation to load it

2134566
affinity	processors
the goal there is basically to set the processors affinity to core 0 which by looking at the windows task manager is working as expected

2134601
chown	chmod
you ll need to chown or chmod the auth file so that user can read it

2134617
postgresql	mysql
if i was getting a similar error with mysql or postgresql two systems i m more familiar with i d check to ensure that a database process was running and then attempt to connect manually to the database using the username password connection string

2134642
equals	gethashcode
just override gethashcode and equals - this allows you to use the object itself as the key in a dictionary with multiple values being taken into account

2134647
rss	feed
i have two sites with rss feed

2134647
rss	feed
in each site i gather the data and then pass it off to a simple formatter i wrote that does the work of creating the rss format so each site is essentially using the same code to generate the feed

2134657
capitalize	uppercase
i was wondering if there was any way using only css and this can be browser specific css to convert all uppercase text to words that are only initially capitalize for example

2134771
disk	ram
just like hibernate in laptop i would to write all the memory used by a process to disk free up the ram

2134801
public	protected
the design decision to allow for a protected virtual void dispose bool disposing method allows for extra flexibility that wouldn t be easily and safely handled in a public interface

2134805
filesystems	ntfs
to verify this mount a ntfs filesystems or whatever type you are mounting over samba on your local machine and see if you get the same coloring behavior from ls

2134812
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the viewdidload is called everytime as the viewwillappear

2134843
inherited	subclassing
alex s on-point diagnosis of the problem notwithstanding i would strongly argue that you should not multiply inherited from dict in this case or in general for that matter. while it may seem convenient to subclassing from it and automatically inherited all the dict behaviour dicts and builtin types in general are often subject to shortcuts internally

2134844
put	get
i understand the troubles you can get into when you put a using declaration inside a header file so i don t want to do that

2134864
int	chars	int	double
you can easily build your own collection class that doesn t need wrapper but at the end you will have to build one for each type chars int float double etc multiply by the types of the collections set map list + their implementation

2134888
getter	setter
in response to setter getter comment

2134890
min	max
other aggregates like min and max cannot be recomputed just by looking at the data that is being changed

2134890
min	max
if you delete the value that is currently the max or min then the new max or min has to be searched for and found in the entire table

2134914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
our website uses the superfish jquery plug-in for our menus and they work fine in firefox ie6 ie7 safari google-chrome etc

2134938
ienumerable	ienumerator
instead of collecting the values in a list you can return an ienumerator or ienumerable and use the yield keyword

2134953
cos	sin	cos	exp
most matlab functions will take vectors matrices as arguments including cos sin exp log etc

2134958
min	max
if app is a web server in cluster mode i could start a new instance with changed min max heap size and than shutdown initial instance

2134972
zoo	chron
i have imported data with a five minute interval into a zoo object where the index is a chron with both date and time

2135074
put	get
in all their examples they seem to put all the logic in the controller and just use the model to get and set data

int	double
when the compiler wants to infer the type of the mt it fails since k which is specified as the loop bound has one type probably something like double and the loop step implicitly the int constant 1 has the type int

2135149
hide	show
the problem is i can t get the divs to space accordingly in ie6 while having an effective hide show

2135149
hide	show
the problem is the show hide

2135149
hide	show
this isn t so bad for this small example but if there are many questions depending on a show hide large gaps start to appear between rows of questions

2135159
execvp	fork
i now call fork and execvp myself

2135159
execvp	fork
i fork and then in the child i close all the server sockets and then call execvp to execute the script

2135159
execvp	fork
based on that information i suspect it s something in my fork execvp code below.

2135164
vim	emacs
maybe the emacs plugin for bazaar created it and thats why vim doesn t care

2135184
versioning	upgrade
regarding telling it which to use unless you re running vs2010 you can t multi-target silverlight apps so when you open a sl project it will be upgrade to whatever versioning you have installed

2135207
put	get
they seem to put all the logic in the controller and just use the model to get and set data

2135230
hfs+	ntfs
for example ntfs fat32 hfs+ or ext3.

2135249
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox ie 7 and 8 and google-chrome

2135256
hide	show
wrap these in divs for hide show

2135256
hide	show
it finds the next element with the given class name and will hide show that element

2135257
stdout	stderr
sys.stderr is a file handle to stderr stdout is what print writes to

2135261
cvs	rcs
generally vc does not do what you would expect because it s designed for centralized version control systems such as rcs sccs cvs and subversion

2135262
post	put
you ll be able to see all the information that s been post put d to your rest service

2135272
zoo	chron
i don t believe that there s any way to do this built into zoo or chron but you can create your own function by using a little math

2135298
put	get	post	put	post	get
i ve gone through the firstresource bit of the restlet 1.1 tutorial and put together a web service that handles get post delete put by subclassing the resource class and overriding the appropriate methods and using a router to attach the subclassed resource classes

2135298
post	get
get post etc

2135302
realloc	malloc
the question is about realloc malloc 0 0

2135302
realloc	malloc
would the answer be same for realloc malloc 0 0

2135302
free	malloc
then the call is equivalent to free malloc 0

2135302
realloc	malloc
in this case malloc 0 and realloc malloc 0 0 are not equivalent

2135302
realloc	malloc
this will result in a call like realloc null 0 which would be equivalent to malloc 0 which may or may not return null

2135302
free	realloc
i am not sure if the omission in c99 is an oversight or if it means that in c99 realloc ptr 0 for non- null ptr is not equivalent to free ptr

2135302
realloc	malloc
in the second the malloc call is made twice whereas in the first you re passing a previously allocated pointer to realloc

2135302
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
also the return value from malloc on the lhs hasn t been free d yet so any other malloc calloc or realloc may not return that value

2135302
realloc	malloc
you won t see possible on the output unless both malloc and realloc fail and return null

2135428
maven	pom.xml
i typically add the jetty plugin to my pom.xml assuming you use maven and launch the web app in development using mvn clean jetty run

icefaces	trinidad	icefaces	tomahawk	primefaces	trinidad	primefaces	tomahawk	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	richfaces	trinidad	richfaces	tomahawk	richfaces	icefaces	tomahawk	trinidad
if you want sorting look at richfaces or another component framework icefaces primefaces trinidad tomahawk etc

2135539
implements	extends
you can extends iterator which will require that you implements the next and hasnext methods

2135539
implements	extends
but you will get more flexibility if you extends iterable which requires you implements elements or iterator in 2.8

2135542
postgresql	mysql
so from what you all are telling me this would be an equivalent mysql table schema of the original postgresql table

2135596
versioning	upgrade
yes this is possible there are multiple places tmp and documents that you can write files to - if you write the downloaded file to the documents directory the file will be available the next time you launch the app and will even persist between versioning of your app as it is upgrade

2135679
hide	show
if you show the loader element before the ajax call then hide it again in the success handler it should work allright

2135909
width	height
all i have is the size of the translating thumbnail and its coordinates like origin center width and height

2136002
google-chrome	firefox
this code perfectly works in google-chrome and even ie but not in firefox

2136029
actualheight	actualwidth
you can determine the origin of a control using a generaltransform on point 0 0 to the root visual coordinate system and actualheight and actualwidth are surfaced directly

2136029
width	height
in the sample above i have transformed -1 -1 and added 2 to both height and width to compensate for the single pixel border region around an iframe - this code is lifted from a working application that uses an iframe to render embedded html when browser hosted

2136125
google-chrome	firefox
if i include jquery 1.4 and wire up a live click event to anything on the page whether it exists or does not this unrelated event handler stops working as expected in ie and continues to work in firefox and google-chrome

2136489
vbscript	jscript
you can write code for asp in any language for which an activescripting engine exists ruby via activeruby but most commonly one would write code in either vbscript or jscript

2136489
vbscript	jscript
which brings us to the third reason the implementations of vbscript and jscript that ship with windows as well as activeruby and all other activescripting engines that i know of are pure interpreters they cannot compile

i think your problem is that you are filtering out the rows where best is not 1 so they aren t included in the grouping by

2138898
opera	firefox
returns function in my ie6 but firefox opera returns string

2138907
extjs	mootools
you could take any js framework like jquery + jquery tools mootools extjs whatever and write down js scripts that will talk to your server via ajax requests and visualize replies in form of html

2138909
subtract	add
if the hh mm ss for timestamp b is less than that for a subtract 1 from d and add 8 hours minus the time difference h giving d - 1 days + 8 hours - h

2138933
vbscript	jscript
however it is possible to use the windows script interfaces to load and compile vbscript or jscript not for the faint-hearted though

2138954
memcpy	malloc
under the hood this might be a bit more costly could use malloc almost certainly uses memcpy but it s way easier to write and much easier to maintain

2138965
int	double
if it s any type of number like float double or int then php will perform as expected

2138966
implements	extends
to implements your own widgets you have to extends view or subclass of view

2139020
getter	setter
its so that you can lazy load the session - normally you would have to run session_start before accessing any session variables by using getter and setter you can have this action performed on demand

2139024
int	chars
for example in stored procedures i see it used with int decimals and chars and one thing that is bugging me quite a lot is this

2139031
width	height
i am trying by using javascript to get the window width and height of the build in webbrowser but can t find the right method currently it seems the dom doesn t know about the zoom level changes

2139040
shadowing	named
you are shadowing the model attribute by a function definition using the same named

2139047
hide	show
in the form activate event some code is run to show and hide the certain tabs in the va tab pro control

2139084
min	max
so using a cte i create a temporary result set of dates ebwteen the min and max dates and their weekday name eg monday tuesday.

2139176
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
however if you implement a custom collection that implements inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged you can let it wrap and filter your source collection

2139199
min	max
all 3 of those nodes on the xsd have min 0 max unbounded

2139219
hash	salt
not to rain on your parade or anything but if the implementors have done their work right you wouldn t notice lags beyond a few tens of milliseconds on modern cpu s even with strong cryptographic hash and knowing the algorithm won t help you if they have used salt correctly

2139225
hash	md5
use the md5 hashing algorithm which generates a 16-character hash and use the 10 th through the 14 th characters

2139235
tcplistener	tcpclient
relevant .net classes are tcpclient and tcplistener

2139261
teamcity	ncover
i am trying to integrate ncover 2 into teamcity 5.0.1 and since i have some files in the project that are out of my control i d like to exclude those from the ncover statistics

2139261
teamcity	ncover
in the teamcity build runner setup i have an option for additional ncover arguments and by looking at the page that describes ncover parameters i added the following to this box

2139266
children	parent
a parent contains shared_ptr s to two children both of which point back to the parent using a weak_ptr

2139395
gdal	ogr
the ogr shapefile driver from gdal ogr directly uses implementation of shapelib so there is no difference actually

2139418
portrait	landscape
this calls setcontentview because the layout differs between portrait and landscape and binds the newly-created playerwidget to the still-existing controller object

2139550
superclass	subclassing
i cannot nest another createcriteria as there is no reference in the superclass to the subclassing

2139557
versioning	upgrade
yes there is no possibility to upgrade from the trial versioning of visual studio 2008 on windows 7 as the upgrade button and product key fields are missing

2139621
vim	emacs
i would like to do something like requires vim or emacs but when i do that i in fact depend on vim or and emacs

2139663
hash	md5
which is enough for the prefixed searches and add another column to store the md5 hash which would ensure uniqueness

2139672
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
check out the documentation for nsurlrequest and nsmutableurlrequest you can use it to make a post request to your login and registration pages just like a web browser

2139685
vim	emacs
so in your example vim and emacs both provides text-editor and your package would requires text-editor

2139685
vim	emacs
make dummy my-package-vim-mode and my-package-emacs-mode rpms that requires vim and requires emacs respectively and provides my-package-text-editor then have your package requires my-package-text-editor

2139703
factors	matrix
after a satisfactory rotation the rotated factors loading matrix l will have the same ability to represent the correlation matrix and it can be used as the factors loading matrix instead of the unrotated matrix l

2139703
factors	matrix
the purpose of rotation is to make the rotated factors loading matrix have some desirable properties

2139703
factors	matrix
one of the methods used is to rotate the factors loading matrix such that the rotated matrix will have a simple structure

2139703
factors	matrix
each row of the factors matrix should contain at least one zero

2139703
factors	matrix
if there are m common factors each column of the factors matrix should have at least m zeros

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix there should be several variables for which entries approach zero in the one column but not in the other

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix a large proportion of the variables should have entries approaching zero in both columns when there are four or more factors

2139703
factors	matrix
for every pair of columns in the factors matrix there should be only a small number of variables with nonzero entries in both columns

2139703
versioning	upgrade
a new versioning if i would ever tried to upgrade it would accept a 3d matrix a set of 2d matrices as an argument and the algorithm should return the one that better fits the above criteria

2139703
factors	matrix
p.s.2 from the same book a test of successful factors analysis is the extent to which it can reproduce the original corr matrix

2139741
opera	firefox
it doesn t work on firefox however someone told me it works on opera

2139756
hide	show
you can hide and show the complete taskbar by using this code

2139818
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
if you re wrong about your assumption about the type your program will fail immediately and you ll be able to see the cause of failure immediately rather than waiting for a nullreferenceexception or argumentnullexception or even a logical error sometime in the future

2139862
google-chrome	firefox
thanks gazler although there was no problem with actual html and firefox error console didn t show any messages i checked developers tools in google-chrome and it said that div tag was inside table body which apparently caused all the troubles

2139871
int	chars
assuming you re using c# you can get the 16-bit chars of strings as int using

2139877
put	get
however the issue is for example if users input data with say more than 1 whitespace or if they put some of the text in a new line etc the pattern does not get picked up because it doesn t exactly match the pattern set

2139915
post	get
what you can do is assuming this is happening on a web server place a get post to a php script passing in any necessary parameters to execute the right php method

2139933
uilabel	uibutton
for example if you have a property defined for a uilabel called label inside of the uiviewcontroller-derived class that hosts it the code would look something like this an example of an event handler for a uibutton touch up inside event

2139945
put	get
i think once you get the range it fixes up the html but when you put it back in it could cause problems

2139979
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i have tried subclassing the uitableviewcontroller and looking at events such as viewdidload and viewdidappear unfortunatly also in these events the cells aren t drawn yet

2139983
folder	directory
basically i m creating a plugin that is designed using the qtbrowserplugin class and i am trying to make my browser which is programmeed using qtwebkit to search for the plugin in a folder specified by me as i don t want the plugin to be stored in the mozilla firefox plugins directory or the standard plugins directory

2140029
rss	feed
i want to index an rss feed and was wondering if this is possible using pysolr and if so how do you do it

2140046
accessor	properties
make it a properties with just the get accessor

2140134
post	get
so use wp_query as you normally would to get the specific list of post that you re after and change the fields that are pulled to get the count wp_posts.id

2140134
post	get
also make sure you change posts_per_page to -1 so that you get all post

2140137
hash	md5
take for example the md5 hash string -- it has 128 bits that means 2 128 different hash can be generated

2140137
hash	md5
even taking into account the birthday paradox it is highly unlikely that a string which isn t the actual password can be found to generate the hash value of course md5 has been found insecure but that s another issue md5 is just an example

2140191
implements	extends
when you extends the mapview there are only a few methods that you need to implements and they are really straight forward

2140196
superclass	subclassing
alternatively if you want to allow subclassing you should test only for properties that are in the superclass

2140236
comparator	icomparer
just write an icomparer that would work as a chain of comparator

2140241
dictionary	map
so if at all possible depending on the size having a huge memory map hashtable dictionary with just keys the actual words may be an option and would be quick as lightning

2140246
maven	cargo
cargo maven plugin doesn t support deployment to remote weblogic

2140254
width	height
i want the contents of the togglepanel whatever facet is active at that case to have width 100 and height 100

2140257
hash	salt
all of my accounts with financial information have different and good passwords but i use the same not-so-strong password on assorted forums. with salt and hash it s not possible to tell if my password on site a is the same as on site b even with both password tables

2140289
prepare	execute
this is most often done by using some sort of prepare statement where your parameters are injected via a mechanism that prevents arbitrary sql from being execute

2140320
textview	imageview
i would think it wouldn t be that difficult to get a horizontally centered imageview with a horizontally centered textview below it then just tweak the image dimensions and the text size till they look just like other icons on the home screen

2140320
switching	screens
as for the problem you are seeing when you switching to landscape view on your home screens you will need to provide a landscape version of your layout xml file tweaked to display correctly in landscape mode

2140320
portrait	landscape
when i make app widgets i usually get the portrait view looking perfect then copy that layout file to the layout-land directory and start making tweaks until it looks like i want it to in landscape as well

2140322
clang	llvm
both the msp430 and the arm family have gcc solutions as well as it is easy to use build and use llvm with its clang llvm has a 64 bit problem with its gcc front end

2140322
put	get
i have spent some time recently fiddling with an opencore msp430 which you could put in an fpga and get more memory and speed and features if you like could even add usb if you wanted

2140418
int	chars
memcpy is not type-safe because you can easily copy the memory of some int into a chars array and end up with meaningless data

2140424
atomic	interlocked
this doesn t need volatile in fact you d get a warning if you had it because interlocked already ensures an atomic update

2140435
memcpy	memmove
type-safe alternative to memcpy for arrays and containers could be std copy in - it may be implemented in terms of memmove if all involved types satisfy certain requirements otherwise it performs assignments - with some classes you can break certain invariants if you bypass their public interface and just go and move copy them around in memory for example i suppose any class with a non-trivial copy constructor is going to misbehave if you make copies of it with memcpy

2140478
teamcity	ncover
the command you posted looks correct check the rest of the teamcity build log to see the entire command that they re sending to ncover

2140492
width	height
whilst the segmented control allows me to alter its width i cannot alter its height in interface builder that property is greyed out on 44 in the size section of the property inspector

2140499
submit	submission
you can submit your information using their submission page

2140510
hide	show
once the animation is complete hide that temporary window and show the real window

2140560
google-chrome	safari
trying google-chrome for mac or safari mac

2140602
accessor	properties
at one point i had issues compiling because the start and end attached properties apparently weren t found in my track class but fortunately after re-reading the msdn article on them i realized that i had changed the names of the properties without changing the names of the setter accessor methods

2140625
ssl	https
sometimes the error occurs if you have added a server ssl certificate https .if the certificate is not valid it will give this error

2140657
ironruby	ironpython
vbx was one of the four language implementations that were originally driving the design of the dlr the other three being ironpython from which the dlr was extracted in the first place ironruby and managed javascript

2140692
windows	wow64
in addition one can use iswow64process to check whether you re a 32bit process running under the wow64 emulation on a 64bit windows machine

2140717
jar	war
package a jar zip or war properly

2140791
atomic	compare-and-swap
just before the actual atomic compare-and-swap but after the function arguments are determined the other thread releases the lock - lock becomes false

2140816
google-chrome	safari
ie google-chrome and safari have built in profilers in the web development tools that ship with the browser

2140818
post	get
siege supports http 1.0 and 1.1 protocols get and post directives cookies transaction logging and basic authentication

2140836
qtcore	qtgui
i ve been trying to install pyqt 4.7 on vista but i am getting an importerror when i try to do from pyqt4 import qtcore qtgui

2140857
folder	dir
try checking out some dir into another folder and then commit your changes there

2140901
trie	tree
looking at this whole process now and the other answers i think this is actually a trie structure assuming the character searched for is the root of a tree as another poster had suggested

2140909
return-value-optimization	nrvo
in some cases compilers can apply nrvo named return-value-optimization as well

2140910
min	max
set the max min size for the width of the form only

2140916
min	max
edit please note that the min max size solutions work much better than this hack

2140959
width	height
video format yuv video format size java.awt.dimension width 640 height 480 maxdatalength 614400 datatype class b yuvtype 32 stridey 1280 strideuv 1280 offsety 0 offsetu 1 offsetv 3

getter	setter
actionscript 1 2 supported this by calling addproperty name getter setter

2140969
firefox	safari
i am using processing.js with jquery 1.3.2 at my disposal and targeting firefox 3.5 safari 4 and ie 8 through explorercanvas

2140988
post	get
it s a bit of a hack but you could create a script on the server that prints out whatever is posted to it in some format json plain text whatever suits you and post your textarea to that script via ajax whenever you need to get the contents of it

2141028
udp	tcp
when it receives that udp text it should forward it to the tcp client that is connected

2141028
udp	tcp
the text sent to udp or tcp doesn t contain spaces

2141028
udp	tcp
problem is even thou i am able to connect with tcp client msg trying to setup udp n is never displayed

2141038
int	chars
in c getchar returns an int with the idea being that there are more int values than chars true in all implementations i know of false in some i can easily imagine so one of the values can be used to denote end-of-file

2141105
ubuntu	linux
i have a c++ code that runs perfect on my linux machine ubuntu karmic

2141111
ssl	https
my task is to make it secure using https ssl or tsl

2141150
getter	setter
yes you are right this would be a bug if your setter getter were serializing deserializing the objects

2141150
getter	setter
if you had written your setter getter something like this you would have a bug

2141223
width	height
instead of reacting to a resizeevent which will fire every frame during a resize if you hit maximize and it takes 3 frames for the component to redraw from widh ehight 0 to width height maxvalue then the resize event will fire three times you could watch the properties of width and height

2141223
width	height
this will in effect watch the properties similar to data binding and execute your resizehandler whenever the width or height change

2141223
width	height
this has a slight drawback as to firing your handler twice if width and height change at the same time but that can be solved with a third function that does the work which gets invoked by your handlers if it isn t schedule to be invoked

2141223
width	height
i prefer the change watcher method because it fires after the width and height properties have changed unlike a resize event wich fires before the width and height properties are correclty updated

2141254
children	parent
if you can id the parent then you could do something like this to get the children

2141268
google-chrome	safari
the hover background-color of the rightmost list item about us is cut off at the very right edge of the text seemingly only in webkit tested safari and google-chrome in windows xp

2141289
folder	directory
short from storing the dll in the same folder as the exe you can store it in a directory that s listed on the path environment variable

2141307
realloc	memset
write your own function say reallocz that accepts the current size as a parameter and calls realloc and memset for you

2141312
httphandler	httpmodule
note that i say practical way you could write an httphandler or httpmodule that handles all of the interaction but you d be reinventing the wheel

2141319
ssl	https
my task is to make it secure using https ssl or tsl

2141336
put	get
that is it has a data structure that needs to be persistent and a ui to let the user put information into that data structure and get it out

2141337
profiler	yourkit
i have a problem with a java memory leak which for some reason does not show up in my profiler yourkit

2141338
public	protected
as to why you would actually make something public in base but private in derived without private or protected inheritance is beyond me

2141355
getter	setter
date setter and getter

2141399
inherited	properties
you add a class that inherited from system.configuration.install.installer create a serviceinstaller and add that serviceinstaller to the installers properties

2141417
move	drag
i have tried moving the files using the repo-browser right-click drag the files and select move items to here as well in the working folder right-click drag select svn move versioned files here and commit the parent folder

2141437
jhat	jvisualvm
to analyze the dump you could use jvisualvm or jhat

2141455
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout slidedown etc - all these are nice but animate is the granddady of them all

2141455
addclass	removeclass
if you don t need to animate properties only change them it s much cleaner to define css classes and use addclass and removeclass or toggleclass

2141499
folder	directory
there is no concept of folder or directory in s3

2141503
many-to-many	one-to-many
this code sample includes a step-by-step guide about how to work with entity data model in various ways including one-to-many association many-to-many association one-to-one association table merging table splitting table-per-hierarchy inheritance and table-per-type inheritance

2141510
cassini	iis
you will then have to have your projects kick up with iis instead of cassini which takes a little bit of work but i think it will solve the problem with oracle at least

2141574
udp	tcp
as i understand it your application is supposed to receive some udp messages and pass them onto a client or clients connected on a tcp socket

2141574
udp	tcp
every time a message is received on the udp socket send it over the tcp socket

2141574
udp	tcp
once the tcp client disconnects tear down udp socket go back to waiting for tcp connections

2141580
post	put
sorry if these queries seem different but they all occured to me same time when i read about the threadsafe vs reentrant post on so hence i put them together

2141598
profiling	debugging
and of course xdebug brings loads of other usefull stuff like remote debugging graphical debugging of your php application in eclipse pdt for instance profiling .

2141623
teamcity	nant
teamcity is very easy to get up and running if you have msbuild or nant scripts set up to build your projects

2141639
gtk	vte
an implementation that might be easier to read is vte terminal which gnome uses since it ll be mapping between vt100 and glib gtk which is probably a lot closer to what mac os x provides

2141664
rss	feed
from msdn with regex and rss feed examples using clr integration in sql server 2005

2141665
jvisualvm	yourkit
attach with jvisualvm in the java 6 jdk and see if it provides information including profiling that yourkit does not

2141674
ogre	irrlicht
personally if i had a project and was trying to convert from one solution to the other i would actually try to convert to a rendering library that supports both such as ogre irrlicht or a commercial engine

2141695
direct3d	directx
on the other hand faking directx direct3d with opengl could be much harder because you have to support the whole com thing

2141705
nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
if you are wanting to subclass nsmanagedobject then i would highly recommend talking a look at mogenerator github

2141707
hide	show
i have a large set around 100 of page elements that i would like to toggle show hide with jquery

2141752
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but after execution some asp.net ajax-function we have strange effect in internet explorer mozilla firefox and opera everything is good but in google-chrome and safari text with html-tags is invisible

i want to make the application that would normally in google-chrome and safari too

2141752
google-chrome	safari
after ajax function in google-chrome and safari hello test

2141762
mef	prism
i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles

2141762
mef	prism
i d recommend listening to glenn block s chats on prism unity and mef

2141856
int	boolean
the third option is intended for functions which are convenient and natural to be called within conditions and i usually emulate a boolean type here by using int values 1 and 0

2141857
getter	setter
in oo c++ java i tend to use getsomething and setsomething because very often if not always i am either getting a private attribute from the class representing that data object or setting it - the getter setter pair

2141864
cos	sin
x x 0 + r sin î cos ï

2141918

that works great on firefox 3.0+ ie6 and opera but on ie7 when hiting the back button the

2141974
google-chrome	firefox
this behaviour is the same on google-chrome 4 and firefox 3.6 however it works as i expected in ie8

2142030
opera	firefox
i tried to search in google but cannot find a complete solution i only find something detects only the browser s type like firefox opera

2142100
qtkit	quicktime
it seems that qtkit by default uses quicktime 7 but can be made to use quicktime x by setting the qtmovieopenforplaybackattribute attribute

2142161
button	checkbox
now the widget i want to use is a custom widget which is a container of some other widgets few checkbox few button with some layout

2142169
width	margin
only this time assign the innermost div a width of 15px and add margin 0 auto

2142173
width	height
quick fit make the image instantly fitting a given width height or width and height

2142210
filtering	grouping
pagedcollectionview gives you lot of functionality out of the box without writing much code.you can use it to sort the data filtering the data grouping the data

2142275
min	max
from i in ilist where i min i max select i

2142275
range	max	range	min	min	max
where ilist is your initial list min is your min value for your range max is your max value for your range

2142277
mef	prism
testability and decoupling seem to be the main focus of these non-datatemplate v-vm creation relationship designs and articles and often they have to do with mef or prism

2142277
mef	prism
any good links to articles covering these topics is appreciated provided they are not mef prism related

2142290
post	get
on my website i can see that the encoding is iso-8859-1 utf-8 for accept-charset but for some reason i cannot get the post to work if it includes etc

2142341
hide	show
to make parent row aware of which child it needs to show or hide i am making use of jquery and assigning row id to each

2142477
gif	png
if jpg if gif or if png i call the appropriate imagecreatefrom-jpg-gif-png

2142494
client-side	server-side
do fast validation client-side like pattern-matching date number correctness and security check server-side

2142506
post	get
you don t really know how the data got to you since it carries post get and cookie data

2142516
postgresql	mysql
update mysql does not have a rank function ms sql oracle postgresql have one

2142531
post	get
refers to all sorts of requests get post etc..

2142534
post	get
get requests should be idempotent and post requests are generally not

2142534
post	get
if your application is using data from it will behave the same for both get and post requests which violates the idempotence of get

2142541
ssl	https
according to msdn https is provided externally to wcf which means tls ssl cipher suite and certificate selection are not possible programmatically

2142546
post	get
it gives you the flexibility to use get or post which can come in handy for things like search forms where most of the time data is posted but sometimes you ll want to say link to a particular search so you can use get parameters instead

2142546
post	get
also if you look at many other languages asp.net for example they make no distinction between get and post variables at all

2142546
post	get
i ve never used request to get cookie values but i think kyle butt makes a great point in the comments on this post about that

2142546
post	get
so if you have the same variable passed in via both post and get which one actually gets into request depends on those ini settings

2142548
post	get
also it s awkward since you don t know if you re getting a post or a get or another request

2142565
post	get
it s important to understand when to use post when to use get and when to use a cookie

2142565
post	get
if you expect to get the value from a post or a get or from a cookie it s more informative to someone reading your code to use the specific variable instead of _request

i have an ubuntu linux development machine and a macbook that i work on

2142586
emacs	textmate
i think it looks like one tab in textmate is for some reason several tabs in emacs

2142586
emacs	textmate
so my code takes up the entire screen in emacs but only the left part of the screen in textmate

2142612
emacs	textmate
for instance if you want 4 spaces per tab then you need to make sure that emacs and textmate are both set up to use 4 spaces per tab

2142662
udp	tcp
if udp ends up being a bit too unreliable it does not guarantee the data will arrive where it is sent you could also try tcp connections

2142662
udp	tcp
with udp you re looking at just about 10 lines of code to send and receive data with tcp is a bit more but more reliable

2142662
udp	tcp
then send that data via tcp or udp

2142677
cpu	processors
the vmr7 is the least processors intensive 6 - 7 cpu but worst quality the evr 8 - 12 cpu is a little more efficient than the vmr9 12 - 13 cpu however they both look similar

2142684
merb	ruby-on-rails
not all do and even fewer will in the future as ruby-on-rails 3 the merger of ruby-on-rails and merb uncouples activerecord

2142691
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
you would then respond to your uiimageview s touches in each object s touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended methods

2142699
udp	tcp
you will likely want to use tcp or udp directly and send recieve the raw bytes

2142702
put	get
if anything the productivity you get depends on how much effort your willing to put in to learning the tools which goes for just about any ide but it did fit my style of software development better than eclipse

2142703
google-chrome	firefox
in both ie7 and firefox but not google-chrome or ie6 the layout of this page is very odd

2142710
put	get
get a solid-state drive and put your os and development tools on it

2142749
xlwt	xlutils
there is a set of cross platform python utilities - called xlrd xlwt and xlutils - for reading writing excel files

2142753
accessor	properties	inline	inlining
in addition to preventing the compiler from inlining very small methods simple properties accessor are inline very often the lookup takes a couple of cycles

2142754
post	get
for a plain idempotent request usually submitted via get there s the possibility the amount of data you want won t fit in a url so it has be mutated to a post request instead as a practical matter

2142754
post	get
no the problem with is nothing to do with conflating get and post parameters

2142755
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m new at this but it works in firefox and yet breaks in google-chrome and safari

2142776
public	protected
a friend of derived can access exactly what derived itself can - that is any member of derived and any public or protected member of any base class or of any public or protected grand-parent class but not any private members of base classes or members of private grand-parent classes

2142823
post	get
as such if one tends to use everywhere i can do anything via get that i could via post which means setting up tags on my malicious site that cause users logged into your e-commerce module to purchase products silently or i can cause them to click on links that will result in dangerous actions or the revelation of sensitive information probably to me

2142823
post	get
referencing my example from above it is perfectly reasonable to allow the response format variable to be sent via get or post

2142825
width	height
i ve got a map in a gwt app up at - i want the map to cover 100 of the height and width of its container

2142845
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2142854
stdout	stderr
note that fds 0 stdin 1 stdout 2 stderr by default but these can of course be re-directed or closed typically if you are a daemon you close your file descriptors and re-open the ones you want

2142889
arp	dhcp
if you are trying to get the mac s and ip s it would be better to use the arp -s command instead of looking at the dhcp lease file

2142898
jquery	simplemodal
i m using eric martin s sweet simplemodal jquery plugin

2142916
mouse	keyboard
everything done with the mouse only extra actions like keyboard keypress not required

2143015
serializable	deserialization
you could create your own persistence service that can handle this situation either by supporting conversion of the old workflow into the new workflow or something more abstract like a persistence service that serializable as xml json something that might more easily support deserialization of one version as another version

2143032
width	height
i guess this is to make up for sizes where the width isn t a multiple of the number of columns or the height isn t a multiple of the number of rows

2143034
int	chars
int float chars don t have any data members or methods

2143042
post	get
exists it will always overwrite the get post content and therefore

2143042
post	get
it is not about the fact that someone can forge get post

2143042
post	get
it is about the fact that cookies will overwrite get and post data in

2143042
post	get
variable_order sets the order of the egpcs environment get post cookie and server variable parsing

2143042
post	get
but then again you might also consider not using _request altogether simply because in php you can access environment get post cookie and server in their own globals and have one attack vector less

2143042
post	get
_request to mean get or post not realizing that it could also contain

2143045
int	chars
int chars and other ordinal types do not have method tables so there s no way to add methods or override them which is really the heart of inheritance

2143087
getter	setter
i ve read in the eclipse help that it is possible to delete getter and setter together with a field

2143087
getter	setter
in the eclipse help file the following is written when you delete a field from within a view eclipse can propose deleting its getter and setter methods

2143087
getter	setter
if you use a name prefix or suffix for fields be sure to specify this in the java code style preference page. the way i understand it eclipse should somehow ask me if i want to delete the getter and setter methods for a field that i just removed without any special configuration

2143090
unix	bsd	debian	linux
it does a little more and comes from bsd or more exactly at t unix as the manpage says so if you are on linux you may need to install an additional package on debian its in bsdmainutils .

2143091
hide	show
that normally has the icon to show hide the keypad

2143111
put	get
finally i wish i could recommend a book to get you started but alas i ve never considered trying this so i ve never put anytime in researching this

2143134
getter	setter
this doesn t seem to work from the source editor however try deleting a field from the outline view of the class - there it does offer to delete the getter setter too

2143171
getter	setter
little off topic but get rid of all your getter setter

2143171
getter	setter
it is because the getter setter method is linked to the field in the outline view

2143188
dictionary	map
map as dictionary and you get your datastructure

2143202
gif	png
i need a preg_match syntax or something similar to extract jpg or png or gif urls from a mixed text and put them in an array or at last store the first url

2143202
gif	png
maybe some syntax which searchs for strings that are beginning with http and ending with jpg png gif

2143210
width	height
right now i was going by the ratio of width and height

2143216
hid	keyboard
if your cc and barcode scanners work as hid devices basically keyboard emulation yes you can and i have seen it done

2143252
stdout	stderr
svn command line errors go to stderr not stdout which is why you aren t able to see them

2143252
stdout	stderr
what you want to do is redirect stderr to stdout and then to determine the cause of the error

2143252
stdout	stderr
this is not ideal because it mixes stderr with stdout when it would otherwise be unnecessary but i don t know of another way to get the desired output in this case

2143265
superclass	subclassing
this will call the - id initwithframe from your subclassing instead of the superclass and perform your custom code

2143265
superclass	subclassing
this also sends the calls to your subclassing instead of to the superclass

2143272
qabstracttablemodel	qmap
i have a class which inherits qabstracttablemodel and holds some complex structs in a qmap

2143300
public	protected
i m maintaining a rails app that has content in the public folder that will now need to be protected by a login

2143315
typedef	struct
edit i was experiencing the above extraneous old-style parameter list error because i was using the typedef name stack rather than using the struct keyword with stack to define it was the structure i am currently defining

2143344
config	ini
essentially nini is a simple ini read write library for config files

2143345
uiview	subviews
so the uiview will have 2 subviews

2143354
memset	malloc
i want to construct read malloc and memset my hashtable in c

2143370
for-loop	loops
and then display the timeline by a for-loop to loops through the hours of the day

2143377
post	get
imo get and post are two different animals and i can t think of a good reason why you would ever need to mix post data and query strings

2143377
post	get
it can be convenient to use _request when your scripts might respond to either get or post in the same manner

2143377
put	get
in addition to the security problems and wtfs caused by cookies and environment variables in the request variable don t get me started on global consider what might happen in the future if php started natively supporting other methods such as put and delete

2143377
post	get
however the question was not about the merits of get vs post it was about how the receiver should treat the incoming data and why it s bad to merge it so this is really just a btw

2143388
mouseover	mouseout
when i mouseout of the floating box and on to canada it will trigger the mouseover event for canada

2143388
mouseover	mouseout
however if i mouseover the floating box again the swf doesn t receive the mouseout event so canada stays highlighted

2143388
mouseover	mouseleave
that way you can simulate the mouseleave event to reset the country highlight and popups then when the mouseleave the floating box you can check to see if the mouse is over a country and perform the mouseover event normally

2143405
listview	gridview
this listview uses a gridview with two columns each templated appropriately one column is the caption just a label and the other column is the control

2143419
apache	nginx
the best way of doing this that i know of is the x-sendfile header which is supported by nginx apache with module and others

2143423
stdout	stderr
just what you need is to make sure you re not inserting weird data to the script to avoid any breaks and to redirect stderr to stdout to avoid to have errors and not to be able to see them

2143441
zsh	tcsh
i m quite certain you could easily google other good alternatives such as zsh or tcsh

2143457
rss	feed
in fact for parsing of rss feed without jquery you can use the google ajax feed api

2143476
int	double
i need to cast a double to an int in java but the numerical value must always round down

2143485
min	max
however the above might pull the min and max for the entire list not for each a.id

2143489
qmap	qdatastream
on the receiving end you can get your data structure qmap if that s what you want to use back out of the qdatastream

2143502
int	double
casting a double to an int does not round it ll discard the fraction part

2143559
maven	pom.xml
we use maven 2 and what i was thinking is to do something like a maven project that pulls the dependencies using dependencymanagement from the parent pom.xml and the default goal is something like unjar all the dependencies and jar them in a unique jar

2143598
groovy	gsp
i m new to grails groovy and gsp

2143605
bigloo	gambit
there is gambit scheme mit scheme plt scheme chicken scheme bigloo larceny ..

2143605
lisp	scheme
yet there s not to my knowledge a single popular scheme lisp on llvm even though llvm provides lots of nice things like

2143611
width	height
a div 100 of the window height 50 of the width left 0 red

2143611
width	height
a div 100 of the window height 50 of the width left 50 green

2143638
int	chars
there s no functional reason why you shouldn t be able in an arbitrary language inherit from ordinal types such as int or chars or chars etc

2143646
pull	push
you can now replace foo-clean .hg hgrc with foo .hg hgrc in order to preserve your repository-local settings such as the default push pull path

2143657
post	get
you should implement something like the post redirect get pattern and redirect to another view at the end of your action methods after all validations were verified and everything executed fine

2143664
getter	setter
as far as i know there is no way to use the old prototyping methodology for getter setter infact i believe the grand total of internal flex sdk classes that use any type of prototyping is 0

2143664
getter	setter
in any case getter setter aren t available in the prototype-hacking game

2143722
postgresql	mysql
personally i love postgresql -- but other free dbs such as mysql or if you have reasonably small amounts of data -- a few gb at most -- even the sqlite that comes with python will be fine too

2143765
post	get
this relies on post redirect get pattern - which is a good practice anyway

2143771
updatepanel	onclientclick
you make an onclientclick event on targetcontrolid for init tinymce if you use also an updatepanel

2143772
getdate	datepart
select datepart dw getdate

2143792
subtract	add
so each time you add subtract from your foolist you ll have to redo all your lookup objects

2143799
tunnel	vpn
you would need to set up a vpn tunnel to your private network

2143843
mouseup	mousedown
edits can be encoded as actions tool mousedown movement mouseup before they are rendered into pixels - this allows a cheap paint to be done as patches at the current mipmap level and quickly displayed while a background thread creates patches at the other mipmap levels

2143848
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following code which works in firefox google-chrome

2143859
hide	show
what i had intended to add in was how this would be achieved in the case of show hide toggling these with an animation speed code above changed accordingly

2143879
put	get
now thread 1 wakes back up and tries to get lock b and will be put to sleep

2143940
division	multiplication
i hate to say it but i don t handle this in my code since i don t use bit shifting for multiplication or division

2143994
unix	bsd
shebangs are only native to the filesystems of unix linux bsd variants due to their design and layout the filesystem knows that when a file begins with a shebang the filesystem triggers the user s terminal process to invoke the shell based on the shebang usually bin sh

2144012
value-initialization	rvalue
the expression t where t is a simple-type-specifier 7.1.5.2 for a non-array complete object type or the possibly cv-qualified void type creates an rvalue of the specified type which is value-initialization

2144037
min	max
can i set the heap size min max bt entering the following into the catalina.sh file

2144042
public	protected
promoting a private protected virtual method to public in a derived class does not expose the base class method

2144065
put	get
i was wondering how to do this in iis and how he put a slash in between the script and the get variables and how he had the script with no extension in the first place

2144070
svg	vml
the library will then handle this outputting to svg if supported or fallback to canvas vml flash silverlight etc if not depending on what s available

2144091
put	get
when i put the variable name into a textbox i get the correct text

2144111
centos	linux
os linux centos 5

2144190
folder	directory
i think the right way to do this is to go to the project properties click on mapping and then enter the path to the web folder in the remote directory and local directory parts and url pointing at the main site

2144204
portrait	landscape
what i m trying to do is create a series of uniform thumbnail images always 68 x 46 from a variety of larger images some portrait some landscape

2144204
width	height
in both cases resizing the image to fill the height or width of the thumbnail and then cropping the excess image equally off either side top bottom left right

2144206
folder	directory
the cms system running as a virtual directory gives the admin the ability to upload photos for display on the main site the target folder of which is www.mysite.com images - when attempting disk access from the root app i am able to write to the virtual directory but cannot do the opposite -- that is write to the root from the virtual directory getting security violations

2144206
folder	directory
if i can only upload to the admin virtual directory the entire point is moot because it s a secured folder that the public can t see

2144214
width	height
it is sized to content width and height and works well in that regard

2144214
width	height
the width and height can change

2144214
width	height
when positioning the window lets say in the bottom right corner i simply take the workingarea of the screen width and height and then minus the width height of the window to get the top and left position that i need

2144214
width	height
the logic works but the trouble i am having is the window s height and width is not returning the size it is after the content was updated but is returning the size it was the last time it was displayed

2144216
gif	png
if you re not opposed to python one option would be to use the python imaging library pil which provides python bindings for native decoders for many file formats including png and gif

2144226
ready	each
instead of each command saying yes i m ready or no i m not which will be the same for each command just have lastrun and interval fields which main can then use to determine when each command needs to run

2144234
children	parent
assuming you have a db with parent and children have a look at

2144294
cassini	iis
i assume that your login form has an external css file and that you re using cassini or iis 7 integrated mode

2144301
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the reason why this is recommended is because it makes setting of environment variables needed for your installation portable you can easily copy setenv.sh to other tomcat installation you can upgrade tomcat to a newer versioning which might overwrite catalina.sh but still have your existing setenv.sh

2144304
typedef	typename
nevertheless for portability you can use a typedef uint16_t or uint64_t although those might not be right or quote the typename with a template

2144304
unsigned	short
that leaves unsigned short unsigned char and signed char as the only types you can t easily explicitly construct

2144307
getter	setter
secondly if you are setting the dependency property from xaml the getter setter is not used the dependency mechanism uses its own internal setter routines

2144332
switching	screens
this way i could easily control the logic to switching between screens like

2144340
single-quotes	double-quotes
in both cases you re nesting single-quotes directly inside double-quotes which i don t think is correct

2144341
qtimer	qthread
i have done this before with a qthread but this time i would like to do it with a qtimer

2144350
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been working on a website that is very jquery intensive in google-chrome and firefox

2144350
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to see what the website is supposed to do open it in firefox or google-chrome

2144398
min	max
that would give you the following min and max number of intervals shown afterwards

2144423
expressionengine	joomla
so i m new to both joomla and expressionengine and want to know if i can use it like i d like

2144432
free	malloc
all in all each and everyone within the dev team have their own responsibility to ensure the code works and know the rules about memory management for example such as for every malloc there should be a free for every new there should be a delete but no blame should be accounted for the dev team themselves neither is finger pointing at the management for piling on the pressure on the dev team either

2144456
width	height
or even by calculating the width and height of css to preserve the proportions and make the image touch the box from inside like

2144502
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
in some of my application designs or for just some uiviews following a navigationcontroller s pushviewcontroller my new view will be shifted off the window by the height of the status bar

2144515
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	prolog	lisp	prolog
introduce a programming language paradigm like functional or logical with a demo of prolog lisp ocaml or haskell

2144531
free	malloc
however i have free all malloc ed memory

2144532
punctuation	words
a common term comprising the two sub-categories words and punctuation often used when talking about parsing is tokens

2144541
punctuation	words
so words punctuation and white-space are all tokens

2144553
free	malloc
if you are sure that you have free all malloc ed memory then no there s nothing wrong

2144587
multiplying	add
add everything up and multiplying the result by 3

2144600
width	height
it takes the greater of height or width sets the matching image dimension to that then calculates the ratio of original dimension to the new dimension then applies that ratio to the opposing dimension

2144607
stdout	stderr
okay option 4 have a wrapper script that redirects stderr stdout from your unmodified c++ program to a java program that translates the output into log entries would not be very complex

2144685
kde	gnome
i think both gnome and kde have their own ways to determine this and also to set the icon and the standard application for it

2144692
post	get
and when you get stuck on a specific part of the process post and you will get help w that

2144753
for-loop	arrays
now i need to read the arrays to get the values one-by-one using a for-loop like

2144786
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you need consistent ordering you can use linkedhashmap for insertion access order or treemap for comparision order

2144826
skip-lists	hashmap
a skip-lists allows you to traverse the entries in key order and also look them in random order but not as fast as a hashmap

2144878
dhtmlx	webix
webix spun off from dhtmlx touch a project with 8 years of development behind it - see below and went on to become a standalone ui components framework

2144878
sorting	filtering
these libraries don t implement complex widgets such as tables with sorting filtering autocompletes or trees

2144878
client-side	server-side
supports writing either server-side java applications that don t require developer knowledge of html http or javascript or client-side javascript-based applications do not require a server but can communicate with one via ajax

2144884
ia-32	x86
x86 ia-32 or the i386-architecture

2144916
vb.net	vb6
vb.net and vb6

2144921
popupwindow	pop-up
i want to open a popupwindow with close button only when the user clicks a button and the parent window should be disabled until the pop-up window closed

2144987
inherited	properties
this allows your character to have as many actions as you want meaning you can add remove actions without changing character class and each action is responsible for only itself but knows about the character and for actions which have more complex requirements inherited from iaction to add properties etc

2145035
put	get
i tried playing around with eval but i m not sure where to put it or how to get js to actually interpret the data

2145064
ciimage	nsimage
the main thing to be careful of is that the conversion from nsimage to ciimage can be expensive performance-wise so you should ensure you cache the ciimage if possible and don t re-create it during each drawing operation

2145115
folder	directory
you don t need to add the folder separately in fact mercurial doesn t handle plain folder directory at all

2145144
memcached	apc
it also comes with prebuilt xdebug apc and memcached modules which are for me the usual pecl compiled extensions

2145155
junit	testng
they all have some integration with junit or testng

2145166
free	malloc
if you must use the cfdictionary approach you have to find a place to free those malloc -ed memory when the values are not needed

2145176
unix	solaris
i come from unix world i m quite familiar with linux solaris cygwin

2145201
int	chars
int start int argc chars argv

2145231
g++	gcc
in a webserver if gcc and g++ are not provided by the hosting service to the user.can we download it and compile through it in rhel5 os

2145234
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
i have an abstract-class the superclass class super and 5 subclassing which should use the proprieties from the class super and add a new propriety a new column

2145234
super	extends
should i extends the class super from java or it s enough to join the classes using a jpa annotation

2145265
super	extends
on each subclass extends the super and add the annotation discriminatorvalue with different value for each of the subclasses

2145302
pull	push
each developer should have their own remote public repository which they can push pull to from

2145302
pull	push
then a will pull b s work to his local clone try things out merge commit and push to his own a s public repo for release

2145318
twitter	myspace
twitter myspace aol windows live msn hotmail or any other openid provider

2145325
width	height
also the correct constructor is bufferedimage int width int height int imagetype you inverted width and height

2145328
stdout	stderr
you can use os.execv to replace it with another process the perl cgi and the new process will inherit the current process environment stdin stdout and stderr

2145336
put	get
that s if they even allow arbitrary code running on their machines at all - they may if you get your own vm but if you re sharing resources with any of their other customers i ll guarantee you ll be restricted in what you re allowed to put on their machine and unless you re in your own little vm it s rightly still their machine - all you do is pay for the ability to use their server infrastructure

2145343
mvp	presenter
in a mvp system such as django the view decides what data should be shown and the presenter decides how it should be shown

2145349
freebsd	linux
ratproxy is currently believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments

2145415
post	get
semantically both seem to perform a get operation even though they are technically post requests as they just retrieve data without changing any state on the server ok that s another assumption

2145430
button	checkbox
if you can t do that without making changes to the form like in most of my cases you can try to utilise the soft keys and get rid of any button checkbox etc

2145438
post	get
if my user clicks more than once on a submit button of a form he essentially sends multiple get post requests depending on the form prefs

2145442
jobs	cron
if you can t create cron jobs on your server i suggest you switch your hosting provider otherwise the website you linked is your only viable alternative but you are depending on some third party this way which isn t really cool

2145456
post	get
thus get requests call get post requests call post and so on

2145517
prng	random
by the way the random module in python uses the mersenne twister prng which is considered very good has an enormous period and was extensively tested

2145585
int	double
this may not meet your requirements but it does give you the ability to specify the input type you are expecting which could be any one of string int double date or currency

2145607
public	protected
a static class cannot have any instance constructor see cs0710 whether it be public private protected or internal

2145657
jar	war
they are of type jar or war

for-loop	loops
either way this does not explain why the gmarker property is not available inside that for-loop that can not even be a race condition since loops starts immediately after that point where the object is still ok

2145715
int	double
the only exceptions are string it s allowed to add string objects and the primitive wrappers like int and double in java 1.5+ autoboxing converts them back to primitives

2145750
width	height
if that contains 0 try calling measure passing in a size structure containing large values for height and width then reading the desiredsize

2145767
children	parent
in real world parent s can accommodate children but children cannot accommodate parent

2145799
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of firefox the issue is fixed in 3.6

2145851

i think you chose a wrong model for real-life parent and children

2145851
children	parent
because not all children are parent

2145853
int	double
i iterate through the map using int keys and the functions firstentry and higherentry and modify the double values

2145853
int	double
those int keys are important to me and because the double values are not unique i cannot have a double key

2145858
post	get
but the problem is before my post method returns a result flag the method already finished so i always get the error message

2145860
children	parent
the xml structure is recursive so the children s can have the same element as the parent

2145952
downcasting	upcasting
the assignments you are performing are called downcasting and upcasting

2145959
int	double
however the only way in which i see this happening with another data structure is keeping a wrapper over the int and the double and writing two comparators - one which compares the int and one which compares first by the double and then by the int

2146047

int	boolean
obviously there would need to be some way of describing the binary file formats - a schema or some such - this would need to support all the obvious data types strings int of various sizes boolean etc floats would be nice too and things like count fields length fields padding alignment etc to handle all the typical stuff that you find in a data file

2146206
getter	setter
if the names are different add the getter setter for all the radio buttons in the actions with there same names the in action exectute method check the values of the radio button for true or false as

beyondcompare	winmerge
i have tried both winmerge beyondcompare and kdiff and they are not good enough if i have functions with the same name but placed in different areas of the file they show it as differences

2146267
width	text-align
the text-align left may not make a difference eg if there s no width specified and nothing inside has an inherent width like an image.

2146268
int	boolean
__eq__ returns a boolean which determines if two objects are equal __cmp__ returns an int which determines if the two objects are greater or less than each other and so is called unless you have specific __eq__ __ne__ __le__ __ge__ __lt__ and __gt__ methods

mouse	keyboard
there are only likely to be a few different types of event that need to be recorded - button clicks keyboard input on any text fields keyboard shortcuts and mouse input on any mouse-input fields so it s not an enormously taxing task although of course working out how to store and bind macros and how to facilitate import and export if you were inclined to do so is time consuming but not technically challenging

2146764
post	put

2147684
inherited	properties
if in your html #divnew is a child of .test then css properties of .test are already inherited by it unless you override them by setting specific #divnew properties

public	protected
does someone knows c# best practice about the way to define attribute visibility private or protected behind public property in abstract class or parent class

2148132
getter	setter
i think children class should have the way to handle directly this protected attribute but it may not be a good practice if getter or setter contains more code.

2148154

children classes should access it via public or protected properties

getter	setter
the docs mention that they are handy for function-based getter and setter but in my case i want an actual object

versioning	upgrade
i think a better solution would be to upgrade call you callback to either use boost function or a homegrown versioning like kornel s answer

2148905
hash	salt
something on the client side must decide on a salt and hash

2148905
hash	salt
that salt and hash must be consistent

2148905
hash	salt
if the salt changes so will the hash and then your server won t be able to hash it back to the original

2148905
hash	salt
that salt + hash have essentially become the user s new password

2148905
hash	salt
if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions

2148932
lisp	smalltalk

pop-up	dialog
in the same settings dialog you can also add this specific site to the allowed sites list and then pop-up blocker will let all new window creation attempts on said site succeed

2149161
ienumerable	iqueryable
you ll also notice that i m using iqueryable rather than ienumerable

2149259
equals	gethashcode
the thing is that dictionary uses two things to access the value by a specific key equals and gethashcode in the following manner

2149259
equals	gethashcode
get all keys that match requested key value by gethashcode value gethashcode value must be equals for equals objects and should be different for different objects

2149259
equals	gethashcode
taking this into account default gethashcode must be consistent with how the default equals implementation works - if a b a.gethashcode b.gethashcode - either way there would be really no point in providing default implementation if it wouldn t even meet the required minimum

2149275

implements	extends
abstract class all its method except some at least one method s un-implemented so that you can extends it and implements the un-implemented method

2149620
implements	extends
advantage by extends from abstract class you get all functionality of base class you will be forced to implements the un-implemented method

2149649
valgrind	gprof
you cannot use valgrind and gprof together

2149655
128bit	64bit
a 64bit double ieee-754 double-precision will help you be more precise with your error term but a 128bit base-10 floating-point value is just performance-killing overkill and almost certainly won t improve the precision of your results one iota

2149676
width	height
calls to the width and height then return accurate values

2149738
filtering	grouping
can easily be modified to grouping filtering data by hours

2149745
hide	show
so i added checkboxes to show hide a given column and set the visibility of the columnseries as such

2149745
hide	show
this show hide the given column correctly the problem is that it does not reset the y-axis so the other column never actually grows in height when the column with the larger values is hidden

for now though this was very fast to implements and a cool way to extends functionality to the sql group

2149807

2150131
for-loop	arrays
so i m assuming guessing that you have some kind of each or for-loop that creates the divs from the arrays perhaps like this

2150183
hash	salt
the hash could be a generated using a unique identifier for the linking website salt plus a dynamic identifier like the date although if the server times are off by any amount of time this could be problematic so i recommend an alternative value

2150233
equals	gethashcode
implement equals and gethashcode properly using the ones from the supplied strings and take care with null references in your struct and possibly to make it even nicer

2150233
equals	gethashcode
you should always implement equals and gethashcode as pair and this is even more obvious since the valuetype.equals is terribly inefficient and unreliable using reflection unknown method of equality comparison

2150249
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
basically you can take the following css and apply it to a div and it should work with firefox safari google-chrome opera ie5.5 and up

2150270
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari all handle this gracefully .

2150287
portrait	landscape
but for some reason that application is always in landscape mode despite my g1 is in portrait mode

2150332
versioning	upgrade
normally with a commercial project i d just upgrade the project to the most recent versioning applicable.

2150347
stdout	stderr
using shell redirection only redirects stdout cout not stderr cerr

2150352
stdout	stderr
to print stdout onto terminal and stderr into a file

2150353
stdout	stderr
if later on you want to redirect both stdout and stderr you can do

2150353
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect only stderr but allow stdout to display use

2150365
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
the 754 standard specifies what result you should get from certain basic operations notably addition subtraction multiplication division square root and negation

2150365
cpu	processors
if for example the processors has registers capable of holding extended-precision floating-point numbers and doing arithmetic with extended-precision does not take any more cpu time than doing arithmetic with double-precision a compiler is likely to generate code using extended-precision

2150365
multiplying	add
some processors have instructions to compute a multiplying and an add in one instruction so b c + d might be computed with no intermediate rounding and get a more accurate result than on a processor that first computes b c and then adds d

2150367
dlsym	dlopen
i m thinking this would be based on a similar set of functionality that posix provides to load and call dll s ie dlopen dlsym and dlclose

2150368
super	extends
even if you extends you will not be able to call the new methods through the super class reference

2150435
children	parent
if you now select only the last children that are also not the first childen of their parent element youâ ll get only the last children that are not the only children of their parent element

2150455
hash	md5
using c# i want to create an md5 hash of a text file

2150460
getter	setter
i completely understand the need for the getter and setter

2150483
getter	setter
if you ever need to do anything else in the setter or getter though the automatic property won t work -- you ll need the private field to manipulate

2150501
getter	setter
maybe you want to change the behaviour of the setter or getter at a later point

2150517
next	except
i met the next problem all resources except one has api for logging in

2150527
google-chrome	firefox
this method works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie8 doesn t seem to want to accept the cookie

2150533
accessor	properties
first thing to keep in mind is that properties accessor are compiled into methods

2150540
hide	show
to answer your subquestion if you want to emulate tag behavior without using noscript make a element with the content you want to show to non-javascript users and then hide it with javascript on domready event

2150550
nsurl	nsstring
returns an array of nsurl objects which you treat as nsstring objects

2150558
portrait	landscape
this should change the program to switch from portrait to landscape when the user rotates the device

2150577
post	get
one would have your authenticate method the other would have your get post

2150602
jboss	glassfish
also consider that in todays landscape with most commercial j2ee containers on top of osgi bea is websphere is jboss to some degree glassfish in the works maybe the upfront cost is reduced drastically by the fact that you can obtain off-the-shelf ready-to use bundles from various different providers which was always a basic element of the osgi vision

2150671
daemons	systemd
if your linux systemd supports it clock_gettime clock_monotonic should be a high resolution timer that is unaffected by systemd date changes ntp daemons

2150687
ubuntu	linux
i just migrated my dev environment from ubuntu linux to mac osx snow leopard

2150707
actionscript	mxml
it would be nice to know this in both actionscript and mxml

2150717
hash	md5
what i d do is make an md5 or sha1 hash of the file store it in the registry and check to see if that s changed on application startup

2150755
min	max
update mytable set spread max homescore awayscore - min homescore awayscore

2150756
des	aes
or the one for aes if you think triple des is too old-school or whatever

2150757
actionscript	mxml
i m new at actionscript though so i can t quite figure out how to duplicate this without mxml

2150780
addclass	removeclass
you can figure out the other one although i would generally advise to addclass and removeclass instead of messing with css styles directly

2150784
uploadify	swfupload
also for file uploads you may want to look into flash based uploaders like swfupload or uploadify that enable you to display a real progress bar among other things

2150789
stdout	stderr
this will work even if stderr is redirected as well as stdout

2150799
getter	setter
getter and setter are the public interface that other classes interact with

2150799
getter	setter
in complex systems you usually end up doing validation and other work inside the getter and setter

2150828
dlsym	dlopen
i m thinking this would be based on a similar set of functionality that posix provides to load and call dll s ie dlopen dlsym and dlclose

2150828
dlsym	dlopen
the com runtime provides a lot of extra services that apply to the windows environment but arn t really needed when implementing mini com in a single application as a means to dynamically link to a more oo interface than traditionally allowed by dlopen dlsym etc

2150828
dlsym	dlopen
ole com then loads dlopen the dll calls its dllgetclassobject dlsym method passing in the guid again presuming that succeeds ole com then calls the createinstance and returns the resulting interface to app

2150834
rar	zip
just package it as a compressed file such as a zip or rar for example

2150880
inherited	properties
there is a horizontalalign properties and a verticalalign properties on the vbox and hbox components it s inherited from box

2150895
hash	salt
the password is stored as a salt hash so there s no recovery possible

2150929
guava	java.util.concurrent
the linked implementation appears to have been written for java 4 and can be simplified a little using guava and java.util.concurrent

2150937
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
pcrypt uses the old style crypt function - if you are using something more moderns like an md5 hash you ll need to change pcrypt

2150973
put	get
now he wants it so when you try and put in a special character it simply will not get entered into the text box

2150995
opera	firefox
in both opera and firefox my facebook connect application successfully loads xd_receiver and everything works

2150995
opera	firefox
the url the popup is visiting is the correct xd_receiver page as is hinted by the fact that everything works in firefox and opera

2151052
ant	cruisecontrol
usually show up in the ant file while is something typical for cruisecontrol configuration

2151060
put	get
as far as swapping the high and low bits your right it did get put into the wrong spot

2151082
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome

2151103
put	get
the formview is returned on a get request and the successview is returned by default if everything succeeds in the put request

2151137
wordpress	oscommerce
i can not say the same for wordpress oscommerce etc

2151141
multiplying	add
to simulate this with a single dimensional array you multiplying the row index by the width and add the column index thus

2151166
securitymanager	classloader
i am hoping there is a simple way around this that does not require jumping through complex hoops using a custom securitymanager classloader etc

2151169
stdout	stderr
from my experience it s better to consume stdout and stderr of child process until they eof and then block in waitfor

2151169
stdout	stderr
however whether the child program will terminate crash when it s stdout or stderr pipe is closed at the other end is totally up to that child s implementation

2151173
hash	md5
what you must do is a server-side validation let s say you will validating against a md5 hash md5 1 c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b

2151173
hash	salt
obviously you should salt the hash function but even with out it your app will be pretty secure that way

2151193
folder	directory
i usually keep bpls in the same shared directory delphi uses because it is already in the path and avoids to litter the system32 folder

2151193
folder	dir
- no separate folder for dcus dcu d11 dcus are left in the source dir no good when sharing a library across differend delphi versions

2151239
hash	md5
it may be sufficient to append a md5 hash generated from the file contents and some secret only known to your application note that this could be circumvented easily by reverse-engineering the application

2151258
mouse	keyboard
various events i quote because i what the c++ concept of events is for things like keyboard and mouse events

2151269
hide	show
you can use it to show or hide the soft input.

2151302
multiplying	subtract
and now to count the digits on the right hand side well i ll just multiplying by 10 subtract the digit and do this until it reaches zero

2151310
profiling	debugging
as long as you just do debugging builds i suppose it doesn t matter which provisioning profiling you use

2151314
glut	glfw
also much of your requirements is already handled by the various opengl utilities - namely glut and glfw

2151321
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

2151321
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type

2151321
int	chars
there is no undefined behavior because a promotional conversion from unsigned chars to int happens in the case of variadic arguments

2151335
integer	unsigned
17 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

2151346
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu hardy heron

2151390
disk	ram
at some point you ll reach a point of truly saturating the machines network disk cpu and ram

2151412
serializable	deserialization
the need for the getter stems from serializable - you want to be able to set during deserialization

2151450
width	height
the final method is to load the jpeg into a bitmap object and compare the number of pixels with the forumla width height bytes_per_pixel

2151450
width	height
so if you load the bitmap and number of bytes of actual raw data is equal to width height then you know it s a safe bet that the image has 1 byte per pixel and as such is grayscale

2151456
width	height
set it up so the selection box s properties width height will be updated on numericupdown controls in real time

2151456
width	height
the width height values are not updated in real time

2151476
getter	setter
so i ve got my getter and setter setup and my xpath all good

2151489
post	get
if your form s method is get instead of post then substitute _post with _get in the code

2151492
svg	vml
nice thing is that this solution also works with vml svg raphael or other content that has alpha transparency

2151526
free	malloc
in c you allocate memory with malloc or another similar function and delete it with free

2151578
width	height
let s say you are only interested in two properties width and height then you can use code along the lines of

2151594
os.walk	enumerate
to enumerate the source files use os.walk and os.path to find the files and build full paths to the source

2151615
firefox	safari
doesn t work in either firefox 3.5 or safari 4 webkit nightly

2151652
range	max	range	min	min	max
because search will be performed between now and now also if i put min and max values as default it would solve first problem but there would be another problem if user wants to search by date range he would need to click many times to come from default 1700 something to now

2151725
post	put
if you can think of any extra information you could verify in a post connection check you could put that info in the certs maybe in commonname and write your own checker to use instead of none above

2151758
x86	mips
i m using x86 ubuntu hardy herron to cross-compile to mips

2151811
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested it only on ubuntu 9.10 though with google-chrome firefox epiphany and opera and it seems to work reliably in those which implies reliability in their windows counterparts

2151825
slug	permalinks
now if you dont want to expose your order ids in the url you could come up with some sort of other params to select the order itself although this would require a join query in your view order controller like customer username order date or what have you simialr to how you might see a blog permalinks as a date a title slug

2151901
internationalization	localization
if you want unicode characters for localization internationalization you shouldn t embed the strings in the source code

2151912
getter	setter
there is no logic involved in either setter or getter

2151937
ubuntu	linux
build operating system linux 2.6.24-23-server i686 ubuntu

2152021
width	margin	width	font-size	margin	font-size
for width padding margin of a text container where it s constrained by other layout elements you might choose to have them sized independently of the font-size for aesthetic reason

2152050
accessor	properties
you would want to serialize the underlying data members as opposed to the values returned by properties accessor

2152057
portrait	landscape
launch simulator in portrait change to landscape right

2152063
min	max
you can find remove the min and max elements in o log n time compared to o n time using a dictionary

2152084
getter	setter
in java an immutable class is generally means that it doesn t have setter and any field that can be accessed with a getter should also be immutable

2152086
unsigned	short
as arrays of unsigned short

2152092
irc	xmpp
this is what we want to do and this too makes it real easy. irc would be great but thinking about it there s nothing inherently wrong with xmpp either

2152094
xval	fluentvalidation
it s also possible to use another validation method fluentvalidation since these can be made to work smoothly with xval

2152139
accessor	properties
you should think of properties as being just like the accessor and mutator functions you used to write the trick with them was if you found that you did want to do some code whenever a variable was accessed you had to change all the calls to that variable to use an accessor instead calling a function rather than just accessing a member variable that is why you would create default accessor and matadors just in case

2152155
fancybox	colorbox
you could also use some php to spit out the markup iteratively and then wrap everything into a div and employ a lightbox plugin like colorbox or fancybox

2152179
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and opera there is a scrollbar that appears when my gridpanel has an overflow of properties

2152195
ant	maven	gradle	ivy
i d like to find a simple non-trivial java project that is expressed in terms of ant + ivy maven gant and gradle

2152204
min	max
ideas i have so far is having a character definition of valid characters that can be used and then build the string from this definition and use a pseudo random length for length variation with a max min length defined

2152206
ant	maven	gradle	ivy
it is expressed in ant ant + ivy maven gant and gradle

2152265
post	get
post the code somewhere and you should get a better response

2152307
post	get
when i submit a form using method post and full canvas callback url action inside facebook iframe canvas i cannot get the form elements in the request

2152343
min	max
use fields or private properties to hold the from and to dates instead of reading them from the dtp and set their defaults to min and max

2152343
min	max
also in the valuechanged event set the from and to fields to the values of the dtps you have to set both when either dtp changes because the user will see the other one as set to today but the search value will still be min or max

2152343
min	max
then you search from min to max unless the checkbox is checked and when the checkbox is checked you use the two dtp dates no matter what they are

2152360
folder	directory
if you dont need the default apps that come with tomcat then just go to your webapps directory where myapp is probably located and look for another folder called root in my tomcat 6

2152395
nsscanner	nsstring
i haven t used them for a while but i think you can do this with nsstring nscharacterset and nsscanner

2152404
post	put
given the information in your post although i d have liked to see the code itself let me put forth the most probable issue and its fix

2152421
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method

2152537
integer	unsigned
note that java does not have unsigned integer variables but these will be retrieved with the exact same bit pattern

2152537
unsigned	short
edit updated the example to show how to convert a short 16-bit signed to an int 32-bit signed with the unsigned value with tc_2_as_int

2152562
hide	show
i have made the program window to hide and show based on an external button input

2152562
hide	show
but if i set the window to active and triggered the show hide function it crashes with error

2152562
hide	show
also when i tried to use show function after hide it gives 2-3 of a same error applies when the window either active and inactive

2152603
ubuntu	linux
that extension is installed by default for security reasons on some linux distributions -- ubuntu provides it by default for example if i remember correctly

2152643
width	height
you could use javascript to get the computed height and width of the element that you want to resize to and pass them to the window.resizeto method

2152835
salt	md5
my thoughts of creating a unique token use hashing algorithms that use salt so the results cannot be predicted or decrypted problems with md5

2152838
filesystems	ntfs
we have a feeling it might be something to do with the ntfs filesystems ours is currently 75 full of fragmented files and we are going to try a few things around this principle

2152841
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i have to work between at least the cygwin environment and some standard linux distros ubuntu and opensuse and i have files lines of code that are only specific to say cygwin

2152852
filesystems	ntfs
i had the same problem because my project and its source code was in a folder that had ntfs s encrypting filesystems efs enabled

2152885
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
if your looking for something else that is more configurable less for scraping take a look at lxml.html and beautifulsoup also for python

2152942
daemons	launchd
if you re strapped for space then what you can do is create a little mini exec launchd daemons

2153064
spaces	delimiter
this function splits the variable title_words into separate array elements using a spaces as a delimiter

2153103
mouse	keyboard
to more concrete the application simulates key presses and mouse clicks when a certain key is pressed on the keyboard

2153152
int	chars
in java a sub-string maps on top of the original chars array and just takes memory for the base object and then the start and length int pointers

2153172
cvs	svn
cvs branches would have been another matter but not with the way svn handles branches it doesn t

2153187
width	height
i m not sure i ve understood your question completely but it s worth nothing that if you rotate a 100x200 object 90 degrees it will give 200x100 for width and height

2153187
width	height
there s a number of ways to get around this but i normally use scalex scaley as they are not affected by rotations and multiply those with the original width height of the clip

2153192
width	height
you can style your iframe give it a width and height and all that jazz

2153209
int	chars
boxing referes to a primite type int chars long etc... being wrapped into a class boxed

2153223
hash	salt
it uses its own rules email instead of username and a differently salt hash password so i can t use built in authentication

2153245
mamp	wamp
i never installed phpdocumentor on mamp but i did on wamp

2153307
public	protected
i found one limitation for public get protected set comments

2153307
public	protected
because comments should not be the same for public and protected respecting stylecop

2153316
width	height
update if i set width and height here

2153330
x86	64bit
one possibility is that the ppc has a large number of temporary registers that can store 64bit intermediate values whereas the x86 code may have to unload and reload the fpu truncating to 4 bytes and losing precision

2153352
hash	salt
another problem in addition to those mentioned above unless you hash and salt the received value again you are essentially storing all your passwords in the clear

2153367
ubuntu	debian
it seems like the tomcat version 6 at least packages available in ubuntu and debian are not working correctly

2153367
ubuntu	debian
while this might not be the premium choice of installation it seems necessary to get tomcat version 6 running without problems on ubuntu and or debian lenny

2153371
unix	bsd
i m using the the excellent unix comm command line utility in an application which i developed on a bsd platform osx

2153371
ubuntu	linux
when i deployed to my linux production server i found out that sadly ubuntu linux s comm utility does not take the -i flag to indicate that the lines should be compared case-insensitive

2153389
onclick	onkeydown
you can use javascript jquery comes to mind to bind all kinds of events to almost any dom element and in my opinion it ll generate cleaner code to if you don t use the onclick onkeydown etc

2153400
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it s a string formatter and it works fine in firefox google-chrome opera and safari

2153418
mouse	keyboard
i love keyboard and i use quite a few in textmate but just realise i still use the mouse for 2 of the most common actions

2153424
yourkit	jprofiler	yourkit	hprof	hprof	jprofiler
use profiling tools such as yourkit jprofiler and hprof this one is a command line tool

2153428
profiler	visualvm
so maybe you want to give it a try first.it should be included with the visualvm that comes with your jdk6 visualvm profiler

2153471
nunit	moq
i have nunit moq rhino.mock installed referenced but i cannot find any reference to mockunitofwork

2153473
versioning	upgrade
the icu versioning is upgrade to 4.2

2153504
implements	extends
usually plugins advertise themselves by extends some sort of plugin base class or implements an interface

2153536
nant	cruisecontrol
when checking the cruisecontrol log file whatever buildargs i try to pass are not passed to the call to nant

2153538
pop-up	dialog
it also listens for the out_going_call broadcast and traps the call if connected to wifi and then pop-up a dialog that tells the user the call has been blocked and offers the user cheaper options than gsm if there are any

2153575
stdout	fflush
to make sure your prompt shows do fflush stdout

2153575
fgets	strtol
if you want to read from stdin anyway use fgets + sscanf combination or fgets + strtol

2153579
formview	datalist
the problem my expectation was that the counter would be increased by 1 on every page load but the counters on my datalist and formview are always behind and stepped by 2 i.e

2153640
firefox	safari
all in firefox safari works fine

2153650
post	get
i know how to send a get post request with curl

2153707
hash	md5
or you have to use md5 library not tested to create the md5 hash out of any password

2153750
children	parent
instead a parent â œadoptsâ children

2153775
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
a nascent script-free alternative is position sticky which is supported in google-chrome firefox and safari

2153785
wadl	wsdl
also i think you should stick with wadl rather than wsdl 2.0 because it is less verbose and way simpler imho

2153805
post	get
i have a standard edit scenario with get and post the form has a save button and a lookup button that allows the user to lookup a postcode which fills out the address and returns it in the form fields

2153827
prepare	execute
prepare statements are much faster if you execute the same sql and just change parameters in it

2153852
ssl	https
i expect that this problem happens when your application is establishing an ssl https connection

2153892
vim	emacs
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

2153897
next	except
editor s note sort -r almost shuffles except that duplicate lines sort keys always end up next to each other

2153911
outputstream	inputstream
i ve written background inputstream and outputstream implementations that wrap other streams and read ahead on a background thread primarily allowing for decompression compression to happen in different threads from the processing of the decompressed stream

2153990
range	min
however upon executing the code and having min specified in the range variable i get the following exception

2154070
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you can have your view model define what is the corresponding value type and in action-filter onactionexecuting call you converter - automatically

2154125
quicksort	mergesort
on small arrays the other approaches are much faster and on bigger arrays mergesort quicksort has a much better performance

2154130
put	get
i want to put overlay like this search in google map but i need to have .kml file for that area or region or city which is i don t have.so if anybody know how can we get .kml file for particular location then please let me know

2154159
richfaces	tomahawk
rather use the jsf-supplied iterating components such as tomahawk t datatable or richfaces a4j repeat or facelets ui repeat or maybe even a nested h datatable

2154164
snmp	mib
i m using java mibble library to process mib files and create mib implementation for my snmp agent

2154171
ceil	sqrt
the cost of traveling is ceil ceil sqrt x1-x2 2+ y1-y2 2 v + days spent in the city

2154196
webkit	gecko
it works in good browsers gecko webkit but jquery has a known bug on using .innerhtml with html5 elements documented here

qtabwidget	qtabbar
i tried qtabwidget qtabbar ktabwidget ktabbar bau no effect

2154229
ant	maven
for the build use a dedicated build system like maven or ant

2154231
ant	maven
you can use ivy if you wish to stick with ant or you can use maven which was designed for exactly this task

2154289
hide	fadeout
i am trying to bounce a secondary nav bar up then hide it fadeout then in new content then bounce down a different navbar on appropriate button clicks

2154318
ostream	istream	std	ostream
there are several shared base classes for streams std ios ios_base is the ultimate superclass but there are also ios istream ostream and iostream for different types of functionality

2154341
put	get
the thing is that on submit the plugin will have to put the text back to the textarea for it to get passed to the next page

2154396
superclass	subclassing
therefore if the non-final method is overriden in the sub class and is executed during the initialization of the superclass it may be accessing uninitialized fields of the subclassing giving erroneous results

2154439
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can see that the range of a float directly depends on the number of bits allocated to the significand and the min max values depend on the numbre of bits allocated for the exponent

2154474
ubuntu	debian
set up a debian or ubuntu server edition

2154493
width	height
rectangle constructor params are x y width height

2154522
springsource	grails
grails is now supported out of springsource too so it should have legs so to speak

2154541
min	max
the values for max min cannot be hard-coded but has to come from my action class probably from the request

2154541
min	max
a solution would be to parameterize the whole thing have a validation rule for advanceamt with parameters min max and call that for each input element containing the class .advanceamt

2154541
min	max
and pick up the parameters min max from the input tag itself from scriplet i can generate a min x and max y

2154568
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
however if i query a value of a input type file on some browsers opera i get a full path to a selected file but on other browsers firefox google-chrome just a file name without path

2154572
subtraction	addition
source unary + - bind tighter than addition subtraction + - and associate right

2154577
redmine	trac
some people for example use redmine instead of trac

2154577
vmware	esx
optimised for vmware esx vmware server and kvm intel or amd x86 architecture

2154577
debian	linux
well you can try damn small linux it s only 50mb and debian based and i believe it s the most famous minimal distribution you can check more distros in this list

2154617
x86	64bit
in win32 intelockedincrement intelockedincrement64 and associated operations compile to x86 instructions that allow processor level atomic operations on 32 or 64bit words depending on your architecture

2154640
persistent	transient
java s transient keyword is used to denote that a field is not to be serialized whereas jpa s transient annotation is used to indicate that a field is not to be persistent in the database their semantics are different

2154646
persistent	transient
the transient annotation tells the jpa provider to not persistent any non- transient attribute

2154764
wma	asf
wma over mms asf

2154778
persistent	transient
as others have said transient is used to mark fields which shouldn t be persistent

2154778
persistent	transient
when this class is fed to the jpa it persistent the gender and id but doesn t try to persistent the helper boolean methods - without transient the underlying system would complain that the entity class person is missing setmale and setfemale methods and thus wouldn t persistent person at all

2154792
wma	asf
wma over mms asf

2154795
mp3	m3u
implement an m3u pls parser which is just a text list of mp3 streams and use the code here to play the mp3 s

2154801
google-chrome	firefox
can some body tell me why this is not working in firefox and google-chrome but working in ie

2154806
getter	setter
vb requires to override both getter and setter while c# does not

2154813
versioning	upgrade
this is why its trying to upgrade your perl to latest versioning when you install this module

2154820
vb.net	vb6
i have a vb project that is converted from vb6 to vb.net

2154839
versioning	upgrade
take a backup of your htdocs and data folder subfolder of mysql folder reinstall upgrade versioning and replace those folders

2154900
bazaar	git
use a sufficiently clever vcs so that you don t actually have to write much code twice git bazaar mercurial and branch

2154906
fadein	fadeout
you can do fadein fadeout or fadeto depending on what you need

2154914
dictionary	map
i would like to map the contents of the history array according to the date values each dictionary has i need to dynamically create sections named and sorted according to the date values of each dictionary the iphone app wikipanion does this in its history view

2154928
post	get
you should be able to view the ajax reponse in firebug and see what is gtting posted back to you - you can get a 200 error but still get an error in the post back

2154945
int	boolean
since the type is determined automatically by the build system boolean int floats and strings i wondered if there is any way to force the datatype to string

2154993
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome

2155040
lxml	beautifulsoup
you re better off using the tried-and-true 3rd party modules out there like lxml or beautifulsoup that are not only more resilient to errors but will also give you exactly what you are looking for with little trouble

2155043
rss	feed
using jquery i get my own stackoverflow rss feed and print out a link to each entry

2155046
rss	feed
you can add a data source which can be a json file or an xml file or and rss feed

2155059
min	max
some assumptions - your collection of validation rules contain three properties id min and max

2155081
many-to-many	one-to-many
a many-to-many relationship with extra attributes is mapped as two one-to-many relationships

2155199
int	chars
this program reads in the data from the text file splits it into two chars arrays and then tries to use atoi to convert this into an int

2155220
avr	microcontroller
if your looking at getting into the real microcontroller space and really taking a look at low level system programming i would recommend you start on a very simple architecture such as an avr or pic something without an mmu

2155270
post	get
there are security issues you should consider like trusting the value of user_id and checking user input but i won t go into that. if you used method post on your form then you get the values with _post formfieldname

2155281
width	height
the constructor of the imagesnapshot method takes width and height as its first two arguments

2155293
inherited	subclassing
if not then instead of trying to add it to 500 classes you might want to spend the time refactoring and subclassing the base object into your own then have all the classes inherited from that

2155314
sudo	passwd
i m using qt c++ they work fine but i can t get them to run bash in a tty which you need if you are going to use anything like sudo which requires a tty pty to accept a passwd

2155322
cos	sin
y sin x cos x

2155340
min	max
using max min or any of the other aggregates can only handle one duplicate row per group

2155395
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
desired solution is a workaround to enable sorting filtering and grouping on a compositecollections i don t care to override and create my own compositecollection i just don t know how i can override this and enable its functionality in xaml

2155406
pygtk	gdk
it s not documented in the pygtk reference but it s in the gdk api documentation and is exposed through pygtk

2155433
post	get
send your post get vars to the php app have it run the necessary operations and then whatever php prints to the screen should be captured by wpf for processing

2155441
erd	diagram
i think you should create an erd diagram and map it to the tables in the following way

2155452
folder	directory
i have this script to display all the files within the directory the script is in but i will have a directory that will contain multiple folder with documents in each

2155452
folder	directory
i want to do this because this directory will have additional folder and files added to it

2155466
serializable	deserialization
when working with instances of an entity class it completes serializable without exceptions but deserialization always throws a null reference exception when excecuting formatter.deserialize

2155466
serializable	deserialization
but i have tested by temporarily removing the event handlers and both serializable and deserialization works correctly so i assume this is the problem

2155477
versioning	upgrade
this means that the next versioning s installer doing a windows installer major upgrade will fail because it is unable to first remove the previous versioning

2155502
hide	show
toggle hide or show elements

2155532
opera	firefox
perhaps this does the trick in ie and firefox not in opera

2155573
spyware	antivirus
mischievous code running with this permission granted could for example shut down antivirus or spyware detection applications yet make it appear as if it s still running

2155583
spock	grails
using grails 1.2.0 and the latest spock 0.4-snapshot as of 01 28 2010 10 18 est i m getting compilation errors that the groovy compiler is unable to find

2155584
min	max
it is guessed that min 555 or max 2000 insert requests must be done per second to sql server and some kind of scenaria will be fired as in my first post

2155600
margin	height
to reduce the slowness of scripting a thousand items you could replace the above-and-below-the shown-items items with a single top and bottom margin of the same height as that many items and catch the scroll event to fill in new items to replace them

2155625
queue	fifo
there s a single-linked list here recipe 17.14 in the python cookbook 1st ed but it s hardly mature or rich -- it s just doing a fifo queue so it s pretty minimal

2155625
cdr	cons
this recipe is a very concise c implementation of read-only lisp-like cons-boxes -- just car cdr and cons

2155648
hash	md5
md5 hash

2155671
google-chrome	firefox
- with keydown or keypress is working fine for firefox and google-chrome

2155744
mouse	keyboard
i use the mouse sometimes in concert with my left hand on the keyboard

2155771
vsto	add-in
i m experiencing a bit weird problem with vsto outlook add-in i m developing

2155798
mouse	keyboard
the more i used the keyboard movement in vim the less i wanted to use the mouse

2155798
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t help that extended periods of time where i m constantly moving from keyboard to mouse can take a toll on my wrist

2155844
put	get
the existing code uses a wrapper around a xercesdomparser to parse the xml as it comes in and after using setdonamespaces and setdoxinclude to true it is attempting to parse the xinclude but i get a persistent fatal include failed and no fallback element found in document 0 error no matter where in the directory structure i put testguioutput.xml

2155853
client-side	server-side
also check out codeplex as there are tons of projects hosted there for server-side jquery wrappers and client-side extenders

2155854
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in firefox 3.6 safari windows and google-chrome windows

2155896
mouse	keyboard
the mouse seems fast but in reality it isn t precise so you lose time in addition to the constant back and forth with the keyboard

2155914
children	parent
the important thing is not to expose the children collection itself to the outside world - the parent should be able to mediate all the access

2155914
children	parent
i don t understand your specification example it seems like your childspecification would return true if any of the parent s children has somecondition as true

2155931
pull	push
devs with required ssh keys can push local changes to the code on github back up to github so any bug fixes or new features that would be of benefit to all projects using the plugin module can pull them down too

2156006
width	height
this will return the size width and height of the text

2156021
width	height
make the size property a struct with the width you want and use a large height value

2156031
queue	fifo
so linked lists are a nice way to implement an arbitrarily long fifo queue of large objects

2156046
uiview	subviews
for uiview ios development only you can safely use makeobjectsperformselector because the subviews property will return a copy of the array of subviews

2156046
uiview	subviews
thank you to tommy for pointing out that makeobjectsperformselector appears to modify the subviews array while it is being enumerated which it does for nsview but not for uiview

2156092
mako	genshi
consider genshi mako jinja2 django templates or more

2156120
bcel	cglib
javassit bcel or cglib might be use to generate a dedicated cloner as fast as one hand writed

2156128
versioning	upgrade
when i say that it doesn t work i mean that using the resulting installer does not attempt to do an upgrade like it would if i manually increased the versioning string in the product properties table from inside installshield

2156145
octal	decimal
other than that you need want to pass 0 as the conversion base in which case it implements the usual c convention that a leading 0 signals octal 0x signals hexadecimal and 1-9 signal decimal

2156161
put	get
...i get undefined when i put this var in an alert within the success function

2156162
srp	principles
but if you follow the srp single responsability principles then i think that ordering methods is in most of the circumstances a non-issue

2156175
many-to-many	many-to-one
fields in those tables and some one-to-one or many-to-one or many-to-many relations

2156175
put	get
or will there be any need to itake the help of php to proces one loop and based on the values that i get i put some conditions to apply rules that the client wants

2156188
postgresql	mysql
if you are doing tests on mysql you should store the results in a different database such as postgresql this way you won t increase the load with your operations

2156216
put	get	post	put	post	get
getting data from directly database wit security issues getting specified text from php values that are put in special divs or getting all content of php and styling into sidebar with without get post methods or whatever it is

2156220
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception
edit by 280z28 changed nullreferenceexception to invalidoperationexception which is what throws when hasvalue is false

2156259
post	get
i will try to get this corrected and post an update today

2156278
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
when i try to use the same method to dynamically create an element it does not work in google-chrome or safari only in opera

2156287
put	get
values that i get i put some

2156312
int	boolean
now you have something that you call with no parameters and it returns something that can take a int boolean function and give you a list int in return

2156319
put	get
values that i get i put some

2156388
post	get
each post get tags through post_tags

2156483
move	drag
jide has a rangeslider with 2 thumbs and a nice extra one on top to move both thumbs at once drag the range around in their open source common layer

2156522
multiplying	modulo
after multiplying two polynomials make sure you divide the result modulo the irreducible polynomial chosen in 4

2156522
multiplying	add
thus you ll achieve a generic simple program which can add and multiplying elements over all finite fields

2156638
post	get
sorry not quite sure how to get the code posting formatted correctly feel free to edit my post in that situation

2156776
ant	maven
halting on error or failure in junit - this halts when i run the ant script only but the build succeeds in maven and does not halt even thought junit has an error

2156814
width	height
just specify one dimension either the width or the height but not both and it will keep the ratio

2156814
width	height
with css you could also specify just the maximum width and maximum height

2156822
post	get
gets the http data transfer method such as get post or head used by the client

2156822
post	get
gets or sets the http data transfer method get or post used by the client

2156822
post	get
such as get post or head

2156822
post	get
get or post

2156824
width	height
setting both the width and height of an forces the browser to rezise it to match what you tell it to

2156824
width	height
setting only one either width or height resizes it so that the image s ration is kept

2156824
width	height
you can use the php function getimagesize to get the image s actual width and height and then rerform a proportional resize based on

2156828
width	height
i you plan to always use this height width you could insert the resampled image directly in the database

2156828
width	height
if you plan to use many height width or change these sizes in the future you should keep the originals as you do now

2156868
width	height
now i want an array which contain those books id s which their height is greater than or equal to their width

2156892
int	chars
in java or c chars and int are practically interchangeable and in certain loops it s very useful to me to be able to do increment chars and index arrays by chars

2156898
ord	chr
in python 2.x just use the ord and chr functions

2156898
ord	chr
by default a string is unicode so the above works ord receives unicode chars and chr produces them

2156913
public	protected
1 in protected inheritance the public and protected members become protected members in the derived class

2156913
public	protected
the derived class can access the public and protected members in both cases

2156917
post	get
...and get all of relations of post instead i got an array of post row

2156963
public	protected
1a protected inheritance means the child can access everything it could in public inheritance but others using that object can only see the public interface to the child anything in it s parent is hidden

2156968
public	protected
public and protected members become

2156968
public	protected
access the public and protected

2156968
public	protected
note you can still manipulate some state if any maintained in the base class using non-overriden public protected member functions

2156982
public	protected
derived classes can access protected and public members of it s base class and the derived class can not access the private members of it s base class

2156982
public	protected
the private members are inherited for the following reason the base class can define a protected or public function that modifies the base class s private member

2156996
public	protected
specifying private protected or public when inheriting from a base class does not change anything access-wise on the derived class itself

2157000
httpresponse	request
the page source is the the raw html that is returned from the web server so you can get this text by simply submitting an http request to google and reading the httpresponse

2157016
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up saying if you close this editor your activity will stop

2157046
struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes
i can think of spring hibernate stripes struts and wicket for java

2157068
post	get
i ve written the following code to get json data with a post request

2157072
mouseout	mouseleave
try using the mouseleave event rather than the mouseout according to the api

2157076
width	height
i am on .aspx page and i want to take the width and height of a control from a static class

2157191
put	get
when i run this query in sql server 2008 management studio it returns me id 1 but when i put this query into reporting query designer - i get the next error

2157204
width	height
where width and height are pixels

2157220
post	get
standard wordpress permalinks have page titles without dates and you can also get rid of the date in post customize your dated wordpress permalinks - perishable press

2157242
post	get
model- loadfromarray something to get post

2157258
qstyleditemdelegate	qitemdelegate
if this is the case a qitemdelegate -derived class or qstyleditemdelegate is almost certainly what you want

2157384
updatepanel	scriptmanager
make sure you add a scriptmanager as well to the page otherwise there s no updatepanel functionality

2157433
robocopy	xcopy
xcopy is old-school robocopy s where it s at

2157436
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox a breaks a line but in google-chrome the line continues

2157443
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
another parser javascript engine like ie 6 7 8 safari or google-chrome might execute this code even though firefox s parser and javascript engine don t

2157517
slideup	slidedown
personally i like to use slideup and slidedown rather than slidetoggle

2157526
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are still acting as they used to

2157526
google-chrome	safari
naturally google-chrome and safari still work as expected and only give the viewable size

2157588
uiview	subviews
it then adds a subviews using uiviewanimationtransitionnone showing a uiview containing a tableview

2157588
portrait	landscape
although both flipping and rotating appear to work at first if i flip while in landscape mode the flipped view is sort of cropped to portrait width although actually displayed in landscape rotation then doesnt fix it u have to flip back rotate back to portrait then flip back again

2157605
inherited	properties
if i use inherited then everything the view needs would always be a direct properties of the view model hence pvm.name

2157605
inherited	properties
inherited from person or keep person as a properties or something else entirely

2157605
inherited	properties
with inherited you naturally expose all public properties from the domain model which may not be a good idea

2157648
children	parent
since you re only inheriting from one parent to one child rather than to many children you re not avoiding a lot of duplicated code in the first place

2157657
inherited	properties
this isn t strictly a viewmodel in the classic sense of the word but i feel it allows for much of the same functionality without introducing awkward inherited or code duplication with tunneled properties

2157702
pop-up	dialog
the code pop-up a dialog showing

2157702
firefox	safari
i ve been researching and it looks like the problem is that firefox is attempting to preflight the request because of the custom headers while safari isn t and is instead just sending the custom headers without first checking if they re valid

2157705
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of hudson hudson ver

2157762
jwindow	jdialog
also calling validate on a top-level component jwindow jdialog jframe will not necessarily resize that component

2157769
textarea	textbox
textbox doesn t holds n only textarea does

2157779
button	checkbox
edit originally i mentioned radio button this is wrong - checkbox is correct

2157785
post	get
you re setting the ajax request type to get but your action method is set to only accept requests of type post

2157789
post	get
you are requesting a get from your jquery code but you are stating that the action is only for post

2157790
dictionary	map
python has dictionary perl has hashes java and c# has map and c++ has the stl map

2157794
min	max
you should use rbsplitview google it it also gives you option for min and max height

2157802
disk	ram
you can create a ram drive and write the stream to it this way you are still keeping it all in ram assuming the disk operations are what worries you

2157808
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml file which depends on this plugin but i can t find it anywhere online

2157827
erlang	lisp
indeed most functional languages like lisp haskell and erlang are derived from mathematics

2157827
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme
so have a look at lisp scheme erlang and haskell if you want

2157833
ubuntu	linux
when i was learning assembly past 4 years i was on windows but now i m on linux ubuntu and the debug tool is only for windows

2157871
apache	nginx
whenever i have done this in the past i have used apache or nginx in front of the webserver and let those handle the https

2157910
cpu	processors
consequently it s pretty perverse really to seriously consider this as an option for shaving a few machine cycles when we re multiple generations of processors beyond the point when it was considered to be a good trade-off of cpu vs complexity to aid clean maintainable code

2157932
ssl	https
if you re transmitting critical data credit card bank account or social security numbers you should use a secure ssl connection https

2157980
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

2157980
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles event bubbling

2157988
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer google-chrome and firefox manage to read the actual status text

2157997
x86	mips
and seeing as on my laptop i have compilers for x86 x86_64 two kinds of mips powerpc arm and avr.

2158015
rank	max
alternately you could not use max and use order by rank limit 1

2158022
webrat	cucumber
in terms of using cucumber with rails webrat is considered the standard way of faking a request through the web stack - it is pretty powerful and results in nice readable step definitions

2158033
post	get
but when i try to run it inside i still get a full page post response

2158033
post	get
the code in oninit causes the control to post correctly but i don t get the updated text for the linkbutton

2158074
post	get
another way to do what you need is simply send a request to an external website via xhr post and then another get request to retrieve the file back which will appear as a save file dialog

2158095
inherited	properties
mike is right that if you just want to use the properties name on all derived objects you don t need it to be marked abstract at all as it s inherited

2158165
keydown	keyup
although the silverlight textbox class does not support a keypress event it does have a keydown and a keyup event that can be used to retrieve character information when a key is entered into the textbox

2158177
hide	show
rita if you re happy to have the html present on the page and you only want to hide show the divs then here is the code for that

2158177
hide	show
based on the amount of html you have to hide show i don t think a jquery postback is required

2158215
versioning	upgrade
i had a couple of user script that worked in versioning 3.5 by adding command line option --enable-user-script after i upgrade to versioning 4.0 all those scripts stop working

2158221
post	get
that way if it s the blogger he won t get emails on his own post but everyone else will

2158259
post	get
when its handle method is called it s supposed to interpret the request dispatch it to a suitable child restlet or query the matching resource the get post .

2158263
width	height
it returns width and height used by string and i can estimate how many lines and points or inches it will use inside a column

2158268
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome this runs fast

2158308
width	height
instead i manually set a width value and have a function change the gridpanel s height and width on the property panel s body resize

2158328
mouseleave	mouseenter
i almost always find that it s better to use the hover method or the hoverintent plugin rather than separate mouseenter mouseleave handlers if you are planning to do things both when the mouseenter and leaves an element

2158328
mouseleave	mouseenter
both of these seem to handle the range of possible mouse movement events rather than just mapping onto mouseenter mouseleave

2158379
min	max

2158650
cvs	svn
no double administration of bugs into planning tool and or planning items into bug tracking tool for the correct cvs svn etc commit numbers

2158772
getter	setter
i tried to implement my own setter and getter methods that align with the kvc standards but the getter method i have is not getting called

2158779

2158947
datalist	repeater
could you not use a repeater datalist datagrid

2158962
cpu	processors
out of order execution is a strategy employed by most modern cpu pipelines that allows them to re-order instructions on the fly to typically minimise read write stalls which is the most common bottleneck on modern hardware due to the disparity between cpu execution speeds and memory latency i.e how fast my processors can fetch and process compared to how fast i can update the result back to ram

2159010
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari it says no which is expected

2159037
cvs	svn
if they know about tfs svn cvs or anything else that s great but it wouldn t get me to hire them if i had doubts about their core skills

2159045
innodb	myisam
if yes is innodb slower than the common myisam but i shouldn t worry about that

2159129
width	height
to calculate how far from the bottom or right you would have to use jquery s width and height methods

2159224
google-chrome	firefox
here is what i have now works in the latest versions of ie firefox and google-chrome - test.cultureconquest.com

2159239

2159334
profiling	debugging
you have your debugging code list memory profiling for the stuff you suspect and look for jumps in memory sizes

2159346
int	double
then the c++ compiler will compile a version of sum for int and a version of sum for double

2159351
width	height
there is an inner div of fixed width and variable height contained by an outer div

2159351
margin	height
if the inner divs height is not set the bottom margin between where the inner div ends and the outer div ends is always 2-3px too long

2159385
width	height
there are a few ways around it one of which is to introduce a thin 1px border which blends into the background of the div and then compensating with the width height

2159427
inherited	subclassing
i m trying to use nhibernate to map a table per subclassing inherited structure that looks something like this

2159455
subtract	add
the solution in this case is to either do the calculation manually or if your application will allow for it add a very small buffer around the subtract point to make it occupy space

2159486
width	height
when you define a layout and view on xml you can specify the layout width and height of a view to either be wrap content or fill parent

2159493
cpu	processors
at the cpu level yes every processors will eventually see the change to the memory address

2159498
typedef	struct
i m a bit uncertain of how the typedef struct and pointers play together

2159526

2159757
accessor	properties
properties tells the compiler to specify a particular properties accessor get set method

2159765
getter	setter
you can replace this with your own setter and getter methods but only do that if you need to as the built-in ones have some features that you would otherwise have to code yourself

2159765
getter	setter
the property is just a hint to the compiler and other programmers that you are making a property and not just getter setter methods

2159765
getter	setter
the synthesize just creates simple getter and setter for you to go with your property but you can also just code those getter and setter yourself like any other method

2159769
accessor	properties	getter	setter
this means that the compiler expects to see setter and getter accessor methods for the properties

2159769
getter	setter
when you use the synthesize keyword you are asking the compiler to automatically generate setter and getter accessor methods for you

2159769
getter	setter
neither synthesize nor property are actually required you can create your own getter and setter methods and as long as you create them using key-value coding-compliant syntax the property will still be usable

2159769
accessor	properties
note that there are numerous keywords you can use with your properties declaration to control what sort of synthesized accessor code is created such as readonly for a getter-only accessor copy atomic nonatomic and so on

2159789
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
since methods are public in objective-c the answer is to write an accessor getter method that returns avar and a mutators setter method that sets avar

2159796
short	base
in short the idea is to build a certain measure of partial replaceability into the base template -- whether by using content styles templates or a combination of these

2159837
ant	maven
i think you would benefit greatly with a build tool such as ant or maven

2159846
hide	show
better do this in a thread from viewdidload and call your method in a thread before calling the thread show your label and when the data is loaded through the thread hide the label

2159878
actionscript	mxml
mxml is also a tag based language and is used in conjunction with actionscript - but i compiles to flash .swf

2159941
put	get
i don t know the specifics but i m sure you could get statistics about the behavior of players that cheat this way--in other words find things that the cheaters have in common length of turns consistency etc and have your application automatically find those and put a red flag on players that look suspicious

2159941
put	get
whatever barriers you put up determined cheaters will get around them

2160018
dictionary	map
i would just create a javascript ecmascript map or dictionary that has the relevant information for the language

2160019
onresize	onload
body onresize resizewindow onload resizewindow

2160019
width	height
the solution i m currently working on needs a few changes as to width otherwise height works fine as of so far

2160042
ironruby	ironpython
you can use ironpython or ironruby with wpf or silverlight

2160042
ironruby	ironpython
here is one article on wpf with ironpython and another article of wpf with ironruby

2160042
ironruby	ironpython
as for javascript there is work on ironjs as well as jint which you should be able to use in wpf similar to how ironpython and ironruby are used

2160084
int	boolean
so some preferences will be boolean others strings others int

2160158
x509	openpgp
i m not using x509 or openpgp keys certs as they are too big and bulky for my needs and they don t fit in the security model

2160165
cvs	svn
sudo is a non-posix example as are svn and cvs

2160209
fgetc	isspace
since isspace may include space form-feed f newline n carriage return r horizontal tab t and vertical tab v in its check for white-space characters your best bet may be to read one character at a time in a loop using the fgetc function

2160209
int	chars
note that if the int value returned by fgetc is stored into a variable of type chars and then compared against the int constant eof the comparison may never succeed because sign-extension of a variable of type chars on widening to int is implementation-defined

2160209
istream	getline
the istream getline method will allow you to read in one line at a time and optionally specify the delimiter default is n

2160247
int	chars
if you stick with the basic c like java operations + - using the native data types int chars string and avoid the fancy libraries java will perform nearly as fast as c

2160251
gridview	datalist	gridview	detailsview	listview	gridview
i see there re controls like gridview datalist detailsview listview

2160291
hide	show
if so i suggest that you may use a simple viewcontroller to show the label loading... and then create the mainviw or next view which you want show to user in the end when it was done hide the first view show the mainview on screen.

2160310
getter	setter
my php objects mostly contain private properties that have a custom getter and setter method

2160346
put	get
models.py is just a file where you put model classes which are just classes that get accessed from all over the place

2160349
gridview	detailsview

2160352
javadb	hsqldb
check out javadb derby or h2 or hsqldb

findwindow	showwindow
i think you ll need to delve into the findwindow and showwindow api calls

2160490
stdout	fflush
try using fflush stdout before your if condition

2160545
hide	show
so i have a three column layout left column is my accordion widget when the h3 is selected a middle div will appear animation doesn t matter and a floating right column within that div to give the appearance of a three column layout which the right column will be used to show hide contents within that middle div

2160545
hide	show
show hide

2160545
hide	show
so i guess what i m trying to do is give the effect that content is being populated from links within the divs to show hide toggle or something when the user clicks a link rather than display a laundry list of items content

2160685
hide	show
this example will show hide the element when the window resizes

2160754
submit	submission
it is not especially easy but the standard way to do it would be to use drupals forms api for the callback submission as well - that way you ll get the same validation that would happen on a non js submit

2160775
memcached	apc
also you should consider using some caching techniques like apc and implement a memcached support in the db layer

2160775
nginx	lighttpd
it s even better if you could use dedicated servers for php lighttpd database and static content images flash etc nginx

2160786

note that the most common reason for this exception these days is attempting to load a 32 bit-specific platform x86 dll into a process that is 64bit or vice versa viz

2160951
width	margin
i should also emphasise the table width was 100 minus a margin prior to this issue and it worked just fine

2160984
memcached	apc
do data caching with the mentioned solutions cache_lite zend_cache apc with multiple backends file memcached shared memory

2161041
equals	gethashcode
while using dictionary i always override gethashcode and equals or provide a custom comparer to the dictionary

2161436
children	parent
now i need to find the number of children associated with each parent for a list of parent

2161440
children	parent
another completely different thing to note is that it seems that children come from one parent

2161472
width	height
in css the width of a block element in normal flow is derived solely from the parent minus paddings margins borders and then the height follows on from that seeing how much content you can fit in the block s width and flowing it

2161472
background-color	transparency	background-image	background-color
for documents whose root element is an html html element or an xhtml html element that has computed values of transparency for background-color and none for background-image user agents must instead use the computed value of the background properties from that element s first html body element or xhtml body element child when painting backgrounds for the canvas and must not paint a background for that child element

fadein	fadeout
however i cannot get them to act syncronously the fadein always gets called before the fadeout is complete

2162832
mouse	keyboard
you can check the cpu usage to find out when the computer is idle but it s not necessarily a good idea or you can listen for mouse keyboard activity

2162832
mouse	keyboard
to check for keyboard or mouse activity you ll need to use a keyboard mouse hook

2162854
fadein	fadeout
explicitly calls fadein after fadeout is complete

2162854
fadein	fadeout
you re passing fadein it as a callback to the second parameter to fadeout to be executed on completion

calloc	malloc
you can t have arrays with variable numbers of elements in c so you have to resort to calloc or malloc and do your own memory management like this

2162882
int	chars
if contains something like 0xff and you want to assign the int value corresponding to that to an unsigned chars the easiest way would be probably to use strtoul to first convert it to an unsigned long and then check to see if the converted value is less than or equal to uchar_max

2162896
sorting	grouping
the execution plan shows how which indexes are used which join methods are chosen nested loops or hash join or merge join how the results are grouping using sorting or hashing how they are ordered etc

2162939
sorting	filtering
the execution plan shows you how the database is fetching sorting and filtering the data required for your query

2162939
sorting	filtering
would result in an execution plan showing the database getting records from tablea and tableb matching them to satisfy the join filtering to satisfy the where and sorting to satisfy the order by

2162943
inherited	properties
i just find this freaky weird since i have another list of custom objects which are much more complicated consisting of inherited interfaces and also containing properties which are generic lists of other complex objects and the caching of those lists work without issue

2163027
pop-up	dialog
like we see while browsing www.rediffmail.com is a poor definition so i m going to assume you re talking about regular pop-up windows with title bar etc not a javascript-implemented in-tab dialog and not new pages that open in new tabs

2163071
google-chrome	firefox
assuming the firefox code is running in some window you edit browser.js and the extension function you want to call also exists in that window you overlay google-chrome browser content browser.xul which is the uri of the main firefox window in which the browser.js code runs you can just call it as you would normally do

gif	png
if i convert a gif or a png with transparancy the transparent parts always get blackened

2163148
ready	each
it allows you to develop and test each bugfix feature when you have the budget and schedule to do so and merge them back into trunk when you are ready

2163169
ant	maven
to automate the process of incrementing the version number in android versioncode and committing the androidmanifest.xml there are various options building with maven or ant could be alternatives but let s do it using eclipse and adt

2163206
put	get
has to be put inside the inner selects but whenever i try to do it i get an invalid month error

ostream	istream
the istream and ostream classes are meant to handle conversion between objects in your program and their textual representation

2163358
uilabel	uibutton
i found that uibutton unlike uilabel will trap mouse events - hence giving the correct modal behavior

2163381
client-side	server-side
the cachingallowed attribute actually configures the server-side caching not the client-side caching as you seem to expect

2163382

2163437
google-chrome	firefox
running this page in firefox or google-chrome i see that everything runs smoothly no troubles

2163443
mvp	presenter
am i wrong in my view that a presenter in the mvp design pattern should be lean and not have much logic just like the controller in mvc and that most logic having to do with model updates should live in a application service

2163460
hash	md5
but if you are trying to find all duplicate pairs in n files then a md5 hash is better because you can create and store the md5 hash value once and compare this much smaller value to each pair of files

2163461
post	put
and building on the other post put the path to python in the system path you could have the best of both worlds

2163475
free	malloc
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that

2163475
free	malloc
when programmers make the effort to write and debug programs with dynamic allocation of chained structures in non-gc languages they sometimes find that their programs are no longer faster than in a gc language because malloc and free are not free

2163493
hide	show
the way they have the jquery show hide example on the tinymce site doesn t actually work

2163503
listbox	icollectionview
if you are in fact using a separate listbox control and templatebinding all the itemssource properties if you need them inside your controltemplate then you should be able to simply add a new icollectionview dp i d recommend read-only on your control to hold your filtered version of the collection and bind the template listbox s itemssource to that new property

2163546
google-chrome	safari
same problem on ie google-chrome safari

2163570
awt	swing
i blame awt and swing for why java never caught on for the desktop

2163595
profiling	debugging
if i create a custom executable then i have a few troubles 1 changing the target doesn t change the executable because you can t link a custom executable to a target 2 debugging the command line program is problematic because breakpoints set in xcode don t get registered the chevrons at the line numbers turn orange when debugging the executable so i have to break into the running code and then handle debugging manually from the console 3 most frustratingly if i create a properly provisioned distribution version of my iphone app then transferring the iphone app to the device fails complaining that the provisioning profiling doesn t match the code signing entitlement

2163612
awt	swing
i have been with java since the beginning so from my point of view the fame of being slow was created by non-responsive and slow gui frontends awt and then swing and in applets probably because of the additional slow startup times of the vm s

2163622
mouse	keyboard
do not use getasynckeystate because that api will tell you the current state of the keyboard mouse buttons which may have changed when you handle the lbn_selchange message

2163633
init.d	pid
if the init.d script pid is constant then do strace or truss on that pid to see what it s doing

2163663

for just height width iframe has height width attributes as seen in w3c spec

2163664
width	height
or you could use the width and height attributes

2163678
put	get
the reason i want to get this working is cause i d like to put somthing like it in our themes so we wont have to worry about it later on

2163700

2163856
profiling	debugging
we use firebug for debugging javascript profiling requests throw logs etc

2163900
vb.net	vb6
its possible that this code was written by a vb6 programmer trusting in old paradigms or possibly this was the work of the upgrade tool porting code from vb6 to vb.net

2163914
google-chrome	firefox
note it is no longer possible to set secure cookies over insecure http origins on firefox and google-chrome after they implemented the strict secure cookies specification

google-chrome	firefox
this works and looks lovely in firefox and google-chrome but in all the ies it looks pants as the animation is poor and jagged

2164146
subset-sum	np-complete
this is a version of the subset-sum problem and is np-complete

2164156
width	height
although it has a fixed width users with different accessibility settings such as default font sizes could cause text to wrap and adjust the height of the document

2164156
width	height
although you can overcompensate for point 3 by increasing the height of the iframe to allow for any extra height you can t really deal with point 1 without changing the layout mainly the width of your site

2164226
pull	push
the idea is that for central repositories that you just push and pull from there s no need to have the files

2164229
sin	sqrt
now each row of prisms is displaced from the next by a multiple of sqrt 3 2 because the dimensions of one prism are 1 sqrt 3 because sin 120 2â sqrt 3 2

2164236
fortran	ada
compared to the languages that are normally compiled to pure machine code and have often large teams of people working on nothing but improving their optimizers c c++ fortran ada java does pretty well at a few things but overall tends to be at least somewhat slower

2164267
vim	emacs
i may use it in addition to or alongside vim or emacs but refactoring is now an integral part of my development style and having automated refactoring tools is essential

2164289
notepad++	textpad
previously i used plain editors such as notepad++ and textpad my efficiency coding increased using an ide with code-completion and runtime debugging

2164294
debian	linux
when running the same java process a jar under windows and linux debian the linux proces uses a lot more 12mb vs 36 mb just from starting up

2164299
vim	textmate
i use textmate or vim for small projects while i reserve ides for larger more complex projects or ones with underlying apis i am not familiar with

2164327
gif	png
spreadsheetgear can also render png gif jpg images from cell ranges or charts as demonstrated here

2164331
wordpress	joomla
i use codelobster which is really great and free but it is especially good if you can afford to shell out money and acutally have use for for their various extensions for popular open source applications like wordpress joomla etc

2164366
children	parent
this functionality removes the navigationgrid grid from it s parent s children and adds it to the children of the layoutroot grid

2164366
children	parent
if the user clicks on the pushpin button again the intended functionality is for the grid to be removed from the layoutroot children and to be added back to it s original parent s children with the grid.column grid.rowspan etc

2164366
children	parent
the problem i am running into is when the navigationgrid grid is initially removed from it s parent s children all of the other elements in the grid resize etc

2164366
children	parent
but when the grid is placed back into it s parent s children it s location is not the same as it was originally

2164373
folder	directory
putting the .h files under an include folder and the .c .cpp files under a source directory

2164379

you can think of each as a variable length unsigned integer

2164406
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in ie8 safari and google-chrome but in firefox the same video the one at 0 in the simplexml array is shown for all the videos on the screen

2164458
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
because if you need ejbs specifically you re probably better off going with a full app server jboss glassfish weblogic etc.

2164465
jboss	glassfish
actually why not just replacing your servlet container with a full java ee server if you need ejbs i don t get it something like jboss or glassfish

2164467
public	protected
in particular interfaces members cannot be declared with the modifiers abstract public protected internal private virtual override or static

2164543

if this is to be drawn to the screen you ll need to locate your drawing code within the -drawrect method of a uiview or â drawincontext of a calayer

2164543
uiview	calayer
to update its contents you d need to call -setneedsdisplay on the uiview or calayer

2164573

2164583
vb.net	vb6
it is actually fairly easy to add some plumbing to a vb.net user control to expose it via com as an activex control that can be used by vb6 and other com clients

2164598
hide	fadeout
to fine tune the fadeout timing you can use hide instead

2164599

2164658
post	get
the param method on the cgi object returns a list of all query parameters including get and post parameters

2164690
squash	branch
i m aware that i could just do a squashed commit let s call it squash squash which would contain cdefghi but then it seems like i would have to kill the bug_fixes branch and start a new branch to cleanly continue

2164712
profiling	debugging
you can also get the sql executed by running profiling but usually it s simpler to just run with the same values in debugging mode

2164770
expander	grid
the extender sits inside the first row of the grid and i would i would like the contents of the expander to expand over top of the contents of everything below when it s clicked

2164876
google-chrome	firefox

2164881
profiling	debugging
but these tools will help in debugging and profiling what s going on in the gpu

2164881
ati	nvidia
both ati and nvidia provide public documentation with recommended steps to find and fix specific types of gpu bottlenecks

2164883
google-chrome	safari
if you combine it with the trick for ie you can have one that works on both main browsers i m not sure if it works in safari and i know it doesn t work in google-chrome

2164895
spaces	delimiter
however when i specify delims it treats the spaces as delimiter even though the docs say specifies a delimiter set

2164895
spaces	delimiter
this replaces the default delimiter set of spaces and tab. doesn t seem to be replacing just seems to be adding to

2164895
for-loop	loops
but i have an uknown set of inputs here so i could be getting 12 directories coming in and don t want to have a repeated line for the command execution same line n times in loops body seems to defeat the purpose of a for-loop

2164903
queue	fifo
the normal queue methods won t work for your case because well it s a queue so fifo

2164972
cvs	svn
our team had a cvs repository which we converted to svn via cvs2svn

2165004
stringbuilder	stringwriter
if the files are small to medium sized you could load the contents into a stringbuilder or a stringwriter and store these in a dictionary indexed by file name

2165005
profiling	debugging
4 - tool supports debugging profiling testing etc

2165026
cpu	processors
li if done right it can take the best advantage of the number of processors your cpu has

2165040
stdout	stderr
on stderr showing up before standard output on stdout

2165040
stdout	stderr
remember that stderr may be merged with stdout

2165040
post	get
request_method set to get head or post as appropriate

2165074
width	height
if i output the bitmapdata to a bitmap on the stage i see that bitmap is in fact rotating but now it s exceeding the bounds width and height of the bitmapdata

2165074
width	height
it rotates outside the bounds of the bitmapdata set width and height

2165162
children	parent
for example we can query all parent which have children such that say 2 of 5 possible values of foo are present

2165195
ant	maven
i don t know exactly how your sources are structured under jdeveloper but you best option here to automate the packaging and the deployment of this ear is imo to use ant or maven but if all this is totally new for you i would recommend using ant

2165230
mouse	keyboard
i m working on a c++ directx 2d game and i need keyboard and mouse input

2165230
mouse	keyboard
microsoft recommends that new applications make use of the windows message loop for keyboard and mouse input instead of directinput

2165258
pull	push
for the sake of simplicity and interoperating with a less-capable system svn it is recommended that all git svn users clone fetch and dcommit directly from the svn server and avoid all git clone pull merge push operations between git repositories and branches

2165291
mouse	keyboard
problem is that by default keyboard mouse messages are routed only to the window currently in focus and typically in games you want to be able to switch focus to a hi-score view enemies on radar view or whatever and still maintain interactivity

2165291
mouse	keyboard
the easy solution would be for every module which requires keyboard mouse input to query for it directly and not rely on message forwarding - hence directinput

2165323
agile	greenhopper
greenhopper an add on for agile based on jira

2165334
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox can run those as standalone apps

this means that unless you declare your field as protected or public the .aspx will not have access to your field

2165345
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to to get a subclassing method to return the variable from the superclass however the return value keeps giving me empty returns

2165384
uiview	calayer
as kendall suggests if you just need to move the triangles around draw them once in a uiview or calayer and animate the positions and or rotations of those items

2165401
post	put
i want to perform a file upload function to the web service via http post and put

2165401
post	put
the browser clients will use post to upload a file to the php app and then will post or put the file to the web service

2165415
stdout	stderr
and a suitable error message to stdout at all the points where you re output an error message to stderr and you ll be to see what s going wrong

2165425
fadein	fadeout
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time

2165425
fadein	fadeout
you want the reset form logic to be trigger on the fadein call not the fadeout

2165446
button	checkbox
so if the user checks multiple boxes hits a button i need to send all the checkbox values to a controller s action that will take those id s and process them

2165467
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
but if i read the iboutlet uiimageview.image.size.width or .height in the viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear method i always get 0

2165476
post	get
so it seems like your question is in 2 parts 1 does php get handed off to before a post operation has uploaded all it s data

2165507
vtune	shark
performance tools shark instruments etc - nothing even close on windows apart from maybe intel s vtune which is nowhere near as functional as shark

2165558
post	get
after you get this part fixed post another question about how to make your controller more restful and i or someone else can help you there

2165593
rtp	rtsp
my network camera products support the rtp rtsp streaming

2165593
rtp	rtsp
the service standard rtp rtsp from my network camera is served and it also supports â œrtp rtsp over httpâ

2165593
udp	rtp
rtp start port udp 5000

2165600
post	get
my get requests all worked fine but my post particularly status updates failed

2165630
inherited	properties
it s not the codebehind that s important it s the inherited properties

2165650
pop-up	dialog
first way is obviously the easiest but this doesn t give you a fullworthy pop-up modal dialog

2165673
unix	bsd
osx having a bsd backend gives you access to the usual unix toolset with a terminal for running shell scripts and other nice command line stuff

2165679
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

2165709
int	chars
i have three int 4 bytes of memory for each int and i want to assign each of their binary values to a chars array with 12 elements

2165709
int	chars
so if each int had a value of let s say 2 then i want the chars array to have these values

2165709
int	chars
however it is mentioned as the terminating null chars in destination is overwritten by the first chars of source which i obviously don t want since most of the times int will have a null chars at the end unless the value is really large

2165743
getter	setter
you can use a static class with fields synchronized and getter setter used

2165844
fast-forward	merge
on xentac s suggestion i went back and found on the laptop that i had made a merge that wasn t pushed to the server which was the culprit and once i got all three really in sync git pull --ff forcing only fast-forward merge works just fine and warns me if something is out of sync before doing the merge

2165900
put	get
but i just cannot get this to work with asp.net mvc 2.0 rc - the put and delete verbs do not get used

2165900
post	put
i disabled the default route and now when i try to submit a form with the override set to put the error the http verb post used to access path contacts 2 is not allowed. is coming up

2165905
rss	feed
i m looking for an open source xml parser that is easy to integrate with my nstableview and will handle large amounts of rss feed

2165920
children	parent
parenting in a 2 layer tree via #afd98f for parent and .afd98f for children

2166048
exif	xmp
i would like to know about whatever is in there xmp exif iptc iim etc.

2166121
children	parent
if you apply visible or inherit which the parent of b is visible by default the bounds return and the children divs define the margins

2166131
implements	extends
i am having difficulty determining which base controllers to extends or implements

2166163
hash	md5
to minimize abuse you could obfuscate the javascript and provide the answers to the client in hash form md5 sha1 etc hash the answer the user submits then verify against the hash

2166197
children	parent
when the names are the same and you do a build the generated code on the client uses a different constructor for the entitycollection used by the parent to refer to the children than it does if the associations aren t set up right

2166207
getter	setter
i have a basic shell set up i have coded some domain objects mainly getter and setter for various object attributes which i ultimately want displayed on the page

2166220
rss	feed
if microsoft provided a rss feed people would install way more hotfixes than they should and we don t want people to unintentionally break their own apps and not be able to find out which of the 30 hotfixes they installed is to blame

2166233
int	chars
from what i can recall read literally reads the file as a stream of chars of which a blank space and carriage return are but i believe these should be ignored as you are reading into an int array

2166312
width	height
basically you want to listen for the when the stage is resized then change the width height of your image so that it matches in at least one dimension

2166313
setinterval	settimeout
do not use strings in setinterval or settimeout

2166335
partition-problem	np-complete
i am aware of partition-problem which is np-complete but that deals with unordered sets and not ordered sequences

2166341
mouse	keyboard
since you pretty much have to run a message pump in order to have a window you might as well use that pump to handle keyboard and mouse input as well

2166368
post	put
i found out why - the httpmethodconstraint does not check the x-http-method-override field and so for example in that article the httpmethodconstraint was set to only allow put but of couurse post was being returned by httpcontext so it failed

2166394
google-chrome	firefox
the focus function worked exactly as expected without any timeout in both firefox and google-chrome of course

2166398
trie	tree
you can google for keywords hashtable binary tree trie

2166409
for-loop	loops
i d use a for-loop just to keep everything out in the open your original loops seems to only print up to 12

2166432
docx	xlsx
a zippackage isn t a regular zip file but a file meant to be used by new office xml-based file format docx xlsx etc

2166443
getter	setter
typically properties need a backing field unless they are simple getter setter automatic properties

2166443
public	protected
i usually do a field then if i need it to be protected or public i will change it to an automatic property

2166448
public	protected
personally i would never expose any protected public instance fields

2166449
getter	setter
avoiding overuse of property getter and setter

2166449
getter	setter
most people don t realize that property getter and setter are similar to methods when it comes to overhead

2166449
getter	setter
a non-virtual property getter or setter that contains no instructions other than the field access will be inlined by the compiler but in many other cases this isn t possible

2166461
pull	push
but you always can use heroku console and do rails stuff there which is a good alternative especially on production when you can t put everything on hold until you pull and push back

2166472
width	height
this means nothing inside of rectangle can alter the width or height after construction

2166500
implements	extends
i ve had some luck extends jlabel and implements icon to get a translucent component working the way i want

2166543
post	get
of course i get a list of all my post titles followed by all my post contents

2166573
listview	gridview
for my own winforms apps i actually have an extender provider that lets me attach this behaviour to a gridview or listview by tossing in a list of column name link text pairs but that code is just a wee bit too long to post here

2166590
post	get
also i was wondering if there would be any way to pause the jms queue processing via an app server admin tool or to easily see what s in the queue i would be enqueuing an object which would be the message xml plus some other data including timestamp received etc. i ve read a few post on here that deal with related issues but wanted to get some direct feedback

2166602
firefox	safari
supports at least firefox ie safari potentially targeting iphones ...

2166646
urllib	httplib
you can make an http get request in python with such standard library modules as urllib and urllib2 though the lower-level httplib module is also fine

2166647
websphere	ibm
message brokers range from free open-source like activemq at or openmq at to large-scale commercial solutions ibm s websphere mq at is one of the largest

2166673
boost	stl
there are very good reasons why there is absolutely no object-orientation in the c++ stl and most of boost for that matter

2166694
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have a script that works fine in all browsers that i have tested so far firefox safari camino google-chrome but not in ie and i can t figure out why

2166713
children	parent
1 modifying accessing children does not modify access a parent

2166718
uiview	subviews
then some uiview game pieces are added as subviews of the gameboard uiview and everything is displayed as i think it should be

2166718
uiview	subviews
when some of those uiview subviews are tapped a menu should appear

2166718
uiview	subviews
iphone - after dismissing modal view controller - gap is left at top of page - but the given solution was don t have another view controller loaded as a subviews of the view controller that displays the modal - but i don t only uiview

2166748
post	get
if you want to make a property read only as far as functionality is concerned you do so by only supplying the get method as you indicated in your post

2166778
implements	modifiers
eric gunnerson expresses it as every feature starts with minus 100 points . to implements read-only automatic properties would have required additional compiler effort to support the readonly modifiers on a property it currently applies only to fields to generate the appropriate backing field and to transform sets of the property to assignments to the backing field

2166800
getter	setter
i think fundamentally the problem is that properties are merely syntactic sugar for a field with optional getter setter methods

2166800
getter	setter
for traditional properties you can put arbitrary code in both the getter and the setter

2166800
getter	setter
even if the setter were able to be invoked only in the constructor of the class the getter could still mutate the value based on whatever logic you decided to put in it

2166801
post	get
screenshots below are made using firebug firebug logs the post or get request the response headers

2166810
onfocus	onblur
add onfocus and onblur event to the input field and set a global variable value

rss	feed
the feed format needs to be either an atom or rss variant

2166877

when no children are left simply walk up the path in a while loop using the parent reference

2166882
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this would also work on recent versions of firefox safari google-chrome opera

2166937
post	get	rss	feed
once you get past all the cartoon post you can see some topics that might be interesting to you such as code smells you need to know them to avoid them rss feed for programmers pieces of advice from programmers and so on

2166940
cpu	processors
if you have only 2 cores cpu processors hyperthreads you know what i mean then openmp cannot give such a tremendous increase in performance but will help

2167003
subclass	abstract-class
if your method in the subclass is merely an implementation of an abstract method then i think it would be correct to leave the abstract-class name in there

2167005
disk	ram
a well set-up rdbms server will perform the majority of it s queries on hot-pages in ram with little physical disk or network i o

2167035
post	get
then when you get down to the post you could click to load the previous page or the next page and it would roll out like a scroll

2167045
width	height
you say that the bounds of the bitmapdata are causing the clipping but you are setting the bounds to be the width and height of the object

2167045
width	height
this suggests that the width and height returned are actually incorrect not taking into account the rotation

2167045
width	height
perhaps try using getbounds to find the actual width and height of itest

2167046
printf	strncpy
i believe your strncpy isn t putting a terminating null character at the end of the string so printf is running off the end of the allocated memory

2167053
strlen	strncpy
you need to give strncpy room for the terminating null so it should be strlen input +1

2167053
strcpy	strncpy
what strncpy was designed to do was copy a string into an output buffer and then fill the rest of the buffer with zeros . it s not really designed as a safe strcpy

2167064
int	chars
neither int s nor chars s are automatically initialized to 0

2167121
width	height
the only thing that seemed to fix this was setting width and height on each picture on the page rather than in css

2167140
hid	keyboard
as far as communicating with the card reader generally you interface with a card reader over usb and the card reader can be placed into keyboard wedge mode or hid mode

2167152

2167243
integer	unsigned
yes you can pass it in as an integer or unsigned integer type

2167278
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you should be using the scriptmanager to emit your javascript where there is an updatepanel involved like so

2167305
firefox	safari
it s almost right in safari but not at all right in firefox not bothering with ie testing as the app uses html5 localstorage which ie doesn t support

2167340
getter	setter
so far i ve come up with two methods in the class below i ve removed setter and getter that are superfluous to this question

2167362

using aspose.words for .net developers can easily open and save doc ooxml rtf wordprocessingml html mhtml txt and opendocument documents

2167498
post	get
the best way imho is to use the post redirect get pattern

2167498
post	get
when using the pattern the post to the original page will not end up in the browser history and refreshing the result page will cause the final get to be repeated which should be safe

2167507
post	get
usually when you refresh a page you think of geting the page again or doing an http get but since the last thing you did was a post when you clicked the submit button the browser will perform the post again to attempt to invoke the same response

2167507
post	get
i suggest using the post redirect get pattern as suggested by jorn schou-rode

2167517
switching	screens
i noticed that when i swipe my finger from left to right across a home screens widget in simulator on a avd android switching to the left home screens

hide	show
when user put the mouse over an image show this image description and date taken below it and pause the slide show if it is running and when the moves the mouse away hide the description and date and resume the slide show

2167625
hide	show
the only problem now is getting the window show and hide properly

2167676
hide	show
but make sure that you show hide the form from the same thread that created them

2167746
serializable	deserialization
therefore the netdatacontractserializer can used in serializable and deserialization with any clr types without any knowntypes stuff

2167752
cpu	processors
instruction availability depends on the cpu mode which is different in user processes than it is while the kernel is doing something so it may be that some instructions whether on the coprocesor or the main processors are only allowed in kernel mode

2167800
vbscript	vb6
i don t have vb6 installed anymore but i tried this vbscript code

2167871
clang	llvm
you can use clang the llvm c c++ compiler front-end to parse code in a way that preserves information on typedefs and even macros

2167880
int	boolean
it sounds like you want some combination of the pack setsize int int setextendedstate int and or setresizable boolean methods prior to calling setvisible true

2167880
invokelater	invokeandwait
if you need to modify swing controls after you ve kicked off your application you ll need to do it via the event dispatch thread see the invokelater and invokeandwait methods in swingutilities among others

2167883

2168045
postgresql	mysql
they want to develop a huge professional database with many complex joins so after consideration i have chosen to go with postgresql over mysql

2168065
post	get
i d give you some example text here but the -- characters get erroneously interpreted by this web post as control characters and what you would see is not correct

on my machine i simply select the project click on the debug top menu then debug project select a server glassfish weblogic tomcat if required and things just work i can place a breakpoint in a servlet and the execution stops there

2168377
ostringstream	std
use std ostringstream in c++ if you want to do the similar thing

2168393
post	put
you can put this in an aspx page but adding an httphandler is probably better as described on the same blog different post creating a httphandler for a sitemap

2168423
hash	md5
then you would replace the checksum with 0 before re-serializing the document and calculating it s md5 hash

2168423
hash	md5
with any luck it should be quite easy to write a regular expression to locate the md5 hash in the file and replace it with 0

2168423
hash	md5
which i ve called hash.xml that the md5 should be replaced by 32 zeros so the hash is correct and illustrate the procedure on a shell command line using perl md5 and bash

2168436
post	get
i have a script that gets information from a form and the server uses post and not get

2168445

2168539
free	malloc
a part that intercepts the calls to malloc free c and new delete c++

2168539
free	malloc
this is quite easy for new delete just global new and delete operators but also for malloc free this is possible overwrite the functions of the crt redefine calls to malloc free ...

2168550

width	height
if not how can i resize it to make sure the client rectangle is a specific width height

2168706
post	get
i would suggest to keep it simple by just using one object for get and post

2168706
post	get
use typed model viewmodel objects for get post and if you need more complex binding create a custom binder

2168717
spaces	linefeed
it sounds like you are reading all of the unparsed data into a big buffer and now you want to write code that makes the big buffer of unparsed data look like a slightly smaller buffer of parsed data the data minus the checksums and linefeed to avoid the spaces overhead involved in copying it into the slightly smaller buffer

i haven t read the spec but i think you don t need to convert back and forth between hex and binary so this might be a little more efficient

2169075
getter	setter
which offers you a variety of getter and setter

2169110

having strings that are insensitive to case punctuation and spacing and that work over words instead of characters was too expensive into the computationally expensive algorithms already expressed in the code below

2169177
getter	setter
they compile down to getter and setter methods in the il and it s possible that some .net languages might not even recognize them as properties - property resolution is done entirely by convention there aren t really any rules in the il spec

if you don t you probably need to pre-process - you could do and replace all characters with spaces and use spaces as the delimiter

2169470
folder	directory
if you look at the directory structure inside of an application you ll see that bundles are little more than an xml info.plist property list + some folder

superclass	subclassing
i was hoping to declare in enum type in a subclassing and then access it from the superclass

2169512
post	get
if you re hoping to get help diagnosing the bugs in your code you d better post that buggy code rather than generic descriptions that just don t give enough info to understand your bugs

width	height
i am not a visual studio programmer but i need to whip up a quick app to display an image and manipulate it s height and width using a slider

2169536
qcheckbox	qsignalmapper
if so use a qsignalmapper to map the textchanged signals to send a value of true and connect that to the qcheckbox setchecked bool slot

2169536
qcheckbox	qtextedit
if this is not what you are looking for at least subclass qtexteditto take in a qcheckbox that it can change when the text changes instead of duplicating code for every qtextedit

2169547
width	height
any size checkerboard you want just pass in width and height as w h

2169547

if for some reason you don t want to share your worker threads with other code in your process then you can create a fifo queue create as many threads as you want to run simultaneously and have each of them pull work items out of the queue

2170216
post	get
to do this we just use standard rest just get post calls via httprequest on the flex side

2170258
mouse	keyboard
intercept the preview version of keyboard and mouse events at your window level or whatever scope you want to prevent focus changes within eg maybe not your menu bar

2170258
keydown	mousedown
when the tab keydown or return keydown is detected in the text box or when a mousedown is detected outside the text box while it has the focus call updatesource on the binding expression then if the validation has failed set handled true to prevent the keydown or mousedown event from being processed further

2170258
mouse	keyboard
also continue handling previewlostkeyboardfocus to catch any causes of focus change that aren t from the keyboard or mouse or that your other code didn t recognize

2170272
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
addition and subtraction as well as multiplication will be easily implemented according to the definition

2170288
width	height
to work around this you could figure out an integral version of your position by taking the desired center position of the view subtracting half of the view s width rounding that value then adding half of the view s width and repeating for the height

2170307
profiler	yourkit
definitely use a profiler on the app yourkit is great ...it s easy to waste a lot of time guessing at the problem when most of the time you ll be able to narrow it down really quickly in the profiler

2170319
spaces	delimiter
the source string will always have only a single spaces as the delimiter

lseek	posix
i suspect that the problem is that you need to do the equivalent of a posix lseek call to set the stream position to zero each time you draw a frame

2170384
free	malloc
no need for a separate malloc for each token unless for some reason you need to free them individually

2170392
getter	setter
when populating a job object you will of course need to cast the ints coming out of the database to kind and priority or you stick with an int backing field and do the casting in the getter and setter

2170393
firefox	safari
the code displays properly in firefox and safari

2170438
realloc	strncpy
the only string function that i used was strncpy ..sure it is a bit long-winded but it does reallocate the array of strings dynamically instead of using a hard-coded max_args which means that the double pointer is already hogging up memory when only 3 or 4 would do also which would make the memory usage efficient and tiny by using realloc the simple parsing is covered by employing isspace as it iterates using the pointer

2170438
realloc	malloc
when a space is encountered it realloc ates the double pointer and malloc the offset to hold the string

2170438
realloc	malloc
in fact i thought this would serve an excellent example of a simple c program pointers realloc malloc passing-by-reference basic element of parsing a string.

2170478
ppl	tbb

noscript	meta
the most useful place to use the noscript element is in the head of the page where it would be able to selectively determine what stylesheet and meta elements get applied to the page as the page is loading rather than having to wait until the page is loaded

2170511
subclass	abstract-class
all the classes including the abstract-class can have constructors.abstract class constructors will be called when its concrete subclass will be instantiated

2170515
subclass	abstract-class
imagine that your abstract-class has fields x and y and that you always want them to be initialized in a certain way no matter what actual concrete subclass is eventually created

2171062
post	get
that includes posting form data in http post requests or querying via get then getting back either json or plists which turn into dictionaries json is more widely understood by server developers but you have to be more careful to correctly define the structures being passed since you can do things like have a dictionary with the same key repeated.

2171111
serializable	deserialization
technically yes providing you have the proper serializable deserialization on each end

2171124
imap	nntp

mergesort	in-place
two in-place variants of the classical mergesort algorithm are analysed in detail

2171525
heapsort	in-place	mergesort	heapsort	mergesort	in-place
in practice due to the overhead in the index manipulation our fastest in-place mergesort behaves still about 50 per cent slower than the bottom-up heapsort

2171525
mergesort	in-place
however our implementations are practical compared to mergesort algorithms based on in-place merging

2171525

prng	random
the prng is also used for the build-in random and randomblob sql functions

2171622
put	get	post	put	post	get
in the case of httpservlet the point is that servlet programmers typically don t want their servlet to support all 4 oft the main http methods post get put delete so it would be annoying to make the doget dopost etc

2171644

2171772
gridview	repeater
i know gridview control comes with lot of built in functionality which we can achieve from repeater

2171772
gridview	repeater
you will be thinking why this question if you can achieve the functionality and performance using repeater use it but i want to understand why and when we should use repeater and gridview

2171783
ant	maven
for the build we have the maven and ant

2171783
ant	myeclipse
i know that myeclipse is bundled with loads of plugins to support the jsf spring hiberate ant etc

2171794
gridview	repeater
like you said the repeater can perform certain aspects of the gridview

2171798
gridview	repeater
i prefer using a repeater almost every time but i can see the usefulness of the gridview

2171830
put	get
if i don t put the cast it says that it cannot bind an object to a jpanel when i do system.out.print me.getsource it prints a line saying that it s a jpanel so i don t get what the problem is

2172000
mp3	wav
i am using python bindings for gstreamer and am using the following pipeline to convert a wav file to mp3

2172024
glut	sdl
glut is implemented on top of cocoa and so on the mac inherits that restriction- and so does any other framework you might choose to wrap on top of that qt sdl glut etc

2172081
dylan	smalltalk	ada	pascal
although design patterns describe object-oriented designs they are based on practical solutions that have been implemented in mainstream object-oriented programming languages like smalltalk and c++ rather than procedural languages pascal c ada or more dynamic object-oriented languages clos dylan self

2172100
hide	show
you can use jquery to show hide divs

2172126
unsigned	short

2172161
cells	tablecell
tablecell cells row.owntablecells i

2172190

i think your problem is with the width and height properties in your iframe

2172190
width	height
when in html don t add the px to width and height values only add those when in css

2172205
button	checkbox
use radio button over checkbox and dropdown selections where possible

2172205
button	checkbox
use radio button to flatten combinations instead of checkbox a and b that can t be on at once offer a b none radio button

2172211
setinterval	settimeout
i prefer re-scheduling on each iteration via settimeout as above to using setinterval but it s totally your call

2172224
queue	fifo
use collections.deque instead of list it s faster for fifo queue

2172283
getter	setter	children	parent
in general if you are attempting to give access to a parent class the correct and future proof way to do this is to create abstract methods that are getter or setter or even more complex if necessary and then have the children honor those or not and respond as appropriate

2172326
loops	while-loop
when you have an infinite while-loop then check your loops for this pattern

2172389
firefox	safari
only safari seems affected but i m suspecting firefox just masks the problem due to more tolerant parsing

2172395
stdout	stderr
some applications write to dev console instead of dev stdout or dev stderr

2172399
google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfectly fine in google-chrome but in internet explorer and firefox it just redirects to a page with the text block

if you need to show an element when javascript is enabled you can first hide the element with css and enable it with javascript jquery

2172422
min	max
you can tweak the cardinality the min and max possible values in your ef model

2172461
operands	scalar
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

2172463
hide	show
and apart from some crazy redirect scenario your best bet may be to use css + js to show hide what you need

2172463
hide	show
what i normally do and your mileage may vary depending on what you need to show hide is this

2172463
hide	show
then you can use css to hide show based on if javascript is enabled disabled

2172492
xslt	xquery
altova offers its xslt and xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 processor as a download for windows see

2172507
getdate	dateadd

2172508
hide	show
you don t need to -- just send frame show #f to hide it

2172511
getdate	dateadd
lose the quotes around dateadd d -500 getdate

2172525
gtk	cairo
i think i must be missing some basic gtk cairo concept because it seems to be running too slowly stutteringly for what i am doing

2172552
codeigniter	cakephp
none in particular are better to look at but try cakephp symfony codeigniter or agavi

2172555
getter	setter
views cause the model to degrade into a heap of getter and setter with few if any meaningful operations defined on them

2172569
ubuntu	mint
did a new install of postgres 8.4 on mint ubuntu

2172574
int	double
however the swing jslider only works with int values whereas i need something that can support double for 1 decimal point

2172583
wtl	atl
note i use the following in code that covers - and sometimes mixes - raw win32 atl wtl and mfc so don t take it literally only the principle

2172583
button	checkbox
the standard control type already contains very obvious information about functionaltiy of a control - a checkbox to enable disable a group of features or for a boolean option an edit or drop down to enter select a value a button to open a sub dialog a static control for the label etc

2172650
google-chrome	safari
an example is the html5 version of youtube recently introduced as beta for safari google-chrome users see here

2172651
google-chrome	firefox
latest version of safary and google-chrome firefox 3.6 too can play tag in a html5 page directly

2172660
post	get
for what i understand of this- security- allowedcontrollers and this- security- allowedactions i should be able to get post data only from the action view of the controller users

2172682
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera 10 opera 9

2172690
geany	notepad++
i would recoment geany for serious programming editor because it have a lot of neat feature almost same with notepad++ in windows

2172693
post	get
it s possible to get what you want scottgu made an excellent blog post describing how

2172699
vsto	add-in
i ve written this little ms outlook 2003 vsto add-in using c# and visual studio 2008

2172711
postgresql	mysql
pdo has drivers for sqlite mysql postgresql firebird db2 microsoft s sql server oracle odbc devices and probably some more that i m forgetting about

2172718
for-loop	arrays
i tried using a for-loop so it d be a bit neater and out of curiosity to see if it could be done but it doesn t compile when i do it this way because it doesn t recognize an item in an arrays as a method i think

2172729
clutter	cairo
i d probably try the cairo mailing list or look at clutter or pygame for drawing a large number of items on the screen

2172748
factors	mean
by significant i mean factors of 10

2172777
firefox	safari
firefox and safari are already supporting the feature

2172792
hide	show
i then use jquery to go to next or previous step - in other words hide or show a specific div

2172853
cassini	iis
since you did not specify either home or professional if you are they do not have iis installed nor does it come with xp home you could try cassini web server which can be found here

2172856
persian	farsi
in typical persian fonts which are true type there is a historical problem with yeh and kafs since these fonts are created for windows 98 which didn t include full persian support and now we have 2 kind of kafs keheh 0x6a9 ú and arabic kaf 0x643 ùƒ and 2 kind of yehs farsi yeh 0x6cc ûœ and arabic yeh 0x64a ùš

2172867
lua	scheme
the perl version is quite popular in dynamic languages icon lua scheme

2172876
vb6	vba
i have no personal experience doing this although i have used vba vb6 and have written vb6 dlls that are add-ins for other 3rd party software although not office

2172876
vb6	vba
the easiest way would be to convert your vba code to a vb6 com add-in

2172876
vb6	vba
then you shouldn t have to change the guts of your code since vba is 99 identical to vb6 and you can code against the same office object model

2172876
vsto	add-in
alternatively you could migrate your vba to vb.net as a vsto add-in

2172876
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is fully supported whereas only the vb6 runtime is now supported

2172936
postgresql	mysql
the dblinq project supports all of linq to sql s features over mysql postgresql oracle and sqlite as well as some unique features

2172948
int	chars
in c the type of a chars constant like a is actually an int with size of 4 or some other implementation-dependent value

2172967
post	put
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested

2173016
width	height
if i create a rectangle with 100px width and 100px height and then rotate it the size of the element s box will have increased

2173037
textview	imageview
here is the contents of my personal view to display my main application just to demonstrate how i can switch view s your view would be different including a textview and an imageview

2173038
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s supported by google-chrome and firefox on the pc and safari on mac os and iphone to the best of my knowledge

2173061
folder	directory
to be prepared if anything comes up here you should stop your mysql server and make a copy of the physical directory containing the database so nothing can get overwritten further a simple copy+paste of the data folder to a different location should do

2173063
min	max
and the min max values calculated using the axes

2173084
width	height
bezier - draw based on top left containing rect and width height

2173084
width	height
bezier with center - draw based on center and width height

2173084
width	height
if you want a symmetrical oval you could always create a circle of radius width and then scale it to the height you want edit notice this will affect stroke width appearance - see acdameli s answer but if you want full control of the ellipse here s one way using bezier curves

2173153
put	get
at the time the application read the socket data or when the underlying layers get the data and put it in the buffer

2173159
kde	gnome
now lets suppose that 50 of all desktop environments are kde the other half is gnome

2173209
free	malloc
if size is 0 then malloc returns either null or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free

2173218
width	height
so x1 x2 middle_xâ â width 2 and y1 y2 middle_y â height 2

2173242
free	realloc
if realloc ever has to move the data in order to resize it it calls free internally you do not need to worry about that

2173242
realloc	malloc
realloc will work just like malloc the first time

2173255
northwind	adventureworks
if you are simply experimenting trying to understand performance differences between different types of queries in an abstract sense then i would have to say that you ll be better off just grabbing a copy of the northwind or adventureworks database and banging around on that one - it s already normalized and indexed and you ll be able to glean meaningful information about query performance in an actual production database

2173257
hide	show
just hide the divs you want to show using css s display none

2173263
chunked	transfer-encoding
that transfer-encoding chunked seems like a clue

2173280
free	malloc
all of the above point out the obvious thing for every malloc there is a free if not you have a memory leak so it is imperative that you free the memory when you are finished with your pointer variable that is malloc d

2173282
post	get
did you set the curlopt for a post request the default is get

2173321
put	get
if you want the descriptor property to trigger when you get an attribute from object x then you must put the descriptor in type x

2173356
vim	emacs
i ve been using emacs for few weeks and it s been great so far - coming from vim was easier than i expected actually - emacs keyboard shortcuts feel more.

2173372
int	chars
an int or a chars

2173414
for-loop	arrays
i aim to beat the speeds of sequenceequal or a hand-coded for-loop over every item by avoiding the repetitive bound checks for both arrays

2173420
typedef	struct
sockaddr is a struct not just a typedef for a character array

2173420
nsstring	nsdata
also you don t need an nsdata at all to go from a character array to an nsstring

2173460
realloc	malloc
the reason you should use the second one is because with realloc failure is bad but is quite recoverable in many situations unlike malloc where failure usually means stop everything and die.

2173460
realloc	malloc
this is a more contentious issue but it is questionable whether or not you should cast the return value of malloc and realloc like you do

2173467
asterisk	pbx
i m looking for ways to use this methodology in configuration of an existing system in this case the asterisk soft pbx

2173509
vim	emacs
just use viper-mode vimpulse or vim mode emacs keybindings are just not as ergonomic

2173521
stdout	stderr
just for debugging purposes redirect stderr to stdout and use passthru to display the complete output possibly including error messages

2173524
cos	sin
w r abs sin r h + abs cos r w

2173524
cos	sin
h r abs sin r w + abs cos r h

2173524
cos	sin
let c represent abs cos r and s represent abs sin r

2173541
post	get
move up the parse tree until i get to the tag that encloses all the content div class post in my case

2173564
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox

2173574
profiler	yourkit
i would also recommend using the profiler to determine the cause yourkit profiler is a pretty decent one

2173576
pthreads	epoll
if you want to integrate pthreads aio with epoll then you need to translate the signal into an event on a dummy fd a pipe maybe and listen for it with epoll while catching the signal either in a classic manner or with ppoll select

2173586
vim	kate
for example under linux i would use kate or vim so something similar is preferred

2173590
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tried the following sscce and it works flawlessly in ie firefox safari opera and google-chrome all of the most recent versions

2173595
accessor	properties
one advantage to using properties syntehsize is that it pushes you to use accessor methods for the ivars

2173599
innodb	myisam
in mysql autocommit is on by default for innodb - myisam doesn t support transactions

2173608
notepad++	textpad
for windows i use notepad++ or textpad

2173609
getter	setter
property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

2173609
getter	setter
obviously you have to be getting and setting something so we create the ivar that goes along with the getter and setter

2173609
getter	setter
the getter returns the value in the receiveddata instance variable and the setter changes the value in the receiveddata instance variable

2173609
public	protected
inside your own class you have direct access to all your own instance variables and any protected and public ivars of your super classes

2173612
getter	setter
this happens because the compiler automatically synthesizes the setter and getter and then calls them for accesses through the dot operator

2173612
getter	setter
one final note is that these setter and getter are automatically protected by a synchronize block that ensures that the operations happen atomically and that a second thread couldn t disrupt the activity midway through

2173615
division	modulo
we have to translate the offset by which the tile extends beyond the screen not the total cameraposx offset so we re using the modulo instead of division

2173619
imperative	declarative
imperative run-time code trumps declarative settings

2173642
post	get
if when you get stuck come back to stackoverflow and post a question stating exactly how far you ve gotten and what you don t understand

2173661
stdout	stderr
this will redirect file descriptor #2 stderr into file descriptor #1 stdout which you ve already directed to the named file

2173661
stdout	stderr
which should direct both stdout and stderr

2173673
put	get
in onrestoreinstancestate for your activity get the hour out of the bundle and put it in the timepicker

2173677
gmail	hotmail
the email has a background image that is not showing when i test it with gmail hotmail or yahoo mail

2173706
post	get
your script sends no data trough the post method and ad the target file is something with get data php just sees it as date passed trough the url

2173721
put	get	post	put	post	get
in a perfect world client browsers would all support get post put and delete for request operations

2173721
put	get	post	put	post	get
however only get and post are supported which means we re stuck trying to identify operations that should be put and delete by using common action verbs in the url like view create edit and delete

2173727
put	get
that because you put the parameter in the url which is kind of a get way

2173727
post	put
to use post parameter you must put it in the data area

2173733
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in safari firefox and google-chrome

2173735
hide	show
i have a link and would like to show hide one form

2173804
unsigned	short
total_length is a unsigned short

2173831
versioning	upgrade
i m guessing the problem does not occur in later versioning but an upgrade is not an option at the moment

2173853
apache	nginx
assuming your http server is nginx or apache install phusion passenger

2173853
apache	nginx
on the passenger site there are very good docs for configuring apache nginx with rails

2173860
opera	firefox
this seems to be a phenomenon happening with firefox and opera

2173865
viewdidload	viewdidappear
this works with viewdidappear not viewdidload

2173869
profiling	benchmarking
iow in the end if you truly care about performance you must carefully benchmarking and separately profiling your actual program s not just toy micro-benchmarks in the general case

2173919
post	get
i started out in php so i really have no experience using them i have read many articles and post on here about namespace in php and i get thebasic idea of how to use it but it is still something that will probably take me a while for it to really sink in

2173964
int	chars
the sort order you describe suggests the int values are actually being stored as a chars type or maybe converted to chars before sorting

2173966
onclick	onsubmit
you can convert the existing form but it is not as simple as just changing the onsubmit or onclick events

2173982
google-chrome	firefox
this is quite easy to do in firefox and google-chrome and would give you a good temporary option for users of those browsers

2173986
subtract	add
saving dates as strings could open a world of trouble when you maybe parse them from xml where the gmt is specified separately or try to add and subtract nstimeintervals

2173994
firefox	safari
it works well in firefox and safari but not ie8

2173997
pop-up	dialog
i have disabled the exception assistant in the vs options but a different unhandled exception dialog pop-up instead

2174000
for-loop	arrays
vectorising in cython shaves about 25 off the for-loop on my computer however more than half the time is spent building the python string the return statement - i don t think the extra copy can be avoided legally as the arrays may contain null bytes

sorting	filtering
but there are considerable limitations to this when it comes to sorting in order to get bigtable to accept a filtering like you have to order the list by geohash as well which makes it impossible to sort it by other criteria especially if you want to use pagination

2174304
width	height
however i am hearing that it is better for the user if i instead refer to the original image and resize it with the browser by changing the height and width in the image tag

2174312
width	height
it s fine to resize images with css or the height and width tags

this makes your script non-interactive which means it can be run in the background and from cron jobs and such

2175477
pop-up	dialog
i believe that this is preferred over having a dialog pop-up since after all that is what edit-in-place is all about

2175507
int	chars
with this way you will store ips in int type field that is smaller in space than chars type

2175521
pop-up	dialog
unless you library is some kind of gui library don t use pop-up dialog

2175542
pop-up	dialog

post	get
for report generation the securitytoken is submitted as post for report download the same token needs to be submitted by the user browser this time using get

2176023
post	get
then i tried url encoding but this fails because for http post stuff such as 3d are transmitted without translation but when browser does http get with the data 3d is converted to

2176023
post	get
what encoding would you recommend to allow safe transmission over http post get without data being misinterpreted

2176043

2176094
inherited	properties
if you re struggling with inherited properties then maybe you need to look at the design of your site

2176113
width	height
also deciding weather you stretch the left and right rectangles the full height or the top and bottom rectangles the full width is arbitrary and will either need to be a constant decision or a parameter to the method

2176113
min	max
other cases where the rectangles only partially overlap will require more logic looking at the max min of values to check for going out of bounds etc

2176116
rss	feed
i m making a rss feed

2176116
rss	feed
note that the description text comes from an untrusted source so they should never be able to break out of the description tag or making the rss feed invalid

2176129
width	height
this is .net i m not sure about the language of your code but i think most of the structures look simular in different languages in .net the constructor of a system.drawing.rectangle is x y width height

2176171
maven	pom.xml
i don t have made any maven changes and the pom.xml was also not changed

2176172
apache	nginx
nginx listening on 127.0.0.1 8003 is running beyond apache listening

2176172
apache	nginx
the problem might as well lie in the apache and or nginx config as well

2176188
cell-array	textscan
after that you can do some line-by-line processing -- using textscan again on the text content of each line for example is a nice quick way to get a cell-array that will allow fast analysis of each line

2176205
openfire	ejabberd
there are two servers that are pretty stable and feature rich ejabberd implemented in erlang and openfire implemented in java

2176210
rss	feed
i think you should take at their rss feed

rss	feed
check out this question on how to do that best way to parse rss atom feed with php

2176220
memcached	apc
user logs in with email password i then set a few things into session userid photourl username latitude longitude gender these are the basic items that will be saved into session and possibly apc memcached when a user is logged in

an rss feed a a special type of xml document

2176293
rss	feed
but anyway here s the regex you might want to use in case you find yourself doing something like this and can t rely on rss feed etc

ienumerable	icollection
your easiest option would be to expose your list as one of the following ienumerable icollection readonlycollection via a public property

2176360
width	height
embed src url of your comic width 300 height 250

2176361
onfocus	onblur
if you are content with requiring your keyboard users to have javascript activated i know not perfect you could give each link an outlined class onfocus and remove it onblur

2176409
innodb	myisam
the former is generally faster in innodb the latter in myisam

2176426
width	height
if the resizing occurs by resizing the form the height and the width of the panel won t change to the new values

this tabcontrol g has tabpages and in this pages is the described user-controls h placed

2176428
int	boolean
they are things that you can pass around to functions return from functions just like boolean int or strings

2176431
inline	inlining
you ll only see bloat from calls that have actually been inline and the compiler will only inline them if its heuristics indicate that it inlining will improve performance

2176499
min	max
depends on what you want to do when validation fails min max you can use bindingcomplete or parse events from binding

2176502
addclass	removeclass
you ll want to use the addclass and removeclass methods mentioned there not the default jquery ones

2176521
many-to-many	one-to-many
it is simply bad design to use many-to-many when you mean one-to-many and it will most certainly give you trouble later on

2176550
post	get
i read that get request can be bookmarked and post request can not be bookmarked

2176581
post	get
attempting to bookmark a post will just result in a get operation on the url

2176589
hash	salt
there are ways around this using a cached javascript client side to generate hash against a fixed salt of a challenge generated with each page but they are messy

2176600
postgresql	mysql
another benefit of this is that you do not have to rewrite your queries if you switch to a different database such as from mysql to postgresql

2176673
punctuation	words
the example uses standardanalyzer which removes punctuation and breaks words according to white space and some other more elaborate rules

2176683
width	height
then set the left top width and height of the window from bounds

2176706
comparator	comparable
since item is itself comparable you don t need an external comparator unless you want one

2176749
google-chrome	firefox
unlike firefox google-chrome provides no helpful bonus properties on the event object

2176807
post	get
well except if magic_quotes_gpc is turned on in which case you do either need to stripslashes everything that comes in from get post cookie or my favoured option just immediately fail

2176823
rss	feed
in fact every service extends a baseservice object with methods like throw which allow me to log my business layer errors to an rss feed

2176861
google-chrome	safari
ideally the solution should work across all modern browsers msie gecko google-chrome and safari

2176923
post	get
i have a form and the method is set to post on the action page when i use i dont get the value but if i use or i do

2176924
post	get
thus it should not be a get request instead it should be a post request

2176941
post	get
in php ini file the default setting gpc get post cookie and request array has that in itself

2176954
ienumerable	icollection
icollection the non-generic version only got ienumerable + count

2176955
int	double
you define an iterator on a list of int and use it to iterate on a list of double

2176973
post	get
post and get are different methods to transfer form data they both use different ways to send the entered values to your application and have to be handled differently

2176973
post	get
php uses _post for the values submitted by a form with method post and _get for values submitted by a form without a method or with method get

2176975
nunit	moq
i m using moq nunit as a unit test framework

2176990

2177059
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when you need to support older browsers what you can do is quite involved and a bit of a hack that will work in firefox 2+ ie 5.5+ and webkit browsers such as safari or google-chrome

2177073
many-to-many	one-to-many
you should not be mapping a one-to-many relation as a many-to-many relation then forcing it to be a one-to-many

2177082
equals	gethashcode
i ve overwritten the equals gethashcode methods to keep trace of the 3 objects in the composite key but what i ve discovered is that when it s creating the table in the database only the two did rid are part of the primary key and not the language

2177138
profiler	yourkit

2177149
width	height
the reason for this in a nutshell is that flash s rendering internals are heavily optimized and among other things width and height are not stored internally as floats

2177149
width	height
as for what math occurs when you then read the object s width height it s difficult to say

2177167
nexus	artifactory
you could use nexus or artifactory

2177223
post	get
i believe http get and post are disabled by default

2177223
post	get
info http get and http post are disabled by default

2177226
post	get
of course that s probably not the only way you could do it and it is somewhat a compromise now querying for a single post is fast - you only do one operation and get everything back but you have no way of maintaining the relationship between authors and post since it all becomes part of the post document

2177419
pull	push
in other words there s no push technology for calendar updates the client program pull whenever it feels like it

2177431
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp

2177485
put	get
to get this work i have to put all the js code in the partial like

2177517
int	chars
it s a bit like asking the compiler and perhaps expecting too much to compile a chars and optimize it into a int because the int works on 32 bits instead of 8 bits and would be deemed faster

2177613
free	malloc
then the malloc free happen in the same place

2177623
udp	tcp
also if there is a way to find out whether is connection is udp or tcp ip it can be helpful too as the type 2 is udp based

you might create a getter function and setter procedure that will return this property of ftimer getter and set this property of ftimer setter

2177661
outputstream	inputstream
this may happen when you do not explicitly call closeable#close on the inputstream outputstream reader or writer which is constructed around the file in question

2177661
outputstream	inputstream
do it for any inputstream outputstream reader and writer etc whatever implements autocloseable which you re opening yourself using the new keyword

2177666
vb.net	vb6
problem is perhaps i think that i am writing in vb.net which has different data types than vb6

2178143
ilist	iqueryable
lazylist is an iqueryable container that implements ilist

2178167
ienumerable	ienumerator
i can see no reason for foreach not to be available to any class implementing the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces and this is a really useful method if you need to perform a small action 1 line is more readable than 1 line + 2 boilerplate foreach syntax...

2178177
min	max
using max and min will get the larger and smaller of the two elements in question

2178190

2178241
getter	setter
how are you suppose to put getter and setter into a interface

2178251
hash	salt
but password verifiers need to be able to recompute the same hash from the password hence they must have access to the salt

2178251
hash	salt
since the salt must be accessible to verifiers but needs not be secret it is customary to store the salt value along with the hash value

2178251
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
this computes a hash password with the hash function md5 suitable for usage in the etc password or etc shadow file for the password blah and the salt zap here i choose the salt explicitly but under practical conditions it should be selected randomly

2178251
hash	salt
there is a specification somewhere on how the salt and password are sent as input to the hash function at least in the glibc source code possibly elsewhere

2178258
getter	setter
i believe what the compiler is complaining about is that the getter returns an array but the setter takes a targetsystem

width	height
i find it more useful to use em for height or width

2178301
put	get
p.s. there is one more oddity eventhough i put numberfirstline false i get the line number 1 i get that linenumber as well without setting numberfirstline which should default to false it is jsu in there to point out that something is wrong

2178324
vb.net	vb6
yes the vb.net data types are not compatible with the vb6 ones

2178339
integer	unsigned
in your situation the only choice would be to choose an integer type that should be enough for all possible implementations like unsigned long for example and stick with it

2178352
public	protected
operations on data that will never be accessible to the public private or protected

2178352
public	protected
operations that you might wish to expose protected or public

2178407
put	get	post	put	post	get
if you re going hard-core rest using the full complement of get post put delete and checking the user agent s accept headers and all that django will by default have you splitting your logic between url config files and view files so it might not be the cleanest solution

2179805
ubuntu	debian
now install the gem ruby version manager a no pain in debian ubuntu it can compile latest ruby version link text

2179805
rubygems	rvm
you could now use rvm to uninstall the older versions of rubygems in your system and only keept the latest ruby version

2179922
ant	maven
i think you could you use the maven ant tasks to install the jars in dist into a local repository

2179922
ant	pom.xml

2180277
post	get
however my experience is that when onsubmit is not being called it s usually because the request is showing up as a get rather than a post

2180277
post	get	submit	submission
two ways to fix it 1 make it a post submit a form via javascript say or 2 override isformsubmission to use some other criteria for deciding whether a given request is a form submission -- for example you might want to say that if a certain parameter is present the request should be treated as a form submission even if it s a get request

2180928
width	height
most browsers will automatically resize an image to the dimensions specified in the width and height attributes of the tag

2180928
width	height
when specified the width and height attributes tell user agents to override the natural image or object size in favor of these values

cos	sin
if your circle is centered at a b with radius r and you want it to come out at angle t then the start points are x1 a+r cos t y1 b+r sin t i ve assumed you want the line to start at the circumference which is what your question seems to imply and if you want the line to be of length z your end points are x2 x1+z cos t y2 y1+z sin t and you can use the processing command

ignoring the signed unsigned discussion since a byte consists of 8 bits a 32-bit integer has room for 4 bytes

2187423
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
obfuscation and encryption protect intellectual property from casual attack but can not prevent a significant well-crafted reverse-engineering effort

apache	lighttpd
i would just look into using or building a system using well practiced mvc style coding standards build a good db structure and tweak the heck out of apache or use something like lighttpd

2187605
folder	directory
you will notice that there are one or more folder named something like 64631a5f-8914-4449-9453-a773c790b1db one of this folder corresponds to the application you are running right now you will notice that there are 2 folder that are really the same application but one contains the previous sqlite database in the documents directory and the other has the newly created sqlite database

2187703
boost	stl
if you want to use pointers in stl containers consider shared_ptr s from boost to wrap them

2187777
int	double
you might expect 0.5 in this case but it will often evaluate the int value on the right first before assigning and converting the result into a double giving the value 0.0

2187794
web.py	pylons
it should be said i guess that reddit has since abandoned web.py in favor of pylons

2187802
pop-up	dialog
in my event handler i want to pop-up a dialog asking if the user wants to edit just one occurrence of a recurring event or the whole event

2188097
implements	extends
subclasses extends filteriterator must implements the accept method

2188104
cairngorm	flex
cairngorm documentation seems pretty sparse - i m surprised that it s the most popular flex framework given this fact

i ve never worked with activex controls before and i m not sure where to put the .cab files on my web server to get them to install through ie when ie can t run the objects

2188124
accessor	properties
for a propertychanging event it s the same thing but you raise the event before assigning the value in the properties set accessor

2188144
subscript	superscript
for example compatibility variants might represent various presentation or styled forms of basic letters superscript or subscript forms variant glyph shapes or vertical presentation forms

2188149
accessor	properties
the problem is that you are not using your properties accessor when setting the timers

2188149
accessor	properties
the syntax will call your accessor method and thereby automatically retain the object that you send to it since your properties is set up as retain

2188149
accessor	properties
simply calling does not use the properties accessor

2188155
mkmapview	mapkit
there s an operation pending so mapkit is retaining the mkmapview and it hasn t actually been deallocated yet

the normal search rules are in effect the folder that contains the exe first windows directory current working directory path environment

2188356
lotus	sametime
ibm lotus sametime has a support page about this

2188370
put	get
also this makes your code extremely portable you can put wrappers in for the put and get functions to cross networks run your hardware in an hdl simulator and reach into the simulation to read write registers etc with a single chunk of code that doesnt change from simulation to embedded to os device driver to application layer function

2188407
submit	submission
if so in step2.aspx you can override the submission of the form submit it in ajax then submit the third from regularly add the to the page submit it with jquery

2188413

if not you should use tcp rather than udp

2188442
ready	each
i used jquery on doc ready to build a new id for the dialog content and put that id in a place that made sense for the code that launches each dialog

2188447
nsurl	nsdata
you would need to serialize an nsurl to nsdata -- and the default nskeyedunarchivefromdatatransformername transformer will do this for you

2188447
persistent	transient
one transient property of undefined type for the url and a second persistent property of string type for the backing store

2188465
try-catch	exception-handling
now my understanding was that if an exception-handling was raised in the function that inserts into tableb when the try-catch block catches the exception-handling the original insertion into the table would be rollbacked

2188507
hash	md5
i understand md5 is a one-way algorithm and all of the functions that i have come across seem to hash everything together

2188545
inherited	subclassing
otherwise if you choose to not inherited from nsobject or any of its subclassing and just inherited from nothing which is clearly a bad idea because of how the nsobject class deals with everything the objc runtime needs to do and the requirements are quite high then you ll potentially end up with no init method at all

2188556
hash	md5
hashing secret using md5 leads to the following hash

2188556
hash	salt
now if mallory gets her hands on the salt hash chances are she will not find the answer in her dictionary

2188556
hash	salt
if you cannot use an existing column incorporate your salt in the same column than your hash

2188556
hash	salt
for example use the first 32 characters for your 128-bits salt and then the last 40 for your 160-bits hash

2188567
hash	salt
for instance if a hacker gets access to your database and the passwords are not salt then he can look up the hash in his database of hash see to get the original passwords

2188569
hash	salt
for your question about salting i would recommend to hash a password with a static salt string and some dynamic data from database which should not change after once created

2188609
super	implements
you invoke super s doesnotrecognizeselector because you might want to implements your own behaviour for unrecognised selectors for your class

2188658
versioning	upgrade
the last resort would be to download a local copy of the hdf5-1.6.5 headers and be done with it but this is not future proof a matlab versioning upgrade is in my future.

2188664
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i tried to add a animation to viewdidload and viewdidappear but it doesn t work

2188681

2188700
hash	md5
the keywords you should have been looking for are strong name or strongname and or permutation since it seems that with the rpc request they send out the permuatation strong name that md5 hash so that you can possibly distinguish on the server side from which permutation the request was send

2188700
hash	md5
the core function is util.computestrongname it computes an md5 hash d oh of the provided byte array with the added catch

2188835
integer	unsigned
i m trying to insert ip addresses into lastip an unsigned integer

2188845
hide	show
i m using slidetoggle with click function to hide show a container div

2188879
int	double
i would think it s just an int but then in the cout statement it s used as a double array

2188897
cvs	rcs
this is in contrast to for instance cvs which inherited a latest-version-plus-reverse-deltas storage system from rcs

2188897
cvs	svn
based on what you quoted it appears that git and svn are actually more similar than either is to cvs for example

2188911
hash	salt
you don t want to use the same salt for every password because then if two people have the same password they ll have the same hash

2188911
hash	salt
as an example of having a unique salt per user and storing it alongside the password hash i ll point out etc shadow on your typical linux system

2188911
hash	salt
here the ol5ttzxl is the salt and rhfguzsbfwqn6jnx5d.ck is the hash

getdate	dateadd
you could get a day of the previous month with dateadd m -1 getdate

2189005
hash	salt
3 you can have a separate salt for each user the database will be used to store the salt and the hash derived from the password salt combination

2189005
hash	salt
b keeping the salt separate from the password hash is not an effective defense we are assuming administrators after all

2189020
submit	submission
it will prevent a submission on pressing enter and you re free to add a submit button or call form.submit as required

2189029
submit	submission
it will prevent a submission on pressing enter and you re free to add a submit button or call form.submit as required

2189039
gdal	ogr
first you don t specify what version of gdal ogr you use so it may be hard to diagnose where is the problem

2189039
int	chars
yes you are correct values 11 and 80 for int width and chars width respectively are default values set by ogr driver for esri shapefile

2189039
gdal	ogr
this software uses exactly the same c code which is used in gdal ogr to handle shapefile data

2189083
hash	md5
taking the md5 hash of that array

2189083
hash	md5
this mysterious bitconverter object appears to be converting that md5 hash array into a string of hexadecimal numbers

2189100
awt	swing
also it s a bad idea to mix awt and swing components

2189100
awt	swing
both ideas are discussed in painting in awt and swing

even if it inline it won t be able to break up the code inside the actuall inlining any

2189149
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have a scriptmanager and an updatepanel in the page

2189182
mouseleave	mouseenter
you do have the option of capturing the mouse when it enters the scrollviewer though so it continues to receive all mouse events until the mouse is released however this option would require you to delgate any further mouse events to the controls contained within the scrollviewer if you want a response...the following mouseenter mouseleave event handlers will be sufficient

2189196
post	get
i would like to write a requestmapping style form controller that redirects after a validation error and round-trips the values and error messages into the get requested form the spring docs always just show the view being rendered in directly in response to the post

2189198
trojan	virus
compile without changing anything and some antivirus packages will report the resulting exe as a potential virus trojan

2189198
trojan	virus
my guess is that someone somewhere once upon a time wrote a virus trojan malware with delphi and the signature heuristics associated with that now sometimes unfortunately collides with other delphi apps

2189230
put	get
put this in a bash script and try to get it to say it worked

2189243
sorting	filtering
good search including metadata filtering by product version or author and custom sorting by votes or recency

2189249
onfocus	onblur
i suggest detecting the window focus events onblur and onfocus in javascript then sending an enable disable call through to the swf file using externalinterface so inside your html you might have something like this assuming swfobject here but this isn t necessary

2189249
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used it with ie8 firefox 3 and google-chrome 4

2189333
google-chrome	safari
we workers are also supported by google-chrome and safari

put	get	post	put	post	get
is it best practice to use get or even put when reading or updating information or is post the most appropriate to use in every case

2189414
postgresql	mysql
there is a clever solution here with cte s and rank over date_added in postgresql 8.4 but because you re using mysql the only thing i can think of of involves a very computationally complex query

2189494
inherited	properties
the interface could have name properties that i can return directly inside the inherited element structure like the positionelements name properties would just return positon

2189497
width	height
i want to just show the video no height width title etc

pkcs#11 only matters with firefox as ie and safari both use native platform certificate stores and apis cryptoapi and cdsa keychain respectively internally

2189763
floating-point	integer
any cpu with native floating point will have an instruction to convert floating-point to integer data

2189768
put	get
put logic in their parent that temporarily disables the one that didn t get the touch userinteractionenabled no

2189785
int	double
when you convert a double to int on an x86 system the compiler will generate a fist floating-point int conversion instruction and the fpu will do the conversion

2189785
int	double
the gnu mpfr library is capable of doing double to int conversions and will perform the same conversion on all hardware

2189805
folder	directory
then to list out a directory using regex find all lines ending in then parse up to the xth slash based on the number of slashes in the searched folder and do a case in sensitive search based on whether or not you want this to be case sensitive

width	height
suppose i dynamically create a div using document.createelement add some inner text and want to determine its height and width

2190011
hash	md5
similar to the recommendation of using md5 or sha1 hash the dustbuster method largely relies on comparing file size as it primary signal

2190030
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
the wcf equivalent for xsd.exe is svcutil.exe - it has a parameter dconly which creates the data contracts only from a given xsd file

2190149
children	parent
i am having trouble with validations on a has_many relationship where the children exist but the parent doesn t

2190149
children	parent
however when creating saving the parent object i want to ensure that specific children with certain attributes have already been saved

2190149
children	parent
when the children are assigned to the parent with they are not saved immediately as the parent s id does not exist

2190149
children	parent
and for the parent to be saved it must have at least those 2 children

2190205
children	parent
first thing if you want the children to be saved without the parent id then there is no point in doing this

2190205
children	parent
so within the transaction if at any stage code fails then it will rollback the whole db transaction i.e you will either have one parent with 2 children or nothing if that s the end state you are looking for

2190205
children	parent
edit since you can t create a parent unless it has 2 children in that case instead of

2190206
versioning	upgrade
i use redgate sql compare for this by comparing to an empty db as well as for doing upgrade between all my db versioning i save a copy of the db for each released versioning and then just do a compare between current and previous to get a change script for that versioning

2190405
multibyte	setlocale
you use the setlocale standard function with the lc_ctype or lc_all category to set the mapping the library uses between wchar_t characters and multibyte characters

2190405
int	chars
the wide-character wchar_t type is intended to be able to support any chars set the system supports - the standard doesn t define the size of a wchar_t type it could be as small as a chars or any of the larger int types

dlsym	dlopen
under linux you could use dlopen to either open up a shared library containing the function you want or even access the current executable and locate your function using the dlsym

2190640
int	boolean
this will validate if that is a number as it will try parsing and it will return a boolean true or false if it parsed the int successfully or not

2190673
folder	directory
assuming you ve checked all the obvious things such as the above then one other thing to try is to quit xcode delete the build folder in your project directory and try again - sometimes the build folder gets in a pickle internally

2190683
dlsym	dlopen
with posix.1-2001 you should use dlopen and dlsym

2190691
pop-up	dialog
either pop-up a dialog log them or ignore them but in that case be sure that it s really safe to do so

2190741
put	get
you re supposed to put something in between them that normally wouldn t be animated with you get a fading effect

2190744

2190873
post	get
today we only use a tiny bit of the http protocol s methods â namely get and post

2190873
post	get
for example rest dictates the usage of delete to erase a document be it a file state etc. behind a uri whereas with http you would misuse a get or post query like

2190907
client-side	server-side
the browserinfo is available at client-side as webbrowser ar the server-side

2190929
dictionary	map
in python there is map in the standard module locale.py see windows_locale dictionary near the bottom of the file

2191085
post	get
i don t know why do you send it by get i d suggest sending it by post

2191092

investigation has shown that javax.xml.parsers.documentbuilderfactory comes from xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar which is being brought in by maven from commons-digester dom4j and jdom

2191111
hide	show
to show hide would have been simple call to .show or hide

2191123
maven	m2e
m2e maven plugin

2191128
config	ini
i prefer to work with ini files as config that sit before public_html folder.i think that gives me a lot of flexibility and grouping var and create if necessary separate ini for modules etc

2191216
post	get
think about it as uber public method accessible through http get post etc. that returns html

2191218
rss	feed
the page i m creating is an rss feed that needs to be set to win-1255 showing information taken from another feed that is encoded in utf-8

2191255
portrait	landscape
i want to create the following layout which should be 100 in landscape form as displaying in portrait form

maven	pom.xml
afetr using the model library see this for my maven pom.xml during this weeks i jumped on this error while attempting to write a configuratoncontainer into the pom.xml

2191537
aggregate-functions	sum
it has to be a mixture of the group by columns and aggregate-functions like count sum etc

2191545
aggregate-functions	sum
group by should be used with aggregate-functions such as count sum avg etc

2191547
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am getting a problem with this code in ie7 firefox google-chrome opera all seem to work fine

2191548
range	max
basically filter and map on range the result of 1 until max is non-strict meaning it will be computed on-demand and it will be computed every time you try to access it s results

2191559
aggregate-functions	sum
you need to use a aggregate-functions such as sum or count or max in your select clause

2191588
for-loop	arrays
you could use a framework such as prototype or jquery that give you an each method to use on the arrays but internally it would likely just use a for-loop anyway so there s not really much point to it

2191588
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
alternatively if this is because you are using the for-loop all over the place and want to have reusable code instead why not attach a buildurl method to your urls object which loops internally and returns your url arrays

2191600
division	modulo
so you will have to use integer division or normal division and modulo

2191616
datediff	difference
if you want the correct difference you need to use the actual dates then you can use php datediff -

2191724
boost	stl
yet i would prefer to use standard iterators stl or boost to support this structure rather that writing my own iterators

2191737
post	get
i wan t to pass a variable without using get to php so i m using post with jquery but i can t write the result into the document refresh all the page

2192120
audiotrack	audiorecord
i currently use the audiotrack and audiorecord classes in android

2192151
disk	ram
if you re allocating close to 2gb of ram on 32 bit windows the system is probably paging a lot of memory to disk and that s where i d look first for the slow down

2192151
disk	ram
when you re using a lot of memory you should think of it as being stored on disk in pagefile.sys but cached in physical ram

2192151
disk	ram
in effect when you copy the file into one big allocation you re copying much of it disk- disk via ram then when you run over it again to analyse you re loading the copy back to ram again

2192160
memcached	apc
note that one could always use some kind of shared memory mechanism apc memcached etc.. to keep sqlite s in-memory databases persistent across connections

2192187
getter	setter
got getter and setter for this field

2192256
children	parent
say you have a parent and that parent has a collection of children

2192256
children	parent
hibernate now can lazy-load the children which means that it does not actually load all the children when loading the parent

2192285
int	chars
i ve also noticed that using int or unsigned int works without needing to swap variables but chars doesn t

2192307
int	chars
because u reads and stores an unsigned int which is very likely larger than the single unsigned chars you have

2192307
int	chars
there is no way to read an int string such as 42 and store it in a chars

2192327
sqldatasource	detailsview
i m using a detailsview with an sqldatasource in the aspx page

2192339

2192354
crypt	salt
i want to take this generated string and insert it into the crypt function as the salt

2192379
audiotrack	audiorecord
as the documentation states for audiorecord and audiotrack

2192379
audiotrack	audiorecord	mediarecorder	audiorecord	mediarecorder	audiotrack
if you want audio in other formats either don t use audiorecord and audiotrack try mediarecorder and mediaplayer or you will have to transcode it using your own code possibly leveraging the ndk

2192379
audiotrack	audiorecord
audiorecord and audiotrack are designed specifically for cases where the audio in question is not supported by the opencore multimedia engine either because it s not a supported codec or not a supported streaming protocol sip

2192386
int	chars
that is your bug your variables were of type unsigned chars which is 1 byte however you entered 12 which is 4 bytes a unsigned int that caused an overflow implementation defined by the compiler runtime and that would explain it overwriting the next variable in memory

2192386
int	chars
you used the u specifier for printf which is an unsigned int for a unsigned chars variable that is incorrect and does not match up

2192405
width	height
this opens a new xaml window which contains a documentviewer control and a listbox with the choice of different labels 1 sheet with 12 labels 2 columns 6 rows 1 sheet with a single label whose width and height can be user defined

2192406
gridex	janus
the reason for this is because janus gridex s do not read from the datasource until the control is visible the control has loaded

2192477
children	parent
i would like to model a person s relationship to another person where the relationship isn t necessarily hierarchical friends colleagues rather than parent children and i am interested in capturing more detail about each relationship notes type of relationship date established

2192481
children	parent
to answer your question above about what on delete cascade does it allows you to delete a parent key record in person and it s corresponding children records in hobby without having to delete all the children records first

2192506
maven	pom.xml
it shows how you can maven deploy to sf without the need for any pom.xml tricks or plugins

if you use a modern browser firefox + firebug safari on mac google-chrome opera ie8 you can right click on an element in a page and use the command called inspect vary from browser to browser

2192525
crypt	salt
it seems that the crypt dislikes + char in the salt and a lot of other special chars as well etc

2192602
int	chars
would this do by using the itoa function to convert the number and store it into a buffer and use the string s custom reverse function which returns back a pointer to chars and convert the pointer to chars to an int again using the atoi function

2192602
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2192610
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
i guessed it s because it shares one nsmanagedobjectcontext instance for all read operations so i rewrote the class so it shares only nsmanagedobjectmodel and nspersistentstorecoordinator instances and creates it s own nsmanagedobjectcontext instance

2192618
outputstream	inputstream
note that generally apis that try to handle files should be written to handle inputstream outputstream as well to allow this kind of operations to suceed

2192636
inherited	properties
for a strongly-typed view i have a basemodel class that has properties that the master page needs and all my other models inherited the base class

2192666

2192811
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome works correctly

2192880
int	chars
when casting int to chars or chars to other simple types what are some of the side effects that can occur

2192935
superclass	subclassing
you can probably implement your idea by subclassing uiscrollview and then implement a different behaviour in touchedbegan moved ended modifying the touches and passing them to the superclass if needed

2192994
unsigned	short
in short you can t rely on shift working identically for signed and unsigned chars so if you need portability use unsigned char rather than char or signed char

2193006
draggable	droppable
these basically make a list draggable and other areas droppable sortable

2193007
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
if there s no dos2unix command then try opening the post-commit hook in an editor that lets you change line endings on windows i believe that notepad+ will but i m not a windows guy like emacs textmate or vim and remove the extra character at the end of the first line and probably all other lines

2193011
int	chars
when casting int to chars or chars to other simple types

2193011
unsigned	short
casting an unsigned char with value 0xff to a unsigned short however yields 0x00ff

2193044
maven	m2e
maybe you can configure m2e to do this automatically on resource changes right-click on your project then select properties maven and add the appropriate war goal to the goals to invoke on resource changes

2193118
inline	inlining
so f# also supports static constraints the type parameter is a instead of usual a and these are processed at compile time using inlining this also explains why the function has to be inline

2193166
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol with four tabitem in it

2193194
waitpid	posix
you can use posix waitpid with wnohang to do a no-blocking wait or signals to check if your child is still running or you can use pipes check when it gets closed

2193233
filesystems	fat
this would be similar to how the fat filesystems works

2193279
folder	directory
i don t do websphere anymore but i know that it s built on top of tomcat and that tomcat by default stores the compiled jsp files in work folder of the installation directory

2193309
lpwstr	bstr
arraysubtype of lpstr lpwstr bstr or

2193326
width	height
in general 3d bin-packing problems have the added complication that the objects can be rotated into different positions so for any object with a given length width and height you effectively have to create three variables representing each position but you only use one in the solution

2193330
put	get
what i ended up doing was using perl with the pdf reuse and pdf reuse barcode libraries to get all pdfs in the directory pull the pages i wanted put the barcode and save out to a new pdf

2193351
int	double
you are using double s not int s

2193425

memcached	apc
a cache like apc memcached or xcache usually has a lifetime before it gets stale

2193546
paramiko	pexpect
if the server accepts sftp sessions i wouldn t bother with pexpect but instead use the paramiko ssh2 module for python

2193546
stdout	stderr
sshclient.exec_command returns a triple stdin stdout stderr

2193581
put	get	post	put	post	get
for example today thinking about a mvc model you can limit your application to respond just to specific kinds of verbs like post get put and delete

2193586
subtract	add
very short operations short arithmetic add subtract simple state flag changes etc are better suited for a spinlock

2193589

qprogressbar	qwidget
the qwidget class and all of its subclasses including qprogressbar are not reentrant and can not be used outside of the main thread

2193780
onmouseover	onclick	onclick	onfocus
all visual components have attributes such as onclick onmouseover onmouseout onfocus etc

2193787
r5rs	r6rs
second that syntax uses keyword arguments so if you re using some language like r6rs or r5rs or pretty big etc then you won t be able to use sort with a keyword like that

2193789
maven	pom.xml
i want to inherit the dependencies of a parent pom.xml in a child project in maven 2.2.1

2193789
maven	pom.xml

2194126
moq	typemock
there are various mocking frameworks that you can use like rhino mock moq typemock to name a few

2194151
curb	libcurl
i also had a look at libcurl through curb but it relies on callbacks not blocks and the callbacks don t pass in the libcurl instance so there s no way to kill the connection like there is with net http

2194164
int	boolean
see the string getdisplayname boolean daylight int style method in java.util.timezone

2194200
put	get
charset utf-8 in fact you might be able to get away with just the meta tag -- just put it before the others

2194207
actionscript	mxml
the mxml and actionscript code

2194209
hide	show
this post is continuation of way to quickly show hide winforms gui c# as it doesn t work for me in this particular case

2194209
hide	show
1 is that the mainannouncewindow gui should start hidden and later on when called by windowstatechange show it should show by windowstatechange hide it should hide

2194233
mouseleave	mouseenter
the icon image also has a storyboard for mouseenter and mouseleave

2194274

i have had experience using both udp and tcp for this in the past and as pointed out by others udp does have some advantage but it s slightly more difficult to work with

2194305
gridview	onclientclick
here is the code for the gridview onprerender event where the onclientclick event of the checkbox is set

2194309
implements	extends
i think i would like to implements it as something that extends a jpanel so it can be embedded as a component in other windows

2194324
post	get
i use separate view models for input get and output post as well unless the two models are identical

2194324
srp	principles
in most cases i don t feel that duplicating some automatic properties on two objects violates the dry principles and i think the cost is justified to follow srp

2194379
disk	ram
takes some place on disk and in ram

2194389
rss	feed
i m trying to parse a stack overflow rss feed of a specific question

2194495
google-chrome	safari
it s in newer versions of google-chrome and safari but i can t pinpoint since which version

2194507
width	margin
further also give #container-900px .left and #container-900px .right a width of 445px so that it fits nicely along the 10px margin of the container

2194537
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it looks the same in firefox opera and google-chrome

2194552
getter	setter
first the setter is probably called less often than the getter so you re doing less work

2194568
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
when implementing argument checking in apis i usually check for each condition separately and throw different exceptions argumentnullexception for a null reference or depending on the api specifications argumentexception for an empty string

2194594
post	get
my method is to have an action that handles both the post and the get scenarios

2194594
post	get
this is my which can be handled by both get and post methods

2194594
put	get	post	put	post	get

2194633
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side technology while js is a client-side

2194675
webclient	webrequest
alternatively use the webclient or webrequest classes instead

profiling	debugging
if you need to debugging these kind of things put the uncompressed js files in your code and use firebug with it s profiling to profiling the functions

2194721
button	right-align
use and to make the button be centered vertically and right-align

2194784
joomla	phpbb
this includes cms s like joomla and forums like phpbb

2194789
hash	salt
it s storing the salt with the hash password so that you can simply extract the whole thing from the configuration file or wherever you store it grab the salt off the end hash the incoming password with it and compare the results to the hash password from the configuration

2194789
hash	salt
if you don t store the salt with the hash password in the configuration you d have to store it somewhere else and extract it from there to hash incoming passwords when you perform the test

2194789
hash	salt
since sha1 is a fixed 160 bits 20bytes it s easy to grab the salt by simply skipping the first 20 characters in the hash password in the configuration

2194829
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsview is often hooked up to a qgraphicsscene

2194834
width	height
another strangeness is that in sizechanged i am using glsurfaceview this is the override method in the renderer required by glsurfaceview i always get width 480 and height 800 no matter whether i start the app in full screen mode

2194844
public	protected
note the access tag was useful with php 4 when there were no public protected private but i never use it when i document code written in php 5 the code using the visibility keywords is self-documenting

2194857
min	max
this function will take values one at a time - so there is no iterating over all values to scale them all or see what the min and max is

2194860
subscript	superscript
i see for nsattributedstring has a specific attribute for superscript but i can t find one for subscript

2194879
dictionary	map
that said the f# runtime fsharp.core.dll does include a few immutable collection classes like list set and map which roughly are immutable counterparts to the list hashset and dictionary classes found in system.collections.generic since it is often useful to have immutable collections for persistent snapshots in multi-threaded code

2194914
innodb	myisam
i am updating this question to reflect the comparison between myisam innodb

2194914
innodb	myisam	postgresql	mysql
i ran a test against mysql innodb myisam and postgresql to see how well

2194914
postgresql	mysql
mysql version was 5.0.67-community-nt-log 32-bit postgresql version was 8.4

2194914
postgresql	mysql
these are the create table statements used in mysql and postgresql

2194914
postgresql	mysql
for reference here are my config files for mysql and postgresql

2194958
dictionary	map
the dictionary is implemented as a c++ stl std map which has o lg n lookups

2194964
hide	show
i was digging through the hoverintent logic and realized that it itself is triggering the function to show hide the menu

2194974
int	boolean
what about the color int rgb boolean hasalpha constructor

2195006
affinity	processors
unless a thread has a processors affinity mask the scheduler will move it from processors to processors in order to give it execution time

2195006
affinity	processors
to specify processors affinity for a thread use the setthreadaffinitymask function

2195087
folder	directory
hudson seems to expect nant_home to point to a folder that contains a bin directory where nant.exe can be found

2195095
gridview	repeater
i m binding this result to a gridview and i need the xml column to be bound to a nested repeater as it contains parent-child data

2195099
getter	setter
for something this simple you re better off just providing the getter and setter

2195118
put	get
to get the xml available on the client-side in part of your transform you can output the sections of xml that you need or the whole dom and put that either in a javascript variable or somewhere accessible on the page

2195118
client-side	server-side
i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable

2195126
int	chars
they can be fixed by using a chars constant converting the numeric constant to a chars or converting the chars to an unsigned chars before the comparison operator promotes both to an int

2195148
int	chars
in regular c would give you an int from 0 to 25 for strings starting with lowercase-alpha chars

2195178
uiview	subviews
i am trying to graph large amounts of data in a uiview as a subviews of a uiscrollview

2195178
minimum	max	min	max
in order to overcome the memory limitations surrounding enormous uiviews i plan once the scrollview s offset has reached the maximum or minimum offset to redraw the view with the new data either with a lesser x value if it has reached minimum or visa versa and then increase the view s offset to the opposite of its current position ie max-- min and min-- max

2195195
subtract	add	range	minimum
for each number you want to scale add the inverse of the minimum input value scale by the scaling factor and then subtract the output range offset

2195195
range	max	range	min	min	max
you need to find out what the operating range for the mouse is and what values can come out of it and that will give you your min and max values

2195199
firefox	safari
when i attempt this in firefox and safari the html updates properly

2195203
ubuntu	linux
i use python based as well as rails applications on ubuntu linux

2195221

2195315
min	max
count sum avg aggregate min max

2195406
accessor	properties
remove the set accessor and mark the properties as readonly

many-to-one	one-to-many

2195703
mouseover	mouseout
i think that every time #bd1 crosses your mouse pointer which is presumably hovering over the image it is calling the mouseout then calling mouseover when it gets past

2195732
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m pretty sure you can achieve this using the lambda expression form by explicitly using the ienumerable version of select instead of iqueryable

2195741

post	get
it s the same reason there is no good way to get a list of all the post across all of the blogs with just a query

2195782

google-chrome	firefox
my tabs work flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome on windows and os x...but not in ie

2196299
google-chrome	firefox
i realize that declaring a variable with the name event is bad code but i am curious about the technical difference here that the use of var in ie reinitializes the variable to null whereas google-chrome will not overwrite with a var declaration unless a value is explicitly assigned and maybe firefox holds the event object outside of the window s var declaration scope altogether

2196325
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute

take for example smalltalk lisp java and c++

2200486
lisp	smalltalk
in fact several modern high-performance jvms are actually either smalltalk vms in disguise derived from smalltalk vms or written by smalltalk vm companies. lisp is also interesting because although it is a dynamic language there are some although not many static high-performance implementations

2200701
realloc	malloc
you do not have to cast the return value of malloc or realloc

2200702
integer	unsigned
i think you can safely assume that size_type is an unsigned nonegative integer

2200726
std	ostream
you ve defined type manip to be a function that takes a std ostream by reference and returns a std ostream by reference but you ve defined endd to take a dxfitem and return a dxfitem and dxfitem does not derive from std ostream

2200761
qobject	qwidget
when a qwidget or any qobject is destroyed it will remove itself from its parent s to-delete list so you can delete it yourself and not worry about double deletes

2200785
hash	md5
the field is binded with my entity.password field that is stored as an md5 hash

2200785
hash	md5
problem is that a empty string has also an md5 hash

2200785
hash	md5
the validator doesn t check the actual input but the converted md5 hash

2200833
maven	cargo
possible answer we could use maven plug-ins for deployment cargo and use maven s profiles to handle several configurations

2200937
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have the basic functionality working in opera firefox google-chrome safari but ie7 is failing to co-operate

2201236
put	get
put text-align left on the outermost div swap the second and the third inner div and then get rid of the unnecessary monster replacing it with the semantically correct and much shorter

2201307
width	height
you should be able to fix this by setting a fixed width and height on your containing div with overflow hidden

2201307
width	height
you don t seem to have width set in your example and your height is set to auto

2201315
int	double
the odometer reading is an int on the incoming data and double on the database changed to int on the dbml file

2201324
width	height
i also applied a scaletransform instead of setting width and height to reduce screen artifacts a bit if control grips etc are displayed and to avoid conflicts if the control being hidden already has width and height properties set assuming that the control doesn t already have a layouttransform set on it

2201350
post	get
so i have a person controller with an add action get and post

2201393
width	height
if you want to end up with absolute coordinates multiple the left and right by the image width and the top and bottom by the image height

2201426
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works well in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.0 3.5 google-chrome and safari

2201447
config	ini
when coding with php i always separate config values like perpage value in a separated ini file

2201456

this works fine and i then pop-up a dialog saying i have detected the call and then the user presses a button to close the dialog which calls finish on that activity

2201460
audiotrack	audiorecord
it calls a service that uses audiorecord to record from the mic and audiotrack to play it out the earpiece nothing in the service to do with the dialler

2201489
getter	setter
and it will create all the getter and setter that you need

2201572
appendto	each
rebuilding the html of each select box after the appendto forces ie to update its state

2201589
pop-up	dialog
sometimes i encouter such strange situations that the program run incorrectly while running normally and it will pop-up the termination dialog but correctly while debugging.this do make me frustrated when i want to use debugger to find the bug inside my code

2201642
intersect	contains
consider the simple case of a text document that has various regions marked up for their type -- perhaps you want to find all the marked-up units that contains or intersect a given contiguous range of text for example a paragraph

2201670
google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen in any other browsers firefox and google-chrome

2201715
inherited	subclassing
the python classes won t be c++ subclassing so you need a c++ wrapper class that does inherited from listener that contains a for the python subclassing instance and that has a notify method that translates the arguments to python objects calls the notify method of the using pyobject_callmethod translates the result back to c++ types and returns

2201757
ati	nvidia
i think you should rather stick with opencl which is an open standard and supported by ati nvidia and more

2201760
ati	nvidia
both of these run on ati as well as nvidia hardware in addition to also working on the vector units sse of cpus

2201771
wapiti	exploit
many of these web application exploit are leveraging vulnerabilities discovered using testing tools free and open source tools such as wapiti w3af or the perhaps the expensive commercial product acunetix

2201786
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have this code working fine with firefox and opera but not with safari and google-chrome

2201802
typedef	struct
i d prefer to look at an older os targeted to a single device as current operating systems contain a tangle of macros and layers of typedef that make following even a simple struct definition difficult

2201811
imagemagick	minimagick
minimagick gives similar functionality to rmagick but is a wrapper to the command line version of convert and is much more stable because it doesn t try to invoke the imagemagick api and manage large binary objects in memory like rmagick does

2201816
free	malloc
another option is to use more classic c memory management malloc free and manage your array that way

2201829
haskell	ocaml
we use haskell ocaml and now f# so for us it has nothing to do with lack of c-like syntax

2201918
int	chars
for example take the chars array holding ascii chars abc the int conversion i m looking for would change those chars to a single int with value 656667

2201939

the problem is i offer hundreds of rss feed and donâ t want to manually burn a feed just for this one feature

2202001
disk	ram
the disk file system is not as fast as ram memory

2202148
rss	feed
i m creating the rss feed as using views

2202190
versioning	upgrade
the next time the app versioning changes needsupgrade will reset to true and you ll auto-call upgrade to bring in any existing user settings again

2202222
scrummaster	sprint
if you need to refine them a bit i think that you the dev team the scrummaster the project team should do that a bit ahead during the previous sprint

2202234
cldc	midp
knowing which configuration cdc or cldc and which profile midp or pp you are targeting is critical to knowing which apis are available

2202257
opera	firefox
etc for the major browsers opera ie firefox

2202401
ascx	scriptmanager
the only problem is that i don t seem to find a way to include scriptmanager inside the ascx itself - only on the pages that host this control which is prone to error and defeats the purpose and just seems wrong

2202468
post	get
ajax get calls to action methods that return a jsonresult object should be changed to use post instead

2202478
put	get
and mz question is how do i get the richtextbox to put some string immediately after the caret

2202530
codeigniter	pyrocms
try looking at phil sturgeon s pyrocms it will give you a real world look at how a great codeigniter dev codes

2202770
clsid	createobject
you need clsidfromprogid to map the argument you normally pass to createobject to a clsid

2202776
post	get
unfortunately i m new to stackoverflow so i can only use one link in my comments so check tudor s post and get enlightened

2202798
post	get
also if i use get instead of post everything works fine except that get won t support the length of data i need to send

2202836
sequence	permutation
it contains all the possible permutation of a 5 number sequence

2202876
put	get
create a big enough file map it get an asintbuffer put in your numbers

2202934
switching	screens
i know it requires javascript but i m not entirely sure how to detect that the image is outside of the viewable screens and then make it switching to the other side of the thumbnail

2203055
public	protected
they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

2203123
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
i m also not sure that enable disable will work with a div or a-tag you might be better off using fadeout and fadein or just show and hide to disable the links

2203136
width	height
also you specify a cols and rows value on the textarea and then style a width and height

2203158
int	double
consequently writing to your int will affect your pointer value or your double

2203161
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer

2203164
int	chars
assuming int is 4 bytes and chars is 1 byte if you modify the int all the four elements of the chars array will be modified

2203251
client-side	server-side
flex is intended for developing client-side applications and communication with a database is done through a server-side application

2203285
folder	directory
setup a virtual directory in iis that points to the website folder of your dnn installation

2203285
versioning	upgrade
note the use of a source versioning of dnn for production use is not recommended additionally it is my personal recommendation to not modify the source unless you are truly willing to accept that future upgrade might not be possible due to your modifications

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
then get it looking right for both firefox and google-chrome

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
only after you have it looking right in firefox and google-chrome should you start concerning yourself with how it looks in ie

2203312
google-chrome	firefox
after you do the above if it still doesn t look right in both firefox and google-chrome set the first and second padding values for your #s rule-set to 0 change 8px to 0px and then add a margin-top declaration to both #s and #searchsubmit and give both the same value for example margin-top 8px

2203313
post	get
however this post tells you how to get it working

2203327
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
to bind the fieldtypes datagridcomboboxcolumn to the fieldtypes property on the view model i created a datatemplate staticresource to be used in a datagridtemplatecolumn

2203329
rss	feed
pathologic can also solve the problem of missing images and broken links in your siteâ s rss feed

2203410
action-filter	onactionexecuting
in the basecontroller override onactionexecuting you could also define an action-filter attribute for this

2203437
width	height
i m currently creating a new neat cli library for php and i d like to figure out the width height of the console it s running in

2203487
post	get
and get with post request or get

2203508
mouse	keyboard
optimizing for mobile means focusing on the basics and redesigning the experience so it doesn t require complex mouse and keyboard interactions

2203637
folder	directory
setup a virtual directory in iis that points to the website folder of your dnn installation

2203726
children	parent
i originally thought that parent div s only grow as wide as their children but it turns out i was wrong given my example above which i coded only to demonstrate my issue i m having

2203741
children	parent
especially if you have multiple children with a single parent

2203743
pull	push
to sync these all you do is send receive push pull the changes between these repositories

2203774
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
we just completely uninstall the previous versioning of the product during an upgrade aka a major upgrade so we don t need to worry about such things

2203776
uiview	subviews
i am developing an iphone app that places multiple custom uiview as subviews in a uiscrollview

2203804
width	height
this size matches the css width and height properties

2203807
rational-numbers	base
but if you re using integers or rational-numbers for your control points then you can use groebner base to rewrite your bi-variate order-3 polynomials into a possibly-up-to-order-9-thus-your-nine-possible-intersections monovariate polynomial

2203807
short	base
burchburger has a layman-friendly introduction to groebner base called grã bner base a short introduction for systems theorists that was very helpful for me

2203811
sysv	systemd
that link is for linux other systemd should do one or the other depending on their sysv vs

2203822
jar	war
the next day sit with him her and have them explain how to compile and build a jar or war

2203822
jar	war
the should be able to compile and build a jar war at the very least imo

2203841
width	height
you might have to override qwidget sizehint in the toolbox class to make the widget exactly as large as it needs to be to fit all the buttons in the case of your six buttons the width would be 64 and the height would be 96

2203894
put	get
it s like for example if you re writing a regex to detect backslashes you have to escape the backslash in the regex by doubling it and if you re using a language without regex literals you have to put it in a string with correct escapes so it ends up as four backslashes in a row which looks completely wrong but it s right when you think about the interaction of different levels of escape mechanism by the way i originally tried to write out those backslashes but in order to get around stackoverflow s own escape mechanism i would have had to write eight backslashes in a row and it didn t feel safe to write that

2203903
mouse	keyboard
it disable mouse and keyboard events for a widget

2203950
put	get
constant is an alternative way to get hold of a constant but a function call can t be put into a string without concatenation either

2203956
inherited	properties
you can inherited your own control from checkedlistbox and create a properties in c# it would be like this the rest of the functionality remains the same as it is inherited so no further additional code required

2204049
button	checkbox
probably best to implement this by having a checkbox with each row then when the delete button is clicked it calls sql to delete each checked row using the filter from 1 and primary key metadata mentioned in 2 as well as to remove it from the table

2204098
children	parent
for the test case there are 4 records in the table 1 parent 3 children

2204119
accessor	superclass
module is the superclass of the class class so if a suitably generic name could be thought of then the methods for defining accessor could be put on module and it would work for modules and classes

2204208
allocator	stl
you can use stl containers to do just about anything you would do with raw memory including allocator and initializing all in one fell swoop

2204216
boost	stl
its codebase goes back maybe 12 or 13 years and while we have put work into upgrading and maintaining it use of stl and boost - when i joined most containers were custom for example - fully upgraded to unicode and the 2010 vcl etc there s one remaining very significant problem it s fully singlethreaded

2204222
free	malloc
the second easiest is to malloc and free them

2204291
accessor	properties
when you declare a member of a class that has get and or set defined formally known as accessor you are defining a properties

2204359
inherited	properties
the advantage of this is that you are guaranteeing that the properties can only be set by either the base class or any class that inherited the base class

2204373
range	max
what i really need is exactly like the range slider except that the max shouldn t have a handle and shouldn t be movable by the user

2204373
range	minimum
one idea that comes to mind but i don t know how to implement is to superimpose a range with fixed minimum slider and hidden handle on top of a regular slider

2204382
inherited	properties
fb_controller inherited from controller and has a properties facebook that is instantiated using the api key and secret upon construction

2204395
pop-up	dialog
a solution i ve seen implemented with grid components is to have a column chooser - some sort of pop-up dialog that lists the columns and you can select which ones you would like to see in the grid

2204421
post	get
the fact that you have a non-common domain will create the need to supply the encrypted piece in the header either post or get and pass it in plaintext

2204479
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can only dynamically resize something that was the result of malloc calloc or realloc

2204482
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater which contains a nested gridview

2204482
gridview	repeater
now i need to be able to retrieve a value databound in a label inside of a repeater and use it as an input parameter for the gridview

2204482
gridview	repeater
so i basically want the label control rollidlabelcode which is located in a repeater to also be an input into my gridview

2204497
war	manifest.mf
since all of the wars use the same jars we store them in the lib folder of the ear and then for each war we reference the jars in the ear lib folder in each wars manifest.mf

2204497
war	manifest.mf	jar	manifest.mf	jar	war
what usually happens is that another developer adds or removes a jar say changes myjar-1.0.0 to myjar-1.1.0 and updates all of the manifest.mf files in each war

2204497
war	manifest.mf	jar	manifest.mf	jar	war
the only way to cure this is to open the properties of each war go into the j2ee module dependencies tab uncheck a random jar which prompts the user to checkout the manifest.mf .classpath and .project click apply which saves the manifest and then re-check the jar and hit apply once again

2204501
width	height
i like it because it produces results in one pass but it assumes that font width scales like its height

2204548
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
to make every tab in my application autorotate properly i ve defined -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in my custom view controllers but they are all inside uinavigationcontroller within a uitabbarcontroller so the message won t get sent down the chain to my vc until those two also respond

2204552
put	get
i install on the simulator and it works fine but as soon as i put it on my device i get the following error

2204566
serializable	deserialization
you shouldn t attempt to proxy a request to invoke a method inside the same application - this will incur needless serializable deserialization of objects to xml messages and back

2204579
multiplying	add
i m trying to write a simple function that takes two inputs x and y and passes these to three other simple functions that add multiplying and divide them

2204589
post	get
and finally here s a blog post outlining how to get it done and quickly

2204591
children	parent
setting such property on the parent will apply to all of its children unless those are set explicitly

2204615
ssl	https
when i deployed the project with the web.config below enabling ssl https www.mydomain .com service.svc sessions does not even pull up at all

2204657
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
say i have two uiviewcontroller all working under a uinavigationcontroller

2204657
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve put my cd calls into viewwillappear currently in viewdidload

2204728
centos	linux
operating system is linux centos 5.4 32bit

2204741
metaclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the first question as somebody noted has nothing to do with metaclass you simply can t multiply inherited from any two classes a and b in this order where b is a subclassing of a

2204858
rss	feed
i iterate a rss feed like so where _file is the feed

2204904
mouse	keyboard
the controller interprets the keyboard and mouse and manipulates both the camera view and scene model

2204906
disk	ram
another possibility may be throwing a lot more ram at the problem and using it as a disk cache

2204917
ant	maven
the process i m constrained to use requires a single build which will be promoted through the environments to production so i m unable to use substitution ala maven or ant

2204952
ant	maven
if you use ant maven this should be fairly straightforward to achieve

2204952
ant	maven
ant maven that should provide you with the ability to substitute a value

2204966
children	parent
assuming you re right that its the ultimate parent i assume that it is so because it makes it easy to find all of forms in your application enumerating the children of this master form

2205044
pop-up	dialog
i am using the below code to pop-up the authentication dialog

2205052
width	height
if you have a width and length then when somebody asks you have length width sqft and if you add height volume as well

2205064
rtl	vhdl
with vhdl you can define your own new types which lets you program at a higher level still rtl of course

2205064
altera	xilinx	verilog	vhdl
i m pretty sure the xilinx and altera free tools support both vhdl and verilog

2205071
width	height
if you like you can bind values to the width and height and turn off the scroll bars so they don t pop up if the image is bigger than the window

2205071
width	height
1 bind the canvas width height to a simple calculation or

2205071
width	height
2 add a listener that responds to resize events and sets the bound width height variables or

2205081
width	height
all the text and url are wrapped in a div with fixed width and height yet the url still overflows

2205151
listview	gridview
i m using listview with gridview

2205165
public	protected
another useful trick that is applicable while using properties is the ability to modify the modifier of the the derived properties like changing from public access to protected

2205195
war	manifest.mf	jar	manifest.mf	jar	war
i am not familiar with rad but i do store the jar war in clearcase without the version number meaning our manifest.mf file does not change that often

2205195
jar	war
that being said this ibm article references some methods to include those jar war files that could be worth a try to see of the manifest is updated

2205195
jar	war
either reference them through a common project not referenced on clearcase and only there to include the jar war files

2205205
switching	screens
if you login and go to your blog page then switching to structure editing mode by clicking the cubes icon at the top right of the screens you can then access the configure this page button for the blog page

2205228
profiling	instrumentation
1 have you or can you profiling with instrumentation during these hangs

2205245
post	get
one of the approaches i use is install fiddler and monitor the post and get packets while manually logging in the site

2205247
min	max
so at the very least you need to set the min and max properties on the print dialog object to something reasonable before you set the flags

2205247
min	max
if you just set min and max the page selection will default both the to and from fields to 1

2205247
min	max
if you set min to 1 and max to -1 and also set frompage to 1 and topage to -1 the from field will default 1 and the to field will be empty

2205247
min	max
it s interesting that this works since the documentation states that max must be larger than min but it looks like -1 is treated more like an empty or null value

2205256
pull	push
with the reactive framework due out in .net 4.0 we will see linq expand to not only pull queries but to push scenarios too

2205316
getter	setter
i have a dynamic list of variables for which i need to create getter and setter on the fly during runtime

2205319
uiview	subviews
so once the view controller calls this inside the uiview i have a button that changes the subviews so what i do is use the super addsubview newview

2205325
ssl	https
is ssl and https one and the same.

2205368
int	double
casting an int to a double doesn t require a cast

2205372
getter	setter
make sure all properties fields and public getter setter match and make sure they re clear

2205374
ssl	https
is ssl and https one and the same.

2205374
ssl	https
ssl ensures that data is encrypted and decrypted back and forth while you are viewing the website https is the uri that is need to access the secure website

2205378
int	double
if you are trying to convert the bits of your int to a the representation of a double you need to cast the address not the value

2205381
int	double
maybe it s doing an implicit conversion from int to float before it attempts the cast to double

2205382
profiling	instrumentation
as for instrumentation you really want to use time profiling to see where the system is spending all its time - preferably on the device itself

2205393
int	double
the compiler rejects what you wrote as nonsense because int and double may be objects with different sizes

2205393
int	double
this is potentially dangerous because if x and y are diffrent sizes let s say int is four bytes and double is eight bytes then when you dereference the eight bytes of memory at to fill in y you will access four bytes of x and four bytes of .

2205393
int	double
if you want to convert a int to a double use a static_cast and it will perform conversion

2205409
mouse	keyboard
you can use events filters on your mouse and keyboard events to filter some keypress or mouseclick when you need so

2205469
mouse	keyboard
this function can you call from either keyboard events of mouse events

2205471
16-bit	64bit
one thing i can say if it s a 16-bit application and your windows7 installation is 64bit vice 32-bit you re far less likely to succeed in getting it running

2205480
yacc	sablecc
sablecc is powerful yet much simpler to use than antlr javacc yacc etc

2205535
mamp	wamp
the best thing to get if you dont already have it is a wamp or mamp server to do testing on you

2205557
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
what you should probably do is compare your views which fields are displayed filtering sorting grouping etc. with each other and also with the view inside your web part

2205566
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
one option might be to write some kind of proxy that the httpwebrequest sends to maybe via the servicepoint and in that implementation buffer the entire tcp request

2205571
hide	show
consider the following example where two placeholders are show on-screen and we ll use jquery to hide them

2205598
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome

2205621
mouse	keyboard
the way i have right now is through calling a function in my main loop which queries the mouse and keyboard using getdevicestate in a nutshell and their respective arguments

2205637

2205983
fiddler	charles
for windows there is a program called fiddler that does exactly what you need so i did a google search for fiddler for linux and came up with charles

2205990

rather than pre generating the feed why don t you have a dynamic feed url which will pic your data from data source structure the data to rss format and then publish on request

2205990
rss	feed
for more info read here how to create rss feed

2205994
uiview	subviews
if the first uiviewcontroller s view is the web view then instead you ll want to change it back to a uiview then add the webview as its own ivar property as a subviews

2205995
rss	feed
rss feed have a pubdate element using which you can detect whether new entries are added to it

2205995
rss	feed
in .net you can use system.servicemodel.syndication namespace to parse rss feed

2206001
union	distinct
if you used a union then that may well be slower as it has to apply a distinct but union all doesn t have to do that so it should be no different

2206003
rss	feed
nb it s only worth doing this if you read from the rss feed more frequently than you regenerate the information

2206003
rss	feed
i m sure there s plenty of ways to generate an rss feed in .net

2206064
many-to-many	one-to-many
- more complex mappings - bidirectional one-to-many many-to-many inheritance embeddables

2206068
strcpy	strncpy
after this you can use the normal string copying functions such as strcpy or strncpy to copy the value in to test

2206075
strcpy	strncpy
you can use a string copy function like strcpy or even better strncpy which has also some size checks

2206094
memcached	apc
apc is good for caching the code that will regenerate pages when needed and memcached is definitely overkill if we re talking about a small ish application

2206108
consistency	acid
acid tanscations and backup consistency come to mind

2206111
stdout	stderr
this suppresses both stderr and stdout and puts them both into

2206111

2206115
pdfsharp	migradoc
i ve used migradoc pdfsharp for generating .pdf files to great effect

2206141
int	chars

and in any case this of course can t make much sense on a platform with int and double of different size since in case of larger double you will read beyond the memory occupied by x

2206233
tcpdf	fpdf
you can try fpdf or tcpdf

2206281
stdout	stderr

2206440
wordpress	vbulletin
i m redesigning the template for a wordpress based site which is bridged with a vbulletin forum

2206442
noscript	meta
you should be able to use a meta refresh inside a noscript tag though

2206493
folder	directory
the way i got round this previously is to just create a virtual directory in the local dev machine instance of iis and point it to the folder containing your web project

2206502
gif	png
convert this picture into a gif png

2206528
noscript	meta
it may not be valid but the meta -in- noscript hack as everyone s already posted and been voted down for really is the only way to do what you want

and everything seems to work fine except instead autocompletion working as i expect i get a pop-up dialog displaying the message

2206610
google-chrome	firefox
update the code below will return the full file path in ie but for security reasons firefox and google-chrome only give you the file name

2206614
put	get
you will have to get rid of the generics and then cast the values appropriately when using the get and put methods

2206678
inherited	properties
if it is that you re downloading via a stream then what you could do is to make a kind of meter which inherited from stream and exposes a properties that is a summation of the bytes read or written to it s underlying stream object

2206710
width	height
if you add content to a table cell and don t completely fix the width and height of the new stuff you might find yourself with unpleasing gaps all over the page and forgetting to open or close s somewhere with 200 validation errors on the original page you are likely to miss something somewhere may lead to a completely screwed view

2206725
integer	unsigned
a poker hand is represented as a 64-bit unsigned integer with a 1 bit for each card that is present in the hand

i did a little post on how to go about it also explaining how to get the cookie info into to you background script

2206815
profiling	debugging
unless you re doing a very memory intensive program in which it anyway would be more effective to overload allocators in specific places the main benefit of overloading the new and delete operators would be to track allocations and deallocations for debugging and profiling purposes

2206824
allocator	stl
try passing in an allocator with strategies so you can test which suits your needs the best similar to what the stl does

2206862
width	height
my only problem is that the natural behavior of the graphic is to have fixed width and height no matter how many items you have inside your graphic

2206867
inline	inlining
one strategy which compilers use to decide whether to inline is to keep inlining function calls until the resulting code is too big

2206867
inline	inlining
there s an obvious potential benefit in saving call overhead but as against that people don t really expect recursive functions to get inline and there s no particular guarantee that the usual inlining heuristics will perform well with recursive functions where there are two different places the call site and the recursive call that might be inline with different benefits in each case

2206882
dictionary	map
each key would map to a list of values or just one value if all your dictionary s had distinct sets of keys

2206913
komodo	aptana
as well as aptana which is great as suggested by marcgg you might want to try komodo edit or netbeans both of which are also excellent and multi purpose

2206943
ssl	https
as soon as i switch that over to https excel won t download the data anymore it s even a fully official ssl certificate so it s not a problem with a self-signed one

2207020

to answer the 2nd part of you question you could parse the jpeg file header to find the width height information without actually loading in the image

2207257
integer	unsigned
perform the actual squaring in a 64-bit unsigned integer

2207294
width	height
in imaging 1024x768 is simply the width height of the image so as others have mentioned you ve already shown the code that retrieves these numbers

2207296
nuxeo	alfresco
at the moment i am in doubth to choose between alfresco and nuxeo

2207337
maven	pom.xml
maven will compile the simple-weather project but as it has a parent maven will look the parent pom.xml file into the local repository

2207337
maven	pom.xml

lisp	prolog
so i encourage you with using a language designed for this kind of problem better suited to your application functional paradigm ex lisp logical paradigm ex prolog or something like that

2207684
for-loop	arrays
the naive way would be to simply search one arrays for each of the elements of the other arrays with a for-loop

2208082
post	get
there is lots of useful information returned available in either a get or post request

2208087
background-color	transparency
this works kind of as expected but background-color is transparency

2208104
post	get
you jquery can then get or post to a controller action which can return as follows

2208136
post	get
this will enable caching more agressively but you ll have to craft those uris and will still get hit by the initial post

2208145
implements	extends
you could also create an abstract base class that implements igrid that implements the setdefaults method and let projectmodel extends the abstract class

2208145
srp	principles
single responsibility principles srp only tells that a class should only have one reason to change which is a very vague restriction since a change can be as narrow and broad as you want it to be

2208145
getter	setter
a dto from a purist sense shouldn t have logic in it other than accessors getter methods which makes it strange that projectmodel itself has references to pagerhelper and sorthelper which i assume can mutate it they re setter

2208183
typedef	struct
it just acts as a typedef to the pointer of the struct

2208219
aggregate-functions	sum
i can use the function delta as an extracontext but also id like to include the sum of all delta results in the template in this case i have to make an aggregate but again since delta is not a db field nor a model field i cant use it in an aggregate-functions

2208235
superclass	subclassing
if that is the case then probably the best form would be to instead initialize it only in the superclass constructor and then invoke that superclass constructor in each subclassing constructor like super foo

2208360
post	get
get and post seem to be sufficient with appropriate verbs

2208360
xml-rpc	json-rpc
there s some benefit to xml-rpc json-rpc in that you kinda know what you re getting back but in any case if i cant easily parse your return type with json or something like php s simplexml and essentially serialize it to a consistent hash i m going to be pissed

2208375
post	put
option 3 put to some separated sub-resource is your best bet right now and it wouldn t necessarily be wrong to just use post on the main resource itself - although you could disagree with that depending on how pedantic you want to be about it

2208445
post	get
the get post etc describes the action verb so also putting it in the url makes it redundant

2208493
post	get
better way would be to have api user 7123 and use get post method to signify operations

2208497
pop-up	dialog
i have recently come to an instance where i want to pop-up a new dialog window which will host this usercontrol

2208498

for-loop	arrays
internally this array.contains method uses a simple for-loop to iterate over the arrays to compare the value

2208730
stateless	stateful
there is a server-side stateful component for each user so intuitively this will limit the number of users compared to a traditional application that is stateless

2208730
stateless	stateful
stateful programming on the server for web apps is far far easier that stateless

2208744
nunit	mspec
mspec is not like nunit in that it only executes the context made up of the establish clauses from the current class and all base classes and the because clause once followed by all of the specifications it clauses

2208757
hash	md5
or md5 company user articleid together and then index the hash that s created

2209072
maya	blender
in general what you ll want to do is use a modeling tool such as blender or maya to generate your models textures materials write out the data in some file format then write code or use existing libraries to read in your data and then display your data using opengl

if you haven t done any swing or swt development before i d give you about two hours before you feel like eating a bullet

2209527
put	get
put it together with a standard url decoder and you get errors

2209542
put	get
i get different errors when i try to put the field name in quotes or just leave it with a space as shown

2209569
bazaar	git
also consider using a distributed version control system mercurial bazaar git

2209603
int	double
there are several calculations involving dfreq so i didn t eliminate it entirely as it does save the cost of multiple run-time conversions from int to double

2209603
int	double
i would expect performance to increase because the int to double conversion would only occur when

2209631
jxtable	jtable
i will definitely suggest you to use jxtable for your tables instead of jtable

2209656
vraptor	spring
for java vraptor has a controller+view implementation similar to rails actionpack and uses a di container based on spring

2209748
int	chars
in the following code x represents a keyvaluepair and the aggregate is simply making a string of the chars int values

2209751
for-loop	loops
you aren t reinitializing the variable before the while loops starts like in the for-loop

2209799
svg	vml
solved - cufã³n is a font-replacement solution that relies completely on javascript and javascriptable languages svg and vml thus allowing the resulting element to be scripted like any other

2209805
wtl	atl
the ui architecture is currently implemented in wtl atl 3.0 and com

2209818
width	height
that is it should also be set as block elements or with set width height

2209827
ant	maven
just about every java project that i ve seen either uses maven or ant

2209827
ant	maven
sure you have to download make.exe if you use windows but ant and maven also don t come with the jdk

2209827
ant	maven
is it just because ant and maven are written in java

2209843
ant	maven
ant and later maven were designed to solve some headaches caused by make while creating new ones in the process it is just evolution

2209850
move	drag
when the user begins to drag the original item isn t actually move it s just hidden

2209859
ant	maven
ant and maven approach the build dependency graph and the management of it from a more modern view.

2209861
ant	maven
one of the major issues solved by maven and ivy-enabled ant setups over make is automated dependency resolution and downloading of your dependency jars

2209868
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to find this is use your browser s inspector google-chrome and safari has this built in firefox use firebug no comment on ie

2209927
ant	maven
ant and maven may be better suited to java than make or as hank gay points out they may not

2209927
ant	maven
however you asked if it matters that ant and maven are written in java

2209927
ant	maven
on rails we use rake c dudes use make and in java we use ant and maven

2209932
ant	maven
that s why alternatives like ant and maven rose up

2209936
public	protected
well the first difference that comes to mind is that an abstract class can not be instantiated but a class with protected constructors could be instantiated throw another public method

2209950
maven	pom.xml
i want to add jpoller.jar as a maven dependency so i edited my pom.xml file to include it

2210127
put	get
this way they get to figure out what they want before i ve put a lot of time into the rest of the system

2210185
quicksort	mergesort
so we wrote our own i wrote it and we did indeed gain good speedups i wrote a multithreaded quicksort and due to its partitioning nature it parallelize very well but i could have written a mergesort too .

2210195
children	parent
if you say parent have children you double up the children in the hierarchy because each of the children have to be under each of the parent

2210195
children	parent
it is often better particularly for what you are proposing to just assign attributes to each person for who their children are and who their parent are

2210206
post	put
if i can post another picture in the next post i will put the successful example

2210208
ant	maven
one big reason is that both ant and maven and most java targeted scm ci and ide tools are written in java by for java developers

2210208
ant	maven
this makes it simpler to integrate into your development environment and allows other tools such as the ide and ci servers to integrate portions of the ant maven libraries within the build deployment infrastructure

2210210
uiview	calayer
i don t think you can add a uiview subclass to a calayer object

2210269
lxml	beautifulsoup
use an html parser such as lxml or beautifulsoup to find all header elements

2210304
ant	maven
actually in your case i think that ant with maven ant tasks or ivy would be the best option

2210325
width	height
i m having problems finding the width and height of an image

2210455
sorting	filtering
i created a generic view which is imported as my_views.view which handles things like pagination sorting filtering etc.

2210549
noscript	meta
i haven t tested it and don t know if browsers will read the a meta tag within a noscript element in the document head

2210549
noscript	meta
according to this page hl en the meta refresh should work inside the noscript element

2210573
administration	activation
i m writing an account module which should take care of everything about accounts registration login logout user administration password recovery account activation etc

2210592
children	parent
often i deal with aggregate or parent entities which have attributes derived from their constituent or children members

2210621
ssl	ntlm
don t forget that unlike in case of ntlm user s passwords will be transmitted in clear text unless you use ssl to publish the web site

2210633
width	height
you could create a pdf form which implicitly contains width and height constraints and is easy for typesetting

2210641
post	get
take a look a curl which is generally available in a linux unix environment and which lets you script a call to a web page including post parameters say a username and password and lets you manage the cookie store so that a subsequent call to get a different page within the site can use the same cookie so your login will persist across calls

2210645
rel	attr
alert #serving_size attr rel

2210645
rel	attr
we are now using jquery object ref and finding if that obj has attr rel

2210645
rel	attr
alert this attr rel

2210650
post	get
usually you will need to scrape the login page to get the hidden fields and then post to the login page

2210653
uninstall	upgrade
does an upgrade get counted as an uninstall followed by an install

2210667
jdom	dom4j
on the other hand - graphml is in xml format so you can easily use jdom or dom4j to create a dom add the nodes based on your data an serialize it to an xml file

2210673
hide	show
i would like to know how to programmatically hide a file but making the file or folder still hidden with show hidden files and folders enabled from the tools- folder options of explorer

2210685
folder	directory
if the desired header file doesn t exist in same folder that u create your project u should add header directory in project properties as you said

http methods get post head put and

2210785
post	get
i think what a lot of people don t get is that your phone post back to the android market when you do an uninstall

2210795
google-chrome	firefox
check it out in firefox and google-chrome and ie8

2210832
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the not selector is only supported by modern browsers firefox safari and opera and not ie

2210840
post	get
it shows how to use the android libraries without external dependencies to perform basic get post etc

2210948
post	get
i m implementing a rest service endpoint in the app and want to be able to get and post to from the service endpoint using a shell script

2210948

multiplying	add
and you don t multiplying by two you just add the two variables

2210985
ubuntu	debian
use ubuntu or debian

2210994
imagemagick	im4java
take a look at im4java a java abstraction around the commandline interfaces of various imagemagick like tools including gm that feels like a language binding

2211057
executable	upx
in some cases we are using upx --lzma on executable but these do not scale very well on terminal servers where the non-packed versions are reused across sessions

2211059
super	abstract	super	implements
if your child class forgets to initialise the final through the super constructor the compiler will give a warning an error just like when an abstract method is not implements

2211073
centos	linux
here is repo configuration i ve used to upgrade php on centos 5 look for enterprise linux 5 in the text

2211106
accessor	ivar
perhaps you meant to access the ivar directly but in that case you have created very confusing code by mixing accessor and direct ivar access and violated the cardinal rule by using direct ivar access outside an accessor

2211122
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

2211130
children	parent
the method that the source queries returns a simple graph of objects a collection of parent where each parent has a collection of children

2211130
children	parent
the result is that childrenlistbox shows all the children of the parent currently selected in parentlistbox when i change the selection the values in the childrenlistbox change

2211130
children	parent
what i want is for this second listbox to display all of the children of all of the parent all the time regardless of what is selected in parentlistbox

2211149
mouse	keyboard
and if you want to support switching between keyboard and mouse in mousedown attach blur handler that restores those to default you ll need and closure over event target

2211150
jar	manifest.mf
compile and put it in a jar file with javassist classes and the following manifest.mf

2211187
google-chrome	safari
not sure why it doesn t work in safari google-chrome webkit but it could be because of this

2211207
inherited	properties
you are correct in thinking that you should create an abstract class to contain the common properties that s what inherited is for among other things

2211210
width	height
what you want is to multiply by the width height of your rows and cols like this

2211282
int	double
first no need to use double and floor call to compute int

2211301
rss	feed
set role-based permission settings for blog taxonomy aggregator and main site s rss feed

2211301
rss	feed
this module does not disable rss feed altogether rss feed created through the views module and others not listed here do not have associated permissions

2211301
rss	feed
rss permissions module lets you disable some or all rss feed based on different user roles

2211330
mouseup	mousedown
these two jquery statements will bind the mousedown and mouseup events to all of the elements within the page that have the text class

2211330
hide	show
then when mousedown happens it looks for the elements nested within that element with classes french and english and show hide them sets the css display property to display the language you want

2211386
128bit	64bit
it is a 128bit datatype as opposed to 64bit which is the size of a double

2211409
jobs	cron
you will still need to have something that kicks off rake jobs work but it is better than having lots of different cron jobs

2211465
realloc	calloc
i m struggling to use calloc and realloc for my array initializations

2211486
width	height
when running in the debugger the width and height properties of s are constantly zero and i can t change this no matter what

2211493
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
beware of sizes in malloc calloc and realloc

2211494
udp	tcp
the only option i ve seen for this would be to use luasocket and communicate via tcp or udp

2211516
coldbox	coldspring
if you work with coldspring modelglue mach-ii coldbox and other frameworks with xml configuration files cfeclipse s framework explorer is brilliant

2211596
width	height
for example i have a rectangle height 10 width 20

2211612
post	get
if anyone knows why the contenttype causes ajax post to fail in jquery i d love to get a deeper understanding

2211622
int	double
if you store the number 3600.2 in an object of type double some digits are used to represent the int part - 3600 and there is less digits representing fractions part

2211636
profiling	debugging
but not because the compiler optimizes it - rather because the code is easy to write debugging get correct parallelize profiling and decide which are the most important bottlenecks to spend time on possibly rewriting them mutably

2211693
rss	feed
what is the xpath expression to select elements with or rss and atom feed

2211693

verilog	vhdl	rtl	vhdl	rtl	verilog
it then synthesizes that c++ into rtl vhdl or verilog

2211714
altera	xilinx	verilog	vhdl
for hobbyists you re probably best off sticking with vhdl or verilog to describe your design and then using the free tools from xilinx or altera to synthesize that code and program the fpga

2211754
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in ie google-chrome but firefox shows me an exception at line 451 in recaptcha

2211780
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
for example while it make sense for a calculator service to expose add subtract multiplying and divide operations i would use another service to expose a getquote operation

2211815
int	chars
this whole thing has a chance of being legal for one and only one reason the 2d int array object is reinterpreted as an array of chars objects

2211820
realloc	malloc
realloc null size is equivalent to malloc size so you should replace your realloc with malloc

2211820
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you don t need to cast the return value from malloc calloc and realloc

2211820
strtol	atoi
atoi does no error checking if you have learned about strtol you should use that

2211829
post	get
i get this by simply adding the following line to any model and making a post to the corresponding action method

2211829
accessor	properties
targetinvocationexception properties accessor foo on object rolling_razor_mvc.models.contactusmodel threw the following exception bar

2211843
implements	extends
if you re invoking methods on an abstract class there must be a concrete class somewhere that extends abstractclass and implements the abstract methods

2211860
boost	stl
i am familiar with using info and man commands in emacs however boost and default stl do not come with man or info pages instead they come as html documentation

2211860
boost	stl
right now i am trying to put together w3m for quick searching of boost and stl documentation from local documentation directory

2211861
ironruby	ironpython
but with both ironpython and ironruby we ll fill in certain magical parameters

2211861

in addition after submission the question if i hit refresh it also doesn t call another form submit

2211939
debian	linux
works on at least debian linux windows solaris

2211988
rss	feed
you should be able to parse an rss feed using javascript which you can write using dashcode

2211988
rss	feed
here is a stack overflow article discussing the use of jquery a javascript library to easily parse an rss feed

2211998
int	boolean
assume each field is four bytes almost certain for the reference and int and plausible for the boolean add an extra four bytes for the object header and

2212025
put	get
bytebuffer works well for this just put in 64 long values and get a out using the array method

2212043
super	self
note that the above is also the reason why you should always assign the result of calling super s designated initializer to self

2212044
getter	setter
this would be like having direct access to your instance variables in a class bypassing getter setter breaking encapsulation

2212147
disk	ram
as long as you never have more threads using cpu time than you have cores you will have optimal performance but then as soon as you have to wait for i o there will be unused cpu cycles so you may want to profile you applications and see wait portion of the time it spends maxing out the cpu and what portion waiting for ram hard disk network and other io in general if you are waiting for i o you could have 1 more thread provided that you are primarily cpu bound

2212162
post	get
btw- i see you re using a post but for retrieval of data no updating or deleting the convention is get

2212229
alloca	longjmp
what i m currently doing is using alloca to push the stack pointer ahead by 768 kilobytes then spawning uiapplicationmain then using setjmp longjmp to bounce back and forth between my ui routine and my main routine

2212250
textinput	textfield
i set the focus to auotocompletelist at the time of adding this list as child but at the time of remove this popup i am getting whole text in textinput as selected with black background iwant to set the focus to this textfield but not to select whole typed text

2212275
modulation	pitch
i m attempting to add my own continuous pitch modulation vibrato to my openal object by assigning the sound s pitch to the path of a sine wave

2212275
getter	setter
this is my callback method which is repeating every 1 30 of a second as well as the getter and setter for the pitch

2212275
modulation	pitch
doing so would allow me to continue to control the base pitch using a uislider for example while the modulation effect can optionally and accuratelyoccur without affecting the base pitch

2212275
modulation	pitch
is there a way to compensate for the modulation to take place inside the method so that the effect can occur on a moving or movable base pitch

2212281
int	double
void initialize2d double m int m_dimension

2212281
int	double
where it comes to contradiction because you declared the variable m_dimension as an int and then you using it as a double

2212321
folder	dir
i know there s this installer available for windows but i think one needs to extract a tar file and replace the existing files in the ruby folder in the instantrails dir and some fine-tunings for it to work

2212348
int	double
in main file include macro header file twice one time with type defined to int next time with type defined as double

2212351
width	height
such as user can t upload a image which is larger than the allowed width height

2212355
webclient	httpwebrequest
right now i use either httpwebrequest or webclient to download files

2212356
domxpath	domdocument
its also posible with domdocument and domxpath

2212366
postgresql	mysql
now what is really happening is pdo is asking the database driver mysql postgresql ms sql oracle etc to prepare the statement but if the database driver cannot prepare it pdo will simulate that feature

2212430
gridview	sqldatasource
i d like all of my gridview to populate with data from my sqldatasource and all of my event handling code button clicks etc to continue to work

2212465
trie	tree
anyway the problem is every node is supposed to store a list of nodes so i can make my n-ary tree trie but i ve hit a snag.

2212532
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it worked for all browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome opera

2212532
opera	firefox
only worked for ie firefox and opera

2212532
google-chrome	safari
did not work for safari and google-chrome

2212532
google-chrome	safari
but it wasn t for safari and google-chrome

2212544
disk	ram
so you might need more ram faster disk for virtual memory and bigger cpu caches

2212596
mvp	presenter
for winforms you can implement your own mvp model view presenter or mvc model view controller patterns

2212660
post	get
post belongsto users when you retrieve a post you will also get data about user to whom this post belongs to posts.user_id users.id

2212661

2212823
mouse	keyboard
i d like to shutdown application when there hasn t been any input keyboard mouse from user for certain period of time

2212826
toolbar	tabs
another is to hide the tabs altogether notebook.set_show_tabs false and make a toolbar with buttons above the widget with your buttons on the left plus one button for each tab in the notebook that switches to that page

2212844
yacc	bison
looks like matz of ruby fame wrote a yacc bison mode

2212854
mouse	keyboard
to track a user s idle time you could hook keyboard and mouse activity

2212854
mouse	keyboard
getlastinputinfo retrieves the time in milliseconds of the last input event when the last detected user activity has been received be it from keyboard or mouse

2212858
post	put
here are the post and put requests

2212861
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
anyways my question is how do i keep the empty div s width at 32 in firefox at least and preferably safari opera and google-chrome

2212864
prepare	execute
as a side benefit using placeholders is also more efficient if you re-use your sql statement it only needs to be prepare once and no less efficient if you don t if you don t call prepare explicitly it still gets called implicitly before the query is execute

2212905
width	height
it s not the width that is the problem it s the height

2212913
ant	maven
i do not use maven ant or something like this.

2212920
portrait	landscape
i need to enter the data into that text fields in both portrait and landscape mode

2212920
portrait	landscape
i have done in portrait mode with help of willshowkeyboard notification and working fine.but same thing i have applied to landscape mode but it doesn t working fine

2212926
cout	cin
cin and cout are not guaranteed to use basic_filebuf far as i can tell. then just add virtual overflow and sync

2212944
width	height
or simply use the minimum width and minimum height options on the node

2212950
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my app in order to understand how autoreleased objects behave i have looped 10000 times this method in the - void applicationdidfinishlaunching uiapplication application function and also 10000 times the same method in - void tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller tabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

2212957
jar	manifest.mf
the recommended solution is to use the class-path line in the manifest.mf file inside your jar to point to required libraries relative paths are allowed and then deploy all files together and invoking it with java -jar your.jar

2212966
post	get
sounds like your login page should use post instead of get in the submit action

2213024
width	height
as said earlier we can use sizewithfont to calculate the height but it needs to know which font is used for what width etc

2213024
portrait	landscape
or what happends if we swap from portrait to landscape we have much more space yet it won t be used since we hardcoded 300.0

2213065
gridview	rowdatabound
my first linq query does successfully execute and display in a gridview but when i try to use a rowdatabound event to work with the results and refine them a bit i get the error

2213065
put	get
this interesting part is if i just try to put in a anywhere else in the same file i get the same error too

2213073
rtp	rtsp
it offers streaming support over the rtp and rtsp protocol rfc 2326 real time streaming protocol

2213075
pop-up	dialog
for any of the other 100+ java files in my workspace eclipse pop-up a dialog complaining editor does not contain a main type

2213083
children	parent
instead of consuming all the resource that it requires to maintain event handlers for those 100 children you could just assign 1 click event to the parent then use event.target to determine which one was actually clicked

2213083
children	parent
another nice thing about this approach is that you don t have to use live when dynamically adding additional children to that parent

2213100
put	get
if you have questions specific to media-players you should put that in a separate question this will improve your chances to get a more specific answer

2213125
folder	directory
or you could export your plug-in into a directory and then copy the directory into the dropins folder

2213127
width	height
the overprint environment only automatically determines the height of the content not the width

2213165
mouseleave	mouseenter
pass true to toggle in the mouseenter routine and false in mouseleave

2213165
hide	show
or do as suggested by the other answer and just use show and hide

2213207
addition	multiplication
you don t have to store zero values outside the bandwidth in that case but your operations like addition and multiplication become more complex to code

2213212
mouse	keyboard
use java.awt.robot an example here on the server side to simulate mouse keyboard events and invoke them from client side

2213234
implements	extends
he is being asked to implements some methods for a class that extends another class

2213251
width	height
you can also get the height and width of the jpeg from the image class and display it in its original dimensions

2213305
width	height
regarding the cell height you can check your tableview s width and if necessary subtract the margins by uitableviewstylegrouped and the width an eventual index bar and disclosure item which you look for in the data storage for your cells data

2213319
boost	log4cpp
the project contains dylibs for curl boost and log4cpp

2213322
fgets	feof
as you are checking in a do-while loop so the condition feof fp is never reached as you exit on checking the return value of fgets

2213337
ubuntu	debian
this looks close and i ve gotten the same type of setup to work on ubuntu 8.04 with ruby 1.8.6. since this is on debian it should be the similar

2213376
keydown	keyup
now i need to find the cursor position when there is a keyup keydown click event in the div

2213390
kohana	yii	codeigniter	yii	codeigniter	kohana
however if you want a php5 only framework as in written to take full advantage of php5 then i d suggest looking at kohana a php5 only fork of codeigniter yii or zend framework

2213425
kerberos	ntlm
i have configured the service correctly and ie will send a kerberos token starting yi.. but after adding the hostname to the network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris and network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris settings in about config firefox only sends an ntlm token

2213441

to remove the text and leave the image google-chrome and firefox works fine with this

2213444
google-chrome	firefox
finally in google-chrome the entire image is the link in ie and firefox only the text is the link so with no text the menu has no function

2213485
put	get
what i thought id do is get the file from the server put on my local machine edit the content upload to where ever an then delete the temp file

2213487
createelement	each
it almost seems a bit counter-intuitive but with most browsers building up a big string and then setting the innerhtml property of a container is usually faster than using the dom createelement function over and over to create each row and cell

2213490
int	chars
whenever you read multi-byte values like utf-16 chars or 32 bit int from a file since that file might have originated on a system with different endianness

2213515
x86	64bit
and don t forget to set your project s platform target to x86 or it will bomb on 64bit operating systems

2213568
vim	notepad++
editors vim notepad++

2213571
libjpeg	libpng
as adam suggests i would also recommend to use libpng and libjpeg

2213574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is already implemented in nightly builds of firefox google-chrome and safari on leopard and snow leopard

2213611
awt	swing
i know swing will automatically repaint as more of the image is read i m not sure how the awt canvas works

2213681
firefox	safari
the jpeg images that imageio generated view correctly on windows file explorer as well as safari webbrowser but in firefox the resampled images are clipped

2213714
allocator	stl
a nice example is the less used allocator parameter of the stl containers it tells the algorithm how to allocate memory

2213745
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
and the comparison of value seems to be case-sensitive there may be a way to make it case-insensitive but that i don t know

2213783
for-loop	loops
the problem is on the 3rd point when the execution moves back to the for-loop i need to block loops from continuing until the callback get called

2213804
free	malloc
pages are a lower-level concept than what malloc handles-- as a result the specifics of malloc free are all simply washed away as the whole thing gets cleaned up

2213820
nsmutablestring	nsstring
because nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring

2213821
folder	directory
and as driss says in the comments having a folder called resources in your project gives the iphone simulator a heartattack and crashes it from the looks of things without even copying your app bundle to the simulator directory

2213830
many-to-many	many-to-one
you should also know how to construct a many-to-one relationship using foreign keys and a many-to-many relationship using join tables

2213840
postgresql	mysql
the above concepts do not vary much between mysql sql server oracle postgresql and other relational database systems

2213864
hash	salt
the only thing that can be work is if we mention that the passwords are just hash without adding any kind of salt to prevent the replay attacks if it is so you must know the salt by the way get an dictionary attack tool the files of many words numbers etc

2213879
getter	setter
in other words the property has a setter but no getter it s write-only

2213900
getter	setter
see why getter and setter methods are evil for an interesting discussion of this

2213900
getter	setter
i typically do use setter but rarely use getter

2213961
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari a character is inserted but the cursor won t move to the right of it

2213961
google-chrome	firefox
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

2213987
mouseevent	mouseleave	mouseevent	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
strange enough for mouseevent like mouseenter or mouseleave handlers of both parent and child work

2214018
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
pip can install from subversion svn git mercurial and bazaar repositories

2214049
cdr	cons
usually the head iseq will be of type cons which stores a constant value in its first or car slot and another iseq in its rest or cdr slot

2214067
memcached	apc
you might want to look at apc or memcached to cache the results instead as it is not a per-user cache and it uses the memory instead of files

2214087
memcached	apc
however if you re attempting to cache a query that is the same for a larger number of users you might want to use something like apc or memcached that isn t tied to the individual user

2214089
filesystems	fat
it s not the filesystems which is almost universally fat or fat32 for these kinds of devices or even limitations in the windows driver although the limits are probably enforced there to avoid confusing the device but limited number of file descriptors in the device s embedded file access code

2214122
wicket	stripes
some recurrent names spring mvc stripes wicket

2214129
bluetooth	usb
if a usb device provider want to expose the device to a standard way most of them do conform to standards to save costs on develop document and educate clients about their apis their driver programmers can write drivers that make the device available to various windows apis massive storage wia directshow virtual serial port bluetooth human interface device etc

2214196
realloc	malloc
then the next time you call setname you end up calling realloc with a pointer that you didn t get from malloc

2214201
public	protected
alice removes the public key padlock with her key meaning the package is now protected only by the private key

2214275
hash	md5
the openssl library allows you to add blocks of data to a ongoing hash sha1 md5 then when you have finished adding all the data you call the final method and it will output the final hash

2214275
hash	md5
you don t calculate md5 on each individual block then add it rather you add the data to the ongoing hash method from the openssl library

2214275
hash	md5
this will then give you an md5 hash of all the individual data blocks with no limit on the input data size

2214300
hash	md5
with that in mind you don t want to combine two md5 hash

2214304
hash	md5
its worth noting that if for some reason you do want md5 hash of subsections of the file as you go along this is sometimes useful for doing interim checks on a large file being transferred over a low bandwidth connection then you can get them by cloning the digest object at any time like so

2214304
hash	md5
this does not affect the actual digest object so you can continue to work with the overall md5 hash

2214304
hash	md5
its also worth noting that md5 is an outdated hash for cryptographic purposes such as verifying file authenticity from an untrusted source and should be replaced with something better in most circumstances such as sha-1

2214345
hash-collision	key
also as sellibitze says an operator is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

2214371
folder	directory
i have created the uiwebview but want to know the best way of capturing the files when they are linked to in the webview and then download them to a specified folder in the documents directory

2214408
prepare	execute
now i know when a query using a prepare statement is execute twice in a single php script it s faster because the query is only parsed once once for each query

2214435
calloc	malloc
we can also use a variation of the malloc function called calloc

2214441
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning on bundler

2214465
pop-up	dialog
with the normal msvc debugger it just pop-up a dialog and exits with no chance to do anything or look at anything

2214470
nsstring	nsxmlparser
void parser nsxmlparser parser foundcharacters nsstring string

2214502
folder	directory
just delete all of the .svn files folder from the project directory structure

2214529
prepare	execute
each php process thread visitor that execute that same script again will not prevent mysql from re-parsing the query to prepare the statement as its valid in a per connection basis so its very effective for queries repeated in the same script

2214529
prepare	execute
now i cant argue about prepare + execute vs simple query performance wise w o repeated queries

2214577
int	double
rectangle2d is an abstract class that doesn t care if you re using int double or float coordinates

2214589
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i ve setting in httpd.conf to restrict access to .htaccess files for all sites and it s working for most of the sites

2214621
writetofile	nsdata
you can later decide what to do with nsdata you can save it to file on the documents folder using the nsdata writetofile method

2214649
packets	multicast
you need some centralized place to send the packets back out via a multicast or else you need a decentralized approach where every client is connected to every other client and each client is hosting a multicast

2214685
realloc	malloc
edit ok with the valgrind errors we can see that a you re passing something dodgy to printf if you compile with -g you ll get the exact line number and also you re calling realloc but not on a pointer you got back from malloc

2214767
children	parent
but something to consider is that in hierarchical data structures like the uiview hierarchy it s generally good practice for children to not know too many of the details of their parent where possible

2214790
super	implements
i m guessing since firstviewcontroller is one of the standard example classes created when starting a new tab bar based application in xcode that you haven t changed its super class or implements the methods of uitabeviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource

2214809
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs is a mac-friendly version of emacs

2214809
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs has the option to rebind option command and meta in various stages between native mac keybindings and native emacs bindings

2214823
children	parent
after importing data from a spreadsheet into children i need to get a list of parent having no children and for this i m using.

2214823
children	parent
but because referential integrity is not enforced i also need a list of children having no parent and for this i m trying.

2214824
backslash	double-quotes
enclosing it in double-quotes and added a backslash at the end

2214825
accessor	properties
so the events i attached to the properties in my ex classes never fired because the set accessor was never invoked

2214833
pull	push
only the most basic mercurial commands are subrepo-aware clone push pull update commit and perhaps a couple of others

2214851
comparator	comparable
i think the easy solution is to implement your own class for storing a node and make it comparable by implementing the comparator interface

2214863
integer	unsigned
you can t specify bits and raw bytes as tokens well maybe you could but i wouldn t know how and you can t coax them into read two bytes make them into an unsigned 16bit integer call it n and then read n bytes.

2214877
command-pattern	memento
the memento pattern would be used in conjunction with command-pattern it is not a replacement to the usage of command-pattern

2214923
serializable	deserialization
frequently the transmission web service or whatever code you re using will have its own handler for this data for example objectiveresource adds a serializable and deserialization handler that works as an extension to nsobject that enables it to do a lot of this stuff transparently and you might look into that code particularly the objectivesupport part if you re trying to do this more generically

2214980
superclass	subclassing
when you subclassing nsobject and add some instance variables you are for all intents and purposes simply creating a new c structure that contains your instance variables as slots in that structure concatenated on the slots for the instance variables for all superclass

2214980
superclass	subclassing
the modern runtime works slightly differently so that a superclass can have ivars appended without requiring all subclassing to be recompiled

2214983
google-chrome	firefox
this this was working for google-chrome but not firefox

2214983
google-chrome	firefox
this was working for firefox but not google-chrome

2214991
post	get
this makes it possible to always render some action as get no matter whether containing page is a post call

2215012
g++	gcc
when you get cygwin install the c++ compiler build tools gcc g++ make autotools etc

2215017
post	get
i ve tried a number of different things including what was outlined in this post how to repeatedly merge branches in mercurial but i just can t get it working

2215021
int	chars
if you compare two strings that each only have one chars then its a simple byte-wise and operation which may be faster than comparing a 4 byte int value

2215024
rss	feed
i know that it was previously possible to display your most recent facebook statuses on your website as an rss feed but it seems they ve changed their setup and i can t figure out where to find the feed anymore..

2215028
onkeyup	onkeydown
but for some reason onkeyup and onkeydown are not getting called

2215060
pthreads	fork
learn several technologies like plain old fork forget or manual multithreading java threads or pthreads mpi openmp bsp maybe even cuda or opencl

2215064
cvs	svn
svn cvs

2215085
easyhook	detours
also consider looking at detours commercial and easyhook free

2215091
haskell	ocaml
so while r is undoubtedly the best language for statistical computing i see some value in being familiar with another language like ocaml haskell or possibly clojure incanter

2215092
public	protected
so basically defining a field is as simple as typing in the access public private protected giving it a type string int string object and giving it a name

2215096
pascal	delphi
part of its inheritance stems from pascal and brings one of the features that delphi users have always loved in their compilation environment incredible compile speeds

2215169
google-perftools	tcmalloc
consider using of tcmalloc form google-perftools

2215174
x86	64bit
the x86 libraries are for 32-bit applications and the x64 libraries are for 64bit applications

2215175
x86	64bit
well the simple answer is that the x86 libraries are for 32 bit operating systems and the x64 libraries are for 64bit operating systems

2215207
put	get
you can put all of the possible numbers into an array and get a random index for that array

2215223
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
now we want to construct addition subtraction multiplication and division for this new numeric type

2215238
bazaar	svn
i ve started to use svn but then discovered bazaar

2215260
firefox	safari
i ve tried running on both firefox and safari in development mode and get the same result on both

2215273
superclass	subclassing
i got this question for homework and all i can think of is to return a subclassing of an abstract superclass

2215274
puts	gets
here is the code that gets the values from the jscript object and puts them in divs

2215320
versioning	upgrade
change gem versioning upgrade requirements run tests fix issues and commit

2215320
versioning	upgrade
i guess it would take at least one month before having the major part of my rails app ready for rails 3 thought i won t probably start the upgrade until rails 3 stable is out or i really need the new versioning for some blocking feature ex

2215334
width	height
i would venture to say your issue is in how you are assigning the new values of x y width and height to your rectangle object

2215344
int	chars
packed data types like float or decimal will not work those would require conversion to something suitable first such as int bigint or chars

2215348
subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo
in python though you will always get a positive number which is often more useful because it means you can do modulo addition and subtraction

2215382
pentaho	olap
not sure but what you re describing looks like an olap cube so maybe consider using a star schema or a snowflake schema and have a look at something like pentaho

2215505
expression-blend	silverlight
i currently have a silverlight app designed mainly in expression-blend using a border with a drop shadow effect encircling a rounded rectangle control

2215517
superclass	subclassing
that return a subclassing of a superclass as you mentioned java.util.calendar.getinstance

2215533
datediff	difference	min	max
following on from mark byers comment in tsql something like the following query would give you the difference between the min and max timestamps in milliseconds varying the first parameter of datediff would allow you to change the unit the total amount time is reported in

2215630
pull	push
you the app_start pull the values from the config file and push them to the specific part of the system not have it pull the config values itself

2215655
inherited	subclassing
if you are inheriting from a real view customview is a subclassing of textview you should inherited all the right functionality for laying things out

2215673
implements	extends
you can create it by extends the thread class or by implements the runnable interface

2215721
postgresql	mysql
ideally i would be able to keep the webapp code and swap out the db classes for something that would talk to another database mysql or postgresql is probably preferable to something like couchdb or mongodb but those could work too

2215732
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work correctly lines up on one line in firefox and ie but on google-chrome and safari it wraps to a second line at about 710px and i can t find a reason

2215732
google-chrome	safari
wrong google-chrome safari

2215769
subtraction	addition
you can then do some simple addition subtraction to calculate the calendar time with some error due to the time it takes to execute the api s consecutively

2215772
put	get
they get to put their seniors into the crosshairs

2215788
width	height
that demo was using an x and y offset that was defined in onsizechanged based on the height and width of the view

2215788
width	height
for a reason that doesn t make sense to me now i assumed that the width and height of the view would be limited based on the content that was being written in ondraw b c of setting the layout width and height to wrapcontent

2215788
width	height
however the width and height that was being passed in to onsizechanged was the dimensions of the entire screen

2215831
uiview	subviews
to get the effect you want you might try making your newsview a plain uiview then add the uiwebview as a subviews

2215853
wadl	wsdl
so wadl can be seen as a rest equivalent of wsdl 1.1

2215853
wadl	wsdl
wsdl 2.0 can be used to describe rest web services and thus competes with wadl

2215853
wadl	wsdl
so while wsdl 2.0 competes with wadl as rest web service description languages wdl 2.0 has more but lets forget that for now xrd is a metadata discovery format for any uri openid discovery being one of the primary use case

2215900
awt	swing
as i ve read webbrowser is an awt component while glasspane is a swing component

2215947
chown	chmod
you could change the user ownership of that folder chown and chmod it so that multiple users can access it

2215962
post	get
and the get and post actions look like this

2216012
portrait	landscape
is that how the landscape portrait transition works switching between two different images

2216018
int	boolean
in this case it will convert the int to boolean any int greater tan 0 will be true so if option has an int greater tan zero its equivalent to a true boolean value

2216104
superclass	subclassing
use super to call superclass s __init__ method then continue initialising the subclassing

2216245
getter	setter
most examples are something along the lines of write a fraction class that has getter setter and a print function which isn t very challenging coming from a c++ background

2216266
stdout	stderr
i don t want to print to stderr i want to print to stdout

2216276
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
visual studio only runs on windows so you would need virtualisation software vmware fusion or parallels or bootcamp

2216282
onresume	onpause
to return back to your application when the user hits the back button you might need to utilize onpause and onresume but i am not sure

2216287
post	get
if you don t want to move your object that is in your index.php have your ajax make a request to index.php but add some extra parameters post get that let your index.php know to process it as an ajax request and not return your normal web page html output

2216303
put	get
also you ll get transitions between different things if you put each part in its own activity

2216334
vbscript	jscript
i want to control the volume of my windows system from a jscript or vbscript script

2216341
uiview	uiwindow
i can place a uiactivityindicatorview on a uiwindow or a uiview by using interface builder like as follows

2216360
uiview	subviews
make the uitableview and the uiactivityindicatorview both subviews of a parent uiview

2216392
freebsd	linux	freebsd	opensolaris
five operating systems linux opensolaris freebsd windows mac os x

2216433
prepare	execute
assuming your code runs in a loop you can prepare the statement handler sth once outside the loop and run execute several times which should save some time if you have many inserts to do

2216470
min	max
the idea is to overide the onstatechanged event of the window cancel the min max constraints and refresh it

2216470
min	max
if the window is not maximized we simply apply back the min max constraints

2216517
stdout	stderr
this is a way of redirecting stdout and stderr away from the shell using the logging module

2216538
mouseover	mousemove
i think you should switch from mouseover to mousemove because it s a bit of a smoother effect

2216564
yacc	bison
it is also used by other programs such as bison yacc to tell you that the problem if there s a compile problem is related to your rules-file at a specific line which the compiler would otherwise be unable to do as the bison yacc generates c-files

2216613
width	height
but first time click change it to width height 100

2216613
width	height
but the second time click on the same button change them back to the width height 50

2216613
width	height
the third time change to width height 100 and so on

2216619
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine in internet explorer but not in firefox or google-chrome

2216640
mouseup	mousedown
if you want to track mouse in the whole view i think is will be easier to implement the mousedown mousemoved and mouseup methods in order to get the mouse events

2216688
getter	setter
additionally the getter and setter of attributes are often assumed from the model which may very well have been declared in an xml file somewhere rather than in code

2216725
strstr	substr
you can use strstr to get the substr starting with and remove the with substr

2216748
getter	setter
the compiler translates it to the appropriate setter getter method call

2216748
accessor	properties
other languages do of course use methods for properties accessor too however they hide this fact more consistently than objective-c

2216769
haskell	ocaml
also i wouldn t pretend this has anything to do with pattern matching in the haskell ocaml style

2216779
rss	feed
you could set up a cron job that checks the rss feed every x minutes and creates a tweet if it finds new items

2216788
implements	extends
- extends surfaceview and implements surfaceholder.callback

2216824
gif	png
then in the css you set the div s background-iamge to the png you want to use followed by a conditional comment to feed ie6 a transparent gif instead

2216929
put	get
i see there are some listing for http get put code but can t find any good parsers as well

2216952
getter	setter
in your templated implementations of the getter setter methods you d simply access m_array

2216987
mouseover	mouseout
change mouseover mouseout by

2217026
hide	show
you can set all these with a stylesheet then just use jquery to show hide the div

2217081
put	get
will it get laggy if i fetch 1 million link elements and put it in the dom

2217130
uitableview	uipickerview
i have already seen some attempts using uitableview and uipickerview

2217263
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the following shows the behaviour both google-chrome and ie are consistent i haven t checked opera in saying that domconfig is not a property of window but firefox claims it is but can t retrieve it copy paste into url field since i can t get markdown to give a link

2217281
accessor	ivar
you seem to be moving between accessor and direct ivar access which is very confusing and error-prone

2217281
touchesmoved	touchesended
that means if you get touchesended again before you get another touchesmoved you ll double-release the layer

2217285
apache	nginx
if you have a production machine set up i would recommend you to use phusion passenger with apache or nginx and set up different virtual machines or ports

2217289
int	double
if the key is the double type i cannot initialize it at all and even if i can theoretically assign an int to every possible input i have several tens of thousands possible inputs and i only actually use a handful

2217326
getter	setter
some methods called accessors we write very frequently these are methods of the form - int variable called getter and - void setvariable int newvalue called setter

2217331
getter	setter
the code will assume your abean follows the javabeans convention that is a property is defined by its getter and setter

2217331
getter	setter
the getter and setter respectively are of the form and

2217331
getter	setter
note the name of the property begins with a capital letter in the getter and setter methods while the bean property s name begins with a lower case letter

2217338
ssl	https
this uses ssl https for transport-layer security which handles the encryption aspect and passes a username password in the soap header which handles the authentication side

2217404
mvp	presenter
in the mvp case the standard is the presenter talks back to the view either through an interface databinding or through properties in the case of passive view

2217404
getter	setter
with passive view the properties are not using databinding instead the view property getter and setter are used to directly set the control value

2217404
post	get
the whole idea about this post is to get the same understanding of mvvm pattern in community

2217409
appendto	createelement
first i tried using createelement and chaining alot of those together with appendto and the like

2217418
post	get
should allow anyone to register using post but only registered members should be able to get a list of all users

2217459
free	malloc
it simply wraps malloc and free

2217477
allocator	stl
you will need to include and pass in an object as the stl object s allocator template parameter

2217480
mockups	balsamiq
that could look something like this used the web version of balsamiq mockups - what a fantastic invention

2217515
nsstring	nsdata
from there it is a matter of converting the nsstring to an nsdata and writing it

2217609
switching	screens
use levels of detail as much as you can -- low medium high versions of 3d models and switching based on distance from camera player - no point rendering a high-res version if it s only 5 pixels on screens

2217646
put	get
i am able to get all of the spacing to work by setting a topmargin but this doesn t allow me to put the username header in

2217684
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
but while some jms providers do offer such features mq weblogic jboss this is not a standard thing afaik for example glassfish openmq doesn t offer this

2217692
fgets	feof
however i have got into a conversation with someone who is saying that i am not understanding how fgets and feof work together and he s mentioning chunked encoding as a more efficient method

2217733
disk	ram
to minimize disk io and hence maximize performance i want to allocate memory to mysql so that the entire dataset including indexes can be kept in ram assume that the machine has ram in abundance

2217842
unsigned	short
unsigned short is 2 bytes

2217852
singleton	facade
if your set of c library routines is not too large you can try combining the singleton and facade patterns so that c library routines are only invoked via the facade

2217852
singleton	facade
singleton insures that there is only one instance of the facade

2217865
width	height
this is obviously a bit verbose and could be optimised a little with additional css classes allowing you to reuse the width height properties

2217957
hide	show
the jquery to make the submenus hide and show

2217982
implements	extends
i have written a jsp custom tag implements in a class that extends tagsupport and i d like to invoke another custom tag that was written as a .tag file

2218084
unsigned	short
unsigned short may or may not be 2 bytes

2218084
unsigned	short
if unsigned short is 2 bytes long you have space worth of len 2 unsigned short values

2218084
unsigned	short
or more generally you have space for len n unsigned short values where n is equal to sizeof unsigned short

2218084
unsigned	short
if however you want to combine sizeof unsigned short values into one unsigned short value then your best bet would be to calculate the numbers by hand

2218156
cout	cin
e.g to use cin cout defined in iostream

2218177
getter	setter
is there a way by which i can get a single test method for both the getter setter like testemployeeid testname so that in these methods i can test both my setter getter rather than using 2 diff

2218183
keyup	mouseup
in windows forms you can create an event handler for the keyup and mouseup events but there is no selectionchanged event

2218190
getter	setter
getter and setter are almost always trivial code which is not worth testing by themselves

2218207
getter	setter
and although i agree with the other poster than getter setter are pretty trivial - i think it is still worth testing them - to eliminate typos test property change listeners etc

2218221
google-chrome	firefox
this is using firefox and google-chrome browsers

2218223
getter	setter
if you have 100 fields in a class with corresponding setter getter i suspect your object model is not decomposed correctly

2218236
int	double
in your example treemap the key of the treemap has type double and the value referenced by this key has the type int

2218281
post	put
and then inside the post template aw_blog post.phtml put the following where you want the bookmark-things to appear

2218296
children	parent
also i should mention that all the elements i m working with are on the same dom tree level so there is no need to worry about parent children

2218360
stdout	stderr
the shell when it forks and then exec s these programs probably uses the dup2 system call to redirect stdin stdout and stderr to the appropriate pipes

2218360
stdout	stderr
this should cause inetd to fork dup the socket onto stdin stdout and stderr and then exec grep with foo as an argument

2218406
accessor	properties
try using an object and iterating via properties accessor for object in my objects and then use object.prop1 object.prop2 instead

2218441
width	height
your code will work if show_img has a width and height set

2218441
width	height
so at that point in time show_img has not been loaded yet so it can not get the width and height unless you explicitly set it

2218443
width	height
the images are probably not loaded when you try to take the width and height so you must bind a function to the load event of the document which will ensure that all images are loaded before executing

2218446
typedef	struct
a typedef is a type definition you re saying this name now refers to this type the name you give must be an identifier as defined by the language standard the type has to be a type specifier an already named type either base type or typedef d a struct union class or enum specifier with possible type qualifiers const or volatile

2218503
strcpy	strncpy
then you can use the standard c library function strcpy or better yet strncpy to copy the hello into it and then you want to concatenate using the standard c library strcat or better yet strncat function

2218560
udp	tcp
i would strongly suggest protocol buffers on top of tcp or udp sockets

2218582
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in ie6+ firefox google-chrome safari etc

2218733
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
some modern browsers firefox safari and opera but not google-chrome support the special back forward cache i ll call it bfcache which is a term invented by mozilla involved when the user navigates back

2218733
firefox	safari
for pages that need to know when they re being navigated away back to firefox 1.5+ and the version of safari with the fix for bug 28758 support special events called pageshow and pagehide

2218766
exif	xmp
as it turns out the windows imaging component wic used by bitmapmetadata reads writes many different types of metadata blocks including tiff exif iptc and xmp

2218766
exif	xmp
as i mentioned in the question i ve now built this library which correctly converts a very high percentage of the metadata properties from the tiff exif and xmp blocks

2218773
pop-up	dialog
i am creating a sand falling game similar to the powder game and i created a class called control to create a control bar at the bottom of the screen with a slider for brush size that works fine and a button to pop-up a dialog to allow users to pick the selected element

2218904
qcodo	qcubed
just set up firephp and using a framework called qcodo qcubed

2218915
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

2218915
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

2218915
keydown	keyup
thus you really need to hook on either the keydown or keyup events

2218923
google-chrome	firefox
but if firefox and google-chrome that alert message it would not show up

2218925
mouse	keyboard
this technique was commonly used by tsr programs rewriting the interrupt vector table to hook the keyboard timer mouse or similar and then terminate while remaining in memory

2218931
min	max
also what is the max and min number of comparisons that we might need to find the indexes

2218945
equals	gethashcode
if you re overriding equals then you should also override gethashcode as this is what the dictionary will use in the first instance to determine if two keys match

2218945
equals	gethashcode
any two objects of the same type that are considered equals should return the same value from gethashcode .

2218946
implements	extends
is-a means that the class extends from a superclass or implements an interface

2218975
post	get
one go get the list the way i need and manipulate the fullname on post

2219036
floating-point	integer
an integer we would hope would be 16 or maybe 64 bits but if it were to derive from the real number a real number has two integers in it a mantissa and a characteristics the exponent and they used they implied binary points inside them to make these floating-point number

2219057
idictionary	icollection
edit hmm idictionary does not implement icollection which is a bit of a pain

2219116
ironruby	ironpython
if you re familiar with c# and the .net framework ironruby and ironpython would give you access to all the classes you already know

2219137
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
essentially what it all boils down to is extending the tableadapter via a partial class with a begintransaction method which opens the inner sqlconnection and holds it open and hands you back a sqltransaction which you then use normally

2219149
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i have a complex set of data models that currently implement java.io.serializable and i have successfully serialized and deserialized them with objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

2219149
serializable	deserialization
however the result are binary files as expected and i was wondering if java supports serializable and deserialization in the same manner to a non-binary format such as xml

2219149
serializable	deserialization
i see that c# has this feature xml vs binary performance for serializable deserialization

2219157
cos	sin
starting from the top-center point move relative 1 2 top width x sin angle 1 2 top width x cos angle - that gets the top right corner point

2219157
cos	sin
continue around the rectangle using the sin and cos of the angles and widths as appropriate

2219169
range	minimum
this measure certainly has a maximum and a minimum so then it could be mapped to some desirable range like 0-100

2219238
post	get
map this servlet in web.xml by an url-pattern so that you can call it by a post form or maybe just by a get link replace dopost by doget then

2219252
libs	buildpath
this way the server s libs will be automagically added to the project s buildpath

2219286
multiplying	subtract
adding subtract and multiplying numbers with an absolute value 1.0 can only result in overflow

2219310
factors	matrix
the pca method is pretty close to just taking the svd and getting rid of the singular values by factors them into the u and v matrix

2219318
struts	wicket
actually since it supports multiple web frameworks spring mvc struts wicket etc one use case for your performance testing could involve testing with each one to compare different types of functionality

2219351
spaces	delimiter
okay i ve got the program working fine now as long as the delimiter is a spaces

2219402
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore the framework that has bespin and mobileme among others will also support commonjs and 280 north the makers of cappuccino employ some of the main narwhal developers

2219412
firefox	safari
of course it works fine in firefox safari

2219414
many-to-many	many-to-one
there are many examples of style filters in the many-to-many and many-to-one tests

2219424
pull	push
using merge to merge master changes to the feature branch git push pull and once mature do a single rebase in one or more commits cleanly

2219432
width	height
but i m coming unstuck when i attempt to remove the hardwired width and height settings from the first line.

2219479
children	parent
when the mouse leaves the parent element i want to hide the parent and it s children

2219479
children	parent
i really only want the event to fire when the mouse is not within the parent or any of it s children

2219484
range	max
compute the above 5 equations of the next step for all combinations of î ï 0 î max x -ï max 0 ï max only 6 combonations and 5 equations for each so shouldn t take too long and since they are run so often the rather restrictive range will be amortized in the end

2219484
backtracking	greedy
it s a greedy algorithm that by its very nature can t backtracking

2219527
firefox	safari
in firefox safari clicking view will allow you to see more details on the product on the right

2219545
integer	unsigned
more 16-bit unsigned integer values

2219570
postgresql	mysql
we had previously been using mysql which has a policy on case insensative searching however postgresql seems to lack this

2219586
bimap	hashmap
google collections supports bi-directional hashmap see bimap

2219637
implements	extends
the reason why i am asking is because afaik if i need to use attributes then i should be implements or extends the asp.net membership providers

2219690
spaces	delimiter
the program only needed to work with a spaces as a delimiter character

2219690
spaces	delimiter
i just turned it in and got full credit but after turning it in i realized that this program only worked if the delimiter character was a spaces

2219694
children	parent
i have a parent program pojo with a many-to-many relationship with their children subscriber

2219720
many-to-many	one-to-many
i think you should have either a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between operation and equipment depending on whether there is one equipment entry per piece of equipment or per equipment type

2219818
floating-point	fractions
rounds a double-precision floating-point value to the specified number of fractions digits

2219823
width	height
if you can give it hints ahead of time through the use of fixed size width height elements then the browser doesn t need to figure anything out and it can draw the elements as they are downloaded

2219840
floating-point	fractions
rounds a double-precision floating-point value to the specified number of fractions digits

2219867
public	protected
protected internal - you cant bind to a non public property

2219879
getter	setter
...via a public accessor getter setter member function

2219882
post	get
you can use an ugly type-casting hack but it s so ugly that i m afraid to even post it not to get downvoted

2219887
versioning	upgrade
if they are on versioning 1.9 they get upgrade to versioning 2.5

2219952
unsigned	short
the function print of namespace freetype has the 4th argument as const unsigned short so i typecasted it

2220083
stdout	stderr
i also need to store the stdout stderr and return code of each completed processes

2220112
post	put
if it s going inside a section then it will be applied to all pages you want to put the and its contents inside the sections there ll be the listing page and individual post pages - the sections should already exist in the aw_blog.xml file

2220118
pull	push
and to better manage the push and pull of parts of your global repo to a private one i would recommend the git subtree script tool

2220119
min	max
once you have used this to find one of the values perform two more slightly moded binary searches using the min and max you currently have to find the tips

2220119
min	max
note there is no early return using this method you just keep going until min and max are like one or something apart i suppose you could add one with another check

2220188
google-chrome	safari
how do i print an iframe from javascript in safari google-chrome

2220188
opera	google-chrome
print iframe content in opera and google-chrome

2220204
width	height
the width and height properties won t be set because you haven t explicitly set them

2220204
actualheight	actualwidth
it s actualwidth and actualheight you want which are set by wpf

2220204
actualheight	actualwidth
the controls haven t been laid out yet so actualwidth and actualheight will be zero

2220204
actualheight	actualwidth
use dispatcher.begininvoke to run the layout logic in a separate message that runs at a lower priority to layout thus ensuring the actualwidth and actualheight have been calculated and assigned

2220219
put	get
if you need to put together a report or something combining data from a mainframe system with external data sources it may be easier to get the data off the mainframe and do the integration elsewhere - perhaps some sort of data mart

2220230
g++	gcc
this piece of code works well with my g++ compiler but gcc gives a error saying lvalue required as left operand of assignment

2220234
keydown	keyup
just remember that for keydown and keyup you ll have to keep track of the case using the e.shiftkey state

2220277
google-chrome	firefox
tested the above which probably needs tuning with google-chrome and firefox

2220291
mouse	keyboard
isenabled is a good solution however i only wish to disable keyboard interaction and leave mouse interaction intact

2220294
cfstring	nsstring
the easier but a bit more inefficient way is to store it as an nsstring cfstring using cfuuidcreatestring and recover the uuid with cfuuidcreatefromstring

2220298
mouse	keyboard
however i think a control that responds to mouse clicks by not keyboard is buggy not everyone prefers to use the mouse

2220323
children	parent
2 you want to seek through each instance and result children inside parent trip whose values are not null

2220329
post	put
only two ways that are valid are either to put the whole resource with the sub data modified or post to that resource or put to a sub-resource

2220335
post	put
of course you could theoretically put them into the same post table and have a posttypeid for comments

2220389
for-loop	arrays
in the above code i ve to parse the elements of arrays in a for-loop and then have to put the substring key and class_name into a hashtable

2220397
rss	feed
i am new to iphone development.i want parse an you-tube xml page and retrieve its contents and display in a rss feed

2220493
solaris	bsd
you probably need gnu make and not the traditional bsd make shipped with solaris

2220499
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
final solution working in ie6 7 8 firefox opera google-chrome and safari

2220568
bindparam	pdostatement	prepare	pdostatement	prepare	bindparam
secondly when in a loop you can save yourself time and resources if you re running the same query over and over by preparing the statement and then only changing the values you send to to that prepare statement using the pdostatement bindparam function

2220583
post	get
i ve been googling for some vb.net code to authenticate to a web server with the post method receive a session id in a cookie and then send this cookie along with all get queries.

2220589
gmail	hotmail
i want to import address book of users from their gmail hotmail yahoo and aol address books

2220643
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox everything is fine

2220650
uiview	subviews
i thought a good approach would be to have one uiview that acts as the top visible part the gauge s window if you will and a subviews that just draws the dial with the values and markers

2220684
nstextview	nstextstorage
you should add your controller as the delegate of the nstextstorage object of the nstextview and then implement the delegate method â textstoragedidprocessediting

2220684
nstextview	nstextstorage
in the delegate method you need to get the current nstextstorage object from the text view using the -textstorage method of nstextview

2220714
webkit	gecko	opera	safari
you may find it preferable to check for gecko ie webkit opera explicitly and redirect everything else to your mobile site - that way you re maintaining a smaller ua regex plus you d be catering for the mobile safari iphone ipod touch by keeping them on your main website

2220716
udp	tcp
if it is allowed by the protocol but is generally not done by tcp udp implementations could you point me to the relevant portion in the linux source code that proves this

2220716
udp	tcp
are there any implementations of tcp udp on some os that do send multiple packets on a single ip packet

2220814
pseudo-class	visited
you may need to add the a visited pseudo-class to in your css

2220814
pseudo-class	visited
to ensure correct style compatibility with older browsers it is recommended to define the a visited pseudo-class

2220839
wicket	stripes
i would advise you to look at stripes wicket or play i never used it myself though

2220874
spaces	delimiter
will select elements whose classname has the word main delimiter with spaces

2220923
cos	sin
sin 2 theta 2 1 2 cos zero - cos theta 0.5 - 0.5 cos theta

2220974
width	margin
a block element will by default have some margin around it and will assume 100 width unless specified or floated

2221037
redhat	fedora
in fedora redhat or similar it would be yum install perl-cgi-session

2221058
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have used smoothdivscroll and jflow it worked perfectly on firefox google-chrome safari opera etc

2221080
tinyint	boolean
fyi boolean is an alias for tinyint 1

2221218
division	subtraction
repeated subtraction is a dangerously inefficient way of doing division

2221249
setinterval	settimeout
i think you have to use settimeout and not setinterval

2221294
getter	setter
it has ugly and inconsistent api - annualcalendar has getter and setter that takes arraylist monthlycalendar has getter and setter that takes boolean both of them just expose class internals

2221436
versioning	upgrade
however i want to force the upgrade whenever i upload a newer versioning because the upgrade will have more features and i want to discard the previous versioning

2221438
debian	linux
i know linux distributions like debian have simply an i686 which is enough

2221476
width	height
in other words i want to flip the rows and columns but keep the same width and height of the new array

2221493
post	get
also you made a typo in method post that s why it doesn t get submitted as post data

2221504
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	mp3	ogg	aiff	ogg	wav	aiff	wav	ogg
its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

2221603
children	parent
you need to check that the parent is actually the target of the mouseout event as opposed to the event bubbling up from one of the children

2221618
integer	unsigned
c99 defined a standard 64-bit integer type named int64_t and unsigned version uint64_t in stdint.h .if you want to provide portable code you should use them but not __int64

2221618
integer	unsigned
notice there is no standard 64-bit integer type in c++ programming language msvc use __int64 but in linux world you normally use int64_t or uint64_t which is type defined as long long or unsigned long long in c99 s stdint.h .here i assume your c++ compiler support the stdint.h header file

2221699
width	height
the jeditorpane cannot compute its final preferred width and height simultaneously it has to know one before it can compute the other

2221699
width	height
on the first pass the jeditorpane computes its preferred height based on the assumption that its width will be unlimited so it returns the height of a single line since the text contains no line breaks.

2221764
implements	extends
we can now create an interface for the banners table objects which implements our irepository and a concrete class extends the abstract repository class and implements the ibannerinterface

2221775
versioning	upgrade
however that is much different from designing the app from the start to force users to upgrade every time the developer releases a new versioning

2221778
width	height
they re there for your custom fields to override with whatever your custom field s preferred width height is

2221783
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome opera but not in ie8

2221787
postgresql	mysql
as the application can be configured to use either postgresql or mysql and questions were raised about comparative vulnerability i tried out both databases and tested each configuration with some sql injection attempts

2221793
rsa	aes
an aes key encrypt the data with the symmetric algorithm with k then encrypt k using the rsa keys of all the receipients

2221838
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have written a code which works on almost all major browsers firefox opera safari but doesn t work in ie7

2221847
postgresql	mysql
but that s shouldn t be a reason to use mysql over postgresql since you can still inject by using subqueries

2221857
post	get
last.fm submissions api relays on http 1.1 get and post

2221859
g++	gcc
g++ -shared -framework opengl -framework appkit -framework cocoa -lobjc -lstlport -framework coreservices -lstlport build lib obj gcc so -l

2221860
hide	show
you can hide the content that may not be visible using css display none and show it when you press a button

2221876
int	chars
when you use to read input it will leave unread chars in the stream those that couldn t be converted to int at least the return chars you type to enter input which the following getline will consume thinking it has already read an empty line

2221884
cairngorm	flex
i m new to flex and cairngorm so bear with me.

2221889
telerik	radcombobox
so when autopostback true and onselectedindexchanged fires after it s code telerik skin acts and finally i lost my radcombobox focus .

2221931
post	get
when i perform a post to get the submitted results my action method takes the strongly typed viewmodel back but the original summary object that i used to create the list is not populated

2221989
width	height
this way you place .div2 right under .div1 with absolute positioning and extend its width and height just like you want to the width and height of the container

2221995
hide	show
i want to just show a and hide b

2221995
hide	show
sometimes i want to just show b and hide a

2221999
versioning	upgrade
instead they force you to issue a lite versioning with the option to upgrade to a full and or pro versioning

2222019
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and internet explorer probably opera too any text inside the input will be vertically centred

2222044
put	get
and if i was to put the class definition into a module called foobar i would get

2222118
google-chrome	firefox
it works as expected in both firefox and google-chrome

2222160
postgresql	mysql
to begin with go with either mysql or postgresql my preference

2222181
int	boolean
without option strict on vb.net is happy to implicitly convert boolean to int

2222224
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian xml_grep is in the xml-twig-tools package

2222235
hide	show
when you receive your json results back you just set the properties of the html tag and show hide your detail pane

2222322
folder	directory
then i created a virtual directory in my default web site the folder appears there as it s on wwwroot and created the application and allowed scripts executables permissions

2222330
mouse	keyboard
map mouse keyboard input to the displayed texture and hand that off to webkit

2222365
mouse	keyboard
in one post it is stated the office apis all assume you are running office in an interactive session on a desktop with a monitor keyboard and mouse and most importantly a message pump. i m not sure what that is

2222383
hash	salt
i realize we ll probably not need a randomly generated 30 character salt to create our password hash or irreversible encryption in bcrypt s case for years

2222464
client-side	server-side
consistent api for client-side and server-side

2222464
freemarker	velocity	xstream	jackson
integration with many popular technos freemarker velocity spring jackson xstream jaxb atom odata wcf data services etc.

2222471
put	get
you have to get to the guts of the plugin and find a place to put a callback function that would trigger your onchange actions

2222488
getter	setter
there should be fairly obvious parent-child relationships that you can describe by having your node classes own or somehow return an array of child node classes and the attributes as getter setter

2222491
hex	binary
zoc terminal has extensive trace features it can show hex dumps control characters and binary logs

2222506
children	parent
to my knowledge there is no css attribute to limit the width of a parent to the size of its children

2222506
width	margin
when you apply margin to body it does not affect the width of the page and you always end up with a scroll bar across the bottom

2222523
hide	show
everytime i make a new selection a table element must show or hide depending on my selection

2222569
put	get
even if i hardcode the numbers in i do not get 80 even though i do when i put it into my caclulator exactly as seen

2222673
hash	md5
when the client wants to initiate a secure connection he sends his username md5 hash of his password and a hash of a random uuid all of which has been encrypted against the server s public key

2222677
folder	directory
in iis manager go back to the folder in question and double check the setting on the directory tab of the folder virtual directory in question

2222699
min	max
some of the headers in visual studio #define min and max

2222699
put	get	min	max
to get around that put parentheses around min and max

2222709
getter	setter
in mytype.java i have a load of setter and getter all of which either assign string s or s

2222715
return-value-optimization	nrvo
as it s written right now this depends on your compiler implementing the named return-value-optimization nrvo

edit the upcoming eigen 3.1 allows some functions to use the intel mkl or any other blas lapack implementation

2223017
post	get
windows comes with winhttp which does support get and post

2223046
versioning	upgrade
i ve seen something like this when i upgrade a library but neglect to remove an earlier incompatible versioning from a path visible to netbeans

2223118
teamcity	nant
teamcity can be configured with different build systems too nant msbuild et al

2223136
g++	gcc
gcc g++ and the other frontends use filenames to determine language

2223136
g++	gcc
for example the only major difference between gcc and g++ is one that bites new c++ programmers different link settings for the c++ stdlib

2223144
g++	gcc
g++ should be the front-end for c++ and cc for c but both point to gcc

2223153
fortran	ada
the program gcc is a driver which can dispatch to a c a c++ an ada a fortran a java and probably other compilers depending on what is installed and the extension of the file

2223159
maven	cargo
the cargo maven plugin would allow to do similar things in a container agnostic way but it might be a bit harder to setup at least for advanced use cases

2223164
range	max	range	min	min	max
you have to use string functions to determine if the tol is a percent and act accordingly to calculate the min and max range for that field

2223180
gif	png
it will allow you to load and store images that were encoded in basically any known format png and gif included and allow you to efficiently operate on the images once they ve been loaded

2223181
pascal	delphi
my preference would be to build directly from the pascal source in delphi 2007 for .net although i ll use newly-built assemblies if necessary

2223203
width	margin
exactly i don t want to put presentation information in my html but i hoped i wouldn t have to just take the css classes that make up the grid system apart and apply the relevant parts like margin 0px and width 960px since that is bad from a maintenance and reuse angle

2223208
firefox	safari
the firefox browser shows the images clipped no matter how they are accessed so i guess this is no longer a perl problem but the safari browser displays them completely

2223223
findwindow	shellexecuteex
use findwindow in your mfc application to try to locate the external application and then only run shellexecuteex if it doesn t already exist otherwise activating the existing window

2223259
codeigniter	cakephp
if you re build an app from scratch i would recommend using a php mvc framework package like cakephp or codeigniter

2223259
postgresql	mysql
the beauty of this is that it also allows you to change your db type later from mysql to say postgresql with a simple configuration change

2223330
goto	break
a while loop can be terminated when a break goto return or throw statement transfers control outside the loop

2223381
g++	gcc
for gcc g++

2223405
superclass	subclassing
the point of polymorphism is that you can subclassing a class and the objects implementing those subclassing will have different behaviors for the same methods defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclassing

2223477
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
instead static members belong to the class and as a result overriding is not supported because subclassing only inherited protected and public instance members and not static members

2223481
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2223482
explode	substr
or substr or explode whatever you wish to parse that string

2223495
width	height
the width and height it takes as arguments are ints for the pixel dimensions

2223506
hide	show
the above code show image related to text box which has focus and hide rest of the all three images at the same time

2223506
button	checkbox
there is not only the text boxes but also group of radio button select boxes and group of checkbox too in between text boxes so when focus comes to these radio button or select boxes or checkbox the related image to them should get visible

2223515
width	height
gridplaceholder is a div on the page to put the grid into just add an empty div to contentpane and make the style of the contentpane to be width 100 height 100

2223540

2223600
kde	gnome
any ideas on alternate ways to do this that will work in both gnome and kde

2223631
cos	sin
also what about functions i have seen all over some f# code like cos sin etc

2223650
int	chars
i didn t realize that i was saving a chars value as an int value

2223670
int	double
the filesize of test.bin is 16 bytes which i guess is 4+8 int + double

suppressfinalize	finalizer
it then uses suppressfinalize to make sure the finalizer isn t called

2223777
mouseover	mouseout
i want to bind that same function instead to the mouseover and mouseout events

2223777
mouseover	mouseout
i m also using the click handler for other parts of the page - i only want to move it to mouseover and mouseout for one menu

2223796
accessor	properties
there re only add and remove accessor for event properties

2223800
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome also supports it and i assume safari does as well

2223812
hide	show
you want to control the show hide behaviour of images according to which input has focus

2223823
post	put
they have a feature called bugzscout which is essentially an http address that you do a form post to with cfform with all of the same information you would have put into the email

2223827
folder	dir
i think i got 1.8.7 working - i basically downloaded the zipped up file not the installer one i extracted it then i copied pasted the extracted to overwrite the files and folder in the ruby dir in instantrails

2223894
rss	feed
otherwise just use the stackoverflow rss feed

2223910
punctuation	words
edit each words and punctuation mark counts as one token

2223912
post	get
according to this this so post you may be able to get around this by telling xcodebuild to assume the target is the iphone simulator instead of the actual iphone with the -target command line option

2223941
min	max
min 0 and max 1 i did reduced the number times the app seem to be running down to two previously using min 0 and max 10 it was running it seemed like 18 copies

2223987
jquery	curvycorners
that said curvycorners is a jquery plugin that looks for those proprietary css declarations and will create image free curved corners in ie6

2224012
imperative	declarative
i m not interested in any potential performance cost just the potential of using declarative approaches in what is traditionally imperative code

2224085
getter	setter
the combination getter and setter you ve defined doesn t fit ruby conventions

2224092
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
as an optional assignment i m thinking about writing my own implementation of the biginteger class where i will provide my own methods for addition subtraction multiplication etc

2224105
executable	upx
it s not really a patcher it s upx - the ultimate packer for executable

2224107
width	height
as you can see the scrollpanel is a scrollwindow defined to have a height of 100px and width of 200px

2224134
addition	multiplication
a multiplication roughly doubles digit numbers addition increases it by at most 1

2224144
getter	setter
i would like to be able to transparently convert hexadecimal uuid into binary for the setter method and back when i use the getter method

2224158
post	get
i am trying to send a get or a post through a command-line argument

2224172
mouse	keyboard
like for example flash and others where you go to a site with a game and it will ask you to install a certain plugin and then you can play the game in the browser with mouse and keyboard input

2224175
macports	homebrew
i recently ditched macports for homebrew as a result im now experiencing some issues with make

2224186

2224219
rss	feed
i use minidom to extract content from the rss feed

2224219
feedparser	beautifulsoup
i also tried using feedparser and beautifulsoup but they did not work for me

2224242
post	get
check for get and post scripts in your system

2224273
pylons	turbogears
turbogears and pylons are both capable of this rather than doing it yourself or using third party apps

2224276
hide	show
and with javascript you show or hide the form you want the user to see

2224276
hide	show
or even you build a single form and you show or hide some additional fields between the 2 states

2224304
cpython	ironpython
the version of cpython you re importing from must match your ironpython version

2224304
cpython	ironpython
use cpython v2.5 for ironpython 2.0 or v2.6 for ironpython 2.6

2224305
mouse	keyboard
you can get an opengl program up in a few minutes by deriving from qglwidget it will create the window context handle mouse and keyboard input etc

2224317
mouseover	mouseout
if you want a mouseover mouseout handler use hover like so

2224332
switching	screens
i have issues with this as i do not think it is accessible if the switching is done via ajax without page refresh then how does a screens reader user know which tab form they are on

2224336
openedge	dsn
3 i provide a connection string and dsn for a 32 bit progress openedge 10.2a odbc driver that i ve set up

2224337
mockups	balsamiq
i use balsamiq mockups

2224338
youtube	vimeo
which is what every ok so not every but the vast majority video sharing site does youtube break vimeo etc

2224358
put	get
combining the two content types in one table lets you put a single index on the date field allowing faster querying though remember you can get a similar benefit from indexed views

2224386
google-chrome	safari
it seems that the css -rounded corners style works on some parts of my stackexchange site s - sf answers phonehow.com and not on others - it displays correctly in google-chrome but not in safari

2224405
public	protected
class methods may be defined as public private or protected

2224412
hide	show
use javascript to remove the text you want to hide and reinsert it on show

2224412
hide	show
if you need more control of the display value used for show and hide you can use a css class

2224414
post	get
assuming you require to send the post request asynchronously you may want to check the example below to get you going in the right direction

2224427
imperative	declarative
i m reading functional programming by tomas petricek jon skeet and i understand the difference between declarative imperative programming

2224427
imperative	declarative
what i was wondering is how are the primitive operators functions implemented are declarative languages constructed from imperative operators functions

2224447
imperative	declarative
there are imperative turing-complete languages and functional declarative turing-complete languages

2224452
imperative	declarative
strangely enough most imperative languages go through a phase where all the code is transformed to be more declarative

2224460
ncover	fxcop	ncover	nant
i used to use cruise control.net nunit fxcop ncover xmlpreprocess nant and a few others before transitioning to tfs where i am doing alot of sharepoint development

2224532
installation	upgrade
i have an installation of asp.net mvc 2.0 rc1 which i am planning to upgrade to the newly released rc2

2224543
setinterval	settimeout
it s true you don t want to use setinterval and settimeout in the way you ve described

2224543
setinterval	settimeout
while you can use setinterval and or settimeout with calls to settimeout again in the function body to poll for a success code that approach is dramatically inferior to just handling the callback in the first place instead of polling for it

2224552
google-chrome	firefox
the 4 tabs line up fine in firefox 3.6 ie8 and google-chrome but when i checked it out using virtual pc with ie6 and ie7 the tabs are all crooked

2224605
addition	multiplication
carry is a single bit for addition and element-sized for multiplication

2224627
implements	extends
it is implements as a class that extends view and is annotated with remoteview

2224678
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the opacity property is the css standard for opacity values and works in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

2224680
maven	pom.xml
make sure that you ve created a new maven project in netbeans and not just a java desktop project these don t recognize the pom.xml

2224686
salt	md5
for password storage i suggest using md5 with a salt

2224698
getter	setter
since this is within my package this seemed like an ok way to do things given that those fields aren t going to be visible from outside of the package and it seemed to be unnecessary to make things private and provide getter and setter

2224698
getter	setter
should i provide getter and setter even when i know exactly what will be getting and setting my fields and i m not worried about someone else writing something that will break my code

2224734
getter	setter
most java developers will prefer to see getter and setter

2224734
getter	setter
maintaining getter and setter may take a little more time but offers a lot more safety plus

2224734
getter	setter
you can refactor your code any time as drastically as you want so long as you don t break your public api getter setter and public methods

2224747
getter	setter
i would adhere to a common style and in this case provide setter getter

2224747
getter	setter
a lot of java frameworks assume getter setter conventions and are tooled to look for these expose them interrogate them

2224747
getter	setter
if you use setter getter you can easily refactor what s behind them

2224752
webrat	cucumber
this error can also occur with webrat cucumber when filling in form data using a table

2224753
hash	salt
store a salt hash

2224756
folder	directory
so place that folder inside your virtual directory

2224762
georss	kml
if your layers are vector wfs kml georss etc. then you can reproject them with openlayers in the browser

2224774
getter	setter
even though it s painful coding up properties with getter and setter is a big win if you re ever going to use your objects in a context like jsp the expression language in particular ognl or another template language

2224799
int	double
you usually only use d for int values you have double in your matrix

2224808
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the entire browser stalls and in google-chrome just the tab

2224810
hash	md5
apply a hash function to the password such as sha1 or md5

2224810
salt	md5
then add extra salt to it by taking like the first 5 characters of md5 social or something

2224816
google-chrome	safari
on safari google-chrome the iframe is resized to 75 of its original size but the content within the iframe is not scaled at all

2224819
pop-up	dialog
the user clicks on the box and a dialog box pop-up asking them to select a category

2224831
jruby	mri
just don t use jruby for unit tests and rake tasks the thoughtworks mingle team for example uses mri for unit tests rake tasks and development and jruby for integration tests regression tests and production

2224831
jruby	mri
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

2224831
disk	ram
just loading the entire beast from disk into ram can already take longer than running the same script in mri

2224870
photoshop	fireworks
the easiest way to do this is to create a small flat image in photoshop fireworks gimp kreta etc

2224882
post	get
i got confused by the question how can i send post and get data to a perl cgi script via the command line and thought this was about sending post and get data to a perl cgi script via the command line from an unspecified client os

2224897
bmp	tga
bmp - tga image file conversion is an appropriate start

2224915
punctuation	words
i can t simply tokenize since i loose punctuation and words positions

2224921
getter	setter
i find getter and setter are better way to program and its not about only a matter of coding convention

2224936
pop-up	dialog
the app produces a modal pop-up and waits for the user input but when the app is tiled with other programs the dialog appears randomly in different locations on the screen

2224978
getter	setter
on the other hand also be careful about getter and setter at all--they have a lot of pitfalls

2224978
getter	setter	int	double
setter and getter expose your internal structures if you have a getter for an int it s difficult to later change that to a double--you have to touch every place it was accessed and make sure it can handle a double without overflowing causing an error if you had just asked your object to manipulate the value in the first place the only changes would be internal to your object

2224988
firefox	safari
i tried on safari 4 and firefox 3.6

2224993
getter	setter
having getter and setter for all fields is also a bad idea

2224993
getter	setter
a field with getter and setter is almost the same as a public field - it exposes the implementation details of the class and increases coupling

2224993
getter	setter
code using those getter and setter easily violates oo principles and the code becomes procedural

2225045
slideup	slidedown
jquery slidedown is invoked revealing more input fields in the previously hidden div and then slideup is invoked when mousing out

2225045
slideup	slidedown
the trouble is that everything behaves in firefox but in ie7 the bottom visible portion of the div which is absolutely positioned to bottom in order to keep at the bottom during slidedown and slideup is not visible on the initial page load

2225063
ant	maven
the good thing about this is that the project documentation can be re-generated through ant maven etc

2225065
getter	setter
however the code that deals with the object often sets public properties directly instead of using getter setter methods

2225081
getattr	setattr
for example if you have a class that overloads the bracket operators with getattr and setattr but uses some funny internal scheme it would be appropriate for it to behave as a dictionary if that s what it s trying to emulate

2225102
getter	setter
although i much prefer specified getter setter for each property whether that s a proxy to a generalized or not

2225107
getter	setter
setter getter are the way to go and the very small performance penalty that you pay for it is usually either optimized away or trumped by elegance

2225174
boost	stl
if you are looking for something to expand on the stl that is supported by almost everything it would be worth taking a look at the boost libraries

2225184
width	height
first time the width and height properties are being set correctly

2225184
width	height
i then use this image s height and width properties in order to create a blown up crop preview

2225184
width	height
the browser or the dom or something automagically set the img s height and width attributes which i access via the dom after the image has loaded

2225184
width	height
this time however the img s width and height attributes accessed via javascript remain the same as the prior image

2225184
width	height
the new image displays correctly in it s own width and height it s just that the tag s properties do not change along with a new src

2225184
width	height
or even better how i could deterministically get the img s height and width upon loading a new src

2225196
getter	setter
i think most people will recommend using setter getter

2225196
getter	setter
by using setter getter you add a valuable layer of encapsulation to your classes and 99 of the time this is worth the extra typing you ll need to do

2225196
getter	setter
imagine trying to do the examples above without setter getter

2225196
getter	setter
it s an object relation mapper orm that can automatically setup setter getter for you amongst other things

2225204
accessor	properties
regarding accessor i do not see a need to use them for what you are describing retrieving class properties and internal state information aka a struct

2225207
rss	feed
we use drupal aggregator to get rss feed and present in views

2225215
content-disposition	content-type
if internet explorer knows the content-type specified and there is no content-disposition data internet explorer performs a mime sniff scanning the first 200 bytes of the file to determine if the file structure matches any known mime types

2225215
content-disposition	content-type
lastly if there is no content-type or content-disposition data and the mime sniff does not recognize a known mime type the file extension is set to the same extension as the url used to download the file

2225217
width	height
what about removing the height and width attributes

2225226
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
dragging and dropping web parts works great in internet explorer but it doesn t work at all in firefox google-chrome or safari

2225226
post	get
these post offer a possible solution but i have been unable to get it working yet on my site

2225253
getter	setter
once on that i d really love if java had implied getter and setter created using a property keyword.

2225285
youtube	vimeo
because both youtube and vimeo videos are rendered using flash it s unlikely that you ll be able to listen for the click events registered by those elements because flash has its own internal event model with its own handlers

2225294
hash	md5
i am creating a sequential file which requires a digital signature md5 hash

2225295
rss	feed
i d check out the feed which can import each rss item as its own node so excluding any is as easy as just unpublishing along with views to list them and sharethis to add the ability to email or share them

2225316
g++	gcc
normally - if you are on linux and gcc g++ gdb is installed - then it should work out of the box

2225320
getter	setter
i wouldn t care much about the style per se or any kind of dogma for that matter but rather the convenience in maintainability that comes with a set of getter setter methods

2225320
getter	setter
if you or someone else later needed to change the behavior associated with a change of one of those attributes log the changes make it thread-safe sanitize input etc. but have already directly modified them in lots of other places in your code you will have wished you used getter and setter methods instead

2225347
post	get
the code is not pretty but basically i am using httpclient to post and get and parse the returned xml with saxparser

2225363
width	height
the problem with it is that it cuts off part of the image when the height and width are not equal

2225363
width	height
notice the returnbitmap width original.height and it s height original.width

2225416
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it working perfect in ie and firefox but both safari and google-chrome fails to load the script on some pageloads

2225422
config	ini
if you haven t already figured it out this is an old thread what you re missing is the ini config

2225431
nunit	mstest
for unit testing you shouldn t test private methods yes but for integration tests using a unit testing framework like mstest or nunit i would very much like to run the internal api calls against a test url to make sure the current code works when the third party api vendor changes their backend

2225535
maven	pom.xml
portability this pom.xml will build on anyone s machine with maven installed

2225541
google-chrome	safari
i did not experience any issues in either google-chrome or safari for windows on your product page

2225592
google-chrome	firefox
most modern browsers i ve tested google-chrome and firefox send a referer header on link clicks and not on direct entry - that is if the user s settings say to which they usually do by default

2225597
width	margin
to achieve a consistent result cross browser you would usually add another div inside the div and give that no explicit width and a margin

2225598
zen-cart	magento
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility

2225599
actionscript	mxml
or move your xml construction to a pure actionscript file instead of mxml

2225609
punctuation	words
search for the words in the ternary tree - if a partial match is found check that the rest of the words is punctuation or at least not stuff that would make it not be a match

2225609
punctuation	words
the main problem with this approach is if there is punctuation before the words like a but that can be dealt with easily

2225630
box-sizing	border-box
you could use the css 3 property box-sizing border-box to achieve this

2225630
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is supported by ie8 but for firefox you would need to use -moz-box-sizing and for safari google-chrome use -webkit-box-sizing

2225644
crypt	salt
i have read the information provided on the php manual entry for crypt but i find myself still unsure of the format for a salt to trigger the blowfish algorithm

2225644
whirlpool	salt	hash	whirlpool	hash	salt
that hash is obviously not whirlpool and is in fact std_des with only the first two characters of the salt being used for the salt

2225651
google-chrome	safari
it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t

2225662
button	checkbox
code for all checked inputs checkbox and radio button

2225664
union	distinct
also your query uses a union distinct but really you only need a union all

2225717
min	max
you could still use max category or min category and group by but leave off the having

2225720
hash	salt
when using salt strings longer than 22 characters there is no change in the hash generated truncation and when using strings shorter than 21 characters the salt will automatically be padded with characters apparently

2225720
hash	salt
however if given a salt 20 characters and a salt 21 characters where the two are identical except for the final character of the 21-length salt both hash strings will be identical

2225720
hash	salt
a salt 22 characters long which is identical to the 21 length salt except for the final character the hash will be different again

2225720
hash	salt
however it is important to note that the string generated includes the hash the salt as well as instructions to generate the salt

2230552
profiling	debugging
for instance i was painfully debugging some hql with p6spy when someone told me about hibernate profiling which is really great and helpful

2230570
content-disposition	content-type
i would recommend reading the file in as a byte and sending it out with it s content-type and content-disposition set in the response and then just perform a response.binarywrite and a response.flush

2230631
vim	textmate
a lot of people will swear by vim if they don t use textmate

2230643
agile	greenhopper
i m an unapologetic jira fanboy particularly when it s combined with greenhopper for a very robust agile project management issue tracking suite

2230698
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	post	put
also mouseover didn t work for some reason i couldn t figure out but when i put mouseenter and mouseleave as suggested in one of the post above it worked

2230698
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve never heard of mouseenter or mouseleave but .

qlist	qvector
qlist is partway between qvector similar to std vector and qlinkedlist similar to std list

2230703
qlist	qvector
qvector has squeeze but that doesn t seem present in qlist

serializable	deserialization
i don t know of any framework that will directly work like castor but i do know of this website he wrote this strictly for serializable and deserialization

2230769
opera	firefox
the following example works fine in firefox and opera but not in ie8

2230769
addclass	removeclass
the below example shows the use of toggleclass but replacing this with addclass and removeclass still has the same problem

2230792
jar	war
this ideally would prevent them from coming back since they re still there and not grenade jboss because they won t be included in the war ear jar if that s actually an issue for existing projects

2230819
url.action	redirecttoaction
my suggestion is to use url.action to generate the base url since it works much the same as redirecttoaction but returns a string

2230823
vmware	virtualbox
i m not sure of any services like that but it sounds to me that you want to use a virtual machine such as vmware or virtualbox

2230870
children	parent
the parent pom has no knowledge of any of the children it simply contains boilerplate repo definitions and common plugins

2230912
appdata	uninstaller
i notice that often times when you uninstaller a program clear out appdata references check registries to make sure there is no residue of any relevant information

2230934
xna	spritebatch
i donno if you are familiar with xna environment or not but i solved the problem by changing the spritebatch drawing spriteblendmode from spriteblendmode.none to spriteblendmode.alphablend i hope this can help you knowing the reason

2230962
x86	64bit
i need something that can run on mac os x or iphone ppc x86 or 64bit

2230973
children	parent
it s a very simple drag and drop utility that enables you the automatically add children parent to your class diagram

2230981
kerberos	ldap
one idea i have found was to authenticate against the active directory ldap using the kerberos ticket

2230981
kerberos	ldap
unfortunately we use windows 7 and re-using the kerberos ticket to authenticate against the ldap only works when setting a registry entry see search for allowtgtsessionkey

2230996
range	max
the dynamic range is the defined to be in decibels 20 log10 max peak-to-peak |s n | max peak-to-peak |e n | 20 log10 1 2 -b 20b log10 2 6.02b db

2231020
installation	upgrade
only if you upgrade the system installation

2231020
installation	upgrade
i would not upgrade tangle with or otherwise modify the default installation of python if that s what you are asking

2231020
versioning	upgrade
you are much better off installing an upgrade versioning of python in an alternate location using macports

2231050
ienumerable	iqueryable
and the second part - you can return whatever you wish but it will be most convenient for you to use ienumerable or iqueryable parametrized with your models

2231054
uiview	subviews
i am trying to get a uiview to clip to subviews but not entirely

2231059
ienumerable	iqueryable
return ienumerable iqueryable or t where t is an entity

2231070
unsigned	short
read it into an unsigned short int and do some range checking after if you need to

2231094
children	parent
invocations of passup would compute as far up into the receiving object s tree as it can until it hits a parent that hasn t received data from all its children

2231103
google-chrome	firefox
the examples work in ie and google-chrome but do nothing in firefox

2231122
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
i d like to be able to tell the uinavigationviewcontroller pushviewcontroller from inside the uitableviewcontroller but i am unable to retrieve the correct navigationcontroller object

2231132
google-chrome	firefox
i was doing some logging on window.getselection and noticed that it contained different information when comparing google-chrome and firefox

2231147
post	get
edit what typically happens in the case you mention below is when a user enters a post code the current location is taken to be the geographic center of that post code you would probably have to get this info from the authority who assigns post codes in your area

2231200
dmz	was
since the web site client being situated in the dmz has no access of the local network at all meaning we are unable to impersonate any network user this is a flaw in my original question saying the impersonation works - it was actually not working

2231253
vim	emacs
that has a chance of winning over the vim emacs people

2231285
unsigned	short	int	chars
you would have to read into an unsigned int u or unsigned short hu and then check that the result is with the range of an unsigned chars

2231294
put	get
when i put the expire call inside an eval i get the following error

2231302
post	get
i have a orders table and i followed the above example changing column names and i get the similar error that the post creator had

subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
it parses simple arithmetic expressions including addition subtraction multiplication division exponentiation and parenthesized sub-expressions

2231373
for-loop	loops
using a for-loop with counter is perfectly reasonable if you don t want a foreach loops

2231434
listview	gridview
i have a standard listview with a gridview

2231437
for-loop	arrays
make the arrays an arrays of pointers and construct each element using a for-loop and the new operator

2231505
post	get
i have a few code snippets that i would like to post to get some feedback pertaining to what i just said

2231524

the form that put s really post s with a to that action has a password and password_confirmation field but no old_password field

2231529
calloc	malloc
the fact that the function returns a malloc -ed or calloc -ed memory becomes a part of its external specification

2231597
memcached	apc
i ve wrote my own custom solution that uses memcached apc filesystem depending on what i need for the task because i couldn t find one that met my requirements

2231603
boost	allocator
if you have a class without default constructor you absolutely need to have an array and you don t want to incur into the overhead of dynamic memory allocator you can use an array of boost optionals

2231622
width	height
it appears that the height and width is not printing properly and also causes the second 48 not to print

2231622
width	height
btw the uiimage displays fine i just cannot resize the image properly if i cannot get the width and height

2231638
width	height
image.size is a cgsize which stores width and height as floats not ints

2231661
g++	gcc
if you look at the commands issued by xcode for a build with the 10.4 sdk selected you will see that gcc g++ flags include

2231706
put	get
the error you get if you put an arbitrary int is

2231725
accessor	properties
of course accessorizer also writes out explicit accessor as in objective-c 1.0 and allows you to override properties - all with a simple toggle of a switch

2231733
int	double
the typical implementation of a double has a 53-bit mantissa so you can represent 53-bit int with absolute precision

2231755
set	bag
my problem is i don t know how to force or suggest to the reverse engineering tools hibernate-tools.jar to use bag or list --it always uses set

2231774
int	chars
offhand i don t know if that will entirely fix the problem though -- i m not sure if the library has real overloads for wchar_t as a native type to print those out as chars instead of short int

2231776
yacc	bison
since yacc and bison are so closely related i don t find it lacking too much

2231812
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you could use sortedlist or a sorteddictionary see discussion below with a custom key

2231847
vbscript	vba
i d like to be able to script this using vba vbscript or a command line

2231906
bash	tcsh
the linux command shell bash tcsh ksh whatever will expand the into a list of files before your program even sees it

2231912
content-length	content-type	outputstream	inputstream
create a servlet which listens on an url-pattern of gets the requested css file by httpservletrequest#getpathinfo and basically gets an inputstream from it using the aforementioned servletcontext#getresourceasstream and writes it to the outputstream of the response along a correct set of response headers with at least content-type and content-length

2231919
waitpid	fork
see perldoc perlfork perldoc -f fork and perldoc -f waitpid

2231935
pascal	delphi
i recommend you see the project kol kol - key objects library is a set of objects to develop power but small 32 bit windows gui applications using delphi but without vcl or free pascal

2231980
uilabel	uitextview
the controller here will be your existing uiviewcontroller objects or subclasses thereof -- in the first tab responding to changes in the data model and updating the say uilabel accordingly in the second tab changing the numbers in the data model when the user for example modifies the value on a uislider or in a uitextview

2231981
mouse	keyboard
i am developing a program which sends images from one computer to another similar to remote assistance without mouse keyboard input

2231996
swt	swing
i would start with swing and swt because the first decision you will need to make will be to pick one of them and it probably won t be feasible to switch later

2232036
swt	swing
apart from swing swt and the netbeans platform there are a few other words you should google

2232075
getter	setter
a model should be a representation of the object in the database and generally only contains your crud methods create retrieve update delete getter and setter methods and maybe some static helper methods related to the model

2232103
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome but ie fails to recognize it as a csv file thinking it is a html fle and when i click save i get the error unable to download name of file from name of site

2232150
prepare	execute
it uses a pdo prepare statement that execute in a loop

2232191
children	parent
i tweaked it to first walk up to the oldest parent and then walk down through all children

2232211
hide	show
b needs to be hide show columns based on user s location

2232216
post	get
another minor problem with your snippet you re mixing get query parameters in with a post form

2232216
post	get
it s best to not mix get and post variables especially if you use _request elsewhere

2232244
hide	show
although you can hide show columns in your code to manipulate the columns before exporting that s not a big deal just the formatting of the look and feel will be difficult

2232262
onchange	onkeyup
used onkeyup and onchange

2232268
tomahawk	trinidad
tomahawk trinidad and or tobago all from apache

2232291
exponent	modulo
we now just need to compute the coefficients of its sixth power take the exponent modulo 20 and add them up

2232306
imagemagick.net	magick++
it should use the issimilarimage magick method from the imagemagick.net project but iâ m confused as to whether i have to route this method through the magick++ as any functionality available to the .net side originates in the magick++

2232386
uiview	subviews
for a custom uiview i ve implemented i want to display some graphics in multiple calayers that are added as subviews of my uiview layer

2232431
mouse	keyboard
while typing this i see that there may be a solution for both keyboard pasting and mouse pasting using ranges

2232439
mouse	keyboard
for instance sending mouse events to mouse listeners keyboard events to keyboard listeners etc

2232475
packets	pcap
if you need to capture packets on the local machine loopback device you should use the excellent rawcap tool to capture a pcap file then use wireshark on the captured file as usual

2232494
websphere	ibm
if possible see if you can use open ssl on ibm websphere everyplace micro environment jvm as well

2232499
poe	anyevent
unfortunately this typically entails the poe framework but there is also a growing alternative which i would want to try first called anyevent

2232499
poe	anyevent
for your specific question you would use anyevent s aio or poe s read write wheel

2232529
hide	show
for other scenarios where you need to hide show find windows and send keystrokes i would recommend autohotkey .

2232572
super	extends
super wheels - extends class

2232618
hash	md5
i m making a md5 hash of a response and then signing it with a shared secret

2232618
hash	md5
for most calls this works but strangely fails generates a md5 hash different from the client on the only two calls that bring a lot of content in the body

2232684
maven	pom.xml
now project can be build with maven and you can manage dependencies in generated pom.xml

2232720
button	checkbox
i m getting some strange behavior in firefox whenever i put checkbox inside a list ol ul dl and then dynamically insert button above the list

2232720
button	checkbox
but i need both button and the checkbox have to be in a list for what i m trying to build

2232725
hash	md5
anyway here s the correct way to create an md5 hash in java

2232725
hash	md5
keeping in mind that you will need to unencode it later before using it as an md5 hash

2232727
directx	gdi
from greg schechter s redirecting gdi directx and wpf applications

2232763
hash	md5
it is actually the md5 hash that are being damaged

2232800
textarea	textbox
if you apply a style that sets the font-family to be the same for both the textbox and the textarea then your pasted text will match

2232823
nsview	nsoutlineview
the data source pattern is often used by nsview sub-classes in cocoa that have complex state data such as nsbrowser nstableview nsoutlineview etc

2232838
opera	safari
it allows multiple decimal points in safari and opera and you can t type backspace arrow keys or several other control characters in opera

2232866
getter	setter
i have used synthesize to create getter setter and can use kvc to change properties

2232896
button	checkbox
but that s obviously a guess since really the button would be two elements before the checkbox anyway

2232903
post	get
if you want to get started making your own apps for free i wrote a quick blog post here works on any os that can ssh red pill

2232914
daemon	cron
given the frequency i would normally write a daemon server that nicely waits idly between job runs sleep rather than try to use cron for fairly fine-grained access

2232914
daemon	cron
the always present running but mostly idle daemon approach has the benefit of eliminating the possibility of concurrent instances of the script being being started by cron automatically

2232919
put	get
keywordextension will let you put a keyword in a file whose results you can tear apart in order to get the hash

2232935
width	height
naturally when the contents of that treeview exceed the maximum height or width a scroll appears

2232962
unsigned	short
b utf16 in unsigned short arrays

2232990
multiplying	subtraction
also you might say that as a shortcut a 1.5 discount is the same as saying that we charge 98.5 of regular price so we should just be able to multiplying the original price by 98.5 and not have to do an extra subtraction

2233036
getdate	dateadd
edit if you want to go by days use dateadd d -740 getdate

2233097
google-chrome	firefox
clicking the move button changes the parent of the iframe and reloads its contents in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

2233114
put	get
in that method put the stuff that happens when you d get the notification

2233149
put	get
and i read here that i should put definition of inline function in header file because it won t work if i ll put them in cpp file and want to call them from other cpp file when i do it i get undefined reference during linking

2233154
mouse	keyboard
i want to be able to record mouse movements clicks and keyboard input from a user

2233163
mouseleave	mouseenter
a mouseenter handler and a mouseleave handler

2233200
restrict	shared
i wonder if it s possible to programmaticaly shared folders in windows 7 while running in restrict logon session

2233203
post	get
i have a static website and i like to take some + or - 15 post from my 200 post wordpress and get it in a static website with design and thing really different from the blog

2233203
post	get
but how to tell the address of the blog and how to get the database texte from post 1828

2233245
maven	pom.xml
the same libraries are referenced in the pom.xml as well it s a bit messy to keep both eclipse rcp and maven happy

2233249
post	get
the value portion of the name value pair from any of the fields coming in through get post

2233265
setinterval	settimeout
it looks like settimeout and setinterval are a bit broken when used between frames in firefox 3.0.10+

2233282
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to the latest versioning and to os 3.1.2 and you ll be fine

2233294
width	height
before writing your img tag to the output buffer save the image to the resulting proposed file name and let identify extract the width and height of this image for you

2233302
maven	pom.xml
so i created a simple web app using maven the pom.xml is setup in eclipse just fine

2233311
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg	opera	firefox
well firefox and opera do not support non-free codecs such as mp3 as with the opera 10.5 alpha firefox 3.5 and later supports only pcm wav and ogg vorbis for audio

2233311
google-chrome	safari
i believe google-chrome and safari do support mp3 however

2233337
width	height
i have an inline div with a fixed width and height and another div leaderboard-loader further down the page with the actual content for that div

2233348
maven	m2e
if you have m2e installed and if your project is recognized as a maven project then you should have more entries in the run as.

2233365
width	height
just put leaderboard-loader in front of the leaderboard-slot tag give it position absolute and identical width and height

2233369
implements	extends
the extends clause has to come before the implements clause

2233384
actualheight	actualwidth
you can calculate the size on-screen of the text rendered via a textblock using the actualwidth and actualheight properties

2233384
width	height
the user can then adjust the width and height of the various text areas until satisfied at which point you can take a snapshot using the render method i liked to above

2233395
accessor	properties
at the design level it might be appropriate to use a protected properties but for implementation i see no advantage in mapping this to a protected member variable rather than accessor mutator methods

2233402
viewdidload	dealloc
and suppose this view controller has a nsoperationqueue which is created in viewdidload and released in dealloc

2233402
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
now suppose at some point while this view controller is alive it adds an nsinvocationoperation to the nsoperationqueue and the operation queue starts executing it in the background

2233486
mouse	keyboard
system wide hooks especially journal add a lot of overhead to keyboard and mouse input you want to minized your impact as much as possible

2233486
put	get
you could also maybe get this working by installing both wh_keyboard_ll and wh_mouse_ll but your two hook procedures would be called separately and you would have to write your own code to put the events in order

2233498
strftime	strtotime
easiest way would be to simply transform it to unix time first with strtotime then run strftime on it afterwards.

2233522
postgresql	mysql
edit i need to do a single query mixing tables from 2 databases one db is postgresql and other db is mysql

2233527
gif	png
it uses the gd library to create thumbnails from images jpeg png gif etc

2233529
mouse	keyboard
i ve written a java app that allows users to script mouse keyboard input jmacro link not important only for the curious

2233586
maven	pom.xml
so i googled a bit and found this post that shows another approach based on os commands using the maven exec plugin and has a complete pom.xml doing some other things

2233682
inline	inlining
to answer some of your specific questions inline is an f#-specific construct that interacts with both the type system static member constraints and code generation inlining code for optimization purposes

2233682
inline	inlining
the f# compiler deals with these things and the information regarding inlining is stored in f#-specific metadata in the assembly which enables functions to be inline across f# assembly boundaries

2233711
dictionary	map
you basically have a dictionary where multiple keys map to the same value

2233763
maven	pom.xml
you should also set a proper source version in pom.xml because maven can make builds without eclipse so it can t use eclipse preferences

2233788
width	height
first my image is resized to desired width keeping the proportions and then giving a fixed height to containing div and setting overflow to hidden makes the script to display just the desired portion of the image

2233871
ocaml	prolog	ocaml	scheme	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
regarding specific langauges lisp was created as an afterthought for doing ai research while prolog with it s roots in formal logic is especially aimed at natural language processing and many courses will use prolog scheme matlab r or another functional language ocaml is used for this course at cornell as they are very suited to this kind of analysis

2233896
datamapper	activerecord
the datamapper pattern is not very popular in the php world in favour of activerecord and certainly much of that favour is attributed to the fawning of ruby on rails in the php framework community although there exists one notable project -- and it looks promising

2233900
webkit	gecko
it works fine in gecko based browsers and webkit

2233930
dlsym	dlopen
dynamically loading the library and attaching the symbols via dlopen and dlsym would work

2233932
ubuntu	linux
in the code it will work when i compile it on linux ubuntu but it won t work on mac osx 10.6.2

2234013
subtract	add
adding or removing elements to or from anywhere other than the end of a list will be slow because when you remove something it needs to go through every item that comes after it and subtract one from its index and same thing for adding something except it ll need to add to the index

2234102
vmware	virtualbox
something similar to that of what virtualbox vmware himachi creates when you install their software

2234103
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following appears to work in safari 4.0.4 webkit nightly 6531.21.10 r54538 mac os x 10.6.2 but not google-chrome or firefox

2234103
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here are the bug trackers for firefox gecko mozilla google-chrome chromium and safari if it happens not to work on windows or something like that

2234109
trie	tree
similar to a trie is a ternary search tree but a ternary search tree has the advantage of using less memory

2234123
getter	setter
however jitter also inlines some simple calls such as calls to property getter and setter

2234129
maven	m2e
assuming you have the wtp web tools project installed which is part of the eclipse ide for java ee developers distro and you have the maven integration for wtp installed which is an optional module of m2e you have to intall it explicitly then your spring project should be recognized as a dynamic web project and runnable on a server

2234182
ready	each
when the form and webservice is ready to deploy to a test qa production server i have to go into the form and modify the data connections each and every time i have to point it to the relevant webservices depending on the environment dev test qa prod

2234183
mouseover	mouseout
- mouseover mouseout events automatically managed

2234183
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
internet explorer 6+ firefox opera 9+ safari

2234253
daemons	systemd
my app had a daemons attached to it so i had to copy that daemons to systemd library launchdaemons to make that daemons work

2234253
daemons	systemd
i made cydia to copy the daemons file into systemd library launchdaemon folder

2234253
daemons	systemd
for example if you have a daemons and you want cydia to paste it to systemd library launchdaemons make the file structure like this before making a .deb

2234344
children	parent
the children of the parent is a set of records that are related by having the same name or same code or both

2234347
post	get
if there s some other state you need to track like post data or you have an extraordinarily long url that you can t fit in as a query parameter or you need to have the destination_url tampered with by the user you store that information server-side send the key as a query parameter instead of a url and look it up when they get back

2234387
mouseleave	mouseenter
my problem is that the mouseenter and mouseleave functions are being called inconsistently when a user moves the mouse quickly through the list over the child elements which are input fields

2234387
mouseleave	mouseenter
here are the mouseenter and mouseleave functions

2234387
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have attempted to assign the mouseenter and mouseleave functions without using live when i call the function that adds the li elements dynamically into the page

2234410
stdout	stderr
you ll note the wrap stderr on the screen for a second during the sleep -- it s overwritten the stdout part -- then it disappears and you see the four before and after lines on the now-quiescent screen you can add other sleeps to follow what s happening in even more details if you care

2234427
disk	ram
assuming you have enough ram i d buy a ram disk app i use this one with good results

2234429
put	get
no if you really must have the create table in there you could put it in an execute immediate wrapped in a pl sql block with an exception handler that only swallows the exceptions you expect to get - so your scripts should handle all expected errors gracefully

2234430
integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
setvolume takes a floating-point fractions and you re treating it as an integer

2234440
mouseout	mouseenter
anyway maybe you can make it so that when mouseenter fires on one thingy it runs the code that corresponds to mouseout on all the other ones

2234468
int	double	sorting	filtering
i m optimizing a sorting function for a numerics statistics library based on the assumption that after filtering out any nans and doing a little bit twiddling floats can be compared as 32-bit int without changing the result and double can be compared as 64-bit int

2236943
n-gram	words
use a huge corpus and generate statistics about quadruplets n-gram how often a tuple of n words appears

2237009
crypt	salt
now the crypt function appears to be capable of taking a salt of any length less than or equal to its maximum and silently handling any inconsistencies in the base64 by discarding any data that doesn t make up another full byte

2237009
crypt	salt
the crypt function will fail completely if you pass it characters in the salt that are not part of its base64 alphabet which just confirms this theory of its operation

2237009
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
the actual salt used by crypt to calculate the hash will in fact be identical

2237009
whirlpool	salt	hash	whirlpool	hash	salt

2237057
getter	setter
note that my solution doesn t need a setter and a getter as long as you always use path_finder and

2237070
getter	setter
xmlserialization only serializes public properties that have a getter and a setter

2237073
libs	buildpath
you should rather have integrated the server in the same ide and configured the ide project to reference associate the server in question so that the ide will automagically take its libs in the project s buildpath

2237110
width	height
another setting such as this is to do something like defining a grid column width or row height like this

i m omitted the getter and setter for ref1 and ref2

2237745
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
in your own answer you note that crypt is using the freebsd md5 which also does some interesting transformations on the salt before running the hash so the result of what i m about to give you will never quite match up with the results of a call to md5

2237745
hash	md5
first you need something to convert the base64 with custom alphabet into a raw 16-byte md5 hash

2237831
post	put
i always use it on post delete put actions

2237836
maven	m2e
... i then found that my command-line maven 2.2.1 does things differently to my m2e embedded maven embedder v

2237955
quicksort	mergesort
if so algorithms like mergesort and quicksort can be parallelized because they use the divide-and-conquer paradigm but since the same kinds of operations are performed on each half you should be aware that parallelizing will only benefit you if you are working on a system with multiple cores

2237969
width	height
the overall dimensions of a range are in its width and height properties

2237980
int	chars
i need to convert a chars to an int

2238285
nant	xmlpoke
nant has an xmlpoke

2238288

2238642
superclass	subclassing
in the majority of cases however the implementation details of a superclass subtly conflict with the requirements of a subclassing

2238642
inherited	subclassing
in these cases the implementation re-use offered by inherited is purchased with the added effort of verifying state changes and execution paths across cascading levels of code the complete flattened implementation details of the subclassing are spread between multiple classes which usually means multiple files of which only portions apply to the subclassing in question

2238684
hide	show
nb you can show hide views in a region by calling the activate deactivate method on the iregion like so

the parent div would be of width height 200 or if you want to get fancy you could simply have the height width be 100 and use some fancy math in js to dynamically size the divs as the port moves

2239587
srp	principles
that would make it two violations one for the srp and anothrt for the soc principles

2239605

2239813
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction pass the sending ui element as their parameter and you re free to use that to modify the state of an element as well rather than using an iboutlet

2239846

2240708
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it works beautifully in firefox safari opera ie7 ie8 and in my own head

2240730
inherited	properties
ie6 and ie7 do not support the value inherited except when applied to the direction and visibility properties

when we were using mysql it was just a matter of setting a policy in my.cfg ini - i don t understand why it s made more complicated in postgresql

2240937
width	height
i don t have the time to test this right now but it should work consistently across browsers as long as the surrounding div has a width or height set

2240938
client-side	server-side
it looks like you ve mixed up server-side code with client-side code

2240963

2241223
sorting	filtering
sorting filtering term vectors multiple and remote index searching

2241257
keydown	keyup
since every fake keyup event is followed by an immediate keydown event you simply remove the keyup event from the keyremovelist if you receive a keydown event this looks like the following

2241257
keydown	keyup
since the real keyup event isn t followed by an immediate keydown event it s processed normally

2241257
keydown	keyup
in theory it should be impossible for a game frame to occur between a fake keyup and keydown

2241277
google-chrome	firefox
changing that made my website work in ie firefox and google-chrome

2241301
post	get

pop-up	dialog
i m not exactly sure what do you mean under show pop-up dialog at this point but do something like this

2241429
children	parent
assuming the bst is setup as they suggest then simply deleting the root node should automatically delete all the allocated memory as each parent down the tree will delete its children

2241473
many-to-many	many-to-one
it does not usually make sense to enable cascade on a many-to-one or many-to-many association

2241473
children	parent
but if you think that you will often be working with the parent and children together in the same transaction and you want to save yourself some typing consider using cascade persist merge save-update

2241473
children	parent
mapping an association either a single valued association or a collection with cascade all marks the association as a parent child style relationship where save update delete of the parent results in save update delete of the child or children

2241473
children	parent
if a parent is passed to persist all children are passed to persist

2241473

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have seen this in opera google-chrome and safari as well but not firefox yet so if i am loading more than one script i hold running any commands until i know the resources are available- usually by testing the typeof a function from the required file and a timer callback if not found

2242265
postgresql	mysql
i want to use ruby with postgresql or mysql postgresql being the first choice

2242287

for-loop	loops
if you re going to write a while loops that is equivalent to a for-loop as above i strongly encourage you to write it as a for-loop

2242654
for-loop	loops
further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line

2242654
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will print 0--9 skipping 5 on the console whereas the while loops will print 0--4 on the console and then enter an infinite loops

2242655
for-loop	loops
the for-loop tells you it is most probably a fixed count loops

it seems like unp is implying that porting tcp applications to sctp to take advantage of multi-homing is trivial yet based this simple attempt that doesn t really seem to be the case

2243444
int	chars
i remember reading somewhere that it is better to use int as loop counter variables rather than chars or short

2243465
rtp	rtcp
however if i remember rtp timestamps have a different baseline in each stream so you need to use the rtcp packets to convert rtp timestamps to absolute ntp time and then convert ntp to directshow using your initial baseline baseline ntp dshow stream time now + 300ms

the properties will not be automatically retained and released unless you use the self.propertyname to force the call to the accessor

2245172
accessor	properties
in the vast majority of cases if you use the synthesized accessor you only need to call release on retained properties in your dealloc

2245172
accessor	properties
without knowing where the exc_bad_access occurs i can t say definitively but since that error often occurs when messaging an non-existant object i can say that it is very likely that your bypassing of the properties accessor and your releasing of them manually is probably causing the code to send to nilled properties

2245172
accessor	properties
you are stepping on the properties generated accessor that maintain the retain count automatically

2245172
accessor	properties
to each one expect inside a properties custom accessor which you don t seem to have use -- which is good in this case.

you should always use accessor of properties which in objective-c 2.0 means using the self.property notation.

2246633
accessor	properties
the only time you should access properties directly is when you are writing an accessor

2246633

2248328
put	get
if generated by the matches for this regex was not the whole capture - then a single-call replace would not be possible - and your question would probably be asking why doesn t the whole match get put into instead of the other way round

2248390
put	get
i understand the get and put principle for collections if a method takes in a collection that it will write a type t to the parameter has to be whereas if it will read a type t from the parameter has to be

punctuation	words
i want to detect words in text i need to know which characters in a given text are letters that is they can be part of a spoken words and which are on the other hand punctuation and such

2248424
inherited	properties
something similar is possible for certain inheritable properties such as backgrounds and font sizes but that uses an inherited mechanism -- affecting all contained controls -- rather than addressing a specific sub-element and wouldn t work for textbox.selectedtext anyway.

2248431
min	max
zipcode min length is 5 and max is 9 and is a required field and only digits

2248462

so in order to achieve this i create a .xib set the file s owner to be of type myviewcontroller drop in a uinavigationitem and add the uibutton

2248687
inherited	subclassing
so given that file s owner is a myviewcontroller and as such a subclassing of uiviewcontroller supposedly inheriting everything you get by using a uiviewcontroller from ib s palette then i should inherited all the functionality of it s superclass.

2248701
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
only a uinavigationcontroller sets uiviewcontroller s navigationitem property

instead they are all just peers and if you d like to get changes someone made to their repository you could pull the changes from them similar but not identical to updating with svn or cvs

2249174
width	height
what i m trying to avoid is hard coding all my appwidget width s and height s or using a separate packaging scheme

2249175
int	double
but if you want to detect nan and inf from ieee754 values map it to an int 32 or 64 bit depending on whether it s single or double precision and check if the exponent bits are all 1

2249191
rar	zip
self extracting .exe files are usually archive files zip rar tar etc concatenated together with a small program that does the extraction then executes the program that was extracted from the archive

2249211

vector multiplication with a scalar is done by multiplying each component with the scalar.

2249215
mousemove	keydown	keydown	keyup
you can use keydown and keyup to track if the space bar is pressed or not and look at that state in your mousemove event handler

2249217
keydown	keyup
you will probably have to be watching for the keydown event check to see that it s the spacebar set a variable saying it s down unset it when the keyup event is seen

2249247
jruby	mri
similar to this question except in jruby it works in mri ruby

i wanted the code to figure out whether it was a landscape or portrait image then expand it in width or height not to exceed the bounds of the containing div

2249337
width	height
the image grows in width and height proportionally and stops growing at the border of the containing div

2249337
width	height
but when i hover over a landscape img the else in the code above it only grows in the width not height proportionally

2249343
ready	each
i d personally not have more than a single doc ready script on each page that called this but i see no other option

2249347
disk	ram

google-chrome	firefox
which returns all team elements fine in google-chrome and firefox but not in internet explorer

2249928
installation	upgrade
a browser-based gui is good for software-as-a-service applications because they don t require installation by the user and can be upgrade by the product developer at will but if you don t plan to offer your product as a software-as-a-service product a la salesforce

2249983
boost	allocator
the convert function does basically the same things as boost lexical_cast except lexical cast is more careful about avoiding allocator dynamic storage by using fixed buffers etc

i have chosen to do the calculation in utf-8 and store this md5 hash

2250087
hash	md5
or store a md5 hash for each charset

2250150
printf	strcpy
the argv 2 in rm . argv 2 is a literal string if you want to use what is stored in argv 2 you need to use strcpy or printf to connect rm . with the string stored in argv 2

2250157
printf	strncpy
you can retrieve the string in using printf or strncpy

2250191
put	get
for other problems that i want to solve with a concurrenthashmap with garbage collection i would use a strong reference in the hashmap as the key to get equals equality and a softreference as the value so the jvm can garbage collect something but in this case the value doesn t matter and i don t have a value to wrap in a softreference to put there

2250218

2250364
width	height
when you don t keep the congruence of your image you see the image incongruous and height and width of your image is not suitable for showing

2250364
width	height
for resolving this issue you can multiply your image s width and height to to a constant coefficient

2250365
width	height
the differencee between what coordinates are set and what the user sees is related to the difference between the height and width

2250365
width	height
displaypointx canvas.left + height 2 - width 2

2250365
width	height
diaplaypointy canvas.top + height 2 - width 2

2250372
int	chars
since url s are utf-8 and since the chars are therefore base 256 encoding the same chars as int code-points in base 32 can only make them longer

2250395
gridview	sqldatasource
i ve also tried populating the ddl with a sqldatasource selectcommand but have had no luck including the id of currently-linked records in the other database even though it s available in my table and i set it as a gridview datakey and add it as a controlparameter in the selectparameters for the sqldatasource

2250405

2250825
width	height
if there are 10 images it loops through and uses getimagesize to find width and height

2250825
width	height
if there are 10 images it loops through and uses fread and imagecreatefromstring to find width and height for speed

2250825
width	height
once all width and height are worked out it loops through and only adds the images to a new array that have a minimum width and height so only larger images are shown smaller images are less likely to be descriptive of the url

2250825
gif	png	width	height
one solution i have found is being able to retrieve the image width and height from the header of the image without having to download the whole image though i have only found some code to do this for jpg s it would need to support gif png

2250866
mp3	wav
tasked with converting wav to mp3 in my mac program i ve downloaded and compiled the lame encoder

2250895
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the view is not yet visible when viewdidload and viewwillappear are called

2250905
width	height
the only idea that comes to mind for your current approach which is impressive is to check the html for existing width and height attributes and skip the file read process altogether if they exist

2250910
pop-up	dialog
i want to show a pop-up screen on my page using jquery ui dialog widget

2250910

same holds true for viewdidappear and viewwillappear

2250919
openssl	botan
as for the encryption part the botan library seems to be pretty mature an its c++ unlike openssl that it s c and so a bit painful to use

2250919
serializable	deserialization
this is how i think you can do serializable + encryption under the same workflow deserialization would be analogous

2250919
openssl	botan
edit changed crypto recommendantion from openssl to botan

all my pages work fine on firefox google-chrome

2250982
getter	setter
you may not need to add any logic to a setter in the future but you may need to add logic to a getter

2250982
getter	setter
if i m feeling rigorous then i d go for full immutability explicit readonly backing fields with exposed getter and no setter

2250982
getter	setter
if i m feeling lazy then i d probably go for agreed immutability auto-properties with exposed getter and private setter

2251051
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i am testing the ping time of sending an object via an objectoutputstream to receiving a reply via an objectinputstream over a socket

2251052
unsigned	short
you can always cast a enumeration value to another type as long as you truncate the value by casting to a smaller type nsuinteger to unsigned short

2251067
for-loop	loops
you can actually do the trick by enclosing an already obtained iterator in an iterable object so the for-loop got what it needs and you can get a hasnext method inside loops

2251117
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the signature of the viewdidappear and viewwillappear are wrong in your sample..they should be

2251238
kerberos	ntlm
what may be happening is that your browser may be falling back silently to using ntlm and other programs such as vs s deployment don t behave that way -- they often only use kerberos

2251275

build a special debug version of the program using -g of gcc g++

2251408
calloc	malloc
you have to explicitely allocate memory using malloc or calloc

2251443
hide	show
you can even make this generic by binding to the .ajaxstart and .ajaxstop events to automatically show hide the dialog for all ajax operations

2251503
width	height
unfortunately the css box model which adds padding to the width or height of an element to determine size causes value width or height not to be useful on an element with padding

2251516
ubuntu	linux
this is all on ubuntu linux 2.6.31-19

you can t there is no default width and height

2251607
width	height
use like rahul suggested css3 or give the divs as i said before a width and a height

2251611
getter	setter
you have to indicate their presence through getter and setter just like you did

2251613
nsfilewrapper	nsdocument
you can create a file wrapper containing all the files for your document bundle using the various methods of nsfilewrapper and then you would implement the -filewrapperoftype error method of nsdocument in order to handle saving

versioning	upgrade
if you re still having trouble see if you can upgrade to the most recent versioning of the control from jquery ui s site

2251767
post	get
if your request is a get change it to a post this will prevent the results being cached

2251790
put	get
just put it in the runtime classpath and use classloader#getresourceasstream to get an inputstream of it

2251790
jar	manifest.mf
putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient

2251797

2251937
rss	feed
closest i got was scrape and generate rss feed which has a scraping script but no info on how to get it to respond to changes on the page automatically

2251952
width	height
because divc has width and height but as it contains nothing the percentage is a percentage of 0 which will always be 0

2252010
width	height
i would like to get a grid s actual width or height and display it in a textbox but the width height should be live when i resize the window i would like to see the new sizes

2252049
folder	directory
if you place an alias to the directory in your domain folder and apache is configured to follow aliases you should be fine

2252060
int	chars
according to the ansi c standards a chars gets promoted to an int in the context where int are used you used a int format specifier in the printf hence the different values

2252087
int	chars
th c standard says that a chars literal like a is of type int not type chars

2252116
int	chars
as a chars literal is typed as int you get 4

2252175
swt	swing	awt	swing
awt swing and swt are supported

fancybox looks nice uses jquery and is highly configurable with various show hide effects

2252359
ant	maven
basically i d be nice if i can tell maven to do nothing else but run the ant tasks defined below inside the deploy phase for example

2252359
ant	maven
it s kind of tedious having to wait for maven to go thru all the phases just to check if the ant tasks in the deploy phase are working correctly

2252379
for-loop	arrays
is there a method for declare and use an arrays in a for-loop like this

2252383
min	max
one thing that perf4j gives for free is the min max standard dev

2252439
win64	windows
i m sure you ll get the concept from there this totally avoids the vb-runtime atl issues and uses the windows scripting host which is available on every major win32 win64 platform

2252452
getter	setter
both getter and setter functions are guarded with locks

2252497
getter	setter
but if it is just an int and you are sure that int is an atomic type the processor will not have to do two separate memory reads to load the int into a register and you have benchmarked the performance and determined you need better performance then you may consider dropping the lock from both the getter and the setter

2252497
getter	setter
if you need to do something like that the mutex protection has to be outside the setter getter functions

2252549
super	self
the code that i assume throws the ioerror is being run after you call the super picture self .save method

2252558
google-chrome	safari
it should work fine in safari and google-chrome out of the box

2252585
direct3d	direct2d
if your going for graphics eg for a game rather than a fully functional gui thing you might also look at things like direct2d direct3d opengl sdl etc

2252604
getter	setter
a classic example is one of coordinates - if you have a coordinate represented via cartesian coordinates and switch the internal representation to polar if you used getter and setter your program would still work even though the x and y fields are gone

2252614
getter	setter
if your class has a getter setter

2252617
getter	setter
if you make a field private and set up a getter and a setter to access it then all other code has to go through those methods to get at that data

2252617
getter	setter
you get these same benefits within the class too if you strictly use the getter and setter to access the field

2252617
getter	setter
getter and setter initially don t look so great because they seem like a lot of extra typing

2252617
getter	setter
but ides like eclipse can automatically make getter and setter for you if you like

2252617
getter	setter
c# can wrap getter and setter in properties which are used in code just like fields but under the hood it calls the getter and setter that you write

2252617
getter	setter
so there are a lot of reasons to use getter and setter and many facilities to make it less painful

2252656
postgresql	mysql
oracle postgresql and mysql have it

2252670
switching	screens
i thought it would a switching to the music library screens in itunes if itunes was at a different screens such as an album detail screens in the itunes store b scroll the music track list display to bring the given item into view and c highlight the given track line in the list

2252671
width	height
2b key point you must consider a 0 height or 0 width but not both intersection as a collision

2252671
width	height
use the intersection s height or width as the amount to revert

2252693
width	height
i m trying to read the width and height of a locally loaded image

2252693
width	height
this seems to work for images that do not exceed the dimensions limited by the flash player 10 but as soon as the images are bigger the width and height remain 0

2252706
config	ini
among countless other things it has library functions for parsing ini like config files

2252778
google-chrome	firefox
my page has no external resources and everything is being served from the same server using https firefox and google-chrome is not complaining it and only ie6 and ie7 are complaining

2252782
uiview	subviews
if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews

2252787
cout	cin
the one i would use is switch to using scanf and printf instead of cin and cout

2252808
telerik	radwindow
i had this problem too becuase i m using a telerik radwindow resizing reloads the silverlight app and then you lose the state

2252816
accessor	properties
the autogenerated accessor of a properties defined to retain will handle retention automatically

2252894
getter	setter
edit as requested the getter and setter code

2252894
accessor	properties
all answers below were helpfull and on the right path to finding the problem in multi-threaded apps however the first answer definitly emphasized recursion as the problem which is what it turned out to be although it wasn t one of the properties accessor as seemed obvious

2252902
rss	feed
if you are consuming content like an rss feed you will have to hold the records from last check and compare those with new entries if they have been reviewd

2252949
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop walks through the groups arrays until returns a falsely value

2252951
many-to-many	many-to-one
the two examples you ve quoted are many-to-one and many-to-many mappings neither of which is applicable to your model

2252951
set	bag
a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and requires fewer database columns

2253040
postgresql	mysql
commonly supported in the order by clause some databases mysql 3.23+ postgresql 8.0+ support the syntax for the group by clause as well

2253061
post	get
i have a pretty basic helper class that i m using to do all my http get post stuff

2253157
uiview	calayer
use hittest to dispatch touches you receive on you uiview to the calayer instance that needs to receive it

2253157
uiview	subviews
if you need more of the uiresponder behavior touchesbegan etc. you might want to go with subviews instead of sublayers as that would allow you to handle the events directly in the objects rather than having to dispatch them from a central responder your main uiview

2253157
uiview	subviews
if it makes more sense to put the behavior into the buttons themselves they shoudl be uiresponders and as such subclass uiview and be added as subviews of your main view

2253158
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome don t seem to have the memory leak but google-chrome doesn t render the controls right either

2253217
post	get
jeremiah has a nice blog post about using a directx9 device as a link between directx 10 11 d2d and the d3dimage but i couldn t get it working with slimdx

2253280
post	get
i wrote a helper class for my own applications and i am able to get post to https without a problem

2253284
unsigned	short
c++ makes no guarantee as to the number of bytes in an unsigned short int

2253305
stdout	stderr
it s seldom that you have code from multiple threads writing to stdout stderr at the same time so it s not usually an issue

2253319
put	get
note also that if you don t put the right after the l you will get a space after every line

2253412
uiview	subviews
it s just a uiview which you insert above your other subviews

2253441
jtextfield	jlabel
i want the jlabel and jtextfield to use their normal heights and the jscrollpane to use the rest

2253465
organization	naming
obviously the overall complexity of the site but also things like naming semantics css performance css file organization and testability acceptability

2253470
jtextfield	jlabel
put the jlabel and jtextfield in that vertically

2253488
put	get
you put key value or get key that gives a value

2253506
post	get
secondly get requests should be safe simply cause data to be displayed with no changes made and post should be used for all data altering requests

2253522
onbeforeunload	onload
in ie i get notified in flash with the onload message but not onbeforeunload

2253530
min	max
sliders will have different max and min values 5-100 0-80 etc

2253530
move	drag
for instance i d like to be able to drag the slider to say 12 and then type in 25 on the box and the slider move to 25

2253540
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you go to the work section of my site the pager i used a background gif for the a and active state function works in safari google-chrome firefox and opera but disappears in internet explorer

2253551
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
however my preference would be to throw a runtimeexception illegalstateexception if the accessor is called but the data has not yet been lazily loaded

2253558
ssl	https
i currently have a webhttp binding wcf restful service it works great over http i can make post of large sizes due to my webconfig settings now i am trying to use it over https ssl now my gets work fine but my posts dont it doesnt work when the file size is over a certain amount i was wondering why this could be since my webconfig specifies a larger size and it works good over http here is my relevant webconfig

2253574
post	get
after reading some post about implementing shaking on 3.0 i think i get the idea but i m not getting any call to the

2253605
submit	submission
in javascript intercept the form submission populate a second form with only hidden fields with the values you want and submit that form instead

2253625
folder	directory
folder directory structure

2253627
folder	directory
now create a group in xcode for every of those folder and drag each of the new settings.bundle directory to the corresponding group

2253636
onreadystatechange	onload
when onload is triggered the anonymous onload function is called - which appears to be very similar to the onreadystatechange handler

2253645
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature

2253664
put	get
using a hash would just make you put the addresses in buckets in my opinion and then you d get to the right bucket quickly and then have to search through the bucket

2253676
rss	feed
instead of minidom i have used celementtree to parse the rss feed

2253682
folder	directory
i already included the aspnet_client folder in my virtual directory in iis

2253706
jobs	cron
this isn t directly applicable but i wrote code that will let you run processes similar to scheduled tasks inside of asp.net without needing to use windows services or any type of cron jobs

2253714
jobs	cron
i also have have several cron jobs which periodically interacts with other third party api services

2253714
jobs	cron
if i don t launch twitterthread cron jobs are running fine

2253714
jobs	cron
where as if i launch twitterthread cron jobs are not running

2253725
children	parent
instead the parent of mychildwindow is myrootwindow2 - but to make this complete enumerating the children of myrootwindow2 does not yield mychildwindow

2253725
children	parent
now i used getparent and enumchildwindows to get the parent or children for a given hwnd and i assumed that this relationship is symmetrical

2253751
goto	break
popular statements for terminating a language loop are break continue goto return throw and exit

2253803
for-loop	arrays
inside this right_container_mc i have other other movie clips called execisebox that get added in the correct positions on the stage from an arrays with a for-loop

2253809
postorder	inorder
we know that the last element in postorder is the root so we locate the root at the inorder sequence and subdivide like this

2253811
versioning	upgrade
when people upgrade from the free versioning to the paid versioning i d like the free database to be copied to the pro database location

2253851
post	put
i m fairly sure i put this together using info from the ibm ldd forum but the exact source is lost in the mists of time and memory so apologies if i ve copied someone s post

2253854
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following works in google-chrome 4.0 firefox 3.5.7 safari 4.0.4 ie 7 and ie 8

2253875
vb.net	vb6
i am having problems when using a vb.net dll in a vb6 program

2253913
sorting	filtering
it seems storing the derived status for the main item would be wrong but sorting and filtering for this information can be troublesome as well

2254013
accessor	properties
or perhaps memory being leaking in your initializer or properties accessor

2254018
strcpy	strncpy
you d better use strcpy or strncpy if you are not absolutely sure what are you doing by using shared memory

2254071
put	get
i am not sure about iis6 but i created a new website in iis7 i could not get things to work under a virtual directory but that is probably my lack of iis knowledge i put my .svc file in the root directory and in services

2254098
google-chrome	safari
i tested in ie5.5 6 7 8 ff3.6 google-chrome 4.0.249.89 and safari 4.0.4 on windows xp

2254098
post	get
sorry about the links so won t let me post more than one until i get a higher reputation

2254102
implements	extends
am i forced to use and or extends implements the zend_db methods interfaces in order to have zend_auth integrated in a web site web application

2254138
int	boolean
int works just fine as a boolean type

2254158
rsa	dsa
rsa or dsa keys so it returns either

2254217
entities	entitymanager
as ruggs said if you are managing the entitymanager lifecycle yourself as opposed to having cmp container managed persistence done by a j2ee then you need to close the entitymanager yourself or at least call entitymanager.clear to detach entities

2254217
entities	entitymanager
all the entities that load persist through an entitymanager stay in memory until you explicitly detach the entities from it via entitymanager.detach or entitymanager.clear or entitymanager.close

2254217
entities	entitymanager
if you persist 1000000 entities via the same entitymanager without detaching them after you will get a oome doesn t matter if you persist each entity in it s own entitytransaction

2254251
prepare	execute
i use a prepare statement and then execute it with parameters

2254303
boost	stl
most implementations of the stl and most of boost of course takes advantage of this to the fullest

2254409
getter	setter
if these are member variables and you still want to access them individually but pack them into a struct don t forget you can make the struct private and write simple getter setter functions for accessing the individual values

2254419
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
ruby people are using a language that s already pretty functional and they re using it on a number of underlying runtimes jruby ironruby mri macruby rubinius etc...

2254451
getter	setter
second if you want to add any custom logic to your getter and setter you have no choice

2254462
getter	setter
c# 2.0 does not support this and requires the private variable with the explicit getter and setter

2254462
getter	setter
therefore a lot of older code or backwards compatible code will use the explicit getter and setter

2254549
int	chars
chars aren t numbers in clojure though it s easy to cast them into chars with the int function

2254590
udp	tcp
there are downsides - udp transmission is not reliable or guaranteed in the same way as tcp

2254607
versioning	upgrade
due to complicated office policy reasons i must not upgrade or modify my versioning of ajaxcontroltoolkit but for anyone else who has this error it was apparently fixed as of last june

2254685
ggplot2	lattice
now you can use lattice or ggplot2 to make plots

2254689
button	checkbox
for some reason it took two clicks to bind the form with the checkbox values so the onchange simulated the first click and the regular button is the second

2254697
width	height
lets say for example that these are my rectangles constructor takes the arguments x y width height

2254721
int	boolean
it converts the boolean to an int and it works .

2254734
javassist	cglib
another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

2254763
folder	directory
applicationwillterminate method of your app delegate simply store content of that dictionary to plist somewhere under you app directory structure documents folder is a good choice

2254766
button	checkbox
i m at a bit of a loss on how to proceed without massive rework of the vb6 content to change the options button to checkbox

2254809
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t make any sense because i can login with firefox and google-chrome successfully

2254839
google-chrome	firefox
it is odd that firefox and google-chrome are not throwing the yellow screen of death

2254849
isapi	httpmodule
i inherited a very antiquated c++ isapi filter that secures a classic asp website and was tasked with the job of creating an httpmodule to directly replace it

2254966
glfw	fltk	glut	fltk	glut	glfw
a couple of alternatives to glut both apparently in active development are glfw and fltk

2254966
glut	glfw
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

2254966
glut	fltk
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself

2254966
ati	nvidia
edit2 when if you decide you want to play around with shaders both amd ati and nvidia have developer web pages

2254978
hex	binary
try looking at the text file in a binary hex editor - i suspect you ll find that every other byte is 0

2255009
hmac	md5
you could append the secret to timestamp instead of pre-pending but in general you are better off using hmac with sha1 digest hmac is just construction and can use md5 or sha as digest algorithms

2255038
restrict	shared
all accounts would shared the single database but each one would need to be able to restrict access to their data

2255064
maven	pom.xml
you can do this fairly easily from within maven using the surefire plugin i usually clean compile install my projects from the command line before comparing them for eclipse usage mvn eclipse clean eclipse eclipse and you can define a test suite in your pom.xml which lists all the tests you want to run en masse every time you run mvn install

2255073
post	get
verbs limit to get post

2255081
put	get
put the keywords together to get

2255081
put	get
put the keywords together to get

2255163
actionscript	mxml
i always thought that separating the ui from the logic is the way to go like the use of class files in flash cs3 cs4 or mvc in web frameworks but recently there are plenty of examples and posts using actionscript embedded in mxml

2255169
button	checkbox
i m having a problem with getting my radio button laid out and checkbox correctly in ie8

2255169
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera all working however

2255192
entities	entitymanager
best so far add the base project s entities package in the persistence.xml using the class tag as explained in hibernate entitymanager s setup documentation

2255222
actionscript	mxml
in my experience there s not much of a difference whether you write a component in actionscript + mxml or solely in actionscript

2255232
int	chars
however to use flood fill i would use a matrix of int because you might have more areas than the max value of a chars

2255240
int	double
works only for basic types like int double ulong etc

2255241
min	max
min max

2255249
width	height
also to make it as efficient as possible don t resize your images using style tags or inline width height but instead use something like php gd or imagemagick to actually make thumbnails in the sizes you need to display

2255263
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
and again clojure is much more pragmatic than both other functional languages like haskell and other lisp like scheme and much simpler and more modern than commonlisp so it is a natural fit for rubyists

2255269
gridview	objectdatasource
i m using an ods objectdatasource backed-up with a linq-to-sql class to populate gridview on my page

2255321
filesystems	fat
to install mingw on fat filesystems

2255330
actionscript	mxml
whatever you do though remember that if you are merely calling a separate script file for an mxml component foo.mxml calls foo.as for its actionscript you are losing the code highlighting feature that helps you work between the mxml and the actionscript

2255346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to debug use firebug in firefox or webinspector that build-in in safari and google-chrome

2255380
hide	show
just show the image before you start the ajax call and then in your ajax success or complete handler hide it

2255422
getter	setter
or should dtos be pure data containers with no additional methods other than getter setter

2255433
getter	setter
dtos should not have behaviour they are mere containers for transporting data across process boundries and should consist of setter getter only

2255442
hide	show
in beforesend callback you have to show the spinner and in complete you have to hide it

2255459
put	get
go get jstl 1.2 here and drop it in web-inf lib after removing any old jstl libraries jstl.jar and standard.jar and the eventual extracted contents some poor tutorials namely suggests that you need to extract the .tld files and put it in classpath this is wrong

2255483
folder	directory
apart from the vs2010 ide you may also run your tests with echo a powerful console application located in the bin folder of the gallio installation directory icarus winform application with a nice ui

2255483
teamcity	nant
you can also invoke the test runner from one of the numerous extensions of gallio for msbuild nant teamcity etc

2255509
ubuntu	linux
edit i m using linux ubuntu 9.10 and python 2.6.2

2255515
maven	pom.xml
assuming you re using maven add this dependency to your pom.xml

2255553
put	get
the queue itself has a limit of 10 entries and once that limit is reached no more packets will get put onto the queue

2255553
packets	multicast
as an alternative you could route these multicast packets in userspace using by receiving them on a raw socket and then forwarding them out whatever interface you like

2255572
for-loop	arrays
first of all i wouldn t use for-in i d use a simple for-loop to iterate over the arrays

2255586
button	checkbox
i m trying my best to figure out a succinct straightforward widget using standard ui widgets available in any toolkit checkbox radio button or listboxes that could model a true false null value

2255592
geocoding	geocode
according to the google maps docs the google maps api provides a client geocode for geocoding addresses

2255630
ssl	https
a have a perl cron job that recently started having its https connections start failing with an error of 500 ssl read timeout

2255650
rss	feed
ie i have a rss reader widget that passes the rss feed i m reading from

2255650
width	height
i have a chart that gets the width and height and the sproc from the custom data passed in

2255716
innodb	myisam
ok so i had to use various table types like black hole merge innodb and myisam in just the right laces

2255723
equals	compareto
if this were my code i d start with comparing the equals compareto and hashcode implementations with the database definitions - if these methods compare more fields than the database requires for uniqueness hibernate might consider two objects to be different even if they end up using the same key in the database

2255751
try-catch	exception-handling
apparently chrome won t pause on the exception-handling if it s inside a try-catch block though

2255778
directx	gdi
on windows you can use the gdi or directx apis to load images to memory

2255778
tiff	png
boost.gil which apparently has support for jpeg png and tiff files.

2255822
folder	directory
to see if a path is a folder directory use nsfilemanager s -fileexistsatpath isdirectory

2255842
intersect	contains
one result point contains the intersection location if they do intersect or if they are coincident at one point

2255898
width	height
if i wasn t clear before i need for the width to be fixed and the cell height that contains the long text to be enlarged and display the text in 2 lines

2255935
inherited	properties
note that it is almost always a bad idea to actually use this in 99 of cases the data template should take care of hooking up related controls by setting their properties or it is better handled with attached inherited properties

2255938
implements	extends
you can optionally also let your servlet both extends httpservlet and implements servletcontextlistener like follows

2255954
kde	gnome
you can look at how nautilus gnome or konqueror kde generate previews for various file types

2256037
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
second in straight javascript you can call getelementbyid to verify it exists or getelementsbytagname to loop through all the divs and count the number that match your criteria

2256045
post	get
so in order for this to work out we are having to post data to that script since using a get the max size of the url is exceeded at times

2256055
put	get
well i don t really get the point just don t put anything in the session if you don t want to use it

2256077
expander	grid
there is a way to make it appear that a single expander has separate layout for its header and content so they can be in separate grid cells or even totally separate parts of the window

2256114
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this works perfectly however in ie and google-chrome the button jumps to the top of the page and then animates to position instead of animating from where it started from

2256165
width	height
if the document you are transcoding doesn t have have a attribute then the and attributes will be used so the aoi will be 0 0 width height

2256200
vmware	virtualbox
i suppose you could run your jvm within a virtualized environment virtualbox vmware instance with one processor allocated but i m not sure that that gets you what you want

2256230
16-bit	64bit
i don t recall if we ever found a runaway program but the values corresponding to 0xcc in various values 52 428 unsigned 16 bit -19 660 signed 16-bit -107374176 32-bit float and -9.25596313493e+61 64bit float popped up in a lot of unexpected places

2256232
width	height
will not let me scale my .swf to 100 width and 100 height

2256232
width	height
width is fine but the height is not

2256245
content-length	content-type
even when the content-type and content-length is wrong safari just downloads the file

2256282
calloc	malloc
without telling you my personal preference 1 if you belong to the first camp you would want to calloc instead of malloc

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the initialize everything camp you don t calloc but malloc because you are initializing floating-point numbers or pointers and you know that all bits zero doesn t necessarily mean 0 for them

2256320
config	ini
keep the config details in a separate protected ini file or even the php.ini file and you can pretty much ignore the server-side scripting after that

2256324
accessor	properties
also notice that properties class is slightly modified to include a get accessor to return the object in question.

2256326
width	height
the new browser appears the correct height and width but the left and top attributes are ignored so the window appears top-left

2256329
for-loop	loops
gcc not only figured out we were doing a for-loop but also realized it was to be run a constant number of times did loops for us at compile time chucked out i and sum and hard coded the answer - 55

2256334
width	height
in my css i set the width and height of the image to 100 so that each image would proportionally fill the canvas

2256338
mouse	keyboard
it s important to think about workflow how commonly used the control would be whether you can replace it with direct manipulation whether a visible indication of its state is necessary whether it s operable from the keyboard and mouse where appropriate and so forth

2256346
nsurl	nsstring
use the -stringbyaddingpercentescapesusingencoding method on nsstring before passing it to nsurl

2256350
gridview	sqldatasource
that way your sqldatasource control will execute the select when databinding the existing gridview not the copy

2256377
put	get	stdout	fflush
when you put it at the beginning of the line you end up with stdout not being fflush so you get multiple printouts when the parent and child processes both fflush their output buffers

2256400
fadein	fadeout
the normal behavior when using fadein and fadeout is to use the display property

2256403
int	chars
in c you have data types chars short int long that can all be used to store int of various sizes

2256403
16-bit	64bit
i ll ignore long long for this discussion. let s say for sake of generality that on a given 32-bit platform the sizes are 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit respectively

2256423
hash	md5
i want to truncate an md5 hash to about half size

2256430
width	height
by taking half of the height and width 100 and 75 respectively you can pinpoint the center of the window

2256435
put	get
when i put the array value in front of the time variable i get the incorrect time

2256454
hash	md5
following the table posted on the above link assuming your digests are 64 bits each since a single md5 hash is 128 bits and that md5 have a uniform distribution there is a very low chance that two hash will collide

2256460
folder	directory
in this case the working folder would actually be the lower directory

2256479
tolower	uppercase
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

2256548
addition	multiplication
if you work through this sequence of questions you should be able to write a function for each step and re-use those functions to answer the later questions and end up with a very simple and unoptimized long well up to maxdigit digits integer package for addition and multiplication of positive numbers

2256578
width	height
if your layout is fixed which means you have defined width height then the min- max- rules will be ignored as the width height have precedence over those

2256579
post	get
if i post the form with nothing entered in any of the fields i consistently get a value of true for modelstate.isvalid

2256581
inherited	properties
the concept of cascading style sheets is that there are rules that dictate other rules up and down the chain hence the inclusion of inherited as a properties

2256581
min	max
for example if you use a container div and you specify an max and min then you would need to recalculate every time you adjust a div underneath it for example if you wanted the header to be wider

2256590
post	get
the possible methods are get in the url or post not

what you need to do is define it as an application folder adding a virtual directory does this by default so that s why it works

2258018

postorder	inorder
if you have an inorder traversal and a postorder traversal for a general binary tree they don t even define the tree uniquely if you can have duplicated values the sequence 1 1 1 for both postorder and inorder can be one of the following trees

2258620
postorder	inorder
suppose you have a postorder traversal list x1 x2 ... xn and inorder traversal list y1 ... yk ... yn so that xn yk

2258620
postorder	inorder
the inorder traversal is 9 3 2 5 6 4 1 and the postorder 9 2 3 4 1 6 5

2258620
postorder	inorder
in the inorder 6 4 1 the left-subtree is empty and the right is 4 1 so from the postorder list 4 1 6 you take as the left-subtree and 4 1 as the right subtree

2258657

2258956
public	protected
i would have listed them public private protected package private with an explanation of each

2258956

32-bit int are at least wide enough to solve the code point problem but they still don t handle corner cases upcasing something can change the number of chars

2259641
int	double
i thought this would take out the double occurrence of this but it returns a list of each word int he phrase

2259649
equals	gethashcode
note that if you decide to implement your own version of equals you also need to correctly implement gethashcode

2259680
agile	sprint
in other words scrum like all agile methods requires active customer involvement and if your customer isn t there for the demo of the product you re developing for him if he s not there for the sprint planning meeting if he isn t available to answer questions in other words if he s not involved your implementation of scrum will very likely be suboptimal i m extrapolating about the other points but i wonder how you will handle them with a remote customer

all other browsers ie5-8 safari google-chrome not working

2259701

the user experience will be determined by gnome or kde not the distro

2259852
kde	gnome
there are two desktops gnome and kde

2259852
kde	gnome
in general you can choose gnome or kde with any distro and you can even install both

now if you went and installed say netbsd then you might notice some real differences although you would still have your choice of gnome or kde

2259882
openbsd	freebsd
give openbsd or perhaps freebsd a chance

2259889
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

2259896
yacc	bison	yacc	sablecc	bison	sablecc
if you absolutely must have an ll 1 grammar then you obviously will need to press on if you get into a situation like this but if you re allowed to use parser generators like yacc bison or sablecc then you will in the long run most likely find it a lot easier to go down that route

2259935
uiview	subviews
you can just add a subviews a uiimageview to the navaigationbar which is just a uiview subclass

2259987

2260107
int	chars
kind of like yylineno except that it returns the chars position as an int

2260117
punctuation	words
using the split method of strings as another answer suggests would not identify words but space-separated chunks that may include punctuation

2260117
punctuation	words
this re -based solution does identify words letters and digits net of punctuation

2260130
rar	zip
a password-protected rar or zip file would be as good a method as any

this code should draw the test rectangles only when the height is less than the width and otherwise the window should remain clear

2260144
centos	linux
i decided that i greatly preferred using os x or centos linux for ruby development

2260217
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you change ienumerable to iqueryable then source.where would also return an iqueryable when called and seeing as source itself would be an iqueryable the whole return statement would succeed in either case

2260229
for-loop	arrays
.findall should be faster it takes advantage of already knowing the list s size and looping through the internal arrays with a simple for-loop

tortoisegit	svn
some research turned up the git svn command and that tortoisegit claims to have some level of git-svn support

2260283
tortoisegit	svn
so i m hoping someone out there can provide a reasonably detailed set of instructions on how to correctly use tortoisegit with an existing svn repository with the repository on either the local filesystem or on a remote server

2260283
tortoisegit	svn
if you feel tortoisegit s svn support isn t mature enough to make this work that would also be useful information

2260292
hide	show
this will properly show hide each element regardless of the number of times the user changes the selection

2260292

at deployment the application can check the current deployed versioning and it then runs all the upgrade scripts that bring the versioning to current

2260300
versioning	upgrade
there is no script to deploy straight the current versioning a new deployment deploys first v0 of the database it then goes through all versioning upgrade including dropping object that are no longer used

2260300

2260425
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button work a little differently than your standard inputs

2260425
button	checkbox

it can also be due to the target assembly not being built for the neccessary platform a 64bit process cannot load an assembly built for x86 only

2260795
width	height
in order to cache properly you need to use a predictable naming convention that takes into account all the different ways that you want your image displayed use something like myimage_blurred_320x200.jpg to save a jpeg that has been blurred and resized to 300 width and 200 height etc

2260795

2260795
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
note image can be a created from a jpg gif png or bmp

2260800

x86	64bit
under 64bit windows you might need to ensure you are running a 32bit instance x86 of psh to do this depending if the live writer component runs in or out of process

2260844
firefox	safari
but instead both firefox 3.6 and safari 4 show this haven t tested in other browsers

2260872
width	height
form elements have traditionally had a width height that includes their padding border because they were originally implemented by browsers as os-native ui widgets where css had no influence over the decorations

2260872
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
to reproduce this behaviour firefox and others render some form fields select button input-type-button with the css3 box-sizing style set to border-box so that the width property reflects the entire rendered area width including the border and padding

2260872
width	border-box
or which is more common for liquid form layouts where you want to use â 100 â width you can set the others to border-box .

2260931
ubuntu	linux
the reason for this is i have windows 7 i don t want to install ubuntu as a secondary operating system and i need to use a linux operating system for testing

i might miss something but since this behaves as expected when using just show and hide i thought that it could be a bug

2261969
post	get
this forum post has a reasonable code sample to get you started

2261990
width	height
image read by gd imagemagick or graphicsmagic is stored as bitmap so it consumes width height 3 or 4 bytes and there s nothing you can do about it

2261994

testdriven.net	xunit.net
personally i have found xunit.net testdriven.net and moq to be a very flexible set of test tools

2262139
int	double
perhaps we are checking to see if a string is a keyword so we have to look up whether a given string is inside the set int double for foreach class .

2262139
put	get
we could put those in a hash set and get decent performance

2262152
division	modulo
if so this should work and it should also be a lot quicker than using modulo and division

for the config values i would suggest you to use ini files and handle it with parse_ini_file function which is a lot more easier way than resorting to sqllite

2262367
apache	nginx
i m trying to migrate a working expressionengine installation from an apache environment over to an nginx environment on a different box

2262457

i guess the target uri needs a clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml file in the root

2262476
pdfsharp	migradoc
the only other option that i ve come across is using migradoc + pdfsharp but you must author the document via migradoc pdfsharp directly it can t be a pre-made printdocument

merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails 3 beta just came out recently and it seems have significant performance improvement especially with the merge with merb

2262675
width	height
if you don t want to do display try changing height width or add remove flow or clear parameters

2262681
getter	setter
i ve found the only way to share a variable between two threads would be to create a getter setter via prototyping and then use postmessage onmessage.

2262718
hide	show
i m not sure why you re against scripting to achieve this especially since you re going to need at least some amount of scripting in order to show and hide the loader at the right times

2262723
profiling	debugging
for debugging you can use a profiling like yourkit a commercial java profiling

2262733

ant	maven
maven or a nice ant script with ivy for dependencies management

2262921
ienumerable	iqueryable
having the ability to query any enumerable is extremely powerful especially given the way linq ienumerable t and iqueryable t are designed

2262921
ienumerable	iqueryable
beyond the basic ienumerable and iqueryable stuff linq also introduced the system.linq.expressions namespace

since the exponent as stored is unsigned it is possible to use integer instructions to compare floating point values

2263012
elf	coff
the coff format itself originated on unix although microsoft has extended the format somewhat and the unix seems to have abandoned that format in favor of elf

2263017
octal	binary
a helpful thing to recall here is that integer literals that start with 0 are expressed in octal which means that you can read the binary digits right out of the on-screen representation well with a little practice anyway

2263027
google-chrome	firefox
the function works well with firefox and google-chrome presumbaly it would work with all moz derivative browsers

2263077

2263647
google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs with both ff3 and safari i m on snow leopard so i can t test with ie or google-chrome

2263719
inherited	properties
since it inherited derives from myfoo it will have all of the properties and functionality of myfoo with the additional properties as well

2263736
inherited	properties
anytime you need to add a properties to it for the external project you can then inherited the class and add the properties there

2263738
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if however your user base is located primarily in the us and uses ie google-chrome safari or firefox than you can use the tostring method on a date object to obtain the timezone

2263746
inherited	properties
maybe it s generated trying to collect information on the real error that would explain the attempt to use the serializer try to comment out all the insides of your custom control so it simply inherited from the base class and try again ok you may need to leave some properties definitions

2263762
subtract	add
i know i could convert my radians into degrees then add subtract 180 degrees then convert back to radians but i m looking for something more efficient

2263780
subtract	add
add subtract pi instead

2263991
keydown	keyup
it turns out that on keyup keydown the ascii uppercase non-shifted version of a key is always returned

2263991
keydown	keyup
pressing shift+a counts as two keydown events when the keys are pressed down and two keyup event when the keys are released

2263991
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup return the value of a single key while ignoring any key combinations

2263991
keydown	keyup
so somewhere along the line the browser is taking the lowercase a ascii code 97 transforming it to uppercase a then passing it keydown keyup as the non-shifted character

2263994
width	height
in that example nsautoreleasepool pool img size width and height should be highlighted however they are not

use the class-path entry in the meta-inf manifest.mf to tell where to look for dependencies relatively to your jar

2264186
mouse	keyboard
in .net winforms i want to display message in a status bar and suspend the program execution until user moves mouse or presses keyboard

2264231
client-side	server-side
dataannotations are a useful feature of asp.net mvc 2 it really does provide a nice cheap way to get both server-side and client-side validation

2264320
post	get
on release post will send to each element release which will decrement ref count to 1 so elements does not get deallocated and you end up with memory leak

2264388
getter	setter
i have formbean class with customername date amount rate etc with setter and getter for the field members

2264399
folder	directory
if you are using applescript would it be possible to attach a folder action to the volumes directory or maybe the specific subdirectory on which the kindle mounts to back up the files

2264413
folder	directory
you could either use applescript and attach a folder action to the volumes directory or you could write a launch agent that watches that path

2264571
rss	feed
i have one table with users and another table with rss feed urls

2264584
textarea	input-field
i now create a new div in which i place the new input-field so each textarea which has a tinymce editor is in his own div

2264647
waitpid	fork
when invoking fork 2 or waitpid 2

2264664
put	get
you would need to put in appropriate constants to for various terms to try to get the acceptance rate around 50

2264801
ncover	nant
we had a similar problem with attribute exclusion when we triggered ncover 1.5.8 from nant

2264994
freemarker	velocity
i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo

2265109
width	height
firstly the width and height attributes of an input should be integers rather than length values

2265109
width	height
secondly and this is what s causing the problem as you can prove by changing the input type to image width and height attributes are only appropriate and only affect rendering in the browser for inputs of type image

2265116
getter	setter
methods can be virtual so when you declare a virtual property you are declaring virtual getter and setter methods

2265124
awt	swing
i d avoid reusing any names declared in at least java.lang java.io java.util and java.net along with the common classes used in awt swing jdbc and a few other subsystems

2265195
inherited	properties
second for...in iterates over all enumerable properties of an object including those inherited from its prototype

2265234
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am developing a web api with 10 tables or so in the backend with several one-to-many and many-to-many associations

2265234
getter	setter
since the queries are tied directly to the api and its business logic they are hard to generalize like getter and setter

2265293
portrait	landscape
ideally i would like to eventually develop an ipad version of the app where the grid would be 3 items wide in portrait and 4 in landscape however for the time being i would like 2 items wide in portrait and 3 wide in landscape

2265378
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as such this sounds like a perfect use-case for a uinavigationcontroller with two uiviewcontroller if you would like to use proper and standard iphone mvc design

2265413
width	height
note prior to iphone os 3.0 uiview instances may have a maximum height and width of 1024 x 1024

2265443
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
and the documentation for listadapter lists simplecursoradapter as one of its own indirect subclasses

2265478
strstr	substr
the key is to use string manipulatin functions such as strstr strpos and substr

2265491
rss	feed
i would recommend using rss feed to extract content

2265534
ant	maven
an alternative to maven if you just want to use ant is ivy

2265568
width	height
which gives my rectangle and height of 2 and a width of 4

2265608
next	except
button next to the property value - nothing happens except this button disappears

2265608
ubuntu	linux
new discoveries i found out that it might not even be an android problem but a general eclipse problem that i can see with all version ganymede galileo helios on my linux ubuntu system

2265635
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you move through 3 uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller

2265748
public	protected
remember that a protected member is essentially just a slightly more restricted public member since it can be accessed by client code as long as it s in a descendant class

2265768
public	protected
1st one is fine in your 2nd sample using public protected you just break that.

2265770
getter	setter
second example is an automatic property and is generally used when you don t have any logic in getter and setter

2265774
getter	setter
for the most part in applications i ve written if the getter and setter aren t more complicated than your examples you probably want to minimize the code as much as possible for readability so the shorthand approach is very useful

2265774
getter	setter
on the other hand if you implement more complicated logic in the getter and setter for example validation or parsing of some sort you want to make sure that no user class bypasses your logic

2265774
public	protected
you know the difference between private protected and public and thus you also know what you can and cannot do with your class depending on which one you choose

2265776
prepare	execute
but before the business logic was execute those controls was either blank or contained dummy-text prepare for translation

2265780
post	put
without the line breaks of course i put them in this post only to

2265820
getter	setter
write automatic properties nâº 2 as the default unless your getter setter has some kind of logic in it otherwise the property or the field is there for nothing - you have to agree that a public property that direct accesses its private field is the same as a public field or auto-propeprty

2265847
tax	shipping	inherited	subclassing
for example if the discount and the tax and the shipping method all varied depending on the type of item then it s definitely time to consider inherited and subclassing where you d say this subtype of item has this tax and this discount and this shipping

the navigation item is not null because i can call and it hide the backbutton every time but the title isn t show

2266304

2266437
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
i have a listactivity binding to a database with a custom simplecursoradapter

2266442

2266548
sharepoint	splist
i have an splist item in sharepoint and i want to find out the size on disk of the list

2266554
post	get
in other words it seems that i lose the post data as soon as i pass the get request for another page back to my views

2266555
hide	show
simply handle the event and resize hide show your controls

2266642
realloc	malloc
the reason i used realloc in place of malloc is because all my realloc calls are in a loop so instead of sizeof node in the second argument it is actually n sizeof node where n keeps on incrementing.

2266649
folder	directory
i need to create a file directory in the common application data folder that will be shared across all accounts

2266649
folder	directory
if i create the file directory as admin i have no problem but if i create the file directory as a user the file directory goes into the virtualized folder for the user s account

2266653
realloc	malloc
and since realloc acts like malloc when it s passed a null pointer it should work just fine

2266663
powermockito	jmockit
you could use powermockito or jmockit

2266677

if you are testing the dependant item then you can mock the singleton using powermockito and jmockit

2266796
bionic	libc
libc is bionic and malloc is doug lea version named dlmalloc with use_locks enabled for thread-safety

2266816
folder	directory
if you set the rights of everything including directory to 644 744 nobody except the owner will be able to browse the directory structure of particular folder

2266827
comparator	comparable
now looking back at this i am wondering if i should have instead have the my class implement comparable instead of creating a new class that implements comparator

2266865
subclass	accessor
i would like my instance classes to be able to use an accessor named cgi to get the cgi object associated with the current instance of my cgi application subclass

2266865
inherited	subclassing
this is working as i think it should and i cannot see any problems say if i wanted to inherited from my merhaba subclassing need not know anything about merhaba

2266868
comparator	comparable
if it is the latter odds are every future sorting use case would require a comparator at which point the implementation of comparable may slow down users of the class not speed them up

2266921
superclass	subclassing
but if the class is extended i assumed this would return the name of the subclassing but it still returns the name of the superclass which i find kind of odd

2266929
implements	extends
using a jtable the traditional way to create such a table would be to have a class implements tablemodel or extends abstracttablemodel or defaulttablemodel

2266934
post	get
basically i want to hit the page with a get or post and have it run and check and or update the permissions on a folder

2266950
post	get

2266967
post	get
you might get some mileage from this post

2266974
typedef	struct
try adding typedef struct request_queue request_queue_t

2266978
gendarme	fxcop
gendarme is a bit like fxcop and has a avoidcodeduplicatedinsameclassrule rule this looks very promising as it avoids the problem of working at the text level

2267016
super	self
the problem was as i found out the usage of super extendedrequest self since urllib2.request is i m on python 2.5 still an old style class where the use of super is not possible

folder	directory
stat.h is available under the sys folder try to #include it from there or add it to the list of include directory

2267272
128bit	64bit
i would definitely go for the easiest solution and just store them as integers of a suitable size be it 32-bit 64bit or 128bit depending on needs

2267280
postgresql	mysql
most sql databases mysql postgresql etc. operate via a client-server architecture so you re not embedding or linking to the database code in your program and thus you don t have to use a license compatible with those database systems

2267285
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and opera the onchange handler occurs immediately after the user changes the checked state

i am actually in a hurry and could not put a detailed code on post but any help in this regard is appreciated

2267366

2267381
exponent	modulo
for every y1 y2 ... y t+1 just calculated you generate a vector v yi e1 e2 ... et where ei is calculated by reducing over modulo 2 the exponent pi in yi

2267534
width	height
the thing is i want to have the image width height stored into that collection

2267559
getter	setter
i m pretty sure that the annotation needs to be on the getter or the property itself and not the setter

2267583
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
i have a navigation app which drills between table views by calling pushviewcontroller on the navigationcontroller object

2267629
post	put
well if you have used the functionality in your post the content will be cut off on the home page where you put the tag

2267654
post	get
i ve also noted other post admittedly from a long time ago where people have failed to get this setting to work simply by setting it in the tomcat config files

2267673
activemodel	mongomapper
there is a rails3 branch of mongomapper using activemodel

2267675
gif	bmp	width	height
it s been a long time since i did raw processing of image files but i would think that with the most common formats gif bmp jpg etc... you can probably find the height width within the first few hundred bytes or less of the file

2267683
width	height
it appears that one browser is stretching the height width to fill the div without keeping the image s height width ratio whereas the other is using the image s dimensions to scale it properly

2267686
interpreted-language	compiled-language
unfortunately with compiled-language such as c c++ java or c# you won t be able to just run new code at runtime like you can do in interpreted-language like php perl and ecmascript

2267698
ubuntu	linux
i have now moved the sources to my ubuntu box and want to build the libs for use on my linux box

2267732
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that example page should work in firefox and google-chrome and i think safari and it half-works in ie8 only half because of course we couldn t have expected microsoft to get -ms-border-box to work properly

2267787
sip	sdp
so my sip works but it doesn t like the sdp data

2267799
min	max
minimax enumerates all of the possibilities to a specified depth d then assigns a score to the nodes game states at d and moving back up the tree returns the max or min node at each depth based on whether i m the maximizing player or the minimizing player

2267811
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
or gm4ie for ie or greasemetal for google-chrome personalizedweb also works in a much simpler way for google-chrome greasekit for safari or user.js for opera

2267836
manual	jmp
volume 2a page 3-549 in my copy of the manual has a huge pile of information about jmp

2267841
post	get
the first important thing is the meaning of get versus post

2267843
post	get
another difference is that post generally requires two http operations whereas get only requires one

2267844
post	get
post can move large data while get cannot

2267847
post	get
use get if you want to read data without changing state and use post if you want to update state on the server

2267861
post	get
http post data doesn t have a specified limit on the amount of data where as different browsers have different limits for get s

2267864
width	height
find the width and height of dialog b and create an overlay on that dialog alone with a message telling the user the action they must take to clear that overlay

2267879
post	get

2267879
post	get
1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

2267879
post	get
however before the final decision to use http get or post please also consider considerations for sensitive data and practical considerations

2267879
post	get
you specify either post or get for the form action

2267881
vim	textmate
if you use a decent editor such as textmate or vim this is an easy task

2267939
accessor	properties
i believe the error you re receiving is from the invalid properties accessor

2267980
accessor	properties
this is why you should use properties or explicit accessor

2268027
width	height
you ll need to provide it with the factors by which you want to scale the width and height as a fixed32

2268027
width	height
here s some sample code which determines the scale factor for the width and height by dividing the original image size by the desired size using rim s fixed32 class

2268041
post	get
as answered by others there s a limit on url size with get and files can be submitted with post only

2268041
post	get
i d like to add that one can add things to a database with a get and perform actions with a post

2268041
post	get
when a script receives a post or a get it can do whatever the author wants it to do

2268041
post	get
a script author should use post to change the database and use get only for retrieval of information

2268041
post	get
for example php allows the use of to retrieve either a post or a get

2268041
post	get
you should use post to change data and you should use get to retrieve information

2268118
folder	directory
your app will be folder inside is your home directory

2268125
cvs	rcs
or you could take advantage of the fact that cvs and rcs store the latest version of the file on head near the top of the file and any other revisions are created by applying diffs internally

2268127
cvs	rcs
cvs was just a front end to rcs and the .v files are really rcs files

2268175
min	max
i want to find the fastest way to get the min and max of a column in a table with a single linq to sql roundtrip

2268204
width	height
i have a favicon with the dimensions of height 26px width 20px named favicon.png

2268211
min	max
you could select the whole table and do your min and max operations in memory

2268224
rss	feed
i m attempting to parse media rss feed that contain media elements but it seems as though all of the standard rss parsing libraries for ruby only support enclosures not mrss elements

2268233
n-gram	words
for example an n-gram of two would probably make it very hard to create words over 6 but an n-gram of 4 would be very easy

2268323

using iis configuration i can block direct access to all folder in the web directory

2268330
width	height
i would like the form to come up at the size of 450px by 700px but no matter what i set the height and width at i get scrollbars

2268385
post	get
i think i can post some of code snippets not all of them to get a better way of doing things and to validate my understanding of scala

2268411
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
the primitive java types boolean byte chars short int long float and double and the keyword void are also represented as class objects

2268493
public	protected
edit fields can be private protected or public

2268603
try-catch	exception-handling
a common pattern is to have an autocommit false the default scopedsession in a module and wrap any business logic execution in a try-catch clause that rolls back in case of exception-handling and commits if the method succeeded then finally calls session.remove

2268609
executable	upx
technically it is possible to embed some other executable files in your exe some packers like upx do it

2268665
expander	grid
you could also implement the row expander ux on the grid which behaves like a tree sort of for each row

2268668
superclass	subclassing
and when i need it pull up that is make a method on a subclassing be a method on the superclass instead is really nice to have

2268670
getter	setter
rename it can also rename getter setter and references in comments literals and even non java files like hibernate mapping files

2268672
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
i have created a model called user which contains e-mail strong md5 hash with salt of password etc

i want to configure this in the httpd.conf and not using .htaccess if possible

2268868

if i do a jquery post it breaks my code and i get no response

2268870
jboss	glassfish
as long as you re using the weld implementation as glassfish v3 and jboss 6 do but the weld-wicket is rather small so you could probably adapt it if needed

2268885
haskell	ocaml
i m hoping to use either haskell or ocaml on a new project because r is too slow

2268900
post	get
for get endpoints it s not problem to check for 404s but i d like to check post endpoints without triggering whatever action resides on the remote url

2268913
min	max
i could find only this one which produces somewhat clean sql still not really effective comparing to select min val max val from table

2268913
min	max
still there is another option to use single connection for both min and max queries see multiple active result sets mars

2268914
postgresql	mysql
assuming that the queries are as simple as you have indicated a simple sql db postgresql mysql possibly h2 would be perfect for this

2268961
tinyint	boolean
it will return boolean datatype which in mysql is just a synonym for tinyint 1

2268980
fflush	gets
you should try using them as shown in the spring nhibernate sample and activate logging to really see if the session gets fflush

2269094
put	get	post	put	post	get
with put post or get it works great

2269098
nunit	mstest
in most cases using some kind of unit testing framework mstest nunit etc as others have mentioned will give you better return on your time investment

2269119
innodb	myisam
converting table from myisam to innodb

2269120
getter	setter
the user table is tied through hibernate to a domain object in my application class user which has the following attributes and corresponding getter and setter which correspond to columns in the user table except for the collection which is explained later

2269128
post	get
i can t find anything in the rfc but it stands to reason that there is no way to pass parameters using the delete methods - only in get and post so either jquery or the browser correctly filter out the parameters

2269137
plupload	swfupload
though it s only a single file upload some other projects like swfupload and plupload aim to provide multiple file uploading but are much larger projects and i feel too bulky and take too long to setup on top of the fact that they really aren t that seamless you ll be jumping through hoops on the backend

2269155
innodb	myisam
andrew there are lots of differences between myisam and innodb the least of which is the fact that they are controlled by different configuration options in the mysql conf

2269155
innodb	myisam
there is also the fact that innodb is acid compliant unlike myisam

2269158
width	height
it won t really allow the end user to select the size but you can pass a max width and max height constraint

2269175
inherited	properties

2269229
addition	multiplication
i usually use a combination of addition of a small fixed amount and multiplication by 1.5 because it is efficent to implement and leads to reasonable step widths which are bigger at first and more memory sensible when the buffer grows

2269230
vim	textmate
what i m looking for are some suggestions of vim resources and plugins if that s the right terminology to closely emulate the features i am unwilling to give up in textmate

2269264
vim	textmate
i m currently in a similar position to you moving from textmate to vim

2269289
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i am using an updatepanel scriptmanager and a timer all ajax to refresh mydatalist

2269313
haskell	ocaml
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

2269380
post	get
only allow the methods get post here

2269401
getter	setter
finally i could create data-only container objects with private member data and only getter setter

2269410
user-controls	elementhost
i m more concerned about performance impacts and or feature limitations that would be introduced by hosting the wpf user-controls in an elementhost

versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
i want every new versioning of the installer to be a major upgrade full uninstall then new install as we don t want different upgrade and clean install versioning

2269449
children	parent
if the parent doesn t have any sizing percent or explicit it will need to be sized based on it s children s sizes

2269449
width	height
so if you build a custom coverflowcontainer component and measuredwidth measuredheight aren t set because measure was not overriden then if you don t specify any sizing on coverflowcontainer it would be 0 width 0 height

2269490
post	get
what i need to find out is how to code in php for the script to first get php the_date yyyymmdd and then have wordpress filter events dynamically only displaying post that have a value greater than or equal to the numeric value printed which would be the yyyymmdd format of today which is pulled in via php the_date

2269505
rss	feed
i have a wpf listbox control which displays items of an rss feed

2269505
rss	feed
i occasionally check the source of the rss feed for new items

2269513
getter	setter
if i have property aprop in bean and getter setter for it i create recorddef then record then recrod.set aprop bean.getaprop and so on

2269520
min	max
within that site the most useful tidbit is that you can do sum count min max avg average stdev statistical standard deviation and var

2269531
getter	setter
one can then use in the .m file to automatically create the setter getter

2269535
serializable	deserialization
alternatively you could use something like xstream if you control both serializable and deserialization

2269557
hash	md5
after i d met the performance troubles i tried to add index on argument column but found that i must to specify length so to avoid this limitation i added a new integer column containing hash values md5 or else of argument column values

2269570
put	get
right now you would have to make a much more specific regular expression to get the value of each key value pairs and put them into the replace

2269579
pull	push
the emulator is working perfectly adb can see it i can even logcat from it but it can t push or pull anything from it

2269591
struts	wicket
i d suggest looking at a java web framework such as spring mvc wicket or struts as they simplify development after you learn them and make web apps more testable and maintainable

2269616
folder	directory
also if i try to delete the folder i used to upload to windows tells me cannot remove foldoer the directory is not empty

2269714
for-loop	arrays
a previous for-loop using the i variable to populate the arrays was written the same way and executed as expected

2269725
for-loop	arrays
a different for-loop to populate the arrays was written the same way and executed as expected

2269824
put	get
the 3 depend on the order that i put the items in while in this order item1 item3 item5 get left which leads me to believe that its the remove that is messed up

2269853
children	parent
parent elements are never to expand to contain floated children

2269853
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure google-chrome is doing anything wrong though firefox is different but i don t have time to look at it further right now

2269869
int	chars
if you port the code to an environment where all the basic types chars short int long long long are exactly the same size as what the original developers used and tested with the code will probably work as tested although watch out for those possibly uninitialized variables but

2269918
cimg	libpng	libjpeg	cimg	libjpeg	libpng
i also don t want to use a library except if it is very very lightweight i used cimg for a while but i wasn t very happy with its speed so i ended up writing the important functions myself and just using libjpeg and libpng directly

2269919
put	get
it will print 3.432 just like i want but if i try to put that same value dec into a json object what i get in the json is decimal 3.432

2269923
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome 0.1 + 0.2 is 0.30000000000000004 which is not equal to 0.3

2269933
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
i can use apache lighttpd or nginx servers

2269941
rss	feed
i have created a gae app that parses rss feed using celementtree

2269941
rss	feed
these lines correspond to the following lines in the rss feed i am reading

2269954
stretchblt	bitblt
bitblt or stretchblt from your dc to the target dc

2269979
stretchblt	bitblt
if you have an hbitmap then you would use bitblt or stretchblt to draw it but if you don t already have the image as an hbitmap then stretchdibits is probably a better choice since you can use it if you only have a pointer to the bitmap data

2269991
redmine	trac
take a look at redmine very good project management application built in ror you ve also got trac which is built in python

2269993
haskell	ocaml
ocaml will be easier to learn if you coming from almost any other language this is because haskell is as function as functional languages get and working with mutable random access structures can be a little clunky in haskell

2269993
haskell	ocaml
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation

2269995
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox google-chrome etc you need npapi

2270011
try-catch	exception-handling
there is no exception-handling as this part is within try-catch

2270032
rss	feed
i m trying to select nodes from an rss feed

for-loop	loops
in the if statement inside the while loops to display the information from page2.php that require from one to three prices and variety will have a foreach loops or maybe a for-loop don t know to count how many variety the user choose in page2.php to display it inside the while loops in cart with the help of an if statment that will detect weather it was choosen from page1.php or page2.php

2270078
sqldatasource	formview
while trying to update a formview control bound to an sqldatasource by using a parameterized stored procedure i constantly get an error screen saying too many arguments specified

2270084
imap	nntp
if the email server is imap pop3 or nntp and you want to use php to query for received mail you could do the polling using the imap extension for php

2270166
folder	directory
now if double click the exe the folder tempfolder is created in the same directory as the exe which i expect

2270253
gridview	formview
when i was getting started with formview and gridview i manually added the primary key value using a hidden field and had the datakeynames attribute sent and i think that caused the value to be sent to the stored procedure twice instead of once

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
the problem occurs within the setinterval settimeout javascript functions

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
after sending the email or tapping cancel the timer is left paused and the settimeout setinterval functions will not fire

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
this will break any thing that relies on settimeout setinterval such as jquery animations and any async ajax calls since jquery uses setinterval to poll until the request returns i ve hit this problem myself

2270314
put	get
i understand that if you put a response.redirect inside a try-catch that you re going to get this error unless you specify the 2nd param of the redirect as false

2270337
kde	gnome
for linux you have to deal with different window managers gnome kde all with different ways of managing the clipboard

2270366
kde	gnome
you may also be able to do this independantly of either gnome kde by using dbus although i cannot say 100 confidently on that either.

2270366
kde	gnome
just be aware that for a truly cross-platform job you have to take into account of the different gui s such as under linux x is the main window manager interface and either gnome kde sits on top of it..i am not singling out other gui s such as fluxbox windowmaker to name but a few and that there will be a lot of platform dependant code and also in conjunction you will be dealing with windows clipboard as well..all in all a big integrated code.

2270366
kde	gnome
maybe that might be better as i would imagine gnome kde etc are using the x s api to do the clipboard work...if that is confirmed then the work would be cut out and be independant of the major gui interfaces... i hope that would be the case as it would make life easier for your project

2270366
kde	gnome
perhaps using compile-time switches for each platform...win kde gnome mac or use the one that is already pre-defined

2270370
button	checkbox
the pagination script below seems to generally work but the problem is that on each page of 20 records when i select some rows via checkbox and click the submit button the display of 20 records jumps back to page 1

2270392
button	checkbox
the form that includes the submit button and the checkbox needs to include a hidden input that gives the current value of the ncurrentpage variable

2270406
int	chars
then you can use java.awt.font.candisplay int to check whether a unicode chars can be displayed in that font where the int is the int representation of the multibyte chars

2270416
inherited	subclassing
i would probably add another tree of inherited so a library is an abstract subclassing of hashset

2270416
inherited	subclassing
but i hope you get the picture - subclassing to inherited the functions you need instead of creating them again

2270461
submit	submission
if it involve submission a form use jquery form plugins to submit the form via ajax and then run your close function on a successful form submit

2270500
hide	show
if you truly want a valid way to do it make your main page the nojs.htm page and use js to hide all content before it s show to the user and immediately redirect to the real main page using javascript

2270517
hide	show
i ve tried changing the opacity to all sorts of levels using show and hide setvisiblecore bool on the window but nothing lowers the flicker to an acceptable level

2270566
ienumerable	iqueryable
tolist converts your iqueryable into an ienumerable via and stops it from going to the database again via linq to sql

2270566
ienumerable	iqueryable
this is generally a good design pattern to follow - the last thing you want is consumers of your business layer being able to unwittingly execute arbitrary queries against your database simply because you returned iqueryable where you should have returned ienumerable

2270574
width	height
pass the image.content into imagesnapshot.capturebitmapdata then make sure the width height of the ldr_target is set equal to the src

2270584
udp	tcp
a good starting point for tcp ip is here and for udp here

2270625
tortoisegit	svn
using tortoise svn or tortoisegit

2270678
post	put
it would help narrow it down if you could post some actual code you re seeing problems with as what you ve put here isn t even compilable

2270809
gdi	directdraw
right now it works correctly by drawing the text in the onpaint method using gdi and the video on a directdraw overlay

2270833
folder	directory
so if you move your website from a windows to a unix-server when you change web host for instance you risk getting a certain amount of page not found -errors 404 errors because directory and other websites linking to yours sometimes get the cases wrong typically writing the first letter of folder names in upper-case etc.

2270836
free	malloc
if your c code malloc s and free s every other line of code you re thrashing the heap

2270836
free	malloc
for heap thrashing that s malloc free being your #1 #2 most used functions

2271115
implements	extends
and yes both docor and customer patient are likely to implements or extends person

2271118
inherited	properties
finally the real pom.xml will inherited from the pom2 and will define its own properties

2271118
maven	pom.xml
note that maven 3 talked about introducing the mixin concept which will allow you to fragment your pom.xml into several files but it looks like that is not happening now until maven 4

2271126
inherited	subclassing
class inherited will give relation between two common subclassing

2271128
width	height
you can call gtk_widget_set_size_request to cause a widget to request a fixed height and width

2271158
children	parent
you could have children send a sigusr1 to the parent when they start then a sigusr2 before they exit

2271167
width	height
i see that to make a circle button a ellipse has to be defined with the same height and width

2271167
width	height
i d like for the circle to take on the shorter of the height width values so that it can dynamically scale according to the button sizing

2271203
min	max
i want to perform a normalization on each column separately that is modifying the values from each colum to actual_value - min this_column max this_column - min this_column

2271203
min	max
the min and max values from a column might differ from those of another column

2271209
winpcap	wireshark
i see the data in wireshark but i am not getting the data through winpcap

2271224
getter	setter
shadowing can be useful in simple code such as constructors getter setter and anything of the sort

2271234
width	height
for cocoa utilizing the technique for calculating string height should get you going if you use an arbitrary large value for the containers width instead of height

2271291
yslow	pagespeed
if you are technically minded install yslow or pagespeed and look at the score

2271309
jdk1.6	jvisualvm
i d recommend using something like jconsole jdk 1.5+ or jvisualvm jdk1.6

2271311
vim	notepad++
my personal picks are vim eclipse or notepad++ if you re using windows

2271369
margin	font-size
so if the current font-size is set to 12px then setting margin 1em on a child element would create a 12px margin around it

2271369
margin	font-size
if you were then to change the font-size of the parent element to 16px the margin would also increase to 16px

2271443
put	get
one method not the most elegant and simple method i thought of is to put all the codes into one set of header source files but that s a lot of work and can get quite tricky.

2271464
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried adding a hidden submit button which gives me the desired behavior in safari firefox and google-chrome but the form is still not submitted in ie

2271467
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
when you re doing a small project or a prototype go with the linqdatasource or sqldatasource

2271477
post	get
use the post redirect get pattern to ensure that the post request never ends up in the browser history

2271494
post	get
you can also post your most annoying and irrelevant noise there you ll get replies with how to suppress it rather quickly

2271497
google-chrome	firefox
now when i implement this is seems to work fine on my computer in firefox and google-chrome

2271555
jstl	taglib
use jsp s taglib jstl

2271559
subtract	add
eg if you have an integer field that you want to order by desc add a field where you store the integer value subtract from 1000000000 or some other large number index it and order by that field ascending

2271574
lisp	scheme
there are no destructive updates to data structures like setcar in lisp and most scheme

2271621
int	chars
such as by accessing the bytes in a chars array as an int by casting a to an

2271622
profiling	debugging
if this is not something you want to leave in permanently it s just for debugging performance analysis purposes then your best bet is to use sql profiling and monitor the sp stmtcompleted event which will record the stats for each statement within a sproc

2271632
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my site is loading up perfectly in firefox google-chrome and other browsers like safari albeit a bit slow

2271645
integer	fractions
in the gaussian integers if the real or imaginary parts of the quotient are fractions they get rounded to the nearest integer

2271655
swt	swing
also coding ui in java is not difficult - if you read some guides before and use some frameworks as swing application framework or swt framework

2271674
put	get
i am looking for a ready-to-run software module that i can take and put in either the keywords or links to news feeds and get it to work.

anyway how do you track client-side wcf issues when server-side diagnostics is not enough

2271731
folder	directory
my problem is that i am reading folder name from some specific directory

2271760
vim	textmate	nerdtree	netrw
whereas the nerdtree feels as though it tries to emulate the behaviour of other ides and textmate s project drawer i feel that the netrw plugin does things the vim way

2271760
vim	textmate
my background is with textmate but i ve been using vim fulltime for a while now

2271761
implements	extends
tell your ordernodelist class to extends then you ll get this enumerator in for you and probably much of the logic you ve created manually to manage the collection will now be implements for you.

2271800
post	get
i am using ciui from google code and all the requests are only get requests and not post

2271807
firefox	safari
my datepicker is working as expected with ie8 firefox and safari

2271811

a semicolon on its own is the empty statement -- that is nothing happens in loops body just the s++ on the for-loop line

2271843
showwindow	cdialog
use cdialog create and then use cdialog showwindow

2271892
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

asp.net-mvc	openrasta
openrasta - an asp.net-mvc framework with strong opinions

2272090
free	malloc
he ll also need to remember to free any memory he malloc s

2272144
folder	directory
subversion basically treats everything like a directory structure - a tag is simply another folder in the structure that happens to be within a tags directory

2272144
folder	directory
thus technically you could check out the tags directory copy one tag folder to a new folder svn add that new folder and commit it - which would essentially create a new tag based off of the old files

2272190
boost	stl
i use stl algorithms cogweels with boost lambda expressions the glue as much i can

2272256
daemons	systemd
well you can not sending a signal is just setting up some operating systemd primitives it has nothing to do with setting up a communication path between your daemons on one hand and the tool used to generate the signal on the other hand

2272273
postgresql	mysql
my second question is what is the best database management system for this scenario mysql postgresql oracle or others

2272284
min	max
compute the min or max or average

2272284
distance	polygons
if c1c2 where c1 2 is the center of the first second polygons d1 + d2 where d1 2 is the distance you computed for first second polygons then the two polygons intersect

2272284
distance	polygons
though this should be very efficient as any transformation to the polygons applies in the very same way to the center of mass and the center-node distance can be computed only once

2272341
bazaar	git
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell it when you move sources around

2272359
pop-up	dialog
i want to add java pop-up dialog from system tray similar as gtalk application avast vireus notification

2272438
opera	firefox
having issues getting specific background images to display in firefox opera all other browsers are playing ball except obviously ie for which i ve had to compromise

2272508
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it on ie8 firefox google-chrome

2272531
opera	firefox
multiple backgrounds are only supported starting from firefox 3.6 and opera 10.5

2272531
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari already support them which i presume you mean with all other browsers .

2272590
post	get
in your specific case i think it s the postconstruct if the namefilterpattern is to be obtained from a get request parameter or just the bean action method if namefilterpattern is to be obtained from a post form input field is suitable

2272669
post	get
i m having a very similar problem except that my form uses get request not a post request

2272669
google-chrome	firefox
both in google-chrome and firefox

2272691
goto	break
if it was changed then break the loop clear the list goto the start of the thread s method and do the same process using the same thread but the textfilter being different

2272696
pecl	pear
a function once given a name can not be reversed as it has been used in thousands of projects and the language core as well as pear and pecl

2272732
filtering	grouping
when the user enters the site he can choose in a dropdown which grouping he wants to see so the complete site filtering content related to that grouping

2272747
folder	directory
xml or php driven for those that don t like to use xml you could even generate the structure based off the folder structure in your directory using php

2272778
post	get
there is a proper way to do this as well using your own theme function if i get a chance i ll post a how to for that too

2272849
division	multiplication
since 10 5 2 you can use integer division and multiplication with 2 rather than float division and multiplication with 5.0

2272881
put	get	post	put	post	get
i would like to be able to get the credentials from application settings and post whatever the user put into uitextview

2272897
rss	feed
but content template can actually be used on any node type and allows modification of the teaser and body properties before they go out in an rss feed search index or are handed off to the theme

2272897
rss	feed
additionally contemplate can choose to add any files images or other media to rss feed as an attachment

2272910
gprof	shark
apparently gprof is broek on macosx 10.5 and i am supposed to use shark

2272931
post	get
all is working right for get requests but all post requests return http 400 - malformed header

2272931
post	get
so instead of the correctly formed request containing get post request line followed by http headers for post requests my application receives from nginx

2272945
getter	setter
lack of properties getter and setter are separate which violates dry and makes things such as frp nearly impossible

2272948

i made a java application.and bundled all classes in jar file..wen i run the project from netbeans my app is running successfully..but wen i place my .jar file at another place and run from there..i am not getting the icons used by my application..in the code i get my icons from images directory present in project folder

2273074
profiler	shark
much more useful for performance analysis is a sampling profiler and for this apple s shark tool part of chud is one of the best

2273170
getter	setter
i often find myself with a dilemma when writing javadoc for properties members of a simple pojo class holding only properties and getter and setter dto-style ..

2273176
getter	setter
alternatively if you do not want to generate the javadoc for all private members you can have a convention to document all getter and use link on setter

2273187
free	malloc
however i made a small test program with the code above just malloc free in the new delete operators and print statement in delete and compiled it using g++

and now my list thislist as it were has a new view that has all the same properties as the default view except now it grouping by a column dlcategory and filtering out anything whose dlpriority is not 2

2273266
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you can instantiate a trivial not-subclassed uinavigationcontroller and give it your original uiviewcontroller as its root controller like

2273270
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller has an is-a relationship with uiviewcontroller so you should be able to change its class type in interface builder with no additional changes

2273281
hex	binary
the number itself is not stored in hex it s binary like everything else in your computer

2273308
pop-up	dialog
so in case of ajax calls if an already existing dialog is initiated you will get the pop-up more than once as many times it was reinitialized

2273320
public	protected
it makes the public or protected facilities of the base class available directly in the derived class so it simply isn t want you want

2273332
submit	submission
an improvement on this especially if you don t want to do this right at submit time might be to clean the contents of each such div any other time you like onblur whatever and assign the contents of each cediv to its own invisible form element for later submission

postgresql	mysql
we are working on our implementation of linq to oracle mysql postgresql sqlite and this implementation is actively developed

2273379
int	double
for example i want to be able to use both int double and my own defined types complex

2273393
for-loop	loops
in the if statement inside the while loops to display the information from page2.php that require from one to three prices and variety will have a foreach loops or maybe a for-loop don t know to count how many variety the user choose in page2.php to display it inside the while loops in cart with the help of an if statment that will detect weather it was choosen from page1.php or page2.php

2273428
filesystems	ntfs
it turns out there is support for filesystems transactions - though i could only find it for ntfs enhance your apps with filesystems transactions

2273438
getter	setter
in my opinion this templating makes it a lot easier in the long run to not only remind yourself what the property means through repetition but also it makes it easier to add additional comments to the getter and setter if you want to add side effects such as not allowing null properties turning strings to uppercase etc

2273449
children	parent
its parentid is 3 but at that point i have no idea where this parent 3 is located in the array and how to add children to that parent

2273466
post	get
mark one as get and the other as post

2273496
hash	salt
principalcontext needs a plain-text password so i can not do a salt hash as everyone recommends for password storing

2273508
required	placeholder
this worked but another problem arose if the form client-side validation failed because of the required or pattern attributes then the fields aren t re-given their placeholder value

2273508
required	placeholder
test case open this with a browser that supports required pattern but not placeholder only opera at this time

2273536
hash	salt
for the salt i d do a transformation on the username hash it rather than share the same salt for everyone

2273551
children	parent
as you re figuring out the parent you simply append to the parent s children array

2273551
children	parent
the only real downside to the second approach is that if you want to add or remove an item you have to remember to go back and update the children array for the parent

2273609
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
does it make a difference whether i use sqlcommand sqlconnection instead of oledbcommand oledbconnection

2273654
superclass	subclassing
that means the signature for your subclassing exactly matches the superclass signature which is also what someone else using your subclassing would probably expect

2273694
public	protected
in those spi-s in bc sources made required methods public instead of protected

2273721
getter	setter
then create a property currentcustomer in the bean with getter and setter

2273724
tabs	tabpanel
internally the tabcontrol uses a tabpanel to layout the tabs

2273770
post	get
jsf favors post requests but you can still use get if you want -- it depends on your need and if the page needs to be bookmarkable

2273774
width	height
this will create an image object from argb pixels in the pix array with the given width and height

2273793
folder	directory
obviously write permissions on the directory the file is unzipped to write on the folder your web-service saves the zip file to when it s uploaded and read on the zip file that s been saved to unzip it

2273834
return-value-optimization	nrvo
read about return-value-optimization and nrvo in a word these two stands for return-value-optimization and named return-value-optimization and are optimization techniques used by the compiler to do what you re trying to achieve

2273850
getter	setter
my business rules must be implemented only within services with anemic domain classes only with getter and setter or must exist a consensus putting domain business rules in domain classes and services

2273860
post	get
generally speaking for this kind of operation a post back which is really not what it is you are simply navigating back to the same page and i assume that the items are part of a get operation so there is no post is what you don t want

2273886
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
even though uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller it s task is the management of other view controllers not the management of views themselves

2273927
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this comes in two forms name return-value-optimization nrvo and anonymous return-value-optimization usually just return-value-optimization

2273927
return-value-optimization	nrvo
from what you re saying your compiler implements return-value-optimization but not nrvo -- which means it s probably a somewhat older compiler

2273937
innodb	myisam
after several weeks development i wanted to make it available to the public and found out the database server provided by my web host does not support innodb only myisam

2273957
haskell	ocaml
both haskell and ocaml provide the lovely benefits of using an ml-family language but for most programmers ocaml is likely to offer a gentler learning curve and better immediate results

2273978
perl	tcl
i have programmed in c pascal gwbasic tcl perl lisp but visual basic is too advanced for me

2273982
integer	unsigned
for an unsigned integer as you asked for in your question you would use uint_max

2273991
integer	unsigned
by far the simplest method to get the largest value for an unsigned integer type is to cast -1 to that type

2274002
pop-up	dialog
i ve just tested bluetoothauthenticatedevice pin null len 0 on a windows 7 box and the dialog box pop-up there as expected

2274002
pop-up	dialog
presumably w7 vista+kb942567 sp2 connects first to the device to see what authentication methods it supports whereas xp2 vista gold just pop-up the dialog immediately and only on completion attempt to connect to authenticate

2274009
min	max
with 2 thumbs min and max values that would stay in the middle of each box

2274017
versioning	upgrade
i understand that an upgrade to the iphone os upgrade the opengl es versioning support from 1.1 to 2.0

2274023
int	chars
note however that this solution only works if the data representation of int and chars is the same on the sending and receiving systems

2274028
tunnel	vpn
you could then ask your application to open the ssh tunnel just before it authenticates and close it when it s done similar to vpn

2274071
fiddler	charles
i have inspected the response xml in fiddler charles and the data is there but in not in the result in the flex variable inspector

2274084
put	get
you don t have to use page.ispostback most ajax requests are just get s so if you put in your page_load

2274149
implements	extends
i am implements my first gwt application currently i just have a quick question about the differences between extends composite and extends a specified widget when creating complex custom widgets and the advantages of using extends composite

2274155
client-side	server-side
one of the features in asp.net is the ability to call server-side code from client-side code without postback using something called a client callback

2274159
onmousedown	onmouseup
also it s rather tricky you d have to detect both onmousedown and onmouseup for the entire document and record the state of the mouse buttons

2274159
mouseup	mousedown
likewise any mouseup or mousedown events on other elements that stop propagation up to the documentelement s event handler would cause it to break

2274170
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i would also keep the major browsers opera google-chrome firefox safari and ie7 8 opened in parallel to one-another for constant testing

2274171
int	chars
the real problem here is that you are combining chars and int semantics in the same query

2274171
isnull	nullif
use a case or isnull nullif ... construct in the where statement

2274207
width	height
i am given a floating number such as 1.77720212936401 and i want to be able to calculate roughly what the aspect ratio is as a width height string with width and height being small natural numbers

2274211
innodb	myisam
there are many web hosting providers that support innodb these days so it would be waste of your time to recode much of your application to work with myisam

2274215
integer	unsigned
java has only a signed integer not unsigned but this should work

2274236
integer	unsigned
based upon your comments you want an unsigned int although you say unsigned integer so maybe you want an integral value not necessarily an unsigned int

2274284
post	get
when i post to android marketplace as an upgrade to my existing 1.0 app i get the aforementioned ambiguous message

2274295
postgresql	mysql
not sure if postgresql or mysql support this you d have to ask someone more familiar with those databases

2274322
matplotlib	scipy
python + numpy + scipy + matplotlib

2274327
google-chrome	firefox
you can test drive this new syntax in recent versions of firefox google-chrome and microsoft edge

2274350
nstabview	nsimageview
i all dragged them to a window in ib but the problem is that the nsimageview action buttons suggest send poke etc... information nsbox and friends nstabview can all vary in height

2274359
gina	winlogon
you can try call wlxloggedonsas function from gina or wlxsasnotify from winlogon

2274361
pop-up	dialog
in such scenarios it will pop-up a dialog asking you to select the appropriate class

2274437
getter	setter
cake will read your db schema and automagically provide model- field and some auto getter setter like findallbyid or findbyname

2274492
inherited	subclassing
all subclassing of textwriter and therefore streamwriter and stringwriter and their subclassing will inherited the write method that supports this

2274634
perl	tcl
this is especially true for folks who have worked with unix shell scripting perl tcl python ruby etc

2274654
int	chars
whenever i try to print the chars arrays to the console i m getting the result in int format but whenever i try to print int arrays to the console i m getting the result in hashcode format

2274673
getter	setter
you need to use the correct properties for admin and you need to create getter and setter for those properties like any other java bean

2274693
google-chrome	safari
we are using django and django-socialauth for auth with google fb twitter but there is a problem with the facebook connect button only in google-chrome neither safari dont shows the button

2274707
yacc	bison
if the user makes an error yacc bison will go on until the next semi-colon end of a statement and then go on with the next statement

2274724
folder	directory
i ve noticed if you change the security settings for a particular directory you can make that folder no longer browsable in windows

2274752
post	get
if you are doing a search you are trying to get data from the server and not send data to it -- which means you probably should use get and not post

2274760
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
in this approach you do not use wsdl.exe svcutil.exe at all since you are essentially bypassing the wsdl

2274760
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
edit following this approach the client can still try to generate proxy objects via wsdl.exe svcutil.exe but they won t get the correct information from the wsdl

2274794
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari but surprise surprise ie has a problem with it

2274794
firefox	safari
firefox safari ie8 alert one and alert two appear three times as expected and colour picker appears

2274799
voip	sip
services should not be starting activities except in very unusual circumstances the socket is a sip connection and you are creating a voip client

2274806
packets	multicast
if i run wireshark it shows that the packets are being delivered to the machine they look correct and they have the right multicast ip and port but the application layer doesn t receive anyting it blocks forever in .receive

2274912
typedef	struct
personally i tend to add the underscore at the end like this typedef struct node_ node

2274918
post	get
the problem i ve got is it seems that my post are very slow for some reason and consequently they appear to get a little clogged up and keep running after i ve completed my work

2274925
integer	unsigned
converts the specified string which encodes binary data as base-64 digits to an equivalent 8-bit unsigned integer array

2274938
getter	setter
because the same situation is there in front of me where i need to extend a third party class and the properties in this class which are private but are needed in the extending class and there are no setter and getter for the private members

2274985
x86	64bit
depending on the kernel involved it can will use the x86 rdtsc function which is a 64bit counter of instruction cycles

2275034
superclass	subclassing
if the private members are truly needed in the subclassing then your problem indicates poor design of the superclass

2275038
getter	setter
may be the third party class didn t provide any getter setter by design

2275096
pull	push
this way you could load the types pass them through the rules engine and then push the allowed types to a query on the database end that pull the list of books in the allowed types

2275121
min	max
note this example also demonstrates that it is not safe to use select max id +1 or select min id -1 as the next available unique value if we do it under concurrency

2275180
post	get
it is possible to use both get and post in form just add appropriate attribute method to form tag

2275199
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
with c-language background i could write some for-loop and inside loops count to ten do stuff and set my bookkeeping variable to zero and continue main arrays handling..

2275221
put	get
my reading of the source code is that get obtains a read lock which is independent of of the lock called _notempty acquired by put

2275221
put	get	puts	gets
if i understand correctly concurrent get s can block each other and concurrent put s can block each other modulo your use of the block parameter but that gets and puts do not mutually block

2275236
post	put
if that s the case it d probably be helpful to put the post s into a queue and have a timer that empties the queue periodically

2275259
width	height
i need my component to be sized exactly to the summed width and height of my rendered strings

2275259
min	max
for anyone interested i ve posted results of using the gridlayout boxlayout and flowlayout using a simple frame that receives 5 fixed size components of 200 wide by 50 in height by setting min max and preferred

2275259
width	height
the gridlayout is always resized along the width and height as mentioned in comments

2275259
width	height
the page_axis and y_axis shrank the width of the components to about half their size 104 but did not shrink the height

2275259
width	height
the line_axis and x_axis shrank the height of the components to what seemed zero but did not touch the width

2275357
post	get
i m going to begin researching this topic right now but i thought d i post this question in the meantime and get anyone s thoughts just to give me a boost

2275361
folder	directory
i want the most recent version of my help file to stay in a folder that is not my visual studio project directory

2275391
portrait	landscape
i am currently trying to implement a grid view in the iphone sdk whereby in portrait mode there are 2 items wide and in landscape mode there are 3

2275410
vbscript	vb6
presently it has vbscript and vb6 as dialects of visual basic

2275627
width	height
create a div of the same width and height as your image and set the image as the background for the div using css

2275657
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	perforce	bazaar	fossil	gitorious	fossil	perforce	cvs	darcs	launchpad	darcs	fossil
so you can have something exactly like github or gitorious codaset for mercurial bitbucket darcs patch-tag bazaar launchpad codeville arch arx monotone fossil but not for subversion or cvs perforce visual sourcesafe team foundation server vault because centralized version control systems simply are not capable of supporting the required features

2275658
uitableview	reloaddata
when you do get the additional row data then call reloaddata to get the uitableview to ask for the number of rows and then call cellforrowatindex

2275665
temp	tmp
oh yeah and make sure the tmp folder is on the same partition as where your build is written to as vc++ makes temp files and moves them later

2275666
folder	directory
in either the system-wide library pdf services or a user s library pdf services directory you can put applescripts automator workflows or symlinks aliases to applications or folder

2275666
pop-up	dialog
those items will appear in the pdf pop-up menu in the print dialog and if the user selects the item a pdf of the file will be placed in the folder or be passed to the application script or workflow

2275697
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview databound to an objectdatasource

2275754
post	get
i found a tutorial showing me how to get my timeline or last 20 post in xml format but can t figure out how to print out just the latest post and just the text of it not the time date etc that come with the xml rss etc

2275770
int	double
the compiler and i say it s a forward declaration for a function taking a double argument and returning an int

2275775
int	chars
as for grays how you ll declare it depends on if you re using your array of unsigned chars as chars a string or as single-byte int

2275775
integer	unsigned
if they re integers you can declare an unsigned single-byte integer as byte and declare an array either static or dynamic of them using the syntax described above

2275795
hash	md5
while some of its info recommendation to use md5 hash for one is somewhat out of date simply because of what-we-know-now versus what-we-knew-then the overall principles are very strong and should be considered

2275803
titlebar	window	min	max
i have created a borderless window style wherein i draw the chrome borders titlebar min max close systemmenu etc and i would like to check it against an existing example

2275824
vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6
edit october 2010 vb6 vbscript and vb.net added as languages supported by clonedr

2275833
children	parent
i have transaction id s stored in a database and the requirement is to display all of the children of the parent and then the subsequent children of the parent s children

2275833
children	parent
in reality this list of parent and their children will never be more than 4 or 5 levels deep but i need to take into account that it can go more layers than that

2275847
post	get
the concept is not bad help avoid injection attacks but escaping all get post and cookie values make your code so much complex for example have to unescape everytime when displaying and data

2275859
cagradientlayer	calayer
in the awakefromnib method it creates and sets all the calayers into their appropriate positions cagradientlayer several catextlayers and a few custom calayer subclasses

2275904
sorting	filtering
tim s answer is a great way to handle things if you have the ability to run the initial query in a second thread and the logic paging sorting filtering to be applied to the results requires action on the server ...

2275958
chunked	transfer-encoding
http could work quite well for long-running connections if you use transfer-encoding chunked

2275965
awt	swing
so i suggest like swing do all the gui manipulation on the awt event dispatch thread edt

2276003
put	get
this approach is ethical can get you better and more relevant data you can put voluntary forms together and allows you to make a value exchange

2276018
pylons	bottle
as an aside i tend to think frameworks are useful and personally use django like the way pylons works and have used bottle in the past for prototyping mdash

2276031
ubuntu	linux
it has been now over one year i have trashed windows and moved to linux ubuntu to be more precise and i am using the ide zend studio combined with aptana studio for developing oo php5.3 websites

2276031
libs	buildpath
code completion for php5.3 not just php5 and not just the php functions but any libs that are added to the buildpath such as zend framework and my own libs

2276041
post	get
anything less is going to be a huge amount of work parsing http requests to find headers and uri s and methods and parsing the get or post query data association handling file uploads cookies etc

2276077
inherited	properties
firefox for example generates anonymous button and input elements inside the file upload element which only inherited some of the properties that you set on the upload element itself

2276109
maven	pom.xml
this is assuming you have the proper references to the maven distribution repository in your pom.xml or settings.xml

2276135
implements	extends	listadapter	listactivity
you will need to extends listactivity and listadapter to implements your design

2276136
directions	infowindow
options like driving directions can be achieved by adding links to the infowindow that call the part of your code that does gdirections calls

2276218
hide	show
for flex components listen to show and hide events

2276221
ant	maven
you need to properly set your classpath whether you re using ant or maven to perform your build

2276221
ant	maven
using ivy with ant or switching your build to maven will allow the build to automatically lookup dependencies and properly set the classpath

2276235
gdal	arcgis
im just starting off with gdal + python to support operations that cannot be done with arcgis python geoprocessing scripting

2276240
versioning	upgrade
users who are still using 2.0 os probably a small minority even including jailbreakers as 3.1 has been jailbroken for quite a while don t have to upgrade to the new versioning

2276277
uilabel	uibutton
in the corresponding nib customtblcell.xib drag and drop uilabel and uibutton elements side-by-side

2276304
ant	maven
so if you want to use a custom strategy you ll have to use ant or maven

2276313
folder	directory
the issue i am having is that my build server seems to be putting both assemblies in the same output directory the binaries folder on the build server and using that directory for resolving project references but it is getting the wrong file the silverlight one instead of the .net one

2276327
setinterval	clearinterval
in the above example the setinterval function fires every 100 milliseconds and just increases the value by 1 each time when it hits 100 the clearinterval function stops it animating

2276328
min	max
the regular expression also needs to support a min and max length

2276374
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am seeing an access is denied error in internet explorer 8 but not in firefox safari or google-chrome when the script tries to access frame.document

2276387
versioning	upgrade
you can probably start with a plist which is the easiest thing to do and if required upgrade to a core data or sqlite in a future versioning by including a hidden migration procedure when first running the new versioning of the app

2276397
put	get
i have all the programming necessary to get the location manager values...but dont know how to put a view above the other views without pushing the others off the screen...or something like this...which blocks and is an alertview

2276440
uiview	subviews
you should be able to create a uiview and add it to your main window as a subviews

2276452
free	malloc
if you are still using malloc free use #define s to redefine malloc and free

2276460
hide	show
i already have this which hide 2 fields now i want to show 3 new fields..

2276463
button	checkbox
something like this is too simple since it does not correctly include textareas selects radio button and checkbox

2276532
srp	ocp
an interesting side point is that if you find yourself mostly rewriting classes instead of changing them when requirements change then it can be an indication that the code is following well srp ocp and other design principles.

2276631
opml	feed
found an answer on superuser on how to import an opml file with 1500 feed into google reader

2276718
jobs	cron
to get a list of the the current cron jobs scheduled for the user your logged in as type the following at your shell prompt assuming it s

2276800
getter	setter
now i have a lot of classes with getter and setter methods

2276800
getter	setter
the problem is that every class has hundreds of getter and setter and i have a lot of classes

2276800
getter	setter
i would like a mechanism that lets me to choose to skip some getter setter couples where it is better to do the work by hand

2276818
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper adheres to the philosophy of one record one instance quite strictly but activerecord is really nowhere near this

2276822
gdal	arcgis
gdal is included in arcgis to work with some raster data formats

2276837
consistency	acid
it is the mechanism by which the rmdbs can assure atomicity and consistency see acid

2276853
width	height
incidently the width and height attributes on the ul and subsequent li s are set to 0

2276906
lxml	beautifulsoup
this is essentially the same advice as the people who are recommending beautifulsoup except lxml is still being actively developed and beautifulsoup development has slowed

2276913
min	max
note that row_number isn t always the most efficient if you can use min max instead just the easiest to write

2276913
min	max
if you re running sql 2000 or this isn t efficient enough you can try a min or max query

2276913
min	max
if you need the highest change the first query to order by id desc and the second query to use max instead of min

2276924
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
checkbox -- textbox -- dropdownlistfor

2277005
versioning	upgrade
to add to the above i ve had to resort to just creating a new project in my latest versioning of the sdk this problem only raised its ugly head when i upgrade to 3.1.3

2277028
installation	upgrade
not only do we use it internally on our developer schemas we also use it externally during the upgrade installation that the customer runs

2277051
winpcap	wireshark
wireshark actually uses winpcap to do this and as the other answer indicates you can use it as well

2277051
udp	tcp
i use this to capture the ip traffic tcp and udp from a given network interface

2277051
udp	tcp
see here for the breakout of the ipv4 header here for the udp header and here for the tcp header

2277052
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

2277061
rss	feed
there is an rss feed for the comments for each status update

2277061
rss	feed
that is the rss feed for the comments for that update

2277061
rss	feed
for a little more automation take the main rss feed for the user user id public posted then you can parse out the post id for each post and build the comments feed url from that user id comments post id

2277063
white-box	assertions
another way of thinking about it is that the mock behaviours you record are black-box implementation assertions where are white-box api assertions

2277104
ubuntu	linux
i should also mention that i am using linux ubuntu and emacs-snapshot is assigned to the alias emacs

2277206
profiling	instrumentation
once you get it working profiling it with the opengl instrumentation to see if have any performance issues then deal with those

2277231
pdu	sender-id
the headers in a short message pdu are solely for the basic transport parameters encoding sender-id ...

2277243
folder	directory
navigate to your folder you may want to mount them - see the fstab file in the etc directory of msys

2277271
for-loop	arrays
i m using a timer in place of the for-loop to grab the images from the arrays

2277304
wstring	wifstream
use wchar_t wstring wifstream etc

2277368
google-chrome	firefox
it work on my mac ubuntu windows google-chrome windows firefox but not ie

2277376
folder	directory
also extend init to accept the directory where you want the folder to go

2277387
explode	implode
i have an ugly solution that works explode the search string into an array of words look up each word in the array of stopwords unset them if there is a match implode the remaining words and finally run a regex to add the boolean mode formatting

2277391
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i open my webpage in different browsers ie firefox google-chrome the text within these cells either fits nicely on one line or it wraps

2277401
width	margin
if you need more space between table columns you can use css margin width properties with any value suitable for you

2277454
post	get
i believe get and post are the only valid values on a form method attribute

2277460
post	get
html v4 and xhtml v1 only support the get and post request methods within html forms

2277460
put	get	post	put	post	get
on the other hand the get post put and delete methods are supported via xmlhttprequest in all modern browsers

2277460

kde	gnome
there is also the docs for the two different desktop platforms gnome and kde that might help you down that road

2277587
public	protected
if you want to customize the javascript to run only under particular conditions not just any postback you can create a page-level variable protected or public in your page s class and do something similar

2277609

gridview	objectdatasource
i have an objectdatasource that is bound to a gridview

2277830
min	max
sql s aggregation functions max min count etc don t seem to be first class functions like their equivalent in linq is

2277838
google-chrome	firefox
operating systems and browsers range from xp to vista and using firefox google-chrome ie7 ie8 - there is no pattern to the failure

2277881
min	max
this allows you to perform aggregate functions on the group returning information about the group min max count etc. but the individual records in each group are not accessible

2277940
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
i tried zend kohana codeigniter cakephp but none of them are really as nice.

2277955
post	put
another option would be to put the data you need into a more complex object on the client side and then use json to serialize it all and put it into the post

2277986
int	chars	int	double
then the user should be able to select a function name from the list manually input a list of arguments the arguments are all basic types like int double bool or chars arrays c-type strings and attempt to run the selected function with the specified arguments

2278058
mdpi	hdpi
it doesn t know how to distinguish between mdpi hdpi ldpi bitmaps

2278058
mdpi	hdpi
finally -- you mention it is 1 3 small that it should be which is a good indication that the problem is related to density as mdpi density is 160dpi and hdpi is 240dpi -- 160 240 2 3 which is 1 3 less than your original image

use a profiler -- for firefox there s firebug safari and windows ie 8 have javascript debuggers and profilers built in at least i believe ie 8 does someone correct me if i m wrong...

2278160
width	height
as well the overflow auto will not have any effect on your .box style because it does not specify any height or width - it will naturally just expand to contain whatever content you put in there

2278160
width	height
to force a scrollbar to appear you need to put in either height or width styling and enough content to exceed either of the limits

pull	push
i had a working gitosis installation on debian lenny but the server got updated and now when i try to push pull fetch the connection times out

2278201

2278213
getter	setter
consider the following classes please assume public getter and setter methods for the private fields

2278239
int	chars
the from an int or string onto the set of 32 relatively ocr friendly chars

2278257

2278415
rss	feed
using a livejournal rss feed

2278435
accessor	properties
the key difference is that the properties is actually calling the accessor method while the instance variable is being accessed directly

2278435
accessor	properties
thus for setting a retain properties using self and the accessor will release the old object and retain the new one

2278435
accessor	properties
the key reason to use properties is that since they are accessor they can be read and or modified from outside the class

2278439
int	chars
this gave me enough space to convert 4 chars chunks into int and run the above function on them

2278470
goto	break
some schools of thought are opposed to things in various languages like next retry continue and break because they are just a little bit too much in the direction of the disrespected goto statement

2278492

inherited	subclassing
it may be that you use interfaces to describe behavior and abstract parent classes to implement the behavior that can be inherited by subclassing

2278810
many-to-many	one-to-many
you must break up the many-to-many into 2 one-to-many relationships using what is called a link table

2278833
matplotlib	chaco
chaco is designed to be very interactive and is significantly more so than matplotlib

2278833
move	drag
for example the user can use the mouse to drag the legend to different places on a plot or lasso data or move a point around on one plot and change the results in another or change the color of a plot by clicking on a swatch etc

2278902
inherited	properties
when you inherited a properties the caller really shouldn t care whether firstname was first implemented in person or customer or object

2278905
int	chars
so you have to over-allocate a buffer to the maximum size as a string of an int even if you require fewer chars since you have the possibility of an overflow

2278920
direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d

pull	push
a dev bare repo where all devs can push their current work and or pull works from their colleagues sort of a local central repo but many other workflows exists like the one described in this progit book page

2278921
pull	push
you can define hooks on the staging repo and prod repo to only accept certain branches and refuse any branch creation as oppose to all the dev repos where you can define push pull as many branches as you need

2278973
pop-up	dialog
joptionpane is a class that will pop-up a very basic modal dialog with some text maybe an icon or input field

2278973
joptionpane	jdialog
as joptionpane is a very basic construct for creating a basic message dialog it might be easier to use a jdialog which can also be made modal

2278973
joptionpane	jdialog
jdialog will allow you to add buttons as you please where as a standalone joptionpane will require you to use yes no or yes no cancel or ok cancel etc

2278993
gmail	hotmail
like hotmail gmail yahoo

2278995
sql-insert	sql-delete
take a look at the loader sql-insert sql-delete and sq-update mapping elements

attackers can force the get and post methods using javascript or an tag in the case of get but the rest of the http header is off limits

2279132
listview	gridview
romain guy elaborates on a few things you can do with listview gridview

2279132
listview	gridview
a listview or a gridview is probably how i would go

2279149
trie	tree
prefix tree trie or suffix tree

2279188
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout accept 2 parameters

2279235
folder	directory
in the installation directory of an air application there is a meta-inf folder or in share using linux

2279263
accessor	properties
awkward accessor names like that are why â œmnameâ is a poor name for a properties

2279263
accessor	superclass
and it doesn t matter whether you synthesize the accessor hand-wave them to a superclass with dynamic or define them yourself

2279263
accessor	properties
that s how the object will respond to the accessor message but the accessor message the compiler generates will be no different since a properties access could just as easily come from outside the class as from inside it

2279263
accessor	properties
i said mname is bad as a properties name because of the accessor names that follow from it

2279263
accessor	properties
when somemethod isn t the accessor or init or dealloc using the properties is just fine and generally preferable

2279263
accessor	properties
when it is the accessor i name the local variable newx having named the instance variable the same as the properties x

2279321
fadein	fadeout
i rewrited the fadein and fadeout methods

2279372

2279382
rss	feed
rss feed incorporate feed onto my site

2279388
postgresql	mysql
but postgresql isn t much harder to install than mysql if harder at all

2279388
postgresql	mysql
as a developer i prefer postgresql over mysql as the latter behaves different from version to version they re still playing catchup to the sql standard and probably always will

2279388
postgresql	mysql
if you actually prefer mysql over postgresql i d lay out a migration plan just to be ready if need arises as a kind of lazy proactiveness .

2279389
runtimeexception	invocationtargetexception
as far as i can tell the invocationtargetexception means there was a runtimeexception and i can treat it like that

2279405
inherited	subclassing
and now on each of your subclassing you override the getequation by specifying the constraint and as transient is not inherited by subclassing the overriden getequation will be use for the equation field mapping

2279416
int	chars
just assign the int to a chars variable

2279435
int	chars
here is a small example to show converting int to chars string

2279438
mvp	presenter
in mvp pattern a presenter has an interface of view so the presenter can call iview.dosomething

2279467
ant	maven
you would need to look at ant or maven

2279510
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
internet explorer 8 and later versions and all other versions of popular browsers - google-chrome firefox opera 4+ - support the css property border-spacing

2279535
width	margin
usually with a fixed width container margin 0 auto should be enough

2279593
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works in firefox google-chrome and opera

2279613
config	ini
is any config needed on php ini file or i may use imap

2279662
public	protected
what is better practise and why accessing base class variables through a protected field or a public getter on the private field

2279665
getter	setter
but when we use getter setter these attributes can be easily accessed modified from outside

2279665
getter	setter
if we are going to use setter getter later on to modify

2279673
put	get
for example you can get a list of all tables columns and foreign key references which is enough to put together a schema diagram

2279685
getter	setter
you can add some logic into setter getter in future

2279685
getter	setter
sometimes getter setter can operate with abstract things.

2279689
getter	setter	public	protected
use public or protected setter and getter

2279689
public	protected
the getter need not be public - if you wan to hide the data from outsiders but give the data to subclasses use protected

2279692
superclass	subclassing
i regard the relationship between a superclass and a subclassing as similar to that of a caller and callee - changes to the underlying implementation shouldn t break subclassing any more than they should break callers

2279701
getter	setter
if you use setter getter you can allways add validation checking etc later on

2279722
width	margin
i recommend using three column div s with float left and a fixed width 30 and a 3 margin to make the gap

2279739
profiling	benchmarking
ultimately i wouldn t start mimicking optimisations from the bcl without benchmarking profiling what difference they make in your specific application

2279802
getter	setter
you can limit access to attributes if you will write getter without setter attribute will be read-only

2279805
installation	upgrade
so if you have upgrade your sql server 2005 client tool installation to 2008 there is no way afaik to create ssis 2005 projects

2279815
width	height
the location in pixels is calculated this works as it should by the width and height of the application

2279834
hide	show
debugging is also fine - the visual studio debugger hide the implementation of the standard containers and instead show a logical view of what they contain

2279845
inherited	subclassing
accessing protected fields from a subclassing is one of the ways that inherited violates encapsulation

2279846
getter	setter
you should never supply getter setter by default only if the use case of the class requires them

2279846
getter	setter
this will almost never be true for setter and only occasionally for getter

2279846
getter	setter
no only one of them is exposed the current length via the size getter and none via setter

2279904
width	height
make the body height 100 because div width or height will apply only if the parent been set to a certain value

2279938
width	height
calc the width and height difference

2279962
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
boxlayout panel boxlayout.y_axis gridlayout 0 1 and if really needed gridbaglayout

2279969
put	get
in your case myhashmap is overloading the standard map methods of put get and remove but not overriding any of them

2279971
put	get
and adjust the put and get the same

2279984
post	get
here is a blog post about it that i think will help you get started

2279999
yslow	pagespeed
2 make the loading in a page the user have to open it in the beginning like login page and put the scripts at the end of the page to let all the content render first and this recommended by most of the performance tools like yslow and pagespeed

2280126
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
you will not get objectdisposedexception or any other invalid state caused by using owned disposed instance you may get nullreferenceexception if you do not check for nulls

2280138
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

this is an enhanced version of the standard headers module because it provides more utilities like resetting or clearing builtin headers like content-type content-length and server

2280552
typedef	typename
actually this error occurs on every typedef declaration followed by typename

2280574
serializable	deserialization
this attribute affects only deserialization and prevents the runtime from throwing an exception if a member is missing from the serializable stream

2280574
serializable	deserialization
objects may be serializable in binary format for deserialization by other .net applications

2280580
hide	show
you may also want to look at some of the demos that show hide columns dynamically

2280614
javadb	hsqldb
you can use an in-memory database such as hsqldb derby a.k.a javadb h2

2280675

integer	unsigned
promotion is the process by which values of integer type smaller that int unsigned int are converted either to int or unsigned int

2280810
integer	unsigned
it begins by promoting the operand to either int or unsigned if they are of a type smaller than int and then choosing a target type by the following process for integer types 6.3.1.8 1

2280810
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

2280810
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

2280810
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

2280810
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

2280810
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

2280810
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

2280826
hide	show
that said you can use absolute positioning to move things around on the page javascript to show hide and move things and probably a bunch of other tricks too

swt	swing
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately

2281077
swt	swing
i cannot add comment yet because i m new here please mod me up so i can comment but choosing swing or swt depends on the ide you re using

i am using a slidetoggle technique to show and hide 100+ divs full of information in my application

2281169
hide	show
i have show all and hide all buttons and i d like for them to have the slidetoggle animation as well instead of just showing and hiding all

2281169
hide	show
if i remove th slidetoggle and replace it with just a show hide on the show all hide all it performs fine

2281169
hide	show
and my show all and hide all functions.

2281169
hide	show
and replacing the slidetoggle in the showall and hideall functions with show and hide works well too

2281188
nant	cruisecontrol
yes i ve have this particularly when building large projects in nant build scripts under the cruisecontrol .net continuous integration server

2281199
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
subclass the code uiimagepickercontroller code class into your own class and override the viewwillappear and viewdidappear those methods will be triggered when the uiimagepickercontroller is about to appear or does appear if you trigger its display properly using code presentmodalcontroller code for instance

2281224
post	get
getting data from a form is basic dom and you ll want to switch out the get to post since you are sending data rather then just requesting it

2281251
children	parent
you cannot truncate the parent table if any child tables exist even if the children are empty

2281280
ncover	nant
either way you get nant to call the unit test runner either ncover nunit or gallio and it runs them from there and not direct from nant as this is just a scripting language but one with significant power to call-out to other processes

2281355
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox mozilla you would be able to access the file system if you wrote a google-chrome application add-on but then all your users need to install your addon as well and that does not sound ideal for what you want to do

2281377
width	height
you could always put the images at the very end of the page in a hidden container and or with a width and height of 1 pixel

2281449
bazaar	git
i have previously considered and passed over git due to worse documentation and cross-platform support compared to bazaar and mercurial but since then they have improved massively in both areas and it seems it s now a really good option whatever your circumstances

2281460
hide	show
this should then hide and show the icon everytime the timer ticks at least then you can see if it s working

2281460
hide	show
maybe only run the timer 10 times and then it ends that way the script should hide and show the icon 10 times by which time the system should be ready

2281472

2281589
strdup	strtok
you could also use strtok and strdup

2281589
strdup	strtok
see example of using strtok and strdup

2281589
strdup	strtok
strtok would then be used to extract the individual tokens - strdup to allocate space an copy them

2281623
jtextfield	jlabel
you should nest your jtextfield in a jpanel or jlabel and put the border on the jpanel or jlabel

2281671
inherited	properties
the difference between the last two is that the hasownproperty method will check if the properties exist physically on the object the properties is not inherited

2281678
boost	stl
you cannot store polymorphic types in stl containers use boost ptr_map instead if it is your wish

2281678
boost	stl
the nice thing about boost pointer container is that it s been meant for polymorphic types with exception safety and all and yet mimics the behavior interface of the stl so that you are not lost

2281775
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
in c# a superclass s static members are inherited into the subclassing scope

2281775
inherited	subclassing
now you can t inherited static classes and the only place i can imagine that static inherited might matter ignores it entirely although you can make a generic constraint that requires a type parameter t to be a subclassing of a you still cannot call t.m which probably simplifies things for the vm let alone write a different m implementation in a subclassing and use that

2281784
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following script that works well in firefox and google-chrome not sure about other browsers but it doesn t work at all in ie

width	height
width height area pixels

2281896
implements	extends
you could also use as delimiters and implements of minimalist html parser suiting your needs but this will probably lead to bugs headaches and more bugs once your minimal needs extends

2281914
superclass	subclassing
an example of use would be say a counter value that would keep a live count of all instances of a superclass s subclassing each subclassing increments the static count value on construction

2281917
keydown	keyup
you can implement an event handler for the textbox s keypress and or keyup keydown events

2281937

we just forgot 1 simple thing in our calculations reflect the size width height of the dots in the position.

2282206
pop-up	dialog
i could - either by setting the cursor or physically disabling all the buttions etc etc but realistically i d prefer to be able to simply wrap the call in some object method etc which will allow a dialog to pop-up up if and only if the operation is taking long enough to impact on the user

2282276
ubuntu	linux
the machines this program runs on are typically ubuntu linux boxes

2282278
getter	setter
i need to use that input in markeroverlay i tried creating a setter and getter but it won t work

2282284
reentrantlock	reentrantreadwritelock
if you go this route use reentrantlock or reentrantreadwritelock and not synchronized on objects as that lets you explicitly manage the lock as an object and use the extra methods available on it

2282314
width	height
it was missing the width and height and once i added it in then three20 was able to scale the image with the correct dimensions

2282353
versioning	upgrade
so if another versioning of some module is installed on a system you will get unexpected upgrade downgrades

2282362
getter	setter
i could get around that by always using setter and getter

2282413
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
when i run the webservice i have this exception could not find a base address that matches scheme net.tcp for the endpoint with binding nettcpbinding

2282477

i ve successfully done this before using a geospatial image of the world and then mapped scaled longitude and latitude values from the max lat lng range -90 90 -180 180 to the max width and height of the image 0 width 0 height which worked perfectly

2282478
client-side	server-side
you still need a server-side check because the client-side may turn off javascript etc

2282606
post	get
the jquery - rather than use get post we must use ajax to set the contenttype i had assumed the json datatype on the .post method sorted this but that s for the return value

2282606
post	get
what it shows is that post get will attempt to convert the data in the request into the object type without any filters useful even

2282612
versioning	upgrade
i do it very similarly but use database extended properties instead of a table to track metadata versioning and the upgrade steps are defined in application rather than a single script

2282626
children	parent
this works only when there is only one child record if there are more than one child records the children get deleted but the parent doesn t

2282629
width	height
when i query the frame of tmpview the width is still as desired and the height is often correct .

2282634
width	height
the default value of both is stretch and when an explicit width height is set it behaves like center

2282634
width	height
...and the button using it with a non-square width height

2282667
hide	show
however if the choice when to show each text can be conditioned you can have two controls with different license texts that is both texts are built into a single msi and show hide them based on the condition

2282720
doc	rtf
cocoa reads and writes rtf rtfd and word doc formats natively

2282735
directx	directdraw
since i ve no idea the differences between directdraw and directx i m not 100 what i should be thinking about that

2282741
disk	ram
by default linux will use free ram almost all of it to cache disk accesses and will delay writes

2282778
next	except
it has nothing to do a leading character except that it seems to split the json at a certain size and then ends up with a random leading character because the next json string starts with a random character

2282810
datalist	repeater
pay attention to selected indexes and bind your child repeater or datalist in the itemdatabound event

2282818

children	parent
i am thinking along the lines of having my custom control modified to hold a parent grid and two children a a placeholder image and b the actual content

2282901

set stretch uniform on ellipse will automatically works like min height width you dont need an attached property as like adam suggests

2282970
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
use the autoresetevent and manualresetevent classes

2282971
firefox	safari
the font renders in firefox and safari fine hover nothing is displayed in the explorers

2283042
qtreewidget	qabstractitemmodel	qtreewidget	qtreeview	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
if you didn t it sounds like you want a custom sorting algorithm which would require creating a derived qtreewidget if you are doing that you might as well just use qtreeview and a custom qabstractitemmodel

2283044
public	protected
we are talking public vs private and i am not including protected for a reason

2283044
inherited	properties
inherited extending to an extended class does not allow you to inherited private variables properties are the answer

2283061
vmware	virtualbox
this is especially easy to do nowadays given that there are several free virtualization products now virtualbox and vmware server to name two

2283089
children	parent
parent and children are stored in the same table

2283104
google-chrome	firefox
i ve just debugged some of my code that uploads files to mvc and i get the exact mime string from the httppostedfilebase in firefox as i do in google-chrome image jpeg and image gif respectively

2283106
punctuation	words
python tries to avoid using punctuation when english words will do especially when the special characters don t have widely-known meaning

2283129
children	parent
you would need as you say to lock the parent record during inserts of children so that another user cannot delete the parent before you commit

2283134
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the feature works fine with safari google-chrome and firefox

2283219
soappy	suds
i have python 2.6 and soappy isn t working any more so i m using suds

2283262
getter	setter
those are just properties that automatically generate the standard getter setter logic

2283262
getter	setter
this means that the getter is public but the setter is private

2283313
internationalization	translation
we have had these things pop up a few times in my current project involving a cms where things like internationalization had to be addressed early but this wasn t necessarily a wise move as there were changes later such as bringing in another company s software to handle some of the translation which may impact some of our code

2283316
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome can pull that xml and manipulate it in jquery just fine

2283331
swt	swing
if you want native controls and dialogs you need to use swt instead of swing

2283332
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you can use objectinputstream objectoutputstream to store and recover your object

2283347
ironruby	ironpython
if you have experience with c++ then c# would be natural to you but if you re comfortable with vba you can try vb.net but if you prefer python then there is ironpython or can give a try to ironruby but the best of all is you can mix them all as they apply to different parts of your project

2283390
getter	setter
and there is no return value well you can call the getter again but it should just return m.value unless the setter getter do something funky

2283407
submit	submission
when user enter id in a textbox i want to check that value in database and get the name for that id before submission the submit button

2283435
getter	setter
again singleton but with getter and setter for each property

2283491
ubuntu	debian
if you are on a debian based server such as ubuntu you can run the following command

2283523
hide	show
the purpose is to wait until the page is fully loaded then show the content and hide the loading animation

2283530
put	get
not familiar with getty but if you put your images in directories on your sever you can use php to get a directory listing and then loop through that listing to display the images

2283530
put	get
if you want to get fancy with it you could even write an xml file with image information and put it on the server then parse the xml when you load the images to supply meta data such as file names who uploaded the file etc

2283532
postgresql	mysql
even if you don t have a database mysql postgresql ... server available you should be able to use an sqlite database the engine is incorported into php via an extension that s generally enabled and the whole database is stored as a file

2283538
hide	show
via jquery i m doing a .slidetoggle to show hide the top div

2283565

2283644
rss	feed
i am looking to display an rss feed with an audio file on my website

2283660
equals	gethashcode
note it s very important here that itemkey is a structure as it provides the correct implementations of gethashcode and equals which are essential to being keyed in the dictionary correctly

2283670
floating-point	fractions
it returns a string because 0.1 and powers thereof which are used to display decimal fractions are not representable at least not with full accuracy in binary floating-point systems

2283675
put	get
in all three cases since you have a specific binary format i d ignore the type class binary defined in each and instead focus on the put and get monads they define

2283690
super	implements
small maps are implements as array maps internally and are really super fast

2283706
geocoding	geocode
there s a non-javascript variant of the google maps geocode check the tos - you ll need to be doing this to eventually display stuff on a google map and you re not going to find any geocoding services that allow a direct database connection

2283712
memcpy	realloc
i am porting a project to the iphone and it uses realloc and memcpy which are not found

2283732
for-loop	arrays
while still not clean and concise the code in the for-loop is quite redundant and we could have used std vector instead of c arrays this code now is guaranteed to assign correct data to

2283743
getter	setter
it also means you can t do things like validate when it s set add logging around getter setter etc

2283805
range	max	range	min	min	max
if it works then calling gencomb num min max should generate all your combinations of num integers in the range min to max inclusive such that no two returned combinations are equal save for ordering

2283844
hide	show
it seems in 2007 table - hide gridlines is default option while in 2003 table - show gridlines is the default

2283873
propertychangelistener	listeners
if for example you have a propertychangelistener registered to properties for a bean any registered listeners might not be notified if a protected property is changed directly by a sub-class

2283881
post	get
already in just a few days i ve had to deal with post back pages from paypal and clickbank i m sure there are a million others. guess what they use get

2283899
public	protected
as your child class is extending your parent class every properties and methods that are either public or protected in the parent class will be seen by the child class as if they were defined in the child class -- and the other way arround

2283905
stackless	multiprocess
if your execution threads are indeed compute-bound take a look at the multiprocess or stackless

2283916
table-per-subclass	fluent
i m using the fluent nhibernate mapper with table-per-subclass to map the following structure

2283935
gridview	rowdatabound
you can also use rowdatabound event of gridview or you can select in markup as described by brian

2283984
public	protected
the context binding tags also let you call public protected functions on the page user control as

2284043
apk	dex

2284111
children	parent
again it changes color while its children don t and important its parent reverts to its original color

2284129
accessor	properties
using this pattern current always contains the current values of the object irrespective of its editing state which makes the properties accessor easy to implement

2284148
google-chrome	firefox
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

2284163
away3d	papervision3d
displaying 3d objects in flash is easy using one of papervision3d or away3d

2284213
postgresql	mysql
a two mediawiki installs pointing back at the same mysql or postgresql database or

2284213
postgresql	mysql
b two mediawiki + mysql postgresql installs replicating data from a master to a slave but the mw slave would have to point back at the mysql master for writes

2284260
getter	setter
however make getter an setter in the parent its a wise choice

2284262
stdout	stderr
s stdin stdout stderr are utf-8

2284265
inherited	properties
then if you want to make changes per-machine instead of per-project like it used to be you just set a properties sheet up the way you want and make all your projects inherited from it

2284335
put	get
put the assembly if any in the gac or in the website bin but i d suggest using the gac until you get the basics up and running

2284370

i want to scale the width and height by the same amount so

2284374
gridview	entitydatasource

2284498
nswindow	nspanel
i cannot find a simple tutorial online that explains the basics of nspanel windowing as different from nswindow

2284509
listview	gridview
if you re not dead-set on using a listview you could instead use a gridview setting the autogeneratecolumns property to true

2284514
profiling	debugging
they add complexity to the source file they make it bigger they re ugly to deal with in terms of debugging and profiling etc

2284549
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you need to use an nscalendar to extract that date s nsdatecomponents

2284562
google-chrome	firefox
i m getting a scroll bar due to the element on the right but not the element on the left ie6 7 8 google-chrome firefox

2284574

2284690
apache	nginx
we have a project deployed with nginx apache django and postgres

2284690
apache	nginx
given performance requirement i need some way which uses nginx and doesn t really bring apache into picture and accepts the file

2284705
post	get
you have mixed get vs post

2284725
x86	64bit
but i think it returns the program files x86 folder on a 64bit windows machine

2284759
x86	64bit
system.environment.getfolderpath system.environment.specialfolder.programfiles returns c program files on a 64bit machine unless the code is build to target x86 in which case it returns c program files x86 so i guess that would work for you

2284777
hide	show
i was thinking i could hide it by adding a beginrequest call to hide and a show on end request but it doesn t work

2284829
accessor	properties
typed accessor properties to access

2284851
portrait	landscape
so if i take a picture of a building the roof will be on the topside whether i hold the phone in landscape position or portrait

2284868
range	minimum
since you know that the range is 0 1000 just add the appropriate minimum and maximum properties to the linearaxis

2284894
tcplistener	tcpclient
you need one tcpclient and one tcplistener

2284952
x86	64bit
intel-like cpu of the x86 family have a hardware implementation of the sin function but it is part of the x87 fpu and not used anymore in 64bit mode where sse2 registers are used instead

2284971
html5lib	beautifulsoup
also the beautifulsoup tree builder is going to be deprecated in html5lib 1.0 . this solution was thanks to amarghosh s tip

post	get
issue number one with this is the request requires a verb in the web.config enabling get post easy added

2285223
16-bit	64bit
also remember that there is no ntvdm on 64bit windowsâ you can t run 16-bit programs

2285232
metaphone	soundex
other possibly useful functions could be soundex similar_text or metaphone

2285238
metaphone	soundex
but functions like soundex or metaphone that calculate some kind of digest can help to reduce the number of actual comparisons

2285238
metaphone	soundex
if you store the soundex or metaphone value for each known word in your database you can reduce the number of possible matches very quickly

2285241
width	height
since flowlayoutpanel lays out the controls without particularly thinking about the number of rows columns but rather on cumulative width height you may need to keep track of how many controls you ve already added

2285241
width	height
the idea is to set the width and height of the panel in such a way that you ll get your desired number of columns there

width	height
tablelayout gives you a good mechanism for rows and columns managing width and height is easier but you d need more code to change the placement of all controls if you want to remove one from the form dynamically

2285259
getter	setter
note the relevant getter and setter i m using within my entity is as follows

2285264
switching	screens
sometime the reconnect also fails to fire so when i switching to quartz screens i get a que of a half dozen disconnect dialogs i have to click on

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
i currently use fpdf to create some fairly complicated reports and am trying to upgrade to tcpdf but i ve found that my same code running through tcpdf is about twice as slow

2285314
tcpdf	fpdf
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf

2285341
listview	gridview
listview or gridview this should be pretty easy

2285343
cos	sin	cos	sine	pow	sin
in the c language the standard c library includes common math functions not included in the language itself pow sin and cos for power sine and cosine respectively

2285343
cpu	processors
now the compiler may optimize the standard c library function sin provided by libm.so to be replaced with an call to a native instruction to your cpu fpu s built-in sin function which exists as an fpu instruction fsin for x86 x87 on newer processors like the core 2 series this is correct pretty much as far back as the i486dx

2285363
launch4j	jsmooth
you could use a java executable wrapper - like jsmooth or launch4j

2285383
post	put
i m not going to put all my questions in one long post it just makes everything more confusing and i need to understand this once and for all

2285393
verilog	hdl
see resources for learning verilog for some info on the differences between hdl programming and computer programming

2285423
width	height
i gave the image width height properties and that seemed to fix it

2285454
ada	pascal
similarly if you ve only ever seen c or c++ or maybe even pascal ada modula clu nothing can really prepare you for the power and expressiveness of first-class functions

2285454
ocaml	sml
or change between languages in the ocaml f# sml family

2285482
hash	md5
iâ ve just made an application that sends an etag whose value is the md5 hash of the response body

2285482
hash	md5
this last question is hard to answer unless you are the author so iâ m trying to find the weak points of using an md5 hash as an etag

2285492
expander	itemscontrol
i want to make an itemscontrol that provides some of its own children and then when used can add additional children similarly to the built in expander class

2285493
firefox	safari
i have a small issue with jquery on safari mac osx 10.6 - the page loads fine under firefox mac and internet explorer win but has to be refreshed to work properly in safari.

2285540
hash	md5
generating an md5 hash of a web page costs processing power and time on the server

2285566
expander	itemscontrol
expander derives from headeredcontentcontrol and this adds in the itemscontrol behavior to that

2285577
shadowbox	lightbox
this is to wire up shadowbox lightbox clone for this actionlink

2285584
hash	md5
if you are using md5 and you can cache store the association between the resource and the md5 hash then that s a fine solution

2285591
textview	imageview
using a framelayout containing both the imageview and textview

2285603
put	get
but what i get is everytime i run a page the instance is null so the object restarts as you can see i put an echo empty

2285652
post	get
i come from the world of web programming and usually the server sets a superglobal variable through the specified method get post etc that makes available the data a user inputs into a field

2285735
put	get	post	put	post	get
the set of operations supported by the web service using http methods post get put or delete

2285743
put	get	post	put	post	get
they use the http verbs get post put and delete and others sometimes

2285750
unix	solaris
is size of _posix_path_max is same for all unix flovors linux solaris

2285756
paredit	slime
you ll need to put together a few pieces emacs slime which works perfectly well with clojure -- see swank-clojure swank-clojure the clojure implementation of slime s server counterpart clojure-mode paredit and of course the clojure jar for a start then perhaps some extras among which leiningen would perhaps be the most notable

2285756
paredit	slime
setting up clojure incanter emacs slime swank and paredit post on the blog of the incanter project

2285778
put	get	post	put	post	get
the http verbs get post put and delete are typical actions that you can apply against any resource

2285784
versioning	upgrade
heroku made all its apps upgrade to the latest versioning of bundler 0.9.4

2285802
hash	md5
should work a bit better since md5 hash usually are expressed as hexadecimal numbers

2285864
g++	gcc
i ran the code in gcc using gettimeofday i ll paste code below and used g++ -o2 file.cpp and got slightly faster results then c#

2285898
3des	aes
3des or rc4 or aes and a message authentication code such as hmac-sha1 to detect tampering

2285936
width	height
i m using rectangles defined in terms of their x y coordinates and their width and height

2285936
width	height
i figured out how to rotate them in terms of coordinates but i m stuck on the height and width

2285936
width	height
my intention is to get the width and height either reversed or negated due to whatever the angle is

2285965
idictionary	ilist
system.web.mvc.controlleractioninvoker.invokeactionmethodwithfilters controllercontext controllercontext ilist 1 filters actiondescriptor actiondescriptor idictionary 2 parameters +193

2285980
width	height
rotation should not change width and height

2285980
cos	sin
your equation is correct if you want to rotate x y about 0 0 by deg but note that often cos and sin functions expect arguments in radians rather than degrees so you may need to multiply deg by pi 180 radians per degree

2285980
cos	sin
if you need to find the locations of other rectangle vertices besides x y after rotating then you should either store and rotate them along with x y or keep some information about the rectangle s orientation such as deg so you can recompute them as x+width cos deg y+height sin deg

2285995
hide	show
effectively when the text value is emptytext hide the password field and show a normal text field

2286035
dictionary	map
i m not sure a switch is the best idea but i m also not sure how to correctly employ a dictionary to map the data retrieval and object creation to a specific type

2286069
int	double
first when casting you need a type double int

2286075
width	height
from the way you describe only rotating by 90 degrees and the way you seem to be defining width and height perhaps you are looking for something like

2286075
width	height
not sure why you want to have negative values for width and height though

2286075
width	height
because otherwise each 90 degree rotation effectively just swaps width and height regardless which way you rotate

2286145
perl	tcl
with the first already being familiar from its use in sh bash tcl perl awk .

2286178
calloc	malloc
new delete are keywords in the c++ language like for and while whereas malloc calloc are function calls in the standard c library like printf and sleep

2286218
inherited	properties
then you can inherited from the media class in your cd dvd and book classes and add specific properties to those media types

2286238
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
doing such things in modern browsers is trivial but in ie you need to call msxml through javascript and .net stuff in order to do the same transformations native to other far more modern browsers firefox safari google-chrome opera k-meleon konqueror epiphany flock....you get the idea

2286256
pull	push
this sort of thing is great for fixing up a mistake in your local repository but since you re changing history make sure you didn t push to someone else or they didn t pull from you the original version before you fixed it

2286277
post	get
it should be able to do either get or post

2286298
128bit	64bit
the plan here is to use the 16 64bit general purpose registers and the 128bit sse registers to do really really long integer math

2286304
int	double
note if you 15 is the cd price then you should consider using bigdecimal instead of int double or whatever you are using

2286304
int	double
if it was something else then change the bigdecimal for and int double and its corresponding parameter name

2286340
put	get
i get the impression that it was removed entirely for a version or two and then put back but with warnings and tut-tuts about overriding the default value 0 which really means 17 which the manual promises is enough to represent any ieee 754 double

2286353
initializer	class-method
class-method identified by the static keyword operate on the base class in a way that s shared by all initializer objects of that class

2286353
superclass	subclassing
note that you don t need to cast subclassing to their superclass as the jvm already knows the class heirarchy just like the compiler knows in c++

2286387
width	height
maybe the width and height of the pyramid are set during the constructor so getwidth and getheight default to 0.0 when called there

2286408
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
you define onmousedown onmouseout onmousemove and onmouseup

2286410
put	get	post	put	post	get
making an application restful usually means among other things to actually use the concept of reacting differently to get post put or delete requests on the same url

2286411
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i don t know for ie and safari but it works on firefox google-chrome and opera

wordpress	phpbb
take an example of an existing web application such as wordpress and phpbb

2286416
folder	directory
my flex application is successfully calling functions in a javascript file through the externalinterface class when these are in the bin-debug folder and the js file is located in the same directory as the flex app

2286422
implements	extends
if i need a extends b but i also need to have a function that accepts a c and i want to pass a to that function then i must make either b or c an interface rather than a parent class and make it a extends b implements c or vice versa

2286476
postgresql	mysql
with shared hosting you may be allowed to open up a port to a server database my website s hosting server provides both mysql and postgresql and but allows remote access only to mysql and only via host name ip address

2286542
stdout	fflush
once you fix the previous error and get the process to close that will fflush stdout

2286542
puts	fflush	stdout	fflush
you can also consider adding fflush stdout after your puts line

post	put
have a look at this post it explains how the denormalizer works and may put you in the right direction concerning your question

2286618
pull	push
if you want someone to see your merge then you need to push pull between branches not drop back diff patch

2286635
cpu	processors
different x86 processors have very different architectures and pipelines so a sequence of instructions that is the fastest possible on one cpu might be relatively slower on another

2286635
cpu	processors
in this case the microsoft c++ compiler s optimization strategy was targeted to a different processors than the cpu acidzombie24 was actually using but gcc chose instructions more suited to his cpu

2286658
mouseleave	mouseenter
using mouseenter and mouseleave events i set a boolean to refer to on blur event

2286668
mouseover	mouseout
then do whatever you want to in jquery with mouseover mouseout events

2286670
width	height
when i resize the height or width the only thing that resize is the image and it s div

2286821
opera	firefox
css3 supports this there is also a special -moz-border-radius style atttribute which firefox maybe opera supports

2286841
move	drag
note regarding pdt2.1 and even the upcoming pdt 2.2 next july the drag and drop or the move of resources still has a lot of bugs including bug 256278 which concerns an odd message on a drag and drop

2286842
elementtree	beautifulsoup
in the past i ve done everything from write my own parser use regular expressions and used various parsing libraries like python s elementtree and beautifulsoup

2286844
gridview	rowdatabound
i am usin rowdatabound event of gridview to do some formating in gridview column

2286940

i want to find a way to get the max value in the range

2287026
extjs	gxt
i m building an application using extjs for gwt gxt

2287030
width	height
if the whole matrix has a mostly constant width and height you may as well use a single vector and address cells with

2287038
width	height
if your matrix has a width of w and a height of h then mapping x y to the index in the vector is simply x w+y

2287062
uploadify	swfupload
yeah swfupload and uploadify both have ways to get them to work with rails

2287116
hide	show
- conditional questions show hide further questions when a certain option is chosen

2287123
des	sha
for reference here is the announcement from the discussion group that moved forward implementing sha over des with support for bsd blowfish

2287155
mouse	keyboard
for the broad masses i would most likely go for solution #2 as it should suit both keyboard and mouse centric users

2287167
implements	extends
my guess is you need to override and implements this method in the widget you create the richtextarea widget in and set the custom styles in the onload method of that widget or you can extends the richtextarea and implements the onload in this extended richtextarea widget

2287182
nsimage	nsscrollview
assume i load an nsimage of dimensions 2000x2000 and display only a portion of the picture inside an nsscrollview with frame size 500x300

2287221
tabcontrol	tabitem
in my tabcontrol using wpf c#.i entering text to listbox in one tabitem from the click event in tabcontrol

2287235
folder	directory
then i would rather try to add a linked folder referencing the root directory of those classes and select that folder when exporting the project to a jar

2287262
int	double
first you need to determine whether it s a whole number or not by comparing it cast as both an int and a double

2287266
folder	directory
the folder that represent the path to the package must not be included in the directory included in the classpath only the top directory for the class folder should be there

2287318
fastcgi	scgi
idea 2 using a normal web server and adding a fastcgi cgi scgi backend to my application

2287318
fastcgi	scgi
the next thing that came to my head was using a mature but compact web server for instance lighttpd and simple provide a fastcgi scgi cgi backend to it

2287333
getter	setter
implement your own getter and setter

2287333
getter	setter
have the compiler implement getter and setter by property synchronized

2287346
ati	nvidia
but use perfhud from nvidia or gpuperfstudio from ati or gpa from intel

2287373
int	double
this is because the compiler assumed that f returned an int and the assignment converted that int to a double

2287431
actionscript	mxml
i want to convert the following code to actionscript mxml works fine

2287460
put	get
we don t know what it can handle besides a -- it could be any superclass of a all the way up to object . in this particular case it s probably safe enough but if you consider something like a list we could be in a lot of trouble you can safely put an a into a but if you assume you re only going to get a s out of it you re going to get classcastexceptions .

2287468
hide	show
1 to hide show you are better just using the hide and show mothods available on a jquery object

2287508
equals	gethashcode
as you can see i have a base class implementing a generic identifier equals gethashcode and

2287508
equals	gethashcode
providing the field with a guid value for id before adding it to the set will take me to the evil assigned ids and if you were to answer to not rely on id for equals gethashcode and to find a natural model-related key...well i don t believe i ve ever found in these properties which provide the immutabilty uniqueness a key deserves

2287551
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
for example an ant build.xml file a maven pom.xml file or even a makefile

2287565
gridview	repeater
bind only works in the context of a databount control such a gridview repeater etc. and is used in datatemplates of those controls

2287575
postgresql	mysql
i do understand that things like postgresql arrays make it impossible to simply attach the mysql interface to any postgresql database but the database was created only through the mysql interface then there would be a guarantee that it did not contain arrays

2287624
getter	setter
i thought this was a good idea until when i encounter frameworks that require setter and getter methods

2287624
uibinder	smartgwt
right now i am trying to adapt all of smartgwt into gwt uibinder especially those classes that are not a gwt widget

2287624
public	protected
the annotation framework would then instantiate transport machine and guzzler as hidden members of car and expand to break-out the protected public characteristics in the precedence dictated by the project annotation sequence into actual source code or into byte-code

2287624
int	boolean
it would be wonderful too if the annotation plugin framework lets me specify that boolean int or whatever else needs to be converted from string and does the conversion parsing for me too

2287626
drive	createfile
so call createfile get a handle then call getfinalpathnamebyhandle volume_name_guid this works because network drive don t have volume guids

2287637
equals	gethashcode
the base class has overriden equals gethashcode methods etc..

2287637
persistent	transient
in my implementation of the equals method in the base class i check whether the entity is transient not yet persistent

2287656
coalesce	isnull
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

2287673
coalesce	isnull
to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

2287673
coalesce	isnull
isnull vs coalesce

2287673
coalesce	isnull
isnull vs coalesce speed test

2287680
put	get
i put break points in these functions and they don t even get called

2287700
liferay	alfresco
there are plenty of commercial tools assisting you on migrating from lotus to sharepoint this seems to be an almost inevitable process unless you prefer to go for liferay alfresco .

2287770
ssl	https
however it also appears that some browsers send a bad_certficate alert to close an https connection when the server certificate acquired during the ssl handshake has expired is self-signed fails the hostname verification etc

2287772
pop-up	dialog
whenever the value changes which you would do manually when you deploy a new version just pop-up a dialog telling the user to refresh the browser or log in out

versioning	upgrade
if it contains the string update_recommended just show a little icon at the top right corner saying that there is a new versioning and that they should upgrade in their own time

2287797
memcpy	strcpy
when you have non-const pointer you can allocate the memory for it and then use strcpy or memcpy to copy the string itself

2287805
gridbaglayout	boxlayout

post	get
requirements are fairly vanilla http get post for a small number of resource types xml and json output needs to live in the same appdomain with a soap asmx web service

2287977
fadein	fadeout
you have chained your fadein and fadeout

2287985
fadein	fadeout
when you use fadein and fadeout you don t just use out on that div s background but on the entire element including all sub elements

2287985
background-color	transparency
therefore you need to set the background-color to blue and then aftwards set it to transparency

2288006
getter	setter
the entities with imports getter and setter removed

2288013
int	double
the gmp and rcdd packages deal with multiple precision arithmetic via an interace to the gmp library but this is mostly related to big int rather than more decimal places for your double

2288022
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in ie firefox and google-chrome and it seems that when you disabled cookies the document.cookie object becomes unavailable

2288104

crossover	mutation
i ve written a basic genetic algorithm with a binary encoding genes that builds a fitness value and evolves through several iterations using tournament selection mutation and crossover

2288106
crossover	mutation
the fitness function merely adds together the value of these genes and in the pop class handles selection mutation and crossover of two selected individuals

2288284
jsf	seam
seam jsf + ejb3 jpa

2288284
jsf	seam
seam offers benefits of jsf minus the issues associated with it

2288336
width	height
i guess you can cache the original size 1024x768 and then just assign this dimension programmatically using width height properties

2288399
outputstream	inputstream
thumbnail is not saved on hard disc i use inputstream and outputstream

2288413

postgresql	mysql
as a result there is no transactional ddl possible in mysql one of the most handy things in postgresql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
using postgresql as an engine in mysql would kill this option

2288489
postgresql	mysql
postgresql also has a much richer sql dictionary that might give problems in mysql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
what is called a database in mysql is sort of a schema in postgresql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
imho it doesn t make sense to create a postgresql-engine in mysql if you want to use postgresql

2288489
postgresql	mysql
i m afraid you would lose the best things of postgresql because of the limitations of mysql

2288491
yourkit	jprofiler
use jprofiler or yourkit or the jvm s built-in tools to find out what it s doing and reduce the memory usage

2288576
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in most browsers firefox internet explorer safari it just renders with the bar immediately but google-chrome probably because its tries to render early on making it faster on most pages first renders the page then renders the bar and causing the page to jump 40px everytime it is rendered

2288577
rss	feed
i m trying to build a polling service in java that checks for updates from a rss feed

2288583
put	get
to put this into perspective i only need to get the http request for image through

i would avoid the use of goto to break from an infinite loop or to proceed to the next iteration use break and continue

2289021
cout	cin
a possible approach is to modify your c++ program so that it takes its input from the standard input stream std cin instead of from the command line parameters and returns its result through the standard ouput std cout instead of as main s return value

uiview	calayer
i have a calayer transformed in 3d on a offscreen uiview much larger than 320x480

2289964
free	malloc
as far as free not taking a const pointer i think that one could argue either that that might have been an oversight of the standards committee or that that s because it takes the same kind if pointer that malloc returns

2289970
terminate	timeout
allow you to use the built-in mechanisms to terminate asynchronous threads to implement your timeout

2290019
children	parent
with the former it would become the parent view controller s responsibility to configure its children whereas with the latter the children would effectively configure themselves

2290019
children	parent
i m trying to decide whether it s better to create a subclass for each one and override the fetchrequest property or make it the responsibility of the parent controller to set the fetchrequest property for its children

2290020
valgrind	callgrind
in my comment above that sample class was originally using select but after seeing the cpu cost valgrind w callgrind i switched to epoll

2290239
valgrind	memcheck
i assume you re using valgrind memcheck tool which is what it is famous for

2290239
valgrind	memcheck
since you are using valgrind already you might also try running your program through formerly exp-ptrcheck which is an experimental tool that is designed to catch certain types of errors that memcheck will miss including access checks for stack and global arrays and use of pointers that happen to point to a valid object but not the object that was intended

2290240

2290354
haskell	ocaml
while dons is correct that multicore parallelism at the thread level is better supported in haskell it sounds like you could live with process level parallelism from your phrase ideally separating out each execution to run in parallel . which is supported quite well in ocaml

2290354
haskell	ocaml
keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module system than haskell

2290354
haskell	ocaml
as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s

2290354
haskell	ocaml
that said learning ocaml is a great stepping-stone towards learning haskell because many of the underlying concepts are very similar so you could always migrate to haskell later and find a lot of things familiar there

2290375
matplotlib	scipy
i installed python 2.6.4 and several additional packages numpy scipy matplotlib and of course nltk

2290413
equals	icomparable

2290648
red-black-tree	heap
best i could come up with is building a red-black-tree o nlgn that will be used to build a frequency heap

2290679
nunit	mstest
their support for svn source control is excellent and we like the fact that they support both mstest and nunit for unit testing

2290692
cassini	iis
you will need to install iis or cassini to host the mvc web site

2290705
mvp	presenter
in mvp the bulk of the work should be in the presenter

2290721
nunit	mstest
yes check out this links nunit mstest dual testing

2290735
getter	setter
if you done your encapsulation correctly and only access members with const getter and non-const setter this should be good enough for you

2290742
for-loop	arrays
if we take a look at jquery function itself it has a for-loop to iterate over an object that has a length property falsely believing it s an arrays

2290747
implements	extends
i can t decide if i should extends membershipuser and implements the appropriate interfaces or completely roll my own

2290752
nunit	mstest
although in fact as sergey mentions nunit and mstest frameworks are similar enough that you can with care write common tests that can work with both frameworks

2290764
public	protected
it doesn t matter whether they are protected public or anything else

2290799

2290873
udp	tcp
i understand tcp udp are the popular ones

2290873
udp	tcp
tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

2290921
udp	tcp
with a good broadband connection tcp should be fine and will make life easier since you have guarantees about delivery that are otherwise missing from udp

2290931
udp	tcp
a tcp header is 32 bytes while a udp header is only 16 bytes

2290931
icmp	udp
an icmp packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

2290935
ant	maven
recently we migrated from using ant to maven

2291090
min	max
note setting axis x y . min max imum seems to have no effect if a point exists inside the bounds

2291093
for-loop	loops
your loops will have to be a standard for-loop like this

2291114
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind memcheck can t detect overflows on arrays allocated on the stack

2291115
button	checkbox
i d also like to be able to add controls other than menu items to this context menu checkbox lists button etc...

2291143
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for the following sample ordered list markup and css ie7 is rendering the numbers alongside the bottom of the list item whereas firefox safari and google-chrome are behaving as desired with the numbers aligned alongside the top of the list item

2291157
pull	push
you can either use ajax to poll the server for updates on a regular basis pull model or use the juggernaut plugin or similar to enable the server to send updates to the client push model

2291164
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i have a base class with properties that exist for each subclassing that other classes inherited from

2291164

2291353
multiplying	division
if you want 4 hour increments divide the hour by 4 using integer division and then multiplying by 4 when creating the new datetime element

2291383
nunit	mstest
generally a unit testing framework such as nunit or mstest for .net stuff would be used

2291383
nunit	moq
a loose example is an mvc type test using nunit and moq

2291403
hash	salt
you also might consider a different approach one simple method would be to hash the primary key with a salt if you wish and store the hash and pk in your database

2291433
postgresql	mysql
we cannot deny the power that can be had by using a rdbms mysql postgresql ms sql server etc they have been in development for more than 30 years and many issues have been thought through and addressed

2291437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in the versions of firefox safari and google-chrome that i ve tested but i get some duplication of text in ie8

2291450
hide	show
what i am going to do is show and hide the content1 div element

2291450
hide	show
inside that div that is being show and hidden there is another text link that will hide the div

2291450
put	get
just put it all together to get it how you want it

2291490
public	protected
i think your point is since everything derives from java.lang.object and consequently accesses its protected members it wouldn t make any difference for it or any method in java.lang.object for that matter to be public as opposed to protected

2291552
hide	show
then instead of using hide and show use toggle

2291554
getter	setter
the methods that read and return an attribute value are called getter and those that write attributes are called setter

2291559
getter	setter
for example if you want to have a certain property in your class let s say amount and give the client of you class the option to change or extract its value you should make your variable amount private not visible for those who use your class and generate two methods a getter and a setter that manipulates your value that are public

2291560
int	chars
int fortable or chars 3 fortable

2291565

sorting filtering grouping is really will be easy with using ria services datafilter control for silverlight

2291584
hide	show
as far as i know the accordion hide the elements that are not show and this might interfere with the loading of the page into the iframe

2291589
int	chars
i also think performance wise the int should beat the chars 3

2291641
innodb	myisam
i have a database called av2web which contains 130 myisam tables and 20 innodb tables

2291641
innodb	myisam
i wanna take mysqldump of these 20 innodb tables and export it to another database as myisam tables

2291649
outputstream	inputstream
also make sure you override parent class urlconnection.getoutputstream outputstream and urlconnection.html#getinputstream inputstream methods to return decorated outputstream and inputstream objects as well

2291668
int	double
this generally assumes that your fpu operates with the same endianness as the int part of your cpu and that â less guaranteed for double and indeed the trick is harder to make portable for 32-bit machines with 64-bit fpus

2291673
hide	show
if so then you can create a sprite and show or hide it based on an event

2291776
put	get
then i would go through each itinerary and if the destination wans t in the map i would create an entry with put destination 1 otherwise i would increment the count that was there with put destination get destination +1

2291807
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work just fine with jquery 1.4.2 firefox ie google-chrome

2291840
istream	getline
the standard library does not provide iterators to do this although you can implement something like that on your own but you can simply use the getline function not the istream method to read a whole line from an input stream to a c++ string

2291869
hash	salt
this is why a better solution is to store a salt password hash

2291882
mouse	keyboard
if you re looking to perform user interface automation uia to simulate mouse clicks keyboard presses etc

2291908

2292160
post	put
i would like to be able to use put requests instead of post

2292161

however from looking at tutorials objects must extends implements threads runnable however if the object is in a thread making a method call to that object seems to happen sequentially anyway

2292219
inherited	properties
this will return all my custom fields in addition to the properties inherited from

2292233
width	height
get width and height of picture and make an empty picture with the dimensions

2292243
width	height
if you want to do it yourself then from my experience you have to add multiple uiimageview with the correct position x y width height to the uiscrollview

2292267
pop-up	dialog
thats a modal dialog pop-up

2292292
width	height
before drawing the path i have scaled the canvas such that the origin is the lower left corner up is y+ right is x+ and the height and width are both 1

2292403
pull	push
in git he ll find out when he tries to pull changes into his local repository or push his changes to the master

2292457
put	get
if you can t get rid of the horizontal scrollbar you should at least try to put the more important columns first so that your users don t have to scroll to the right very often

2292484
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
1 assuming there is a central repository which is the case of svn and cvs but not necessarily git bazaar mercurial etc. and person a commits and then push the commit which just transfers the diffs and commit messages to the central repository person b should update it s copy manually

2292487
postgresql	mysql
or you can make the most of the fact that some very clever people worked out database theory read up normalization for the skinny and then and this is real important all the other clever folks who ve gone ahead and built relational databases like mysql postgresql sql server access oracle etc etc based everything they ve done on all that database theory

2292535
integer	unsigned
but things like cmyclass for class and uicount for unsigned integer named count does not help programmers and just leads to extra wasteful typing

2292560
expression-blend	silverlight
if you want to do better gui prototyping use silverlight and expression-blend

2292624
setinterval	clearinterval
using plain old javascript these are the setinterval and clearinterval methods

2292628
vbscript	jscript
in that thread chris nielsen has a creative idea of using a javascript library on the server side as asp supports jscript as well as vbscript

2292643
versioning	upgrade
i used an older grails versioning latest that was out in november 2009 and upgrade to 1.2.1 now

2292651
pull	push
mercurial repositories are also much easier to backup and restore you can always simply copy them but you can use push and pull to make incremental transfers to your backup location

2292743
haskell	scheme
haskell is a little different with its lazy evaluation model effectively automatically producing the effect of closures in many cases but in scheme you end up using lambdas for control flow a lot

2292763
post	get
you will have to somehow remember this from the time you the server are handling the post until you are handling the get

2292826

works fine for me in safari google-chrome and firefox 3.5

2292949
firefox	safari
inspecting the element in safari or web developer firefox plugin does not reveal anything unusual either

2292967
opera	firefox
a quick comparison between opera 10.10 ie 6 and firefox 3.6 all on winxp sp3 - opera and ie show slightly larger fonts

2292967
gentoo	linux	opera	firefox
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

2293011
stdout	stderr
with this you will be redirecting the stderr which is descriptor 2 to the file descriptor 1 which is the the stdout

2293011
stdout	stderr
combining the two commands will result in redirecting both stderr and stdout to sample.s

2293042
puts	gets
third postrunnable does not take effect immediately but rather puts things on a message queue for the main application thread to process when it gets a chance

2293090
haskell	ocaml
as an examples of haskell and ocaml in machine learning see stuff at hal daume and lloyd allison homepages

2293090
haskell	ocaml
imo it s is much more straightforward to achieve c++-like performance in ocaml than in haskell

2293147
integer	unsigned
each uiview can have a unique tag associated with it which is just an unsigned integer

2293177
doc	rtf
itâ s a webservice that supports various formats of input docx doc rtf txt and output docx doc html pdf jpg gif...

2293183
expression-blend	silverlight
i had a very talented and smart graphic designer working for me at one stage and convinced her to use expression-blend so she could stylise my silverlight apps

2293203
inherited	properties
when you make a control that is inherited from control you have to make use of a couple of properties such as isdesignmode you can then construct event handlers especially for within design mode

2293255
exponent	modulo
then i can get modulo and exponent of the rsa public key in byte

2293255
exponent	modulo
but it seems like rsapublic.modulus and rsapublic.exponent are not in this format there are many not-digits in the byte of the modulo and exponent

2293281
getter	setter
a semantic can be a setter getter other property or addon removeon or fire event p317

2293282
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in google-chrome and safari but not the latest version of firefox 3.6 on the pc

2293316
exponent	modulo
it looks like you can get the byte arrays by getting an rsaparameters object via rsacryptoserviceprovider.exportparameters and then extracting from this the exponent and modulo fields

2293333
postgresql	mysql
edit i created an empty django project - default django configuration plus django.contrib.admin and fresh empty database tried both with mysql and postgresql

2293359
setinterval	settimeout
i ve looked at settimeout and setinterval and these appear to just delay the execution of a script whereas i want to literally timeout a long running process

2293378
google-chrome	safari
except for webkit the rendering engine in safari and google-chrome which has a totally custom made-up-by-dave-hyatt not-even-in-css-3 property value -webkit-background-clip text

2293378
google-chrome	safari
no other browser other than safari and google-chrome supports it

2293395
dlsym	dlopen
dlfcn.h dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose

2293396
opensolaris	bsd
if you want to know and understand this technology just create a virtual single machine install bsd linux opensolaris etc

2293422
glassfish	resin	glassfish	weblogic	jboss	resin	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	weblogic	resin
you can pay for a java ee app server weblogic websphere or use an open source one jboss glassfish and openejb and activemq or you can stick to spring and deploy on tomcat jetty resin or any other servlet jsp engine

2293476
rss	feed
sun have an rss utilities library that was built for creating feed

2293518
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to upgrade to the latest versioning of the .net provider for firebird

2293541
yacc	bison
you should never access yylval directly in the yacc bison file as its not reliable

2293541
yacc	bison
to make this work for non-terminals you need to use type declarations for them in the yacc bison file and the rules for those non terminals need to set eg

2293560
hash	md5
interoperability as has already been mentioned is very much in ldap s favour with some types of server software although much of the software that integrate with ldap require a specific schema so it s not necessarily as simple as just installing and configuring an ldap service and off you go - you might need to add new elements in the schema for each app you want to interact with and each application might have different limitations with regard to authentication for example plain text password fields password fields as md5 or sha hash etc

2293571
extjs	smartgwt
not as good looking as smartgwt or extjs but a lot quicker

2293580
hive	hdfs
if you know sql you could take a look at using hive ql to query the hdfs

2293581
cpu	processors
a prof once told us in class that windows linux os x and unix scale on threads and not processes so threads would likely benefit your application even on a single processors because your application would be getting more time on the cpu

2293587
for-loop	loops
however when i proceed to claim a hash map outside the for-loop and expect the hash map is updated after loops it turns out that the hash map stays empty

2293592
implements	extends
i am trying to implements a method for finding the boudning box of rectangle circle location and the group which all extends shape

2293602
cpu	processors
a prof once told us in class that windows linux os x and unix scale on threads and not processes so threads would likely benefit your application even on a single processors because your application would be getting more time on the cpu

2293687
haskell	agda
as in languages like agda clean coq and haskell

2293695
post	get
i ll be sure to post my results once i get everything sorted out and working for my project

2293703
int	double
it has a int double and string constructors so you can simply have

2293708
qtextedit	qvboxlayout
also i have a qtextedit visible by default which is in a qvboxlayout with the qhboxlayout that hold the buttons

2293708
hide	show
so the problem is this when i hide the qtextedit and show the other buttons the window won t resize

2293748
apache	nginx
unfortunately apache doesn t have a reliable push service like nginx

2293768
free	malloc
if the pointer is getting changed a lot you may have to write some code around malloc and free to keep track of which values are good and bad

2293781
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to a newer versioning of ruby easily it should give you that method on the range

2293782
int	chars
provided that you know the size of the data structure you can represent that size in some number of chars s or int s

2293782
int	chars
there are a few caveats...both the sender and receiver need to agree on the interpretation of the message contents and the buffer that you provide on the sending and receiving side needs to fit into some definable number of chars s or int s

2293821
client-side	server-side
another good example is webform validations the client-side validation scripts are all generated dynamically at the server-side

2293947
x86	64bit
so if you app was working in 32-bit you should try setting the compiler options in the project properties to explicitly produce an x86 32-bit app which should run on both 32-bit and 64bit

2293948
hash	md5
sha1 is a safer hash function than md5 which also means it s slower which probably means you should use md5

2293961
getter	setter
for a getter and setter for an attribute

2293968
dictionary	map
i have some global dictionary keyed by the unique numeric id s for lecturers and projects that map to objects

2293972
wan	lan
in a lan wan situation you need to make sure nothing is connecting them to the outside world except through the proxy

2294037
folder	directory
if the third-party app ignores the current directory you could make a symlink to it in a different folder

2294044
hide	show
this is a great tutorial on getting started with jquery which covers show hide effects which is what you want to look at to achieve the functionality you ve described.

2294097
put	get
if someone wants to steal software and willing to put in the time and effort to do so they will be able to get it - no matter how good it is

2294102
strstr	substr
don t use substr â use strstr strnstr

2294146
daemon	cron
you just need some communication between a privileged daemon or frequent cron and the cgi script

2294146
daemon	cron
have the cgi script create a file if the daemon or cron finds it have it restart the service and unlink the file

2294167
i2c	spi
you basically have to read the datasheet for the device you are wanting to interface with and read and write to its memory over whatever interface it might use spi i2c uart etc.

2294219
client-side	server-side
important client-side validation is not a substitution for server-side validation

2294221
min	max
an easy way to get the max and min value in an array is as follows

2294221
min	max
this has been explained at get max min values in array

2294232
klocwork	coverity
i suspect they cost more than youâ re willing to pay but both coverity and klocwork do serious checking for memory leaks along with lots of other things

2294238
geocoding	geocode
assuming you are asking whether you should do your geocoding with javascript or a server side language like php best practice is to cache whatever geocoding you can into some sort of persistance layaer xml db whatever and minimise the number of client side geocode requests because of the delay it will introduce

2294270
client-side	server-side
however google offers its geocoding services through a client-side api in javascript and though a server-side web service

2294270
client-side	server-side
server-side geocoding is limited to 15k requests per day per server while client-side geocoding is limited to 15k requests per day per client

2294272
hide	show
the way i ve built it and have done this before on a smaller scale with no problem is to imagemap the main image of the usa give each area an id then use jquery to show hide an absolutely positioned div overtop of the map

2294272
mouseover	mouseenter
as you can see i ve experimented with various functions including mouseover mouseenter and hover

2294314
memcached	apc
if the boost is not so significant i m going to replace apc with memcached

2294331
spaces	linefeed
first create regexp that replaces all comments with equally number of spaces and linefeed so that row and col positions won t change

2294334
quicksort	mergesort
you could present the questions through the algorithms of quicksort or mergesort

2294347
memcached	apc
apc and memcached are not the same things

2294347
memcached	apc
you can use either apc or memcached or both as a data-cache that s what we are doing on the project i m currently working on some data are cached in apc and some others using memcached

2294421
haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme
if you re a java c++ c# kind of guy learn something that will really torque your brain like haskell erlang or scheme

2294473
kohana	yii
almost all php frameworks use the long form symphony yii kohana

2294494
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
jquery tabs is not working on ie8 - working fine on firefox safari google-chrome ie7

2294519
implements	extends
is extends abstractmap not sufficient because abstractmap implements map

2294664
mouseover	mouseenter
to make it work you need to change mouseenter to use mouseover

2294684
jboss	glassfish
these modules can be used to load balance across servlet containers such as tomcat jetty or ejb containers such as jboss glassfish

2294745
put	get
i could not get your question fully but i assume you want the vehicle facility to be selected after form is submitted you put javascript to use for that

2294822
put	get
to ensure all widgets get this new style you need to put your css file in the .gwt.xml file in the following way the order of lines is important

2294832
opera	google-chrome
also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

2294840
pellet	jess
both pellet and jess can primarily be used as semantic reasoners

2294840
pellet	jess
i have not use sweetrules reasoner before but it seems that it supports both swrl and jess rules therefore this reasoner can be helpfull in crossing between jess and pellet

2294858
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed this behaviour in both google-chrome and firefox so i m assuming there s a specific reason for it

2294903
pull	push
the proposal is to change the default to upstream push only the current branch and push it to the branch git pull would pull from

2294905
google-chrome	firefox
well this works for me tested on google-chrome 4 firefox 3.6 ie8

2294914
pull	push
so i have nothing to do with push or pull

2294984
tabcontrol	tabitem
while clicking a button i want to add a new tabitem s to the tabcontrol

2295011
int	double
i would like to prevent this automatic conversion from double to int or at least get warnings at compile time

2295061
firefox	safari
the portion causes jquery to throw an exception in safari 4 and firefox 3.5

2295070
versioning	upgrade
i don t see anything wrong with your config so try to upgrade log4j to a newer not necessarily the latest versioning

2295079
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a checkbox a dropdownlistfor and a text box

2295126
hide	show
as long as you maintain a reference to any node you can affect its style property via hide show etc

2295133
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you can hook up jquery to asynchronously call a controller action when for example a checkbox is checked or a dropdownlistfor changes

2295143
pull	push
the difference is that you don t construct them push based collection but rather you get next element from them pull based collection

2295146
maven	m2e
using generated sources is well supported by m2e use maven update project configuration once sources have been generated and if i remember well by the maven eclipse plugin as well the folder will be added to the java build path

2295189
sorting	filtering
i use imodelbinder for grid s settings binding expression trees for sorting and filtering data

2295190
hide	show
what i want to do is to have a storyboard animation to show hide the menu on the left-hand side

2295203
folder	directory
- it tries to access format file right in working directory root while this file supposed to be in .svn folder

2295237
width	height
i m trying to make a textblock control with a fixed size height and width in a window

2295292
post	get
you should not use post and get variables directly in your array

2295311
width	height
for some reason it does not display the width and height of the li

2295320
width	height
declare the a element as display inline-block and drop the width and height from the li element

2295320
width	text-align
the first method allows you to have a dynamically centered list if you give the ul element a width of 100 so that it spans from left to right edge and then apply text-align center

2295322
width	height
using width height on inline elements is not always a good idea

2295340
16-bit	64bit
as said in the comment please drop turbo c and if you use it turbo c++ nowadays they are both pieces of history and have many incompatibilities with the current c and c++ standards and if i remember well they both generate 16-bit executables that won t even run on 64bit oses on x86_64

2295340
g++	gcc
there are a lot of free working and standard-compliant alternatives vc++ express mingw pelles c cygwin on windows and gcc g++ is the de-facto standard on linux rivaled by clang you just have to pick one

2295405
cgpoint	cgrect
as i also need to store nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect nscolor uicolor and nsimage uiimage structs objects in my model i m not sure what the best way to handle them would be

2295463
inherited	properties
note that mfmailcomposeviewcontroller inherited from uinavigationcontroller so it also has navigationbar properties

2295490
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
i work on linux so don t have the problem as my servers are a mixture of redhat centos and ubuntu

2295490
vmware	virtualbox
you could create a virtual machine on your machine with vmware of virtualbox that mimics your remote server

2295494
freebsd	debian
when i m happy with my changes i push them to a test server freebsd apache for the client s feedback and then when they re happy push the changes to the production server debian apache

2295497
pull	push
you are basically right if you only have one repository you will never need to use push or pull

2295593
post	get
or the session id as get or post parameter with a hidden form field

2295595
bmp	png
i found some piece of code imagecreatefrombmp that converts a bmp to png

2295595
tiff	png
finally i like to save it to tiff or png file or string

2295613
ftp	smb
the answer depends a lot if you re working alone or on team and the method used to share and transfer files subversion git smb ftp ...

2295735
folder	directory
when extensions are installed via the joomla admin panel joomla will create folder that i want to add to svn but these folder are created by the apache user and i do not have write permission or root access which prevents svn from adding .svn directory within

2295790
post	get
sql injections rights management illegal data access via post get data tempering

2295800
client-side	server-side
you d better use json or any other format if you want to treat data client-side before submiting them but please leave sql for server-side processing

2295817
firefox	safari
i have tested your code seems fine in firefox safari on the mac and ie7 on the pc

2295847
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome

2295847
width	margin
i want the padding margin and width of the first 5 columns to be maintained but pushed to the left yet the table should expand as wide as its parent

2295901
shadowbox	lightbox
i m using shadowbox js for showing flash video in lightbox style popups

2295963
ubuntu	linux
there is a package called chm2pdf under ubuntu linux

2296007
free	malloc
malloc and free

2296016
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
in my code i create a subclassing for example if i have a datalayer class which has all the public methods to access the data layer then i might subclassing it with a test_datalayer subclassing which inherited methods from datalayer and which furthermore implements any additional methods that you might want like delete and whose implementation can access internal or protected methods of the base class

2296040
qprogressbar	qwidget
this will draw the qprogressbar into the qwidget

2296111
nunit	mstest
i am not sure how to run unit tests without visual studio but i had moved to nunit from mstests and its reasonably easy - as long as you don t use the test context from mstest can t remember the real name all you have to do is to rename the tags testclass - testfixture etc there is always 1-1 mapping and change the usings

2296136
webclient	webrequest
it s certainly doable with either the webclient classes or ftp webrequest webresponse series of classes - and i can give you some sample code if required - but unless you have some specific business case for rolling your own something like rsync may be the better choice

2296153
children	parent
every time you change a parent you will create a copy of the children if the parent data changes a lot then you will eat up your storage quite quickly

2296153
children	parent
also storing all the child changes within a single parent record will tend to bloat the parent as having lots of children tends to which might have implications for the performance of data retrieval

2296211
margin	height
when the last cell is displayed the imageview textlabel and accessoryview are all maintaining the same margin from the bottom of the cell rather than maintaining their position in the center of the cell like they do on the other rows of smaller height

2296233
width	margin
give the inner a negative margin to negate the padding and fill the width example

2296252
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
linux executables do not have version information like windows have...the only way i can think of doing it is to create a static character string which would be expanded by a version control tracking system such as rcs cvs svn git in which a certain identifier is expanded based on the person who checked-in the code here s the example of rcs identifiers that is used.

2296303
folder	directory
furthermore this project folder should be what goes into your trunk branches and tags directory

2296346
cart	oscommerce
the host that i use has auto installs for oscommerce zen cart and nopcommerce

2296395
post	get
lately i ve been using a wrapper php class that fetches get and post data and lets me access it using a single getter function

2296395
post	get
after years of developing web applications i ve never had a single good reason to care whether an incoming var was coming from post or get

2296395
post	get
today i noticed that codeigniter has one getter function for post data and one for get

2296395
post	get
a couple of clarifications i m not asking about the differences between post or get or which one i should use to send data to a page

2296395
post	get
i m asking about whether i should care if data is arriving to my page via get or post

2296413
post	get
you could care about the difference whether you want your data coming from a form post or it being submitted through url-parameters get

2296416
int	double
from a geocoder object you can call the getfromlocation double double int method

2296420
post	get
but when security is at stake you might well care about the difference if somebody s putting a normally hidden input in a get variable and you treat just as if it came from a post it s a potential attack vector

2296420
put	get	post	put	post	get
in restful apis you definitely care about the difference post means a completely different thing than get in this case along with its much-neglected cousins put and delete

2296430
cldc	midp
i am trying to develop a tcp client that runs on mobile devices using midp 2.0 and cldc 1.1

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
i setup the tcplistener in a server in japan and the tcpclient in uk

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
i kept sending 500 bytes to the tcplistener and when tcplistener sends 10kb back to the tcpclient

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
for all loops i only have one tcpclient and it keeps the connection with tcplistener and do the send receive for 500 times

2296440
tcplistener	tcpclient
how can they be faster than raw tcpclient tcplistener in my experiments

2296471
hash	salt
from your description of the problem you are not trying to create a secure hash - merely hide the file in a large namespace - in which case use of a salt rainbow tables are irrelevant - the only consideration is the likelihood of a false collision where 2 different files give the same hash

2296482
post	get
if you feel hacky use both and differentiate say allow to preserve semi-persistent config by encoding it in get and encouraging to bookmark the page while filling post with strictly volatile stuff

2296514
qtcore	qtgui
the problem is that when i build library b and run ldd on the executable it is being linked to qtcore and qtgui both of which are pulling in lots of unrequired files resulting in an executable that is taking long to load and has unwanted dependencies

2296525
rss	feed
use case is i am getting data from arbitrary sources and making a rss feed for that data

2296525
rss	feed
the data source sometimes have escape sequence character which is breaking my rss feed

2296531
post	get
the http standard defines different semantics for get post operations sec 9.1.1

2296535
wstring	istringstream
i m trying to use istringstream to recreate an encoded wstring from some memory

2296544
haskell	sml	sml	apl
by constructs from apl haskell and sml

2296593
ssl	https
also i am not quite sure but i think that fopen cannot handle ssl https connections

2296616
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note canvas is a new feature and is only supported in recent browser releases latest safari firefox or google-chrome for example

2296648
gif	png
if you have a finite number of line drawings and a limited number of colours you could just pre-generate every possible colour section combination - isolate each area as a transparent gif png and composite them using position absolute to create an onion skin animation cel effect

2296692
pivot-table	crosstab
creating crosstab queries and pivot-table in sql server

2296698
width	height
you can specify some parameters such as width and height in the constructor when calling the base class constructor

2296739
firefox	safari
i ve only tested that with explorer and firefox but i d be happy to help you get it running with safari if you want

2296780
google-chrome	firefox
when i navigate directly to the svg it renders fine in firefox 3.5 3.6 and google-chrome but when i inline it verifying i have the right doctype and xml namespaces both firefox and google-chrome just display a pile of text from within the svg

2296780
google-chrome	firefox
i then attempted to change my content type served up to force it to be application xhtml+xml but when forced into a xhtml valid mode both firefox and google-chrome refuse to give dojo access to everything in the dom that is required for it to work

2296780
google-chrome	firefox
i have also attempted to display the svg stand alone through an tag which seems to work fine in google-chrome but firefox 3.5 3.6 refuses to display the svg in a dijit.contentpane though again navigating directly to the document displays the picture

2296815
subtract	add
implement simple add subtract methods instead

2296916
wxpython	wxformbuilder
i have a wxpython project created with wxformbuilder that contains two panels each of which contain a wxlistctrl

2296952
oql	jhat
you should be able to query all collections or single one with object query language oql in jhat

2296966
union	distinct
i don t know how i can do several union with a distinct

2297018
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu try

2297047
uiview	calayer
the loading... text is a uilabel the rectangle could be an image or could be a uiview with rounded corners via calayer

2297074
width	height
store your window height width and position during the lock event and restore it on an unlock event

2297077
textarea	textbox
is it possible to fade out the text inside a textbox and textarea and leave the actual element in place

2297126
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian ubuntu it s fairly easy to set up an apache environment

2297154
versioning	upgrade
sadly the older versioning of this export is too far removed and unoptimized to be able to upgrade it to work with some of the more modern browsers

2297170
trie	tree
you could store your information in a trie of some sort perhaps a ternary search tree

2297193
getter	setter
also make sure to use immutable objects where appropriate instead of always using some stupid java bean class with all public getter and setter

2297238
profiler	gprof
even if you get gprof to work or a similar profiler you re likely to be disappointed

2297269
google-chrome	firefox
well your code worked for me running google-chrome 5.0.307.9 and firefox 3.5.8 on ubuntu 9.10 though i switched

2297294
children	parent
in other words if you have a class parent with multiple children would parent have an instance of a collection of children or would these be separately requested

2297306
srp	principles
now that the class is huge and that getdescription also sets a description are not a direct violation of the srp but of different principles

2297317
exponent	modulo
there is a rsa modulo n and the two usual rsa exponent d and e such that ed 1 modulo p-1 and q-1 where n pq

2297317
exponent	modulo
this means that trusted web servers will need to compute things with a big modulo and a big exponent and without knowing the modulo factors

2297317
ecdsa	rsa	rsa	dsa
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

2297317
ecdsa	rsa
from the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit key

2297317
ecdsa	rsa
the ecdsa signatures consist in two 192-bit integers 384 bits to encode while the rsa signatures are 1024-bit long

2297419
post	get
i know this post is similar to about 5-6 other post on this site but i have reviewed them and still can t get the syntax correct

2297444
internationalization	localization
what you re looking for is django s internationalization and localization feature

2297483
free	malloc
b pass a malloc -ed memory and free it in animationdidstop

2297489

gridview	linqdatasource
the users of my web app need to filter a long list of items in a gridview accessed via a linqdatasource

2297552
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout 2 1 redirects stderr to the same place as stdout

2297557
post	get
the next or probably first step you should take would be to change your form from get to post as it is in most cases a bad idea to send form data via get

2297563
stdout	stderr
the compiler warnings happen on stderr not stdout which is why you don t see them when you just redirect make somewhere else

2297563
stdout	stderr
the means redirect stdout and stderr to this location

2297569
vim	emacs
familiar with vim ed emacs etc

all you need to do is modify the line cgcontextdrawimage and alter the width and height parameters

2297638
width	height
cgcontextdrawimage context cgrectmake 0 0 width 2 height 2 image.cgimage

2297638
width	height
will draw 1 4 of the image as its height and width are being doubled past the textures size

2297639
folder	directory
if it s really just one folder and you re running on windows you can set up security to prevent everyone from creating folder in that directory

2297659
config	ini
you could switch to a xml ini config file that s stored in the user s application data folder or possibly even the my documents folder

2297676
gif	png
you can load any supported image file type jpg gif png etc using image.fromfile image.fromstream etc

2297825
qsort	bsearch
that sort and compare using the qsort function how do i use bsearch to find subsets of my list

2297833
webkit	gecko
though it would be awkward to ensure cross-browser compatibility given the differences between trident gecko webkit and presto

2297833
width	height
i d recommend using css-sprites for the background colouring of each cell if they re going to be a predictable height width just to conserve some bandwidth

2297833
width	height
to have one div generate the colour for three areas assuming a fixed height width of each div of 100px

2297839
vsto	add-in
so i want to capture some key-commands in our docuement-level excel vsto add-in

2297955
postgresql	mysql
right now postgresql mysql and oracle

2297965
google-chrome	firefox
also since it s javascript it should now also work on firefox google-chrome etc

2297975
vb.net	vb6
works with vb6 and vb.net

2297994
client-side	server-side
another candidate might be javascript or some kind of dsl to javascript bridge as that would allow the strategy to run either client-side or server-side

2297998
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover usually takes two parameters first is mouseenter second is mouseleave try

2298021

you re doing a post so put it in the form

2298056
post	get
post action should return same result for post an get by fallowing code

2298107
hash	salt
i would hash my user id and the salt

2298107
hash	salt
the validating application knows the salt so it hash the same values

2298130
jar	war
rather than have that base class as a class in each war file i want to move it to its own jar that each of the other projects can reference

2298177
superclass	subclassing
superclass receive this message before their subclassing

2298255
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
in place of the comment -- if this was the fault of the caller of your class throw illegalargumentexception or illegalstateexception as appropriate

stdout	stderr
in this case to pipe stderr you d want to do something like this which merges stderr with stdout before piping

2298324
converter	multibinding
i ve seen similar behavior when dealing with multibinding with multiple converter but not on a simple binding

2298329

google-chrome safari ie8 and firefox all support queryselectorall so it seems more appropriate to use that if it s available

2298576
postgresql	mysql
all major databases including sql server mysql and postgresql support this keyword

2298580
switching	screens
my app has 5 different relative layouts that it can switching between by using a set of buttons that is at the bottom of the screens

2298580
textview	imageview
3 of the layouts contain only textview and imageview

2298609
webclient	httpwebrequest
then in your code you would create an httpwebrequest httpwebresponse or webclient and then fetch the url and get the contents

post	get
notice that the form uses the post method not get

2298810
spweb	splist
if your title is full of special characters or something else is demanding you to be able to have a simpler name to grab the list i recommend doing it by the id of the spweb or splist their collections generally accept a guid as parameters and if they don t there s a method for that

2298817
put	get
i have everything set up perfectly when i tell the service to toast when it is started and destroyed but as soon as i put the media play-in in there instead it starts fine and starts playing the music but as soon as a click a button to stop the service i get an error and a force close

2299188
debian	linux
as far as i am concerned i use debian linux for all my parallel stuff

2299250
debian	linux	uptime	reboot
this is happening on a workstation that regularly reaches months of uptime i only reboot it when critical security patches affecting my trimmed down and hardened debian linux are issued which really doesn t happen often and on which applications never crash making it very unlikely that it s an hardware issue on that machine more below

2299250
debian	linux
note that the exact same application on exactly the same hardware with exactly the same jvm but another version of linux i had debian etch previously did not trigger that sigsegv once

2299293
debian	linux
version of linux i had debian etch

2299294
post	get
i don t think it s possible to get the post data but others might have a way

2299300
rowdatabound	onclientclick
in my rowdatabound event i call the javascript function showmodal from button s onclientclick event

2299306
int	double
formatted input for anything but the basic types int double etc. doesn t make a lot of sense and arguably only from them when taken from a non-interactive stream such as an istringstream

2299350
dictionary	map
when the som has stabilized dictionary words near to each other in your metric are near to each other in the topology of the map from which you get the encoding trivially as binary words

2299352
post	get
also consider some security testing of an application - sql injections rights management illegal data access via post get data tampering xss etc

2299358
cassini	iis
we finally figured out that using cassini the built in visual studio iis to host the listenerservice backend was causing the problem

2299369
width	height
i wouldn t recommend programmatically forcing an arbitrary height and width

2299369
width	height
the best thing to do is use the form s onclose event to save the form s height and width and then set the height and width with oncreate

2299370
put	get
so you are going to need to put some thought into which edges of which components get anchored and which don t

2299417
sudoers	passwd
currently the linux boxes are all standalone and use the usual etc passwd authentications etc group groups etc sudoers sudoers and so forth

2299439
switching	screens
the lifecycle of an adroid app under various conditions switching screens freezing stopping etc. is described in an excellent video tutorial by google

2299498
width	height
jim s method works as well just call width and height on the returned size

2299506
firefox	safari
the following font-face declaration works perfectly well on firefox mac but not safari webkit

2299535
free	malloc
however and this is a common case if the memory was allocated by the new operator in c++ or a call to malloc in c then you have to expose a function in unmanaged code through interop which will free the memory appropriately

2299535
free	malloc
in the case of malloc you would create a function that takes a pointer and calls free on that pointer

2299575
vim	emacs
emacs or vim would allow you to do this for most languages

2299619
google-chrome	firefox
this should work tested in firefox and google-chrome

2299643
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this gives you the way to create simple dropdowns that degrade properly work across all major browsers ie opera safari firefox and its very lightweight 12 lines of javascript

2299679
int	double
trying to display a double as an int type d or vice versa can give you strange output

2299766
cvs	svn
if the half team was using cvs and the other half used the other svn say like in a competition to see which will dominate and become the winner thus the last repository standing the question is.

2299781
cvs	svn
well there is a migrator tool for migrating from cvs to svn but i don t think it allows you to merge the projects while importing

2299781
cvs	svn
you could try import the cvs repository as a branch into svn and then merge it with the trunk

2299784
hide	show
once the slideshow starts over the images don t show up yet when it goes to load the following image it plays the tween from the hide previous function which show the image briefly before fading out

2299789
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox but when using google-chrome when the facebook login window opens it starts gradually resizing itself until it becomes a narrow column - when manually resizing the window it gradually reverts back to the narrow column

2299795
opera	firefox
some browsers at least firefox opera and ie support this

2299805
cvs	svn
you can try to use cvs to svn bridge but i strongly recommend to switch to svn

2299808
cvs	svn
besides cvs is deprecated so if you have a choice between the two use svn

2299813
disk	ram
the other interesting metric here is privatedirty which is basically the amount of ram inside the process that can not be paged to disk it is not backed by the same data on disk and is not shared with any other processes

2299813
dumpsys	adb
a common one is the command adb shell dumpsys meminfo which will spit out a bunch of information about the memory use of each java process containing the above info as well as a variety of other things

2299813
dumpsys	adb
you can also tack on the name or pid of a single process to see for example adb shell dumpsys meminfo system give me the system process

2299842
cvs	svn
in order to use both tools you need a replication system so you can have a cvs and svn repository both represent the same source code

2299864
osql	powershell
sql server 2008 provides an osql powershell cmdlet called invoke-sqlcmd that does that same type of thing as osql from powershell

2299945
google-chrome	safari
i m working on a site where these bugs randomly appear in safari and google-chrome

2299962
outputstream	inputstream
if the socket s outputstream has not been flushed the inputstream on the other end of the connection may block waiting for input while the outputstream blocks waiting to fill its buffer

2299968
udp	tcp
tcp and udp handle that queue differently though

2300007
rpyc	pyro
i ve googled such things as pyro twisted.spread rpyc

2300012
oncreate	setcontentview
i m guessing you would need to save the user s preference then have them close and restart your app as i believe the only time you can call setcontentview is in oncreate

2300012
oncreate	setcontentview
you could read the layout preference as the first thing you do in oncreate just before you call setcontentview

2300029
junit	servicetestcase
since i m new to junit i can t figure out how to use the servicetestcase class

2300104
put	get
i thought it was best to put it in the application.js but because the partial gets added via ajax the validate method called within document .ready block does not get triggered because the form does not exist when the original document is ready

2300115
jruby	rubinius
nb that jruby macruby and rubinius have more advanced gc s

2300131

post	get
my reference is the table displayed in netbeans the http monitor were i can see the parameters and attributes associated with every get or post ordered in request session context tab

2300233
accessor	properties
the second dot is the properties accessor it will try only to get the z properties which is undefined because it doesn t exist on the number.prototype object

2300233
accessor	properties
is equivalent to access a properties with the bracket notation properties accessor

2300250
post	get
the concept here is the check occurs on the get request such that on the post to save django will already have determined if this is a new or existing record

2300312
tabcontrol	tabitem
you ve bound itemsource to items so the tabcontrol will create a tabitem for each item

unicode	ucs
thank you remus rusanu for pointing out that the multi-byte strings are not directly compatible with unicode ucs sets

2300372
folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog
.net winforms has openfiledialog for files and folderbrowserdialog for folders

2300374
hide	show
due to the large amount of data some javascript interface should be used to show page in steps forms could be loaded at one page but js would serve to display and hide respective sections fieldsets

2300382
int	double
it looks like your f is only grabbing four bytes of a double and then the next four bytes are treated as an int the real int value is then ignored

2300417
put	get
put a build.bat in the same folder as the solution set up any iis configuration necessary show them the url and where the css files are let them get on with it

2300436

the representation of closures or whether first-class-functions are handled by some other technique such as lambda lifting or defunctionalization is largely orthogonal to the handling of known vs unknown calls

2300605
free	malloc
every malloc call should eventually have a matching free call

2300641
move	drag
you could use that as a basis for your control and add the drag and drop capabilities using the uiresponder methods touchesbegan move ended

2300743
rss	feed
i want to serve an rss feed for each

setuptools	yolk
yolk is a python command-line tool and library for obtaining information about packages installed by setuptools easy_install and distutils python 2.5 and for querying pypi python package index a.k.a

2300908
width	height
check your css for overriding styles for width and height such as

2300908
width	height
you have an overriding height width set for a parent element somewhere

2300908
width	height
parent element css can override image width and height set in html but not if it is set this way

2300926
comparator	icomparer
in modern c# 3.0 and higher i think you can pass a method name to sort rather than explicitly creating an comparator or icomparer

2300934
free	malloc
it is a function you can set a breakpoint on to debug a malloc free bug in your program

2300961
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream is build for that see example here

2301028
x86	64bit
even though the x86 registers on a modern intel or amd processor are 64bit wide

2301044
post	get
remember to use get if it will only fetch the data and use post if the request will change something add edit delete login etc

2301045
spaces	delimiter
if you really want to get the first n words and you define words as delimiter by spaces you could still do it in the query as follows

2301056
spaces	delimiter
in particular this will return up to six words where we define a word as a set of characters that are not spaces delimiter by spaces

2301056
punctuation	words
note this will return punctuation attached to the last words which may or may not be desired

2301088
int	double
i have a case where i should get the elements from an array and i do not know if the type is double or int

2301089
mouse	keyboard
for some reason the mouse events especially movement are not passed correctly through the window when wm_paint is in progress and so it appears as though the mouse and the keyboard for that matter lag

2301089
mouse	keyboard
the fps is fine this is some api problem i suspect that for some reason the keyboard mouse messages are not handled as they should while the wm_paint is in progress because the slower the timer is set to the less jerking there is

2301102
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
you likely used an hdl vhdl or verilog to implement your design

2301114
mouse	keyboard
i believe with the main message pump the mouse and keyboard messages are queued up and waiting for you to finish the prior wm_paint message

2301114
mouse	keyboard
maybe look at using directinput for mouse and keyboard input if this is an issue

2301134
oncreate	ondestroy
you are trying to call stop on a member mediaplayer object player in your ondestroy but in your oncreate you create a mediaplayer object player with your line of code

i hope that explains the general difference between the two types of crypto systems such as rsa and aes

2301218
invokelater	invokeandwait
and you may choose to issue a separate invokeandwait or possibly use invokelater for each block update

2301231
awt	swing
swing does not support multithreading so whenever you need to interact with it you need to do in from the awt event thread

2301266
msg	eml
granted the majority of the eml files i see are adherent to the msg format described in 5322 or 2322 or 822 however good ms stuck to the standards i don t know

2301361
uninstall	upgrade
i ve just gone through some pain with iphone and xcode upgrade and keychain failures etc and decided to uninstall xcode completely and re-install

2301450
width	height
â use the entire width and height of

2301468
hide	show
i would also like it if a user clicks on a link the uinavigationbar show a back button but if on the home page hide the back button

2301505
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to create pop-up using the jqueryui dialog

2301514
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
currently i m using taglib sharp as suggested in one of the posts stackoverflow for reading id3-tag out of mp3 flac ogg and similar multimedia files

2301524
google-chrome	firefox
please note that in firefox is working fine but in ie or google-chrome it is downloading the swf...if i comment response.redict ... the user remains on this page so the click button is working well only the redirect seems to be the problem

2301530
serializable	deserialization
in your case i would concentrate on the rpc asynchronous way and how will you transport data to the front end serializable deserialization

2301531
post	get
i ve read a few post here on stackoverflow about task scheduling but i m not sure that i get it right

2301544
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
while everything works fine in firefox ie8 opera google-chrome i m having problem with ie7 wrapping words inside block elements

2301553
implements	extends
i wonder if this is because the nexus indexer doesn t index a legacy repository in which case you can maybe implements or extends the indexer or if it s just a limitation

2301602
getter	setter
alternatively you could create a wrapper object called softwaremonkeycontext that has the specific setter getter methods as above and internally uses your genutil.uncheckedcast method

2301653
put	get
they ll then get the appropriate support put in place so that can happen

2301684
udp	tcp
the main difference between tcp and udp is as stated before that udp is connectionless

2301724
allocator	stl
you could try to create a memory mapped file and then create the stl map structure with a customer allocator

2301736
opera	safari
update opera mini and safari mobile definitely support it

2301737
pop-up	dialog
what i d like to do is use the same method that function uses for checking for errors on the fly and then if there s an error that would cause the dialog to pop-up simply pop-up a one-time notification and skip the calls on each file

2301782
x86	64bit
if the main assembly is set to x86 it will run as a 32-bit process on both a 32-bit and 64bit operating system and any attempts at loading assemblies flagged as x64 will fail

2301782
x86	64bit
likewise if the main assembly is set to x64 it will only run on 64bit operating system and any attempt at loading an assembly set to x86 will fail

2301782
x86	64bit
a msil main executable assembly will run as 32-bit on a 32-bit operating system like if it was set to x86 with the above failure point and as 64bit on a 64bit operating system like if it was set to x64 with the above failure point.

2301797
post	get
if you don t want to see the parameters in the query string use the post request instead get request

2301803
onclick	onchange
you should put an onchange event handler on the instead of many onclick event handlers on the s

2301846
cakephp	lithium
while refreshing myself on cakephp i learned that there is a new framework called lithium that is essentially what cakephp 3 was going to be

2301846
cakephp	lithium
i m trying to decide whether to use cakephp for my upcoming php project or to wait a bit for lithium to release a non-development version and try that out

2301851
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the code in google-chrome and firefox and the result is the same

2301874
superclass	subclassing
and whenever you want to instantiate the subclassing from within the superclass

2301879
crossover	mutation
if the children produced via crossover mutation is an inverse ignore it and generate another child till it is a good child

2301959
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
i don t think there are any libraries that will let you compress mp3s i presume you re talking about generating an mp3 from a wav aiff etc

2301976
min	max
if you think you are going to have a large number of requests why not just setup a pool with a min pool size set to say 25 arbitrary number here do not shoot and max pool size set to say 200

2301994
packets	pcap
then you ll have to parse the http in the captured packets and correlate http requests with its response and take the time difference which you ll get from the timestamps from pcap

2302020
x86	64bit
first off setting platform target to x86 on your .exe project is a very useful when you are debugging your project on a 64bit version of windows

2302052
hide	show
the first step is to show the from that you will need to hide

2302065
google-chrome	firefox
however i discovered that while google-chrome and so presumably webkit allows you to select text within a readonly part of the contenteditable element firefox only allows you to treat the contenteditable as one big block and select it all at once

2302069
puts	gets
this is because the dc which contains the text gets processed with alphablend which also eventually puts it to the window s dc

2302076
uiview	subviews
i have a uitableviewcontroller subclass that has a container uiview which has 1 of 2 subviews the tableview or a uiscroll depending on whether or not the view is flipped

2302129
rss	feed
so i am grabbing rss feed via ajax

2302130
jobs	cron
works only if you have access to the server of course or can set up cron jobs with more liberal permissions than the php user

2302214
accessor	properties	width	height
yes this is standard it s because you re asking for the width and height in the constructor at which point the properties accessor settings are not established

2302240
simulink	labview
i m interested in creating a visual programming language which can aid non-programmers like children to write simple programs much like labview or simulink allows engineers to connect functional blocks together without the knowledge of how they are internally built

2302260
vmware	virtualbox
i found that ubuntu 3d graphics work out of the box in virtualbox 3 where vmware 7 doesn t support out of the box at least

2302260
virtualbox	esx	vmware	esx	vmware	virtualbox
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc

2302260
vmware	virtualbox
also there are tons of features in vmware such as ace to lockdown virtual machines that just don t exist in virtualbox

2302262
mongodb	bson
with couchdb this means the use of json and with mongodb this means the use of bson

2302262
imperative	declarative
typcially querying follows an imperative mode of programming rather than the declarative style of sql

2302262
serializable	deserialization
just keep an eye-out for the serializable deserialization scenarios

2302284
config	ini
imagine a strategy whereby you might want parsers for several formats of config file say ini xml and yaml for example

2302434
width	height
the new window can be forced by setting the width and height of the new window but you must be aware that popup blockers can prevent this action

2302443
children	parent
the parent class is usercriteria which has a list of criteria as children

2302462
scrummaster	sprint
the scrummaster s role is to help and support the team not to question the team s way of working during a sprint

2302462
scrummaster	sprint
being dogmatic about your personal idea about how a sprint should look like internally is not something i would want a scrummaster to act like

2302462
scrummaster	sprint
it s their sprint after all and while i think it s perfectly fair for the scrummaster to mention concerns about the way the sprint is going he shouldn t force his idea of the best way to work on the team

2302493
haskell	ocaml
the program works fine and fast in haskell even when using foldl and not foldl but stack overflows in ocaml and f#

2302504
jsf	seam
struts2 and jsf with seam are a nice choices but i can t decide which s better

2302519
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
it overrides touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled

2302519
touchesmoved	touchesended
there is another animation in the touchesended method that works just fine so i know that the animation part of things is working just not in touchesmoved

2302520
apache	nginx
at least for apache and nginx there is a module enabling you to use the x-sendfile http header

2302523
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2302652
rss	feed
i am trying to write a simple google app engine website that reads an external rss feed

2302683
serializable	deserialization
also if you re planning to do some serializable deserialization on your data and would like to do it really fast check out google s protocol buffers python tooling available

2302684
mockito	jmock	jmock	powermockito
another option would be to use powermockito an extension to mockito or jmock which allows to mock stuff normally not mockable like static final private or constructor methods

2302739
portrait	landscape
as you see the code is running in reverse i mean the part the should run when i change the device to portrait the landscape part of the code runs and vice-versa

2302752
jdom	xerces
it seems that the workaround is to include a copy of the xerces jar in your application so that jdom doesn t try to load it from gae itself

2302808
put	get
from there it s easy to get the actual values of an instance s properties but you have to check to see if they are primitive types or objects so i was too lazy to put it in

2302808
inherited	properties
you could also choose to scan the inherited chain to get all the properties defined on an object

2302849
post	get
this all works just fine but i have this same code all over the controller for the get actionresult then the same thing in the post actionresult

2302880
put	get
short of moving up the inheritance chain and put the source code of those parent classes all in my project or writing the widget all from scratch without using the existing framework widgets that already solved the problem i can t find a way to get a vertical scrolling gallery

2302891
getter	setter
let mfoo be an instance variable that s a property that has been synthesized hence it has default setter and getter

2302925
accessor	properties
if you re accessing the properties from another class you should always use the accessor method or dot notation

2303017
uiview	subviews
if the uiview is not a subviews of the uitableview it will not pass it touches up the responder chain to the uitableview

2303017
uiview	subviews
to test this i suggest putting your uiview over make it a subviews of an ordinary view and get the responder chain to work like you wish

2303032
wav	ogg
firefox ogg wav

2303032
mp3	wav
safari mp3 wav

2303032
mp3	ogg
chrome ogg mp3

2303032
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i basically need to encode in wav and ogg mp3

2303046
udp	tcp
for example various network services can be configured in etc services and a program like inetd listens on all of the tcp and udp sockets for incoming connections and datagrams

2303046
stdout	stderr
when a connection dg arrives it forks redirects stdin stdout and stderr to the socket using the dup2 system call and then execs the server process

2303046
udp	tcp
you ask why are tcp servers are typically concurrent while udp servers are typically iterative

2303090
put	get
one potential issue of overriding get_value_for_datastore that i think of is it might not get called before the object was put into datastore

2303093
ppl	tbb
this would bring it closer to more common c++ libraries tbb openmp ms ppl and tpl

2303117
public	protected
similarly the core android team had to make a decision as part of creating the initial sdk of how best to take the existing code and create public stuff we can work with and protected private stuff we cannot with sdk fidelity in mind

2303122
cgpoint	cgrect
strictly speaking nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect nscolor uicolor and nsimage uiimage structs objects are all implementation ui elements that have nothing to do with the data model

2303122
cgpoint	cgrect
it should store all the nspoints cgpoint nsrect cgrect as strings or numbers

2303142
implements	extends
to the point just create a class which extends httpservlet implements the dopost method define the servlet in web.xml and let the action attribute of the html element point to an url which is covered by the url-pattern of the servlet mapping in the web.xml

2303147
opera	firefox
i have a greasemonkey script that works just fine in firefox and opera

2303147
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this allows me to have the same code for firefox and opera and google-chrome i thought

2303147
google-chrome	firefox
resolution i followed max s. advice and it works in both firefox and google-chrome now

2303149
free	malloc
note that when your program exit s all the memory you allocated with malloc is free

2303151
free	malloc
yes you can do that unless you write your own defintion of malloc and free

2303151
free	malloc
note both your custom methods will be calling malloc and free internally

2303181
subtract	add
when you add or subtract characters on a string it doesn t change the string it produces a new string that is the new result

2303181
subtract	add
when you add or subtract numbers from an integer it doesn t change the integer it produces a new integer that is the new result

2303181
subtract	add
and when you add or subtract a delegate from a delegate it doesn t change either delegate

2303238
svm	naivebayes
although not a specialized text mining framework weka has a number of classifiers usually employed in text mining tasks such as svm knn multinomial naivebayes among others

2303295
min	max
if i group the data by category i can aggregate sum count min max etc. based on any of the other columns

2303309
getter	setter
also when i place breakpoints in the getter and setter of the attached property they are never reached

2303309
getter	setter
the breakpoint in the getter and setter was also never reached yet throwing an exception in them did cause the application to terminate so i am thinking it s a framework eccentricity

2303310
postgresql	mysql
if you re just looking for a free sql database there are many sqlite as valentin suggested postgresql mysql firebird etc

2303331
maven-plugin	pom.xml
i ve created a maven-plugin my-code-generator which is used as described in the pom.xml excerpt below

2303375
haskell	ocaml
non-exhaustive pattern machings are idiomatic in haskell but extremely bad style in f# and ocaml standard ml etc.

2303395
mp3	ogg
you could then use ogg mp3 for the others and maybe get away with some simple flash for ie opera

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
using the jquery mouse events for mouseenter mouseleave or hover all work swimmingly on all mac or windows browsers except for ie8 windows

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am using mouseenter and mouseleave to test for hot rectangles absolutely positioned and dimensioned divs that have no content over an image used as hotspots to make visible the navigation buttons when different regions of the main enclosing rectangle image are touched by the cursor

2303420
mouseleave	mouseenter
windows ie jquery never sends notifications mouseenter our mouseleave as the cursor enters or exits one of the target div s

2303424
maven	m2e
i ve managing maven through eclipse with the m2e plugin

2303425
accessor	properties
when i write a properties i use _get_foo and _set_foo for the accessor and _foo for the attribute itself

2303437
getter	setter
getter and setter java like

2303446
accessor	properties
for instance if one uses the design pattern for a singleton often times accessor or properties are used and if the class is not initialized it is done from the accessor since the constructor is private

2303454
google-chrome	firefox
the header image appears correctly onlayed on top of the background color on firefox google-chrome and newer versions of ie

2303469
width	height
i miss defining a viewport with glviewport 0 0 width height

2303470
many-to-one	one-to-many
many-to-one one-to-many or one-to-one

2303516
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	aix	unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
for a project at university i need to extend an existing c application which shall in the end run on a wide variety of commercial and non-commercial unix systems freebsd solaris aix etc.

2303576
dependency-resolution	packaging
by packaging them as another artifact declaring them as a dependency and calling the dependency-resolution api which is a lot more work

2303577
int	chars
if you need to detect it at runtime one method is to use a union of an int and a chars then set the chars to 1 and see what value the int has

2303585
for-loop	loops
mark byers below there is a simpler version of the code above and it has three if statement two before the else one inside a for each loops and another inside the for-loop i want the one at the foreach loops to pair up with the else statement

2303635
public	protected
because the signature includes internal types the method can t be public or protected

2303648
width	height
you can optionally set a width of the lightbox to restrict the width and let the height be automatic

2303668
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewdidappear and viewwillappear of vc3 is not fired either

2303672
int	chars
don t assume the current platform uses ebcdic chars and packed decimal int

2303690
width	height
image with image-rendering optimizequality set and scaled with width height

2303698
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the documentation states that viewwillappear and viewdidappear should be called on vc3 so i don t know why they are not

2303740
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind using both memcheck and exp-ptrcheck

2303744
opennlp	lingpipe
opennlp and lingpipe as posted by the other posters are also pretty decent

2303758
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
funnily enough i thought usual linux tools like nano gedit vim and whatnot would have capabilities for ansi color codes in a text file but it s very modest out there with info on ansi color in text files in these editors

2303784
setinterval	settimeout
there are setinterval settimeout methods but they are the same timers

2303788
getter	setter
you could protect the dumb class es further by creating an interface that does not expose the getter setter functions

2303802
put	get
this makes it easy to add new files to your project - you simply put them on disk and they will get compiled automatically

2303811
wav	ogg
i will settle for ogg or wav it s just for a little 2d game so it doesn t have to be super hi-fi quality just something the players can hear

2303822
button	checkbox
check out this jquery checkbox radio button plugin i think it does what you re looking for

2303933
google-chrome	firefox
incidentally ie handles this scenario more gracefully than either google-chrome or firefox

2303938
int	chars
one form i ve used is an array of int as big as the original string storing n chars deleted here values but there are a host of other possibilities

2303955
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari it works as it should

2303962
google-chrome	safari
same thing happens in safari and google-chrome

2303985
prepare	execute
and the statement + bound variables are execute on the mysql server -- without it re-doing the preparation each time the statement is execute which is why prepare statements can be good for performance when the same statement is execute several times

2304020
haskell	scheme
in any functional language like clean haskell ml or scheme this kind of thing is very easy

2304020
free	malloc
in a language with explicit memory allocation new or even worse malloc and free such a solution would be very tedious

2304074
opennlp	maxent
i built a maximum entropy named entity recognizer for conll data using opennlp maxent for a course once

2304086
switching	screens
now if i press the home button and then switching to the home screens the activity will unbind from the service when i go back to the activity from the task manager then oncreate will not be called and if the code is trying to access a function from the service i will get a nullpointerexception

2304086
onresume	onpause
if i bind and unbind only in onresume and onpause i don t have this problem

2304092
prepare	execute
for prepare statements that are execute with the mysql_stmt_prepare and mysql_stmt_execute c api functions the server writes prepare and execute lines to the general query log so that you can tell when statements are prepare and execute

2304103
hash	md5
you can use md5 file_get_contents to download the file and calculate the md5 hash if your php installation is configured to open remote streams

2304113
unicode	ucs
unicode is always stored in some kind of unicode transformation format utf well or ucs but i never saw that used somewhere

2304152
apache	nginx
nginx doesn t support chunked requests so i m tryping to proxy my put request to apache but it seems nginx blocks and sends 411 error even when proxying

2304156
firefox	safari
silverlight is supported on windows and mac os x in ie firefox and safari

2304185
client-side	server-side
silverlight is a client-side framework comparable perhaps only to adobe s flash while asp.net is a server-side framework

2304195
width	height
the height and width of an image object are fixed at the time the image object is constructed

2304210
onresume	onpause
in most cases you will want to register in onresume and unregister in onpause

2304210
oncreate	ondestroy
if you use oncreate and on ondestroy you will still be registering for updates when you are paused which is being a bad citizen

2304231
implements	sealed	implements	extends
extension methods imply that you are extends the sealed class with new functionality and not overriding the ones already implements

2304237
post	get
however in order to correctly implement prg as i understand it i would have to validate on postback determine there is an error then redirect the user to the same page but via get not post which would then eliminate any kind of scary message you are about to resubmit the contents of a form to the server which can have unintended consequences... etc if the user reloaded the page

2304271
post	get
it takes a string that contains the html document sent by the http server after a post request but fails to parse it properly - i only get like four nodes from the entire document

2304271
post	get
then everything works just fine - i get a proper dom tree but i need to somehow retrieve the post answer from server

2304320
post	get
so now onclick name should be passed as post variable instead of get

2304341
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
with that in mind in most object-oriented programming languages i m thinking objective-c but i know the same is true for java and others the parent class is called the superclass and any class which inherited from the super is called a subclassing

2304341
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
a subclassing inherited things like all instance variables and methods from its superclass thus it contains everything from the parent plus whatever is added in the subclassing

2304345
superclass	subclassing
the set of possible members of a superclass is a superset of the set of possible members of a subclassing of that superclass

2304349
move	drag
i am trying to set up a container that the user can drag items into and then move the items around within the container

2304349
draggable	droppable
i incorporated the answer from when i make a draggable clone and drop it in a droppable i cannot drag it again which works with one problem

2304369
hide	show
when the user leaves the real password field the script will see if it s empty and if so will hide the real field and show the fake one

2304381
superclass	subclassing
the properties and methods defined by a subclassing may extend beyond those provided by its superclass and in fact they often do but instances of the subclassing are still members of the set of instances of the superclass

2304381
superclass	subclassing
so in oop terms people would be a superclass and programmer would be a subclassing

2304381
superclass	subclassing
hence superclass and subclassing

2304402
jstl	taglib
it is to be used to as a template to write html css js in wherein you can dynamically control the flow with help of taglib like jstl and access backend data using el

2304402
implements	extends
just create a class which extends httpservlet implements the doget method accordingly with the espider stuff and finally forward to a jsp page to display the result register the servlet in web.xml and call it by url which covers its url-pattern in web.xml

2304407
integer	unsigned
it defines types like uint32_t an unsigned 32-bit integer

2304411
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing has all the members of its superclass and more

2304411
superclass	subclassing
if a class declaration is considered as a specification then the superclass specification is satisifed by more objects and the subclassing specification is satisfied by fewer objects

2304466
width	height
rather than send a width and height i would like to calculate the dimensions on the fly

2304466
width	height
that should work just great except the webbrowser control refuses to render therefore i can t get the client width and height

2304477
sendkeys	findwindow
i cheated a bit on the findwindow api call because i knew the window s title was and was somehow able to bring it to the foreground and using the inputsimulator to send the keystrokes to it...or use the traditional plain old sendkeys function...the reason i had the thread.sleep is to ensure that the keystrokes are sent in order to be pushed into the keyboard queue of the active foreground window which despite that is hidden

2304488
google-chrome	safari
if i point by browser google-chrome or safari on osx to this web site it shows all the svg perfectly

2304530
rss	feed
btw something that i will probably change is i will skip querying certain folders to speed it up a bit journal deleted items junk e-mail drafts rss feed microsoft at home tasks notes contacts calendar sent items outbox

2304553
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
getelementsbyclassname is supported by google-chrome firefox 3+ as well as recent versions of opera and safari

2304580
comparator	comparable
the java documentation for comparable recommends that comparator be consistent with equals because of the behavior in sorted sets or sorted maps

2304580
comparator	comparable
i will implement the comparable interface and the comparator function to achieve this

2304580
comparator	comparable
i m going with implementing the comparator instead of comparable

2304583
min	max
in that control each column can be given a max min width

2304593
comparator	comparable
comparator has the advantage in that you can implement any number of them for different types of sorts rather than the single comparable

2304607
fadein	fadeout
because stop does not work with fadein and fadeout there is a funkyness with the arrows sticking around if you move the mouse pointer fast

2304607
fadein	fadeout
as i said there is still a fix -- get rid of fadein and fadeout and use animate so you can call stop

2304613
equals	compareto
it is not a good practice to implement equals and compareto that are inconsistent

2304628
equals	compareto
the requirement here is that 2 objects that are equals should also return 0 for compareto meaning that they occupy the same rank for sorting purposes

2304649
post	get
we use nsurlconnection to http post to and http get the data from a private web site

2304674
post	get
i have debug the through the whole code and the print_r of get and post has values through the whole code

2304678
width	height
if the picture is horizontal the new size will be width width height proportional to width

2304678
width	height
and if the picture is vertical the new size will be height width width proportional to height

2304732
integer	unsigned
i can specify an integer literal of type unsigned long as follows

2304747
fadein	fadeout
you can control the fadein and fadeout methods much more reliably

2304749
put	get
as such when i call for my function i get the following result this is only for breakfast since that s all i ve put in

2304756
integer	unsigned
integer constants are either int or long signed or unsigned and in c99 long long

2304767
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
don t use viewdidload use viewwillappear or viewdidappear depending on which looks better for you

2304774
children	parent
and then in each of these method you would create a new object and just copy the values yourself and control how you want to handle children or parent objects correctly

2304794
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy
i would generally recommend doing this in either oncreate ondestroy or onstart onstop depending on the semantics that you want

2304794
oncreate	ondestroy
if your activity wants to be interacting with the service the entire time it is running for example maybe it can retrieve some data from a network for you and will return the data when ready and you want to allow this to happen while in the background so if the user returns you will have the data ready then oncreate ondestroy is probably appropriate

2304794
onresume	onpause
i generally wouldn t recommend doing bind unbind in onresume and onpause

2304794
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
also these pairs oncreate ondestroy onstart onstop onpause onresume are intended to be the proper pairs for acquiring and then releasing resources such as binding to service s registering receivers etc to ensure that they are correctly acquired prior to being needed and released and not leaked when no longer needed

2304797
inherited	properties
here s what i am currently using to automatically print class variables in a library for eventual public release - it works by dumping all properties from the instance class all the way back up the inherited tree

2304843
hide	show
if i knew this i would know when to show the div and when to hide it

2304907
rss	feed
easy to see the errors via a readout rss feed etc

2304981
for-loop	loops
the last time through the while loops when only the initialization of the for-loop is executed so that when the while loops exits

2305035
mp3	wav
i encoded the problematic audio file to mp3 format from a wav file using lame on ubuntu

2305073
hide	show
dotfuscator hide your code and .net reflector show an error when you attempt to decompile it

2305078
portrait	landscape
i am trying to code for calling landscape screen from portrait screen

2305116
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

2305134
invokerequired	begininvoke
following msdn article there are four methods on a control that are thread safe to call invoke begininvoke endinvoke and creategraphics and invokerequired property

2305202
spaces	delimiter
is there some way i can set the file file.txt .foreach method to use a spaces instead of newlines as a delimiter

2305218
post	get
i am almost at it but there is one last step i need to get it working sending an httprequest with the correct post data to a php page

2305260
pull	push
the latest changeset that is placed in a repository from a commit a pull or a push is called the tip

2305292
ienumerable	iqueryable
i believe you are confusing an iqueryable with an ienumerable

2305292
ienumerable	iqueryable
yes it s true that iqueryable can be treated as an ienumerable but they are not exactly the same thing

2305292
ienumerable	iqueryable
an iqueryable queries each time it s used while an ienumerable has no such implied reuse

2305299
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i m using bass to extract samples from mp3 wav ogg etc files and add dsp effects like echo flanger etc

2305331
ant	maven
there are only really two choices ant or maven

2305332
ant	maven
and i find it less light because ant scripts grow ugly and unpredictable and become hard to manage while maven scripts stay simple because of the rich functionality provided with the tool

2305337
pop-up	dialog
the user would click on the control a file selection dialog would pop-up the user would select the file and then the upload process would initiate placing the photo somewhere on the page

2305345
ubuntu	linux
for this i recommend g++ on an linux distribution such as ubuntu

2305350
ant	maven
as said elsewhere your real choice is between maven or ant

2305350
ant	maven
to echo other sentiments i find there is more configuration to do with ant so i prefer maven

2305354
min	max
once you zoom out a bit the max value is always a positive integer and the min value is always a negative integer

2305354
min	max
so you need a function that scans the waveform data in chunks and keeps track of the accumulated max and min for that chunk

2305354
min	max
this is slow process so professional audio editors keep a pre-calculated table of min and max values at some fixed zoom ratio

2305354
min	max
its worthwhile to write code that handles all of the channels of the file in an single pass when doing this scanning slowness here will make your whole program feel sluggish it s the disk io that matters here the cpu has no trouble keeping up so straightforward c++ code is fine for building the min max tables but you don t want to go through the file more than once and you want to do it sequentially

2305354
min	max
once you have the min max tables keep them around

2305354
min	max
you want to go back to the disk as little as possible and many of the reasons for wanting to repaint your window will not require you to rescan your min max tables

2305354
min	max
then you draw the waveform by drawing a series of 1 pixel wide vertical lines between the max value and the min value for the time represented by that pixel

2305354
min	max
this should be quite fast if you are drawing from pre built min max tables

2305435
post	get
before passing the get post parameter to a type-specific filter with filter_var i do the following

2305548
width	height
i m trying to get a canvas element to take up the entirety of the document height and window width so that when i resize the window the canvas element stretches with it in effect giving me a full screen canvas

2305597
xfce	gnome
if you prefer gnome or xfce gtk qt can also use your gtk theme

2305597
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
a qt application can be perfectly integrated in windows xp vista 7 macos kde gnome and xfce desktops

2305632
post	get
do not use limit m n use limit n the way to achieve this is quite clever if for instance you have the post sorted by primary key desc then you can get the next page by adding a primary key less than the last element of your current page

2305672
jar	.war
so i want to include 2 jar files in my java web application .war file - to be loaded on glassfish version 2.1

2305678
quicksort	mergesort
resorting within the tree is mostly a matter of choosing an algorithm that gives good performance when operating on a linked list of blocks the leaf nodes minimising the need to use leaf nodes - variants of quicksort or mergesort seem like likely candidates

2305679
mouseleave	mouseenter
the above code is my current solution and its working hover doesn t seem to work because live is required again to remove the bold class thus i am using mouseenter and mouseleave

2305712
integer	unsigned
you should also be aware that assuming unsigned long long is a 64-bit integer type this code won t work correctly for n larger than if x or xx is greater than or equal to then will wrap modulo giving you the wrong value for

2305767
boost	stl
please tell maybe there s something in stl or boost for this

2305769
bazaar	git
generally from what i ve seen this suggests that a dvcs mercurial git bazaar et al might be the most appropriate solution - with the review step being the push to your central repository this resolves the conflict between commit often and review before commit

2305843
jar	manifest.mf
when you re ready to create your executable jar make sure you create a meta-inf manifest.mf file that points to your main class and adds these jars to its classpath

2305850
boost	stl
i don t think there s anything in the stl or boost that does this

2305899
free	malloc
i m trying to free up the memory i ve allocated with malloc but the free command doesn t seem to do its job properly according to eclipse s debugger

2305924
inherited	properties
my model has just one properties but inherited from an abstract base class

2305927
firefox	safari
firefox and safari use the fragment in the location header

2305927
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
thus we seem to have consistent behavior for safari ie firefox google-chrome just tested in that the fragment from the location header gets used no matter what the original uri was

2305931
free	malloc
when you malloc some memory all it does is searching for some free space in memory and keeping track it is now used

2305946
boost	allocator
boost s reference mentions that this allows a factory to change the allocator scheme without the change affecting the user of the factory

2306005
ubuntu	linux
i am building on linux ubuntu 9.10 with gcc 4.4.1

2306009
set	bag
if it s something that s not a part of a persistent object then you can either just read the post values each time and set the viewstate again probably the best practice or if you need to persist that value across a redirect then use the tempdata bag which works much like session

2306019
system.in	system.out
even if you could drill down to the fd inside the stream objects associated with system.in or system.out i don t think that the java class libraries provide an api for turning the fd into a socket object

2306070
postgresql	mysql
personally i d stick to mysql but i never got on with postgresql

2306114
portrait	landscape
but if you want start your application in the portrait mode and then go to the landscape mode you can add a static boolean to know if you must stay in the landspace mode or not

2306130
rss	feed
i m looking for a php solution to easily traverse readonly xml files rss feed from websites

2306144

firefox or google-chrome

2306190
swt	swing
where i m not so sure is if i should use swt or swing

2306212
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
for example in my .h i define a class to conform to the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource protocols

2306223
swt	swing
for your requirements it sounds like the bottom line will be to use swing since it is slightly easier to get started with and not as tightly integrated to the native platform as swt

2306239
swt	swing	awt	swing
i don t know swt too well to brag about it unlike swing and awt but here s the comparison done on swt swing awt

2306249
post	get
i m trying to get to the code that process a post so that i can copy it for my site and make some minor changes to how it s displayed on my site

2306275
awt	swing
heavy components native awt hide swing components not a problem most of the time as as use of heavy components is rather rare

2306275
awt	swing
supported by eclipse gui editor vep vep also supports swing and awt

2306275
swt	swing	awt	swing
has an integrated awt swt bridge to allow use of awt and swing components

2306282
ubuntu	linux
if you want to write graphical applications which work on linux similar to those in a default ubuntu install take a look at gtk

2306294
sudo	passwd
one problem is that sudo can prompt for a passwd

2306294
sudoers	passwd
either remove apache user s passwd but then don t run sshd telnetd ftpd etc... or see if your etc sudoers has a passwordless configuration

2306294
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
man sudoers about line 200 and again about line 270 says tag_spec can include nopasswd to specify that the user does not have to re-authenticate with their passwd to run a sudo command

2306330
junit	jsunit
xunit error - couldn t split junit testsuites for the file tests jsunit logs jstest-1266764410175-0.xml into junit files with one testsuite

2306404
multiplying	add
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

2306435
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are recommended

2306436
jlist	jtable
for this kind of thing you d normally use a jlist or jtable if you need custom rendering

2306457
sorting	filtering
this allows the outer select to filtering on row numbers after sorting and filtering

2306470
rss	feed
i m look at a way of turning an itunes podcast id into the rss feed that the podcast producer serves

2306470
rss	feed
i m aware of the rss generator which can be used to generate a feed of links to podcasts but these links are to html pages

2306481
tcplistener	tcpclient
tcplistener and tcpclient classes

2306499
swt	swing
the miglayout for both swing and swt and jgoodies forms tools are two of the best in my opinion

2306506
int	chars
int parsedata unsigned chars packet int len

2306506
int	chars
printdata chars mesg unsigned chars p int len

2306515
put	get
for a perfectionist person he she would start to learn as much as possible about language x so probably would run put of time and ot get it done

2306528
debian	linux
os debian linux 2.6.26-2-686 filesystem ext3

2306539
rss	feed
it different - reading books following some rss feed from the pros in the area watching attending conferences usergroups etc .

2306616
free	malloc
there is a common sense way of doing this in the lines of c for every pair of malloc there is a free if there isn t there s a leak likewise the same for the globalalloc virtualalloc heapalloc localalloc virtualallocex ...there s an associated ...free pair with them for example running a heapalloc on variable foo for example and there is no heapfree for foo that is a leak.

2306745
getter	setter
by mistake maybe because they were typing to fast and just wanted to get the getter and setter out of the way

2306752
width	height
set the width height in inches

2306769
jsf	seam
there is a good choice of jsf seam books

2306788
getter	setter
also an average ide can autogenerate all getter setter in a few keystrokes clicks

2306788
getter	setter
in eclipse for example do alt + shift + r and then s and then select the properties you d like to generate getter setter for and click ok

2306801
bazaar	git
if you don t work in a team and you have all your files local you could use a distributed version control tool like git mercurial or bazaar

2306802
free	malloc
in particular since there are malloc calls we have to be able to handle a failure in any of those calls and free all the memory we allocated so far

2306820
equals	gethashcode
because the equals and gethashcode

2306820
equals	gethashcode
in terms of the equals and gethashcode

2306833
filesystems	fat
this follows the conventions established by the 8.3 naming restriction in the fat filesystems but there is no technical reason for a three character limit on modern filesystems

2306875
required	placeholder
edit that s right missed new but another error was that i should have used render instead of decorate because decorate required all dom elements in place and i don t have placeholder for the buttons defined while render creates new ones

2306942
multiplication	modulo
you will still need a method to perform multiplication and modulo on large integers

2307004
mouse	keyboard
the most common implementation is to exit on any mouse move click or on any keyboard input

2307008
lxml	beautifulsoup
personally i write my own tool atop python s beautifulsoup or lxml whenever i need to --- it s at most a dozen line script and does much of what i want

2307019
vb.net	vb6
you can assign 256 single-byte characters to a string if you need to use it to receive data but the parameter passing may be different in vb.net than vb6

2307023
width	height
in this case the height 10 should be resized to 400 and the width 1500 should automatically resize depending on the height

2307070
width	height
flex sets the height and width of an imported image to the height and width settings in the image file

2307070
width	height
to set an explicit height or width for an imported image set its height and width properties of the image control

2307070
width	height
setting the height or width property prevents the parent from resizing it

2307070
width	height
therefore flex scales the image as it resizes it to fit the specified height and width

2307085
getter	setter
in each step elements can be added removed and changed using getter and setter within the collection

2307102
haskell	scheme	forth	smalltalk	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk	scheme	prolog
smalltalk lisp scheme haskell python prolog or forth for example of languages from a different programming paradigm which could expand your approach for development in general

2307125
shadowing	named
as to parameter shadowing in constructors i usually give those a shorter named of the corresponding field such as

2307150
post	put
put the tags alongside the post in the same database table entries contains post title and tags and obviously id

2307161
move	drag
grabbing the scrollbar causes a drag event and move the group

2307162
ubuntu	linux
when you use ubuntu linux you can use ppa repositories for all or most see here link for an informative blogpost with all the information you will need

2307241
children	parent
this constraint seems to be necessary because the parent control needs to rely on certain properties and behavoir in its children

2307241
children	parent
there is also some direct communication of the children with its parent

2307243
inherited	properties
the studyunit objects inherited from dependency objects and i am only binding to its dependency properties

2307273
explode	implode
either use a combination of explode strip and implode or user preg_replace

2307281
integer	unsigned
an integer is -2147483648 to 2147483647 and an unsigned integer is 0 to 4294967295

2307320
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade to update the latest versioning of ruby gems which will then use gemcutter as the sources link

2307324
getter	setter
the new property is marked as public and must be read write must have a getter and a setter

2307352
pop-up	dialog
does the user get presented with a pop-up dialog box

2307392
google-chrome	firefox
i wasn t able to reproduce your problem in google-chrome 4.0 ie8 or firefox 3.5 using that code

2307424
move	drag
on windows when dragging the firsts object to second it allows the drag drop and then crashes the program due to that move supposed to be blocked

2307426
integer	unsigned
uint32 is an unsigned integer with 32 bit which means that you can represent 2 32 numbers 0-4294967295

2307460
int	chars
i am then checking to make sure the chars is a number and storing it in an array of int although that will probably be changed to a short since i only need to be able to store 0-9

2307473
int	chars
first of all if you only need to store values from 0 to 9 you might as well store them in a chars which is just a small int type in c++

2307473
int	chars
since chars is a small int type in c++ you can also do math on it so you could just subtract 0 from each digit after verifying that it is a digit

2307551
free	malloc
if you didn t malloc it you can t free it

2307554
free	malloc
you ve probably either free ed it already or overwritten the malloc info preceding the block with a buffer overrun

2307558
free	malloc
a segfault from free can be caused by calling it on a pointer that was not allocated with malloc or had been free d already

2307571
strdup	malloc
please check on that field and make sure it has being malloc d or strdup d

2307583
client-side	server-side
the result is jquery apps that are full of client-side cross-site-scripting security holes just as we were starting to make some progress of fixing the server-side xss stuff

2307617
lisp	scheme
i m going to pipe in that scheme is different from common lisp when it comes to defining new syntax

2307619
portrait	landscape
i have implemented it and it works fine in portrait but when i run the device to landscape self.view rotates and uigetscreenimage continues to capture using the screen non-rotated coordinates

2307661
ubuntu	debian
just install a debian or ubuntu server and try to use it through your proxy

2307663
punctuation	words
remove all punctuation from the input string tokenize it compare each words to the exclude array and then remove any duplicates

2307711
put	get
when i pass the results from getjson to parseinfo function just like the one below is it possible to get results back into a php variable so that i could put the latter through another php function

2307725
getter	setter
synthesize will only be needed if you also have the property directive for the variables unless you write getter setter methods yourself

2307729
post	get
you are submitting your form with the post method but you implemented a get handler instead of a post handler

2307729
post	get
changing def get self to def post self should fix the http 405 error

2307755
put	get
i just put because i thought that would work but can t seem to get it to work

2307815
for-loop	arrays
if i uncomment the in for-loop it will print everything except the last item of the arrays and it still has a seg fault

2307840
hide	show
i m no windows forms expert but couldn t you set a flag in your constructor whether the form can be show or not then override the onload method and if your flag is false hide the form immediately e.g

2307920
cout	cin
further you have out in as parameters but use cout cin

2307986
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc or realloc

2307988
post	get
if you do as described in this post it s not much just a try catch and get the inner exception out you should be able to see more details and hopefully find the cause of the exception which could be trivial

2307993
xlib	motif
there is motif the proprietary successor to xlib and lesstif the open source emulation of motif

2307993
perl	tcl
there is tk which started out as a library for the tcl language but has bindings for perl python r and many other general purpose utility scripting languages and is cross platform very easy to use for programmers and quite ugly and archaic ie

2307993
kde	gnome
there are gnome and kde which are built on top of gtk and qt respectively and have a larger amount of desktop integration usability and ram and cpu usage than pretty much any of the other alternatives - in particular people who try to use gnome and kde apps simultaneously will have a significant amount of redundant libraries doing the same things in incompatible ways in ways that often do not integrate between the two desktops loaded into ram

2308013
for-loop	loops
you could use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

2308013
for-loop	loops
in that case your for-loop could start it s index at 1 and you could do the first element outside of loops if the length is more than 0

2308033
chunked	transfer-encoding
i now think this was actually a tomcat bug getparameter fails on post with transfer-encoding chunked

2308112
rss	feed
i am currently scraping an rss feed from last.fm and the title attribute looks like it has a unicode - that comes up as u2013 on firebug

2308120
gif	png
convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

2308124
getter	setter
objects typically communicate using void methods and by passing data rather than having getter setter

2308152
post	get
to get this version look at the hornget link provied in the post

2308166
primes	modulus
in rsa there is a public value the modulus often noted n which is a product of two or more distinct primes factors

2308166
logarithm	modulo
then there are algorithms based on discrete logarithm in the multiplicative group of numbers modulo a big prime diffie-hellman key exchange dsa signature el gamal encryption .

2308166
ecdsa	rsa	rsa	dsa
if factorization became easy thus scraping rsa and indirectly jeopardizing dsa and diffie-hellman then we would switch to ecdh and ecdsa

2308166
hash	md5	hash	hmac	hmac	md5
symmetric cryptography hash functions md5 sha-256... authentication code hmac cbc-mac... symmetric encryption aes 3des... random number generation rc4... and related activities are totally unaffected by factorization

2308231
hide	show
oh and one last quick note the code you are working with does seem to require a value be set for the select items make sure you also set that for the select you want to show hide the divs with

2308254
ienumerable	ienumerator
when the c# compiler processes an iterator a method that contains a yield statement the compiler generates a class that implements ienumerable and ienumerator

2308255
post	put
if you put it into post then all your variables are in a consistent location when you re trying to process the form

2308256
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the outcome of all the above is that in ie7 the text block inside the div id spotlight is farther right in comparison with firefox google-chrome safari or even ie8

2308282
ubuntu	linux
my program run on windows and linux on the moment ubuntu 9.10

2308303
division	exponent
so the second time you reach exponent is 0 and you have a division by 0

2308306
for-loop	loops
if your loops is dependant on being able to extract the iteration index out to pass it elsewhere then perhaps a for-loop may be a better choice

2308314
explode	implode
in words read the file into a string explode the string using the marker as the delimiter modify the second if you have a single editable section enclosed by the markers array element to contain the new text submitted by the user then implode the array back into the string then write the string back as the complete file

2308336
rtp	rtsp
for streaming and talking to your clients you need to define a protocol search the web for rtp and rtsp

2308337
google-chrome	firefox
this process works just fine in firefox and google-chrome and pretty much every other browser

2308484
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however when going directly to a hashed link from an outside page or refreshing the page the dom either does not load fast enough or at all surprisingly it works best in ie eventually in firefox and rarely in google-chrome safari

2308484
google-chrome	safari
also the splash page does not render properly in either google-chrome or safari due to what i assume are more jquery problems

2308485
pop-up	dialog
makes the dialog view pop-up the user can press cancel or submit that message

2308551
put	get
just as you set your get options when getting messages you also need to set put

2308556
accessor	properties

2308763
inherited	subclassing
admittedly i come from a java background and in java here i would set up an inherited heirarchy and then on each subclassing of feedentry extend the parse method so that each feedentry knew how to parse itself

2308784
bids	ssis
the second problem which i have seen in sql 2005 has to do with the fact that the runtime for ssis in bids is a 32bit process

2308784
bids	ssis
as mentioned above the root cause is that the runtime for ssis bids devenv.exe is a 32 bit process and many subsystems in that exe create their own private heaps that don t release memory xml oledb etc. see this response to a similar question

2308822
put	get
put a bunch of print statements in so when it loops you can verify the output you get is what you are expecting

2308934
putty	winscp
for linux i use winscp and putty consoles

2308943
putty	winscp
to work directly on the instances i use winscp for both windows and linux instances i installed a third-party sftp server for windows putty for linux and remote desktop for windows

2309135
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
webkit google-chrome and safari supports this now but for other browsers like firefox and ie you can use this script to simulate the effect using javascript when the browser doesn t support the html 5 feature

2309153
range	max
simple solution is sending int s max range to method i.e 2147483647 as it is same in both mysql c# 4 bytes can use int.maxvalue

2309251
rsa	aes
another approach might be to extend propertyplaceholderconfigurer and handle the aes or rsa encryption of the properties

2309251
rsa	aes
so in both approaches above you have to obtain the aes rsa key from another location possibly accessible only for the user under which your application server is started this has to do with os security

2309331
post	get
submit something to a server via a post -- get a list of results back in json format -- take this list of 0 to n results and display them often as a list

2309336
onresume	onpause
i also save data to preferences in onpause and load preferences in onresume

2309367
hide	show
problem is you are hiding and showing bitmap on mouseover so when you move mouseover bitmap mouse goes off panel onpanelmouseleave is called and you hide bitmap which means now mouse if over panel onpanelmouseover is called and in that event you again show bitmap and that means now mouse if over bitmap again and out of panel and hence you are stuck in a hide show circle

2309372
required	placeholder
sometimes i just set the required attributes and set the text etc. sometimes i have placeholder in the template and go something like

put	get
put the text in the jslint page and you will get an answer

2309794
mvp	presenter
the only real candidate i found is the gwt-yui-carousel widget see link below but this seems to be an overload of ressources - though it does almost exactly what i need but instead of displaying simple images i ll have to display in mvp terms a view presenter

2309817
button	checkbox
at first i also thought that there shouldn t be multiple input fields with the same name but having thought about it for a few more seconds i realised that - in the case of radio button and checkbox in particular - there is a good case for duplicate names

2309927
stdout	stderr
first two invocations prove that ls does not write to stdout and writes the error message to stderr

2309930
width	margin
you not only create a an easy way to stretch the color across the page being able to use different color in all header content and footer but also it saves yourself from the double margin problem of ie when you use width and margin in the same elements

it s possible that it s just stdout not getting fflush after the printf

2310241
stdout	fflush
try adding fflush stdout after the printf

2310342
rar	zip
zip rar 7z arj

2310388
public	protected
personally i think it would make more sense to just expand the meaning of interface to cover any contract whether internal private protected or external public but i suggested adding a whole new construct first because people seem to be very adamant about the meaning of the word interface and i didn t want semantics to become the focus of people s answers

2310399
hide	show
also you d better hide them from the start and show only elements with image loaded successfully

2310428
stdout	fflush
note that you will still have to wait for the sub-program to fflush its stdout buffer which is commonly buffered differently when not writing to a terminal window so you may not see each line instantaneously as the sub-program prints it this depends on various os details and details of the sub-program

2310440
hide	show
i am using the jquery show hide functionality in a form generated with php

2311143
post	get
i ran across this post which helped me get the answer

2311172
explode	fgetcsv
you can explode each line on the delimter like or you could use fopen and fgetcsv to parse line by line

2311191
postgresql	mysql
for sure you are looking for a free database so for that you can use many databases like mysql postgresql and sql server msde or access

2311191
postgresql	mysql
but we still have other scenario if you are going to distribute this application to other pcs so you have to think about deployment and in this case you can eliminate the mysql postgresql because they depend on servers but msde it s also server is much easier and you can found alot of tutorials how to deploy it with your project

2311193
maven	m2e
to do so right-click on your project then properties maven lifecycle mapping and find something equivalent to the capture below i m using m2e 0.10.0 so it might be different for you

2311217
istream	getline
if your compiler supports c++ simply use istream getline

2311280

2311392
int	chars
using int arithmetic where is the ith chars of the string and n is the length of the string

2311409
addition	multiplication
so computationally you need four subtractions to get v and u two multiplication one addition and you have to check somewhere between 1 and 7 equalities

2311434
lisp	scheme
richard stallman argued that this was very important for him that it was made default in emacs lisp even though stallman knew about lexical binding in scheme and common lisp

2311434
lisp	prolog
lisp allows to describe prolog terms with s-expressions and with a special compiler the prolog terms can be compiled to lisp code

2311434
lisp	prolog
sometimes the usual prolog syntax is needed then a parser will parse the typical prolog terms into lisp forms which then will be compiled

2311437
inherited	properties
i have a class that inherited from the linkbutton asp.net control to include an int value properties for remembering a database id when creating linkbuttons dynamically

2311448
client-side	server-side
redirect on client side means following steps client-side - server-side - client-side - server-side - client-side

2311448
client-side	server-side
redirect on server-side means client-side - server-side - client-side headers only - server-side - client-side

2311456
folder	directory
you can create just the same directory structure inside the other project by creating link folder

2311478
inherited	properties
i don t think you need inherited from the linkbutton to just attach an id properties linkbutton has a properties called commandargument which you can utilize to store this id and sent it on postback

2311479
post	get
there is also a good example on devx which you can connect via http post and or get

2311491
stringstream	fstream
afaik the binary flag only applies to fstream and stringstream never does linefeed conversion so it is at most useless here

2311495
cray	sgi
you iirc the cray and sgi mips compilers could produce reports like

2311504
udp	tcp
you need you tcp to establish reliable connection and after it sends data over udp

2311515
integer	unsigned
for fast lookup if you only have unsigned integer values you could store the enum values in an arraylist indexed by their respective int value

2311538
profiler	vtune
they also have the vtune profiler that specifically can report efficient use of the alu s in your program s hotspots

2311564
hide	show
in the mean time i hide the webview and show a loading label

2311572
profiling	instrumentation
i was therefore unable to use any commercial profiling that was available to me because they slowed the execution of the server too much and so instead i added various log messages with time stamps to instrumentation the code and thus find the bottle-necks

2311594
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
which should work on firefox safari and google-chrome but not any version of ie

2311611
gridview	repeater
i d suggest using a databinding approach where you actually bind your datatable using a databound-control such as a gridview or repeater

2311635
inherited	properties
in my experience every time i ve wanted to remove a properties from a class in an inherited class my class design was flawed

2311635
inherited	properties
one way to solve this problem would be to create a new base class without the shipunit properties and then inherited that base class two times once for your concrete ship type and once for your concrete shipplacementarray type

2311636
qmenubar	qmainwindow
qmainwindow provides you convenience function to add and manage a qmenubar

2311636
qmainwindow	qwidget
with a window that inherits from qwidget instead of qmainwindow you need to achieve this by yourself

2311661
vtune	shark
we do a fair amount of profiling and have used shark osx only vtune glowcode and the old favourite of counters clocks

2311664
accessor	properties
the other way which i find much easier to read and to write is to implement array accessor methods for the array properties in your case the persons properties and exclusively use these accessor to mutate the array outside of init and dealloc

2311676
integer	unsigned
where the column like and dislike are unsigned integer

2311683
put	get
i also added an event handler for cellbeginedit and put a breakpoint there but it doesn t get hit

2311711
ssl	https
you are seeing this error because you are loading only some of your contents over https the rest if being loaded over http without ssl

2311731
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i still need to distinguish between versions 8 and 9 for all major browsers but here s the code i m currently using that works for all versions in ie and all version up to 8 in firefox safari and google-chrome

2311731
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it also detects whether the plugin is installed but no version info for versions 8+ in firefox safari and google-chrome

2311769
keydown	keyup
i m running an on screen jquery keyboard so the normal keyup keydown events are not fired

2311783
post	get
from using curl i know that each of the different get post delete requests work for each of the uris and return the correct json response

2311848
hash	md5
md5 is a simple hash one that isn t even cryptographically secure

2311857
titlebar	window
when saving the new filename updates in the active window titlebar

2311895
hash	md5
plus md5 always returns a string the string representation of the hash for the input so isset is always true and doesn t make much sense there

2311926
width	height
if you re simply trying to resize an image i d recommend setting width and height of the image with css

2311926
width	height
note that the height and width can also be set using javascript

2311926
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i can tell all browsers except ie using an bicubic algorithm to resize images by default so your resized images should look good in firefox and google-chrome

2311926
width	height
if setting the css width and height doesn t work you may want to play with a css transform

2311929
hide	show
i want to hide show the form field base on selection from select form field i used the following code but it didn t hide the #job_name

2311962
objectdatasource	formview
i m currently using the objectdatasource and formview controls

2311998
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the change that richard m suggest use inline and remove margin-top would work only with webkit browser google-chrome safari on ie and firefox the popup box align to the left rather than to the text line

2312005
explode	implode
so it only a matter of explode ing array_shift ing and implode ing

2312053

2312200
width	height
but when i ran i get 0 0 for width and height

2312217
subtraction	addition
the extra addition or subtraction isn t going to make any difference to the speed of execution of the program

2312232
width	margin
finally on the content div erase the margin and width declarations

2312256
vsto	add-in
begin with downloading vsto visual studio tools for office this will allow you to created a c# excel add-in

2312258
width	height
an inline-block div with no content has no height or width and sits on the baseline of a line of text

2312297
mouse	keyboard
the uielement calls commandmanager.translateinput in reaction to user input mouse or keyboard

2312311
width	height
trace the width and height in one of your event.complete handlers and it will work just fine

2312353
public	protected
as nazariy have said you need to set the visibility accessor of the method to protected or public

2312414
post	get	rss	feed
i need to read multiple rss feed from different blogs and get just the title date and url for the last 10 post of each site and then format those lists however i like

2312437
width	height
i have a navigation menu on this site where i have set the list item anchors to display block and defined a height and width that matches the entire containing element but only the text is clickable

2312450
subtraction	addition
here you go addition and subtraction in c++ using nothing but comparison and logical operators

2312457
rss	feed
have a rss feed reader showing first ten items from each feed if you don t wish to store the items

2312609
opera	firefox
tested the above code in opera 9 ie6 7 and firefox 3.6 on winxp and win2k

2312609
opera	firefox
i tested it with zoom in firefox and opera on the above mentioned windows versions and they keep quoting the dpi as 96 regardless of the amount of zoom

2312658
filesystems	ntfs
assuming the filesystems are ntfs you can use the filesystems serial number of the entire filesystems and file id of that particular file directory to together represent a primary key for that file

2312670
getter	setter
you need to use getter and setter

2312692
getter	setter
you need getter and setter but be careful that you don t accidentally give your user access to the encapsulated data by returning a reference to the object instead of a reference to a copy of it

2312728
getter	setter
the accepted method is to use getter and setter

2312740
firefox	safari
only tested in safari so i can t say for sure if it will work in other browsers although i guess it won t be a problem in firefox

2312848
fast-forward	merge
there s no built-in way because assuming it s not a fast-forward you really do have to have the files checked out for git to do its merge magic

2312906
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you could always use the interfaces for this such as inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

2312992
boost	stl
but you ll need to write a special class for that because there s nothing similar in the stl or in boost

2313003
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if laststringfromrecieveddata is an instance of nsstring or subclass such as nsmutablestring then this is the correct way to compare two strings

2313014
stateless	stateful
however with service locator pattern it s possible to expose your stateful page viewstate or any other type of stateful repository to a stateless object datasource provider class

2313035
width	height
if all works as expected you can simply use a script like this to dump images of the desired websites but you should start firefox and resize it to the desired width manually height doesn t matter www mechanize firefox always dumps the whole page

2313103
fadein	fadeout
or you can use fadein or fadeout with specified time

2313142
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox and google-chrome but something s not quite right in ie6

2313159
implements	extends
i d say have the team learn python and do the basic stuff as you learn the deeper parts you could build classes for them to extends implements

2313170
colt	jama
might be a little lighter-weight than colt but the difference from the look-and-feel of jama might be a little larger

i ve tried setting a url option and tacking on a random number or timestamp but it winds up being attached to the post that submits the comment to the server rather than the get that returns the response and so has no effect

2313607
post	put
the trouble is that wp-comments-post is spitting back the entire page when a new comment is submitted and the only way i can see to add headers is to put them in the wordpress post template which disables caching on all post at all times--not quite the behavior i m looking for

2314057
width	height
this error was caused by missing width and height of the canvas

2314064
action-filter	onactionexecuting
the reason seems simple enough model binding and therefore validation happens before the earliest action-filter method onactionexecuting is executed therefore changing uiculture has no affect on validation messages

2314093
goto	break
i ve seen code like that so you can use break as a goto of sorts

2314106

2314986

use a border of height 1 and don t set the width width auto horizontalalignment stretch the default

2315001

google-chrome	firefox
if you set your image tag src to # or empty it will cause twice pageload calling i faced this on google-chrome and before on firefox

2315153
subtract	add
the reason why you have to add d q before subtract the oldest character is because you might run into negative values due to small values caused by the previous modulo operation

width	height
i am trying to resize the objects in a uiview when the device is rotated without hard coding the width and height

whenever i alter the onmousemove or onmouseup attributes of the document for example

2315426
range	minimum
knowing that the set is ordered allows you to use a cartesian tree which is an ideal data structure for range minimum queries

2315443
free	malloc
if you use malloc as he suggests make sure you free it each time if it is allocated each iteration

2315447
range	minimum
more detail consider computing the minimum value in the range i j

2315501
stdout	stderr
just avoid any use of pipes -- let stdout and stderr just show on the terminal

2315517
serializable	deserialization
i think amf is better because it does serializable and deserialization of actionscript objects

2315521

you can also use the dataview class which provides sorting additional filtering derived columns and several other bits of functionality that is similar to the access query object in some respects

2315560

2315657
width	height
this correctly printed out the height and width of the icon that i had set by calling seticonimage

2315676
getter	setter
you have to loop through all the variables and check for public setter and getter and use it

2315697
goto	break
it d be better to replace goto step 32 with a break statement which exits a loop immediately

2315704
getter	setter
if you have an accepted convention such as the one used by java beans where each field needs a corresponding get and set method then you could loop over all of the first object s getter methods call them and pass the resulting values to the second object s setter methods

2315704
getter	setter
however this won t work for any fields that don t have the right getter and setter

2315705

2315853
children	parent
for example you may save a parent with its children thinking it s cascading the save

2315906
onkeyup	onkeydown
so during my form s onkeydown onchar onkeyup i would need to pretend they are going to my windowless child control

2315906

2315906
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know in what development environment firefox google-chrome or blender were created in but their widgets support windowless controls

2315906

if you get stuck post code and i ll help you adapt it but it shouldn t be difficult at all

2316738
post	get
so i do my get post translation in the controller and then send raw data to the model for validation and processing

2316755
rss	feed
assuming you don t control the source of the rss feed doing it periodically via cron makes sense

2316772
rss	feed
if you do control the source of the rss feed have a look at the other observer pattern

2316830
try-catch	exception-handling
you would normally enclose a block of code in a single try-catch block if the code block should be executed as a block or not at all if some exception-handling occurs

2316830
try-catch	exception-handling
if it s not the case then i believe it is much better to isolate the different code blocks throwing different exception-handling into different try-catch blocks sandwitching do more stuff here that does not throw exception-handling

2316863
post	get
if you rely on javascript then no you don t need a since you ll probably bind the element to post a request with xhr but for accessibility purposes you should wrap it with a element to get it to work without javascript

2316910
put	get
to make things even more difficult it should work for put and get methods too

2316935
firefox	safari
i had the same problem and found that whilst i couldn t inspect hover objects in firefox with firebug safari s web inspector would freeze the current state and allow inspection

gridview	repeater
if the dropdownlist is within a repeater then to make the selectindexchanged event fire you need to disable enableviewstate on the gridview repeater

2317302
gridview	repeater
you also need to databind the gridview repeater on each postback so databind it in the page load method

if the width for rowdefinition height for columndefinition is omitted 1 is implied

2318098

post	get
make sure that whatever is making the change does it via a post request rather than using url parameters and a get

2318145
post	get
now the servletcontainer most logically a decent and efficient implementation would process the http input stream immediately as it comes in so the parameters would be processed in the order as they appear in the request uri get or request body post

2318145
websphere	ibm	jboss	glassfish
i can at least tell from experience tomcat does it the right way so all major containers appservers which are built on top of tomcat catalina ibm websphere jboss sun glassfish etc will also behave so

2318160
overwrite	preserve
alternatively if you have no local branch changes you need to preserve you could just svn copy a.cpp from trunk and overwrite your local a.cpp

2318214
gmail	hotmail
essentially i need to check if the email contains hotmail yahoo gmail etc in the email field

2318258
min	max
i d obviously need to be able to tweak the min and max dates for each user type

2318294
post	get
so basically i am not doing any post get or ajax calls that i can attach the unblock code to it

2318294
hide	show
most of the statements are selecting some nodes and adding removing some attributes like hide show etc

2318329
hide	show
you ll want to show your element immediately upon starting the long process and hide it from within a callback

2318331
deque	multimap
the map set multimap and multiset are normally implemented as binary trees with red-black balancing rules for example and deque is possibly more impression than knowledge a circular queue in an array exploiting an array-doubling or similar growth pattern

2318345
width	height
the width height ratio i want the text field to have

2318356
onresume	onpause
the accelometer should be deactivated onpause and activated onresume to save resources cpu battery

2318372
sorting	filtering
a php framework like symfony or codeigniter can offer you some great features like templating and layouts automated validation escaping of data to protect applications from attacks cache management smart urls e-mail and apis automated pagination sorting and filtering plug-ins orm for databases internationalization etc etc

2318450
post	get
one way is to add the string value also into the value with some delimeter and get both using a split operation on post

2318454
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the search feature seems to be broken the results area is completely blank even though it says there are a few pages of resultsâ in google-chrome firefox and safari

2318456
width	height
textwidth and textheight should give you the right numbers as opposed the width and height properties

2318462
joomla	oscommerce
i looked over oscommerce and joomla s virtuemart but i don t think they are what i need

2318467
put	get
i want to know what i need to put in my tag in my spring security config file applicationcontext-security.xml so that i can get spring security to use my existing service layer class authenticationservice which deals with my custom user and role domain objects

2318487
lxml	beautifulsoup
use beautifulsoup or lxml to parse the html

2318523
banking	payment
i m developing a banking accounting system and want to make possible printing a swift society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication payment order

2318555
int	chars
and so on this is just an example the class_id and parent_id columns are int but i just made them chars for this example so you get the idea

2318557
gentoo	linux
i am running gentoo linux

2318565
profiling	debugging
but to try and debugging it use sql profiling one of the sql server performance tools that comes with sql server to put a stored procedure trace on the database and capture the exact command that executes this stored procedure

2318586
vmware	virtualbox
i know there re solutions for vmware and virtualbox but not much about virtual pc

2318735
excel	listobject
i am creating a listobject in excel using vsto as follows

2318736
oncreate	onstart
in one of the lifecycle methods such as oncreate onresume or onstart call setlistadapter mycustomadapter

2318787
firefox	safari
and unfortunately with a webview unless you do a bit of work you don t have all the great web debugging stuff that firefox or safari would have that would have made this problem easier to find

2318809
width	height
it may not be related but both viewperson and newview have a width and height of 0

2318823
width	height
just set its height and width so the aspect ratio matches that of your label and you should be good to go

2318861
g++	gcc
i am using g++ gcc version 3.3.3 on suse linux on a 64 bit linux machine and the error that i get is

2318911
min	max
question 1 is nicely answered by bentley davis by setting the min and max values of the x and y axes

2318911
min	max
if you do not set the interval the mschart will automatically do a best-fit interval between your declared min and max thus potentially changing the positioning of the gridlines and the labels

2318924
accessor	properties
i suggest as a troubleshooting step setting a breakpoint in projectionparameters at the line you mention and one on the rateruleids.get properties accessor

2318926
hide	show
the question is how do you hide show the images

2318926
hide	show
if you use the hide show methods to toggle the display property then you can use

2318970
children	parent
so when you select like a certain node you could grab all its parent and children from node_parents

2319001
kerberos	ntlm
the issue is that authentication is downgrading to ntlm from kerberos and i can t figure out why

2319001
kerberos	ntlm
this suggests that kerberos is failing and since the client won t allow ntlm the call results in an exception being thrown

2319001
kerberos	ntlm
if i don t fully trust the server i use kerberos otherwise ntlm is fine

2319025
width	height
any control placed inside of the grid will directly fill the whole grid and its size the width and height will match the size of the grid

2319044
pop-up	dialog
tortoiseplink has been modified to not read from the standard input but instead pop-up a dialog window if something goes wrong

2319044
pop-up	dialog
you ll have to invoke plink or putty manually then say yes and they will save it in the registry. tortoiseplink will instead pop-up a yes no dialog box

2319047
free	malloc
all i know is that i have to use malloc and later free in c and new delete in c++

2319088
folder	directory
well i found out that all the application does is create a network folder structure a parent directory with some sub directory within it

2319092
free	malloc
to understand malloc free and new delete you might read chapter

2319097
setinterval	settimeout
you can only achieve what you re trying to do with a settimeout or setinterval call increasing each step with a timer instead of a loop

2319109
implements	extends
however java s type system is perfectly capable of distinguishing between interfaces just try to extends one with a class abstract classes just try to instantiate one and classes just try to implements one and so are most ides

2319132
free	malloc
also keep in mind that if you allocate memory in c++ using malloc you have to use free to free it

2319161
portrait	landscape
i want change the view from portrait to landscape and vise versa depends upon device view position

2319173
superclass	subclassing
if i in code try to access the collection car.wheels i get an sql error because the where clause applies to the table of the subclassing wheel instead of its superclass carpart where the isdeleted property is actually defined

2319178
width	height
you want the a s to display in block mode so that your width and height declarations will properly take effect

2319235
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine on ie7 8 opera and google-chrome but does not work on firefox 3.5

2319244
children	parent
in my fluent nhibernate mapping for the parent i want to load the list of the children

2319249
free	malloc
the term dynamic allocation is normally used for memory and objects allocated from the heap and whose lifetime are determined by the programmer by new delete malloc free rather than the object s scope

2319268
cassini	iis
impersonation does not work the same as in iis see cassini considered harmful

2319317
folder	directory
creates a directory folder

2319347
disk	ram
i guess the problem is audio synthesis oscillators filters effects etc can be quite cpu intensive as opposed to sample playback which is more ram disk laden

2319381
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
older code in our application contains calls to malloc realloc and free

2319381
free	malloc
the problem is that we now have to include a 3rd party library which has classes that contain methods that have names like malloc and free

2319381
free	malloc
but even then if our code is required to call these malloc or free methods of the 3rd party classes the preprocessor will still alter the calls unless we write all calls like this

2319482
min	max
- the other which does a select min max from flat_file grouping by source into another temp file

2319498
cassini	iis
the web.config has been updated the site runs well in cassini but my problem now is deploying on iis 6

2319571
qsqlquery	qsqldatabase
note that it is also possible to explicitly specify for which database a query should be run by explicitly specifying the relevant qsqldatabase instance as the second parameter for the qsqlquery constructor

2319588
hash	salt
i m creating hash passwords using salt sha1 in php

2319687
udp	mtu
i don t know about .net implementation specifically it might be buffering your data but udp datagram is normally limited by the link mtu which is 1500 on normal ethernet subtract 20 bytes for ip header and 8 bytes of udp header.

2319687
udp	tcp
udp is explicitly allowed to drop and reorder the datagrams and there s no flow control as in tcp

2319701
free	malloc
why don t you just define your own malloc and free functions instead of using macros

2319714
post	get
but you might be able to fake it by doing a post using something like system.net.webclient and then a redirect it depends on how the other site handles the get - it might display the same thing that it did on the post or not

2319745
onfocus	onblur
i used to have the onblur and onfocus events set on this text box to do some text swapping when the user clicked into it or out of it without typing anything

2319754
ubuntu	linux
but in linux especially in ubuntu it doesn t appear well since the font size is 10 by default

2319780
objectdatasource	detailsview
i have a detailsview whose datasource is an objectdatasource

2319804
disk	ram
write a program that just reads the file then one that reads and writes the files then one that just hashes random blocks of ram remove the disk io part and see if any particular step is problematic

2319827
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
constructors are not inherited you must create a new identically prototyped constructor in the subclassing that maps to its matching constructor in the superclass

2319836
free	malloc
for free it is the case the standard free takes a void for malloc it isn t the standard malloc takes a size_t you are passing an int and size_t can t be a typedef for int -- size_t is unsigned

2319849
children	parent
the code below is as far as i got it but it is not dealing with multiple children of parent correctly

2319852
free	malloc
for your particular issue about malloc and free the problem is that in your call to malloc

2319853
hide	show
as long as you re keeping them within logical groups you can just move swap show hide the group s container like nsbox or an nsview

2319856
put	get
i have tried to fix this but i cant get the blog to interpret the code and put it out as the real dates and the time

2319864
rss	feed
ok so i m currently having a play around building an iphone web app in which it displays an rss feed

2319864
rss	feed
the rss feed is a full rss feed so the whole story is in the description

2319882
width	height
in a custom wpf control i would like to set the width of the control to be a function of the height

2319914
hide	show
i m looking to hide show properties depending on what selection the user makes in a drop

2319918
hide	show
rather than use the path to show parts of an object i want to use the clipping path to hide cut into an object

2319928
puts	gets
that gets all the information about the forthcoming data block and nicely puts us in the right position within the file the start of the data block

2319929
width	height
first make just to make sure that the outer canvas isnt getting autosized or something weird like that set it to a fixed width height

2319968
pdfsharp	itextsharp
you can use either pdfsharp or itextsharp to create annotations

2319968
pdfsharp	itextsharp
haven t tried pdfsharp annotation but itextsharp does work

2319983
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
i am developing an asp.net 3.5 web application in which i am allowing my users to upload either jpeg gif bmp or png images

2320018
width	height
in my case i needed to cut the height and width of the image by half

2320021
tcplistener	tcpclient
if you are writing a relatively simple application and do not require maximum performance consider using tcpclient tcplistener and udpclient

2320023
free	malloc
if it s available on your system you can use ld_preload to preload a .so library you build that has your versions of malloc and free

2320042
portrait	landscape
if i change the screen from portrait to landscape i can t see the tabs

2320072
portrait	landscape
when that is all said and done in portrait orientation android will use main.xml found in res layout and in landscape main.xml found in res layout-land

2320135
udp	tcp
udp is a connectionless protocol which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp

2320135
udp	tcp
think of udp as a fire-and-forget protocol in comparison to tcp where integrity and checksum is the additional overhead of the tcp over udp

2320139
range	median	range	percentile	median	percentile
you may be better served by using a percentile measure such as the median to represent the central tendency and a percentile range such as the iqr to measure certainty

2320140
lan	localhost
as developers we tend to see only the extra 10ms it takes to download the library over localhost or from our development server on a 100 mbit lan

2320140
google-chrome	safari
if they are using a 1-2 year old good computer with safari or google-chrome this would be negligible but if they re on ie ff2 or some versions of ff3 the difference can be severe or at least measurable

2320149
multicastdelegate	delegation
the highest abstraction below is multicastdelegate which seems unhelpful would need a non-generic predicate type under and identifying the presence of the generic parameter is also useless given the other generic delegation s that may be present in the list

2320185
next	except
the user can drop it everywhere except after the last child of any particular node it seems since it reads that position as being between the node and it s next sibling

2320224
inherited	subclassing
you can also create different handler subclassing if necessary--i m just saying don t forget that event handlers are classes you can use inherited and everything if need be

2320233
division	multiplication
these are special registers used to store the result of multiplication and division

2320265
int	chars
if the string value is most important then use something like the soundex algorithm to split the string into a single chars and a number and encode both into a word or int simple hash

2320309
gtk	gjs
seed and gjs are both gnome projects that bind the gtk and gnome libraries to javascript

2320390
width	height
since text is a control it inherits the method text.setsize width height

2320396
jobs	cron
we re trying to build a dashboard for our cron jobs ---- cf java sqlserver etc

2320404
int	double
the dynamic classes would only need simple fields string int double

2320425
versioning	upgrade
this process will eventually be sent to several other developers who already have eclipse same versioning that i m testing with and i d rather just do an in-place upgrade rather than have everyone go and install a new product

2320426
int	chars
in function int qmain int chars

2320428
width	height
pass width and height into the griddata constructor and set it to the textbox textbox.setlayoutdata along with the properties about how you want the layout manager to manipulate the field

2320450
qdialog	qwidget
you should inherit publically from qwidget or qdialog

2320516
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome for now on just windows from an external application process

2320523
queue	fifo
use the ccr it provides port primitives which are efficient fifo queue and dispatcher dispatcherqueues and arbiter primitives that allow you to control task scheduling

2320537
bcel	cglib	javassist	cglib	javassist	bcel
it is possible to generate classes via cglib asm javassist bcel but you shouldn t do it that way

2320556
google-chrome	firefox
then manually test in firefox and google-chrome for all progression testing

2320593
agile	metrics
you ll have an easier though maybe not easy time introducing agile if show how it aligns with those metrics better than existing practices

2320593
agile	metrics
project the changes in these metrics under an agile process for instance in most cases the sooner we find a bug the easier cheaper it is to fix so benefits from tdd and rapid releases to qa should be easy to quantify

2320597
hide	show
on elements that are nested in that way because inside of one element cannot hide behind itself while the rest of it show

2320599
division	subtract
sort your numbers in decreasing order find the first one less than your desired sum then subtract that from your sum division and remainders could speed this up

2320621
free	malloc
in the second case itâ s easier to forget the free as you donâ t see the malloc

2320626
awt	swing
i believe that all awt swing dimensions are pixels unless otherwise stated

2320700
entity-relationship	diagram
if you are modeling a database entity-relationship diagram are pretty universal to most people

2320709
width	height
you can set the button s height and width to zero

2320723
multiplying	add
just read in big chunks of data and reshape the data into an array that reflects the receiver channel sample structure and then use the appropriate indexing to multiplying and add things for pythagoras and the sum command to add up the terms in the resulting array

2320725
superclass	subclassing
in your case you create an anonymous subclassing of so type parameter is retained in the superclass declaration

2320728
children	parent
whatever the case i can t figure out how to access children of the parent in this mxml example

2320761
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine with firefox and google-chrome

2320779
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux become root and cd to sys bus usb devices usb1

2320790
folder	directory
the best place to put practice directory in the documents folder in the app directory

2320790
folder	directory
gives you the path to the directory folder which you can then hand off to the nsfilemanager

2320800
migrate	staging
assuming you eventually get to the point where you have multiple environments dev test staging prod you may want to migrate data from one to the other

2320803
fast-forward	merge
now merge to master it will be a fast-forward and tidy up the topic branch

2320805
equals	gethashcode
that ll simplify the equals and gethashcode methods nicely

2320831
free	malloc
if you must create raw pointers for homework then you can use malloc as you did or new within a function and hope you remember to de-allocate the memory through free and delete respectively or in a slightly-less-likely-to-leak idiom you can create the pointer with new pass it to a function and de-allocate with delete when you re done with it

2320835
stdout	stderr
if you want to execute a command and get both stderr and stdout not merged a solution would probably to use proc_open which provides a great level of control over the command that s being executed -- including a way to pipe stdin stdout stderr

2320835
stdout	stderr
and here is an example let s consider we have this shell-script in test.sh which writes to both stderr and stdout

2320841
kerberos	ntlm
this negotiation attempts to use kerberos but if that doesn t work it ll fall back and use the older ntlm protocol

2320845
versioning	upgrade
i once had this issue when my major upgrade didn t contain or remove a file from the previous versioning

2320906
google-chrome	firefox
it looked great in google-chrome drop down under the second menu item in ie7 the drop down was under the third menu item and in firefox it was under the first menu item

2320924
mouseout	mouseleave
this is one of the problems with mouseout vs mouseleave

2320924
mouseout	mouseleave
mouseout fires when you move into a child element whereas mouseleave only fires when you move off the element and all child elements

2320958
emacs	aquamacs
most people use emacs aquamacs + slime vimclojure or some java ide with a clojure plugin for stuff like that

2320966
post	get
all the php library does is make curl post and get calls to facebook s rest server

2321043
post	get
in asp.net mvc i need to use 2 separate functions for get and for post so i need to initialize the same data twice and i don t like to repeat something in my code

2321080
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you can create an action-filter and implement onactionexecuting

2321096
mp3	wav
the only problem that i see is that you are using an mp3 format and this uses a wav so you will need to convert the file first

2321161
google-chrome	firefox
p.s i have tested this code works in firefox google-chrome and ie6

2321210
put	get
i know the .each method works as i m able to put alert item.title and get the expected result

2321232
free	malloc
additionally i try to add the code to delete destroy free as soon as i add the code to create init malloc

2321329
qobject	qwidget
here is an explanation of the setproperty method in qobject from which qwidget inherits

2321331
clang	llvm
update feb 17 2012 as of xcode 4.0 with llvm 3.0 clang has supported objective-c++

2321341
post	get
i learned how to get a scrollviewer s scrollbars to display after scaling an element within in a scrollviewer from this post

2321352
gif	bmp	pcx	djvu	bmp	pcx	bmp	tga	tiff	bmp
apng â bmp â djvu â exr â gif â icer â ilbm â mng â pcx â pgf â tga â tiff

2321354
uiview	subviews
so as you can see above i have set the uiview and set the uiimageview and assigned a uiimage to that uiimageview and then added it to a subviews of the view

2321357
post	get
the problem is that the page post back to missing the views part of the path which is a non-existent page so i get a page not found 404 error

2321363
cassini	iis
i have an asp.net application in vs2008 that is growing larger and am developing and testing on iis7 not cassini iis dev so when i make changes i publish run and test

2321364
width	height
edit width and height set the viewbox attribute on the main svg element to the rectangle you want render repeat

2321415
jobs	cron
you could use appengine cron jobs to put a job on a task queue to compute the numbers for the report

2321452
isnull	nullif
this was done using nullif and isnull in the view design.

2321472
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested my site in different browsers now ie firefox safari google-chrome and so far sifr works fine

2321499
nsscanner	nsstring
you can use nsscanner if your hex number is in an nsstring

2321572
folder	directory
a cgi-bin folder was automatically created in the directory for clothing.mysite.com

2321574
daemons	systemd
i m writing a linux daemons and for now it works pretty well but it leaks memory and it s bad - after a few hours it segfaults after using 60 of the systemd s memory

2321633
put	get
one problem with locals or vars is that it will let you put stuff in the namespace that you can t get out of the namespace by normal means

2321645
integer	unsigned
for b it s because integer primary key is the same as integer unsigned primary key

2321688
asterisk	pbx
take a look at asterisk pbx project and asterisk java integration project

2321706
public	protected
that said i think in c++ which again supports private and protected inheritance it s possible to cast the child class up to parent and get access to parent s public members

2321713
boost	stl
previously the code only used stl and boost but i recently had to include so i could look-up csidl_local_appdata

2321763
rss	feed
geoplanit required an appid so i haven t tried this yet and yahoo weather is an rss feed

2321769
daemons	systemd
then run your program until it crash and make sure that the systemd generates a core file use ulimit -c unlimited to allow the creation of a core file be careful if it s a daemons it must be done for the user that actually run the daemons

2321791
integer	unsigned
the size and sign of integer types must be the same. mysql s numeric data types are signed by default so you would have to explicitly specify the unsigned attribute

2321799
webclient	ftpwebrequest
don t waste time to try the webclient class it will give you even less flexibility than ftpwebrequest

2321857
inherited	properties
i find that generics facilitate composition through generic properties without having to write different classes for each composition you want to leverage or having to create a lengthy inherited tree

2321857
children	parent
class parent tchild ilist tchild children

2321880
cout	cin
i can use cout but cannot find examples of how to use cin within a qt console application

2321887
opera	firefox
this is especially odd because in other pages in ie the code works as expected and it works every time in firefox opera and webkit

2321901
maven	m2e
also you may want to look into using the m2e plugin if you are doing maven development with eclipse

2321914
keydown	keyup
shift doesn t trigger keydown and keyup which would have been ideal

2321916
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so when something happens in your second tab where the uinavigationcontroller lives you will push a uiviewcontroller onto the stack

2321918
firefox	safari
you can create an npapi plug-in which will work in safari firefox and other mac web browsers

2321932
hide	show
i have little piece of javascript to show hide divs based on which link is clicked in a list

2321955
addclass	removeclass
if you re able to use jquery or something similar as it has this ability built in - addclass removeclass

2322007
nfa	dfa
you then step through all of those and follow some fairly simple rules to collect sets of nfa states together to become a state in the dfa

2322007
nfa	dfa
the rules are simple enough that it s pretty easy to program them into a computer but you have to repeat them for every cell in the nfa table and do essentially perfect book-keeping to produce a dfa that works correctly

2322026
ant	maven
as others have posted ant and maven are pretty much the de facto project spec utilities in the java world

2322059
ksort	asort
if you change to then you can use ksort where you tried to use asort

2322087
postgresql	mysql
so far the best way i ve found is to first load the xsd into an rdbms like postgresql or mysql and then have rails connect to do a rake db schema dump

2322091
swt	swing
performance is comparable to swt swing is not slow

2322091
swt	swing
but at the bottom line i wouldn t suggest to use pure swing or swt

2322091
swt	swing
there are several application frameworks for swing swt out

2322091
swt	swing
the biggest players are netbeans swing and eclipse swt

2322137
gmail	hotmail
i can t reproduce this bug with any of my email clients gmail yahoo mail hotmail thunderbird blackberry or iphone

2322167
google-chrome	firefox
i m using jquery 1.4.2 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 4.0.249.89

2322207
getter	setter
the end result is a property that is publicly readonly while being readwrite within the implementation and for whom both setter and getter are synthesized automatically by the compiler

2322221
freebsd	linux
i am trying to build an application for freebsd which links to a shared object share.so built on linux

2322221
freebsd	linux
i also have freebsd linux compatible libraries under usr compat linux lib

2322262
maven	pom.xml
if a developer that uses eclipse edits the dependencies in the maven project files pom.xml files then idea can import the files and change it s project settings

2322262
imperative	declarative	ant	maven
re ant vs maven - in this respect syncing project settings ant build files won t work because they are imperative script-like rather than declarative

2322265
button	checkbox
when your go button is clicked use javascript to get the values of all the checked checkbox

2322325
mouseover	mouseenter
i have tried using the events mouseover and mouseenter but both of these only animate one time when the mouse is positioned over the button

2322369
jar	war
an additional step needed for jboss 4.2.1.ga is to remove any log4j jar files from the war

2322369
jar	war
if this jar is included in your war the sql.log file is never written to

2322369
maven	pom.xml
example maven pom.xml entry

2322377
console.readline	console.writeline
you can use console.writeline console.readline ..for the purpose.both are in system namespace

2322388
folder	directory
somewhere in each of those directory will be a class template folder

2322388
post	get
if you get it to work post the correct c++ paths back here and i ll update this answer to reference them

2322428
int	chars	int	double
only the types chars short int long long long float double long double _bool void and with _complex will be examined

2322437
profiling	instrumentation
my profiling is showing me that the sqlalchemy instrumentation is taking a lot of time in this use case

2322483
post	put
or even put the breakpoint before the post so you can step through the view

2322492
int	double
in practice though you can expect that long long int is the biggest integral type and long double is the biggest floating point type

2322510
backslash	double-quotes
as you are having double-quotes in a double-quoted string you have to escape the double-quotes inside the string using a backslash

2322513
post	get
you need to sanitize your inputs before dropping post or get data into an sql string

2322515
getter	setter
i can do it without a setter and a getter but i want to know the correct way to approach this

2322522
width	height
use one of the drawimage methods where you can provide the required width and height of the drawing area

2322536
cout	cin
the first point is to make sure operator overloading is a little less messy than in c++ debatable but it surely makes things a lot simpler and the second point was specifically chosen to rule out c++ s cin and cout way of dealing with io iirc

2322537
getter	setter
a reason to use an setter getter in that kind of situation would be if you want to ensure that some condition or calculation is made on the data each time the property is set

2322537
getter	setter
as a sidenote of course if your want to access your private property from outside the class you ll have to use to public setter getter -- but it doesn t seem to be what you are trying to do here

2322543
ant	maven
maven should be the preferred way but most ide s now days support some kind of ant based project which is what most of the ides use internally

2322545
tabcontrol	tabitem
inside the window is a tabcontrol with three tabitem

2322549
getter	setter
don t forget that you can use the magic __get __set methods without having to create getter and setter for everything

2322549
getter	setter
edit if the member variables are private or protected you will have to use a getter and setter

2322576
peer	p2p
otoh your response to the above comment seems to imply that you might have some p2p elements in which case http will probably not serve unless you incorporate a little bit of network traversal and proxying to expose the peer as public addresses to each other

2322584
int	chars	int	double
the native types for c are chars int float double and void

2322584
range	minimum
the c standard defines the minimum range for these types and defines a few relative relationships long int must be at least as long as a regular int etc

2322590
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
there are no conditional comments for firefox opera and safari

2322592
google-chrome	firefox
update looks like this works in both firefox and google-chrome

2322595
ant	maven
i d recommend ant long before maven

2322665
getter	setter
setter getter allow derived classes to modify limit enhance state and behavior of an object more easily

2322665
getter	setter
but you can over-do setter getter and then they become a bit annoying

2322677
hbase	hypertable	voldemort	memcachedb
update and twitter s selected cassandra over several others including hbase voldemort mongodb memcachedb redis and hypertable

2322694
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
the advantage of this low-level approach is that with just wait pulse and the lock statement you can achieve the functionality of autoresetevent manualresetevent and semaphore as well as waithandle s static methods waitall and waitany

2322712
post	get
you only need separate methods for get and post if their method signatures differ there s no reason why one action method can t handle get and post methods

2322712
post	get
if you need to know whether it was a get or post you could check using request.httpmethod in your action but i would advise using a separate method decorated with the acceptverbs httpverbs.post attribute as suggested by the other posters

2322724
rss	feed
i m using the nsxmlparser class to parse an rss feed

2322726
pop-up	dialog
if a try to browse any page it pop-up the username and password dialog box and even though i entered a valid user including the domain administrator it doesn t log on into the app

2322732
sorting	filtering
there is an msdn article entitled selecting rows randomly from a large table that talks about this exact problem and shows a solution using no sorting but instead using a where clause on a generated column to filtering the rows

2322749
folder	directory
one directory folder per concept is a good idea

2322776
apache	nginx
check out the nginx upload module i m sure apache has the same thing

2322782
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox google-chrome opera it works fine

2322839
for-loop	loops
unlike a regular for-loop a foreach loops will only use the collection once to call getenumerator

2322858
required	placeholder
stfail is the exception and only required 1+ arguments. the last required argument is always an optional format string for a description and any other parameters are used to substitute in those placeholder just like you d do with printf or nslog

2322893
waitpid	fork
see the perldocs for fork wait and waitpid and also the examples in this so thread

2322905
for-loop	loops
but there are a lot of things that go wrong here -- you have to do this on an enter_frame loops instead of a for-loop otherwise you just get the 2nd frame totalframes times you have to have the right security settings to be able to use the draw function if your clip has weird registration points the bitmaps will clip.

2322929
google-chrome	safari
over time encountered quite a number of serious cross-browser issues mostly in less widely used browsers safari google-chrome

2322944
rar	zip	rar	gzip
i can uncompress zip gzip and rar files but i also need to uncompress bzip2 files as well as unarchive them .tar

2322944
maven	pom.xml
i am using java along with maven so ideally i d like to include it as a dependency in the pom.xml

2322958
alarmmanager	wakelock
but if you want to keep the device awake -- whether for your first approach or just while you are doing work triggered by an alarmmanager -- you need to hold a wakelock

2322968
inherited	properties
it sounds like you could easily accomplish your task by creating your own custom class that inherited from qwidget and has the additional properties that you described

2322996
for-loop	loops
i d even go as far as saying that the body of loops must not continue or break unless explicitly documented at the top of the for-loop because as i said the whole purpose is to make the code easier to understand by coming up with a distinct style to express simple repetitions

2322996
for-loop	loops
if that s the case then i m merely extending that principle to say that if it s even simpler than your simple for loops you don t even care about the iteration index or whether it s increasing or decreasing etc you just want to repeat doing something n times then use the winking arrow for-loop construct instead

2323028
versioning	upgrade
alternatively just have the customer upgrade to the very latest fiddler versioning

2323032
rss	feed
i m going to go out on a limb and say you mean by rss that the feed is to be parsed and served inline on the server side

2323032
rss	feed
you ll need to implement some sort of caching to keep from hitting your rss feed over and over and over but the speed benefits will be noticeable

2323041
rss	feed
i want to read multiple rss feed using jquery

2323049
width	height

folder	directory
when i clean the solution the model folder is still in the bin debug directory but the contacts.xml file has been cleaned

2323064
valgrind	memcheck
run valgrind with the option to try it but beware that it is not as robust as memcheck

2323115
inherited	properties
this is what makes the styling work properties but is also important to allow attached properties properties inherited through the visual tree and many other things wpf relies on

2323130
min	max
standard sql doesn t allow you to define a group by clause that does not include columns that are not wrapped in aggregate functions min max count etc in the select clause

2323137
ssl	https
this works fine with http i would like to somehow add a ssl certificate so that the files are served up via https similar to

2323146
rss	feed
you could parse the rss feed from yahoo with javascript

2323193
ienumerable	ilist
and if all you need to do is foreach you don t even need ilist ienumerable will suffice.

2323193
ienumerable	ilist
note that the non-generic ilist and ienumerable are in the system.collections namespace which is not using-ed by default

2323213
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works correctly adding nodes as it should but on ie7 i get a scripting error and the specific error

2323297
getter	setter	public	protected
give message a public getter but protected setter so that only subclasses and the datacontractserializer because it cheats may modify the value

2323315
folder	directory
..and you put the folder which contain the library files into your project directory and of course change folder in the above code to whatever the folder names are

2323361
width	height
things like background font b i center width height are examples of old attributes or tags in the case of font that define style and should generally be ignored these days

2323438
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if your visitors are using a webkit google-chrome safari or gecko firefox browser possibly presto opera too but i m not sure then you could use

2323460
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this technique works on safari 3.2+ ie 5.5+ firefox 3.05+ google-chrome 4+ and opera 10+

2323473
client-side	server-side
client-side scripting server-side scripting and ajax are not means to defend against eavesdropping

2323620
gwt	cssresource
note however that for gwt 2.0 cssresource and uibinder is recommended

2323733
getter	setter
that is to say it s got a name a type a getter and a setter just like any other clr property

2323733
inherited	properties
when you register a dependency properties you can specify that it participate in properties value inherited

2323751
int	chars
i want to use templates but i only want it for the following types const chars int unsigned and size_t

the thought behind this is that i want to keep the store around in order to preserve the column sorting and filtering but destroy the grid in order to save on memory

2323762
onclick	onchange
instead of writing onclick for each option tag i recomment use onchange event of select

2323833

hide	show
i ve pinpoint the cause and found out that it is show hide function which is not working

2323833
hide	show
where should i amend my code in order to hide show div element as the way i wanted

2323845
capitalize	uppercase
the regex matches only words which are entirely uppercase any number of uppercase letters with a word boundary on each side and then passes each of these to the defined function which returns a replacement text with only the first letter capitalize

2323849
hide	show
also make sure you ve pulled in the definitions of show hide

2323878
hide	show
which will show the element with the id of composer and hide all visible child elements of the class pmcommoncontainer when the element with the id compose_link is clicked

2323888
division	multiplication
portable edition still with only one division no branching and no multiplication

2323891
pull	push
although my preference is a pull rather than push solution whereby developers can view changesets checkins through the website

2323926
gif	png
afaik jpeg doesn t support transparancy so perhaps you re saving the image out as gif or png with a .jpg extension and your viewer is ignoring the extension

override the touchesbegan and touchesmoved to save the initial points in the began and calculate rotation translation and zoom in the moved and construct a cgaffinetransform to apply to the imageview

2324037
implements	extends
you could also implements the zend_paginator_adapter_interface directly or extends zend_paginator_adapter_dbselect in any model that needs to support pagination

2324075
cvs	svn
we use fisheye on our cvs svn repositories

2324076
sorting	filtering
the rule of thumb for any application is to let the db do the things it does well filtering sorting and joining

2324076
postgresql	mysql
i took steven s postgresql demonstration of a full table scan query performing twice as good as two separate indexed queries and mimicked it using mysql which is used in the actual question

2324076
postgresql	mysql
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

2324116
public	protected
this includes public protected default package access and private fields but excludes inherited fields

2324118
pascal	delphi
i think you can use this framework for your application in delphi as it is written totally in pascal

2324149
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

2324300
width	height
you may want to fiddle with images hint use html width height not style css

2324328
equals	gethashcode
note that strictly speaking the original gethashcode method isn t bugged even though it has the same flaw because even if you don t properly mix in the last element when the bit-length is a multiple of 32 equals object would still return the same hashcode

2324332
width	height
when i instantiate an object of this class from another main class i want to have the dimensions width height of the loaded image being known to this main class

2324344

2324392
ant	pom.xml

using this pom.xml the ant task is not executed if i do not define the -dftp property in my maven command

2324403
int	double
int are slightly faster but you d have to be microbenchmarking to notice. there s a small percentage difference between int and long and float and double but basically if you can afford one you can probably afford the other

2324403
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

2324424
textarea	textbox
a textbox with textmode singleline is rendered as an input type text while a textbox with textmode multiline is rendered as a textarea

2324446
client-side	server-side
am i supposed to use a server-side language like php or a client-side one like javascript w jquery

2324656
instances	transient
instances - save the transient instances

2324656
instances	transient
instances - save the transient instances

2324663
jobs	cron
i suggest either implementing the scheduling part on your own server using cron jobs and then sending the push request to urban airship or whomever you choose using code like this

2324668
instances	transient
hence the exception message object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing field

2324696
width	height
however drawing inside the pdf s trimbox worked perfectly well when i interpreted the coordinates as x y w h where x y is the upper left corner and w h the width and height of the rectangle that originates from there

2324761
width	height
you can get the width and height of the image using the imageloader object public functions getwidth and getheight but you need to know when the load is complete so you could dispatch a event from imageloader completehandler like

2324902
post	get
we don t ever call the do_get and do_post methods from our code this is done automatically by the httpserver class instance when get and post requests are made see point 2

jstl	taglib
then in your jsp files ensure that you re using the right taglib uri s as outlined in the jstl tld documentation

2325772
super	extends
often it turns out that you need the same parameter to be both super and extends compared to some exact type which means that you cannot use wildcards at all

2325772
super	extends
unlike classes where extends is always the answer one needs to think about whether they mean extends or super when it comes to generics and the mnemonic is a useful way of remembering the general rules

2325783
phpunit	simpletest
if you are testing a php application phpunit is generally considered much better it s activelly maintained and developped at least that simpletest

2325795
portrait	landscape
i am new to iphone development.in my app i want to display the web view in device with c portrait orientation.it should also support landscape orientation

2325842
onresume	onpause
always install handlers in onresume and disable them in onpause

2325857
getter	setter
you can achieve that by implementing getter and setter in the delegate class

2325857
getter	setter
so the variable you to assess is set in the currentlink string by setter method and class where you want the string just use the getter method

2325913
subtract	add
add 12 uniform numbers from 0 to 1 and subtract 6

2325996
pyopengl	pyglet
i ve navigated through pyopengl and pyglet in eclipse but it did not look like they support this

2326028
inherited	properties
sadly this properties isn t inherited meaning you have to put an attribute in the start tag of every element inside the

mp3	wav
i m using lame encoder to convert a wav to an mp3 in mac osx using objective-c and cocoa

2326340
inherited	properties
statictext doesn t have htmltext properties like a textfield - it inherited directly from displayobject

2326340
mouse	keyboard
you cannot mimic it by listening to mouse events as displayobject doesn t dispatch mouse events - only an interactiveobejct would dispatch mouse keyboard events

2326347
margin	height
breaking large blocks of text into paragraphs that have a bottom padding margin that s at least twice the size of the line height makes them stand out better

2326429
free	malloc
i d throw in a guess that you might be calling mismatched new delete or malloc free implementations - so something was allocated by your memory manager but when the memory is released you end up with the default delete free implementation

2326457
firefox	safari
this only happens in firefox tested in safari ie6 and ie7 so far

2326530
google-chrome	safari
1 i believe you can use defaultvalue to get the initial value but i couldn t find a list of browser support update just tested in ie6 ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3 ff3.6 safari 4 google-chrome 3 and this solution works great

2326533
getter	setter
objective c will create a getter and setter property that will handle the retain for you in the most efficient manner

2326726
portrait	landscape
portrait video recorded in iphone 3gs is strangely rotated in landscape and only quicktime plays it correctly players like vlc etc play the portrait mode videos in landscape because it is encoded that way

2326730
portrait	landscape
you might consider switching from portrait to landscape in other words transposing the data so that you get to use 65k rows for days of the year

2326739
google-chrome	firefox
this code executed now from index.htm page and it works great on ie and google-chrome but not firefox .

2326801
implements	extends
if you extends a class that implements cloneable you have little choice but to implements a well-behaved clone method

2326801
implements	extends
since you made it clear that you have little choice but to implements clone here s what you can do in this case make sure that myobject extends java.lang.object implements java.lang.cloneable

inherited	subclassing
if the class you are writing this method in implements cloneable this will never happen since any subclassing will inherited it appropriately

2326851
superclass	subclassing
the exception is explicitly thrown by an implementation - this is the recommended way to prevent clonability in a subclassing when the superclass is cloneable

2326851
superclass	subclassing
the latter case cannot occur in your class as you re directly calling the superclass method in the try block even if invoked from a subclassing calling super.clone and the former should not since your class clearly should implement cloneable

2326853
sqldf	plyr
once the data is in the long format you can use sqldf or plyr to extract what you want from it

however note that multiplying two numbers of arbitrary length x is not o 1 on finite hardware -- as x tends to infinity the time needed for multiplication grows if you use karatsuba multiplication it s

2327303
addition	multiplication
of course if you implement factorial some other way for example using addition recursively instead of multiplication you can end up with a much more time-complex algorithm

2327309

but i would like hudson ci server to be able to run it but no matter all the jars i put in ant_home lib i can t get this task to run in a simple command line ant..

2327403
apache	nginx
wsgi is usually preferred because it decouples your choice of framework from your choice of web server if tomorrow you want to move say from apache to nginx or whatever the move is trivially easy with wsgi not so easy otherwise

2327417
post	get
edit changed the title of the post to get more views

hide	show
hide the details markup until a list item is clicked at which time do a ajax request to get the details and populate and show the details section

2327568
wtforms	werkzeug
this is probably less relevant to your questions but all the functionality in django is also provided by other libraries that i find to be superior jinja2 for templating it has the same syntax as django templates without the mess that is the template tags system and better performance wtforms for forms and modelforms babel for i18n with many features not present in django s own i18n library and werkzeug to provide a complete wsgi interface with url routing

2327571
datamodel	powerdesigner

2327607
width	height
there is actually an easy o 2 n brute force solution where n is either the width or the height whichever is smaller

2327774
pascal	delphi
the most ideal solution would be to create a wrapper preferably which consumes the original source unmodified and compile that wrapper to an obj file using c++ which then is linked into delphi where another wrapper exposes the engine via a more standard object pascal syntax

2327794
folder	directory
however i would like to be able to read the content of the pda not only in its mydocument folder so i can t use this plus it have to work with 20+ possible pda of the same model thus making 20+ directory

always use delete if you use new and free if you use malloc

2327960
free	malloc
malloc free only deal with the memory allocation and deallocation

2328225
apache	nginx
from apache and php s perspective the ip address of all requests is the nginx server

2328242
width	height
with the rectangle s width and height set to auto i expected the rectangle to resize to automatically display the arrow that is drawn

2328242
width	height
however it seems that i need to explicitly set a width height in order to see anything

2328242
width	height
if i leave the width height as auto the rectangle is displayed as a single point as if width height 0

2328255
ssl	https
i ve got a ckeditor wysiwyg text and html editor control on an https ssl web page

2328263
sorting	filtering
the new logger only consisted of a single python file which provided a bug list with sorting and filtering options and a submit page

2328269
pop-up	dialog
additionally i think i may experiment with putting a timer around the call to edit.removeandsort and if it takes over a certain amount of time pop-up a one-time dialog mentioning that it looks like removeandsort is having problems and asking if the user wants to cancel or at least not call remove and sort

2328278
apache	nginx
here s a blog-post about that nginx proxy to apache - access remote host ip address using mod_praf

2328284
nexus	artifactory
maybe overkill if you re the only one working on the project but i d recommend installing a maven repository manager like artifactory or nexus

2328284
nexus	artifactory
i m not familiar with nexus but artifactory installation is dead simple - just unzip and you re good to go since it comes with an embedded jetty

2328312
ssl	https
you are getting the warning because the scripts are not being loaded via a ssl link https just regular http

2328315
ostringstream	std
create a std ostringstream and print them to it just like you could to cout

2328335
realloc	malloc
if you re allocating the strings with malloc originally you might consider using realloc to resize the character arrays so they can contain the new string

2328353
jar	manifest.mf
i would extract the driver jar file and find the manifest.mf file this will contain some version information

2328362
button	checkbox
it adds the ability to use a free-form list but turns it into either checkbox or radio button

2328374
x86	64bit
i want my solutions platforms to default to any cpu i believe that means that at jit time the assembly will be either x86 or 64bit based on the machine that loaded it

2328386
memset	calloc
containing such gems of nearly-forgotten wisdom like as mentioned above there is a null pointer for each pointer type and the internal values of null pointers for different types may be different. which means that calloc or memset are not a portable initialization for pointers

2328411
mouseover	mouseout
once i mouseover one of the tabs the rotation should stop on the selected tab and when i mouseout it should continue rotating from the selected tab item

2328475
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that will loops through a set of page in php

2328486
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i ve seen how collision is detected in the colliding mice example where it uses a qgraphicsscene to draw the qgraphicsitem mice on and scene - collidingitems this to see which mice are colliding

2328486
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
the problem is that the fridge magnets example uses a class that inherits qwidget in place of qgraphicsscene so there s no collidingitems method to check when we have a collision

2328491
hash	md5
for the fastest verbatim searches you should store a md5 hash of the title in a binary 16 column create a unique index over it disabling the key compression and search for the hash

2328522
post	get
once you ve got started post code either on the nvidia cuda forums or here on stackoverflow and the community will likely help out but you ll need more specific questions to get more specific answers

string is defined as a standard type just like int double float etc

2328550
firefox	safari
try using a different browser firefox safari konqueror or ignore that your div isn t partially transparent until the fix comes

2328556
free	malloc
new delete are type safe whereas malloc free are not

2328556
free	malloc
this means that pointers returned by malloc and free are void pointers that need to be cast to the correct type

2328556
free	malloc
new delete implicitly support array allocation and deletion using the and syntax using meta-data supplied by the compiler malloc free do not support this syntax

2328556
free	malloc
applying new delete to a class type t will call the constructor and destructor respectively of t malloc free do not call the constructor and destructor of t

2328556
free	malloc
the same holds for memory allocated using malloc which should be free using free

2328569
memcpy	memmove
but anything under about 8 kb is faster to handle with memmove and memcpy

2328579
mouseover	mouseout
so i would imagine that you can simply do that on mouseover and reset back to your defaults on mouseout

2328587
versioning	upgrade
i am running versioning 2.8.4a and will try to upgrade to latest release hoping this will fix things

2328672

2328713
hide	show
strangely as opposed to show method hide can revert hard-coded visible style with no problem

2328713
hide	show
so to hide show elements as intended i either have to use hide show method combo without no visibility style hard-coding or use css method of jquery and set the visibility style as desire

2328716
hide	show
i have some very simple jquery hide show logic called on a change in select list value in a drupal form

2328739
put	get
i put everything in comments to finaly get to that conclusion

2328770
rss	feed
as a workaround for familiar feed i would manually fix those datetime nodes - by catching the xmlexception loading the rss into an xmldocument fixing those nodes value creating a new xmlreader and then returning the formatter from this new xmlreader object code not shown

2328770
rss	feed
rss feed cf all ned us hl en q test cf all output rss

2328807
union	distinct
pushed the color condition into the where clause of subselects adding the color to the grouping and added distinct to support identical behavior of union

2328810
onfocus	onblur
i don t activate deactivate detection onblur and onfocus

2328886

learning some functional language like haskell or ocaml would help in intellectual enrichment and will teach you new ways in which you can tackle the problems

2328975
width	height
height and width are always zero and color of any pixel is always the same

2328989
folder	directory
files should be downloaded into a specific directory if you are concerned with other accessing this file you should do a deny from all in a .htaccess in that folder

2329143
queue	fifo
basically all checks stay the same just that you use a fifo queue to hold your states instead of an implicit stack

2329186
int	chars
for your error the reason is simple you are trying to assign a pointer chars at sz wich is an int

2329204
exponent	modulo
the main problem i have is that i have been supplied the exponent and modulo as an nsdata object and i need to then convert them to a seckeyref object in order to perform the rsa encryption

2329246
vbulletin	phpbb
those that immediately come to mind are phpbb vanilla and or vbulletin

2329248
for-loop	loops

2329252
orca	msiexec
msiexec i sample.msi reinstall all reinstallmode amus in command prompt.inspite of setting in command prompt i tried to update msi property through orca

2329275
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome but not in firefox and safari

2329350
free	malloc
hence the reason you don t want to mix malloc free with new delete

2329401
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 3.5+ and newer versions of google-chrome and safari both links popup the colorbox as is expected

2329452
pull	push
i can control the push pull but i haven t seen a way to actually prevent repos from being visible in the hgwebdir cgi application

2329454
put	get
sometimes this is referred to as a view model class and generally contains nothing more than several string properties that the ui layer can get from and put to directly without worry of validation

2329457
min	max
once you have used something like the code above to get your miny and maxy you can then use those values to reset the min and max y-axis values on the chartarea

2329482
sorting	filtering
the thought behind this is that i want to keep the store around in order to preserve the column sorting and filtering but destroy the grid in order to save on memory

2329492
width	height
box has height h i width w i and

2329492
width	height
as it is 3d i get three sequence of height width and depth

2329582
hash	md5
i must admit that i know virtually nothing about encryption but i m assuming that an md5 hash as an example can be longer and would presumably take more processing power to crack

2329584
post	get
the code necessary to get authentified and to read the sharepoint list from java is a bit too long to post here

2329595
x86	mips
the differences features of different cpus platforms like x86 mips arm powerpc

2329609
hash	salt
we prepend each password with a random salt value and hash using md5cryptoserviceprovider

2329664
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

2329666
mouseover	mousedown
the problem is when 2 items are positioned so that the label of one is above the icon of another in the z-index so that the label eats any mouseover and mousedown events

2329669
versioning	upgrade
my solution was to upgrade the versioning of tinymce that i was using

2329678
udp	tcp
you can open a tcp pipe you can broadcats udp you can do a fully fledged ws for this purpose alone you can use a file share protocol

2329681
postgresql	mysql
since you ve indicated that you re happy working with either one i say go with postgresql for new projects and don t worry about converting existing projects unless and until oracle does something with mysql that gives you cause for concern

2329685
width	height
accounting for the rotations is easy enough for every tower all you have to check is what happens if you use its height as the length of the base and its width as the height and what happens if you use it in the natural way

2329715
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
try creating an object to bind to and instead of using datagridtemplatecolumn use datagridtextcolumn and datagridcomboboxcolumn and the editing should be as you expected

2329726
scrypt	pbkdf2
use scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2

2329726
hash	salt
you should hash the passwords together with salt that are long and cryptographically random

2329735
inherited	properties
since csmapannotation does not inherited from mkannotationview and you have not implemented the selected properties it will not work

2329772
hide	show
you d better not show hide the window but create a new one and close it when needed

2329794
min	max
does the language have min max functions

2329795
post	get
if you include it as part of a post build process or if you have team system set the rule to fail the build they ll soon get the hang of it

2329818
int	boolean
assuming your language doesn t equate boolean and int values as c and c++ do

2329834
stdio	fflush
calling exit instead is a good way to cause pending stdio buffers to be fflush twice

2329839
kerberos	ldap
in addition ldap makes for a good way of abstracting authentication over lots of different means active directory kerberos even normal sql-based authentication

2329845
uninstall	upgrade
at uninstall and upgrade time the reference counts that should have been tracked would determine whether the shared items should be removed

2329867

also available zip unzip tar untar xmlvalidate xslt ftp telnet scp sshexec cab .

2329881
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
i m using the nsurlconnection and the nsxmlparser in order to connect and parse the xml content

2329889
scrypt	pbkdf2
we estimate that on modern 2009 hardware if 5 seconds are spent computing a derived key the cost of a hardware brute-force attack against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost of a similar attack against bcrypt to find the same password and 20000 times greater than a similar attack against pbkdf2

2329889
hash	salt
also always add a salt to make it impossible to share effort for brute forcing many hash at a time

2329892
width	height
you do this by dismissing all variations where the width is lower than the depth so for each i w i d i and then dismissing the variation where the height is not the highest nor the lowest of the three dimensions because the other two variations can go one on top of the other and this one can t join in

2329899
maven	pom.xml
i m using jsf 2.0.2-fcs with hibernate entity manager 3.3.2.ga and hibernate validator 4.0.2.ga below are the relevant parts from my maven pom.xml running in tomcat 6.0.20 on windows xp pro service pack 3 32-bit

2329993
onfocus	onblur
note that this method doesn t require adding onblur or onfocus event-logic in your html itself

2330079
nsstring	nsdata
you should use nsdata to store binary data not nsstring

there are open source and commercial jpa implementations toplink essentials eclipselink hibernate entitymanager openjpa kodo etc and any java ee 5 or java ee 6 application server must provide support for its use jboss uses hibernate entitymanager glassfish v2 uses toplink essentials by default glassfish v3 uses eclipselink by default weblogic uses kodo by default etc 1

2330292
glassfish	weblogic
it is for example possible to use hibernate instead of kodo with weblogic or instead of eclipselink with glassfish

2330653
public	protected
it should be protected or private and it should only be tested indirectly by unit testing your public api

2330668
hash	md5
the simplest way to be slow is to iterate the fast hash function thousands of times - that s what the md5 and sha-1 based password scheme used to store passwords on unix-like systems do it s not just one round of md5 or sha-1

2330705
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i m using touchesbegan touchesmoved with multitouch

2330705
touchesbegan	touchesended
i bounds test on the point of touchesbegan to set the button as down and the same for touchesended to reset it

2330736
gif	png
i suppose you can set a generic field type use filefield module and in the allowed filetypes setting enter all image and video filetypes png jpg gif avi flv etc then also set unlimited for the quantity allowed

2330751
for-loop	loops
if by query you meant your for-loop start loops at

2330751
for-loop	loops
as of right now your for-loop structure checks if which evaluates to false so it doesn t run the code inside of loops

2330770

firefox	safari
i tried the website on ie 8 safari and firefox and it looks fine now

2330812
post	get
when a character is typed in to the textbox it sends a ajax post or get request to the php file which queries the database and returns a result set

2330837
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it looks like at least the latest versions of internet explorer firefox google-chrome and safari all support the cut and paste events which are triggered immediately after text is cut or pasted in a given input element

2330837
mouse	keyboard
the events are triggered by keyboard and mouse interactions

2330837

put	get
i think i d use a combination of jquery and js regexps jq to find the elements to process and get the contents out of each javascript s replace method to do the string manipulation and jq to put the modified contents back in the dom elements

2330946
width	height
then you can write some js to load or replace with the desired image or adjust the height width attributes on the image which would scale it but doesn t always look great

viewdidappear	viewwillappear	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
and this is sufficient until the view is obscured by a modal view at which point the view is resized to the default size somewhere between calls of viewwillappear and viewdidappear as uinavigationcontroller inherits from uiviewcontroller

2331036
width	height
if you only specify the width in css the height will scale automatically

2331076
mouseleave	mouseenter
i actually acheived this using the mouseenter and mouseleave events and changing the gradient but.

2331077
min	max
however i don t want the rescaling to be jerky as one would get by constantly resetting the min max -- when it does rescale i want the rescaling to be smooth

2331114
bindparam	bindvalue
if you are having problems with passing non-references to bindparam i suggest using bindvalue instead

2331136
put	get
i get a distinct flash-bashing troll vibe off this question but i ll put in my 2 cents

2331139
cakephp	yii
the closest frameworks to want you require are symfony yii cakephp they all have a console command line tool so quickly generte basic crud for them symfony probably has the most complete functionity with it s admin generator but also as a steeper learning curve than the other two

2331150
button	checkbox
you can derive your control from buttonbase just like button hyperlinkbutton checkbox etc

2331182
int	chars
a chars + int results in a chars that is int chars higher in memory

2331193

i m using the height h as the width of the checkbox

2331214
cdr	cons
building data out of thin air - an implementation of lisp s cons car and cdr functions in c#

2331220
int	chars
a chars is just an int with a range of 255 values and chars literals like a are just a number as well

2331227
int	chars
in c a chars is basically an int between 0 and 255 so you can treat the int directly as a chars if you want to sprintf to a buffer or similar

2331239
int	chars
finally obligatory portability remark a chars s value as an int may not represent its ascii value if the underlying encoding is not ascii mdash

2331300
filtering	grouping
you need ranking and grouping algorithms to filtering and understand the data and how it relates

2331339
stdout	stderr
i need to launch a number of long-running processes with subprocess.popen and would like to have the stdout and stderr from each automatically piped to separate log files

2331339
stdout	stderr
each process will run simultaneously for several minutes and i want two log files stdout and stderr per process to be written to as the processes run

2331353
int	chars
keep in mind that str a chars pointer is just an int int long long long depending on architecture that identifies a location in memory

2331355
setinterval	settimeout
in fact moving an item at a constant speed is the default way of animating in javascript setinterval settimeout etc. jquery is a shortcut for the people who don t want to do the tedious calculations involved in the more frequent case of wanting a transition to occur in constant time

2331355
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval or settimeout with a date difference check

2331359
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
although it works for other browsers like ie firefox and google-chrome it doesn t in safari

generally if you put the numbers you wish to generate in an array in your case an array of length 16 with two each of 1 2 ... 8 then randomly permute the array you will get what you want

2331419
rss	feed
php is a server-sided language which runs on your server not the users that accesses data such as information from forms databases rss feed etc and then processes the data for example mailing the form results to you before sending the user a html document like one that says thank you for you submition latest blog posts from a database etc

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
but you should use a for-loop instead of a while loops when you know the size and even with a variable length arrays you know the size.

2331552
google-chrome	firefox
it works as expected in ie8 but doesn t fade out google-chrome firefox 3.6

2331552
google-chrome	firefox
niether the fadeto call or the one in the button click work in google-chrome firefox

2331584
int	chars
why are the linker implementing int global and chars global as the same global variable

2331584
int	chars
how are the size of the global variable managed the size of int and chars are different

2331598
width	height
scale works like a percentage and there s no way to get the width height or depth of the dae once in flash

2331605
google-chrome	firefox
works just fine for me in google-chrome 4.0.249.89 38071 and firefox 3.5.8

if you put it in external file how do you get around the needs for site_url and base_url beside of course put the absolute url that i want to avoid

2331766
16-bit	64bit
in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor

cat	tee
i o pipes cat tee xargs read write overwrite append seek

2331846
cpu	processors
data types size depends on processors because compiler wants to make cpu easier accessible the next byte

2331846
cpu	processors
for eg if processors is 32bit compiler may not choose int size as 2 bytes which it supposed to choose 4 bytes because accessing another 2 bytes of that int 4bytes will take additional cpu cycle which is waste

2331871
vbscript	jscript
but windows script host is on every version of windows since win98 it supports scripts in jscript or vbscript or any mixture of the two

ant	maven
i m going to give up on maven if i can t get a simple working example and use gwt s eclipse plugin with ant i guess

2332565
range	min
then i fold seeding with the first result as min min setsminisin and every step of the way if the set does not change i just widen the range else if the set does change i make a new element

2332588
width	height
sprites work well when youâ ve got an element with at least one fixed dimension width or height and you want it to have a different background image in different circumstances

2332661
onmousedown	onmouseup
ok my problem is that i need to find a way to constantly read x y coordinates of the cursor in my browser onmousedown and then to quit reading the x y coordinates onmouseup here is what i have so far

2332702
dbf	bde
if you re still using bde you can use the bde api to physically sort the dbf table

2332726

use strptime mktime and strftime

2332780
hide	show
this will revert back to the show at first then hide behavior

2332813

dwoo	smarty
they are both very similar but dwoo has the advantage of not sucking major donkey balls which is smarty s main downfall

2332899
folder	directory	hash	md5
also if you think that there will be big count of uploaded files you can divide your directory structure by folder with names for example consists of first 2 letters of md5 hash

2332943
tostring	string.format
you can use string.format or tostring method of double to do so

2332998
width	height
just remember that those divs need width and height atributes

2333005
hash	md5
what i always do is set the filename as an md5 hash of the file itself - the side effect of this is it avoids duplicate uploads taking space plus you can verify data integrity fairly easily

2333085
hide	show
you can either hide the current results altogether only show percentages without absolute number of votes or delay the display of the votes

2333090
debian	linux
this has worked well so far and i could just unzip the linux zip file on my debian based server and run . eclipse from the command line and the app would start up

2333120
x86	64bit
we ll assuming your talking about amd64 em64t x86_64 and x86 for 64bit and 32-bit respectively

2333120
x86	64bit
you can run amd64 code on x86 processors only by emulation qemu or some kinds of virtualisation i believe vmware might support 64bit guest os on 32bit host os on 64

2333139
int	double
i have a with dynamic values from an enum like string int double bool datetime

2333143
versioning	upgrade

default accessor is the special properties that returns an object of the collection based on

2333198
getter	setter
one of the field is called images with only getter and no setter

2333211
hide	show
essentially when you click on this button it either show or hide the tab control which contains status messages and re-sizes the form to fit the remaining controls shrink or grow

2333217
hide	show
one way to do this is to create the controls all together and show hide the ones required depending on selectedvalue dynamically

2333270
uiview	calayer
it starts with calayer display and from within that method uiview drawrect is called to be precise first uiview drawlayer layer incontext context is called and from within this method uiview drawrect is called

2333270
uiview	calayer
which is used in uiview drawlayer layer incontext context within calayer display method

2333286
children	parent
when i delete the parent the deletions cascade correctly to the children

2333307
getter	setter
in our legacy java ee application there are loads of value object vo classes which typically contain only getter and setter maybe equals and hashcode

2333314
hide	show
just add a code to resize the form every time the show hide details button is clicked

2333317
post	get
the procedure for writing one is outlined in that post - it s similar to what alex describes but by overriding get instead of get_value_for_datastore you avoid issues with needing to write to the datastore to update it

2333330

post	get
it should support mysql and php with get post session and cookies

2333500
put	get
it must get a default price from somewhere else not in this table and it must also get an override price from this table and put the two pieces of information together

2333511
mouseover	mouseout
once i mouseover one of the tabs the rotation should stop on the selected tab and when i mouseout it should continue rotating from the selected tab item

2333511
mouseover	mouseout
at the moment the when mouseover the cycle stops but does not select the correct item once i mouseout then mouseover again the functionality works perfectly

2333566
free	malloc
the c library then manages these pages and maintains lists of what is free and what is allocated giving the user addresses of these blocks when asked to with malloc

2333566
free	malloc
this area may contain garbage or it contain other malloc d memory it may contain the memory used for stack variables or it may even contain the memory used by the c library to manage the lists of free allocated memory

2333566
free	malloc
corruption of the c-library s malloc free management memory causing crashes when malloc or free are called

2333566
free	malloc
malloc free and pointers are very fragile in c and to a slightly lesser degree in c++ and it is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot accidentally

2333576
hex	binary
csv comma separated values is not a format suitable for binary data the general rule of thumb though for saving binary data to a text file is to convert it to a format that does suit text files something like base64 or a textual representation of the raw data in hex

2333605
maven	pom.xml
maven pom.xml fragments

2333642
post	get
as is usual when you post a question you get a minor breakthrough

filtering	grouping
sort filtering and grouping queries all

2333861
folder	directory
i am able to create the temporary directory e.g-for 100 revision number able to create 100 folder but need help to write piece of code to do a unreserved checkout prior to this create activity set activity each element associated with the each revision and put the file into the particular created folder

2333867
opera	firefox
a browser is not the right tool if you want to debug xslt that transforms xml to xml unless it is a browser like firefox or opera and your target xml format is a format like svg or mathml or xhtml the browser knows to render

2333883
oursql	mysql-python
all python database modules use the same api so either mysql-python or oursql will work

2333883
lxml	elementtree
elementtree or lxml

2333883
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	elementtree	elementtree	beautifulsoup
no direct equivalent but beautifulsoup and lxml can parse and elementtree and lxml can generate

2333883
mako	genshi
genshi jinja2 mako cheetah and too many others

2333895
getter	setter
the convention you are referring to is to adopt an anemic domain model as opposed to rich domain model where entities are simple pojos annotated as beans entity with just the bare minimum in terms of getter and setter

2333904
swt	swing
essentially the two apis you ll need are jdbc and swing or an alternative such as swt

2333925
google-chrome	firefox
using either google-chrome or firefox + firebug you have a right click + inspect element option that s great for cases like this i recommend either combination

google-chrome	firefox
edit the following works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

2333952
versioning	upgrade
now i have upgrade my ubuntu to versioning 9.10 and g++ to versioning 4.4.1

2333981
free	realloc
when you call realloc as you have you throw away the new address and there s a good chance that the old address has now been free

2333981
free	realloc
the reason realloc returns a new address is because expansion of the buffer may necessitate it being moved if that current block is surrounded in the memory arena in other words it can t just expand into a free block following it

2333981
free	realloc
keep in mind that realloc doesn t have to return a new pointer it may give you the same pointer if for example there was enough free space after the block to satisfy the new size or if you re reducing the size

2333981
memcpy	memset
similarly you don t need to memset a memory chunk to 0 if you re immediately going to memcpy over it

2333981
realloc	malloc
that s because realloc null 7 is identical to malloc 7 - realloc is perfectly capable of starting with a null pointer

2333994
pop-up	dialog
when i try to execute this statement in oracle sql developer 2.1 a dialog box enter substitution variable pop-up asking for a replacement value for tobago

sorting	grouping
bea stollnitz has a good description on her blog of how to use the collectionviewsource to implement sorting and grouping of collections for the ui

2334093
width	height
this rescales the image to the larger size of the width and height and then crops it to the correct size

2334101
post	get
i know the java code works file because i can get a response if i post to it from a html form

2334115
x86	64bit
wpf application run as 64bit processes on 64bit os unless compiled specifically to target only x86 just like any other .net application

2334132
put	get
to get a has one relationship you would put the addressid on the the persontable

2334161
spaces	delimiter
there are many other issues like this you need more ui spaces because some languages need more characters than english to express the same concept you need bigger fonts for east asia you need to use localised date times in the user interface but perhaps english us when communicating with databases you need to use semicolon as a delimiter for csv files string comparisons and sorting are cultural phone numbers addresses.

2334202
mouse	keyboard
i don t know the inner workings of gmail s keyboard event capturing but i recently wrote a simple keyboard shortcut navigator so i don t have to use the mouse to click links for chrome

2334263
mxml	haxe
my advice is learn flex focusing strongly on mxml or learn haxe

2334271
16-bit	64bit
it may be a long way away but consider some years in to the future where 64bit os and cpus are ubiquitous consider how 16-bit faded away when 32-bit took over

2334285
autocompletetextview	spinner
there is no combobox but you can use a spinner and autocompletetextview as briefly described in building custom components

2334324
int	chars
not quite you only need a number of chars so sizeof int is not required

2334357
button	checkbox
basically what i am trying to do is create a sort of console application wrapper for the dll that would create a new instance of the dll s form and then make certain checkbox checked and click certain button

however depending on the device used by the phone you may be able to get the system to put it into monitor mode if you have root access

2334381
many-to-one	one-to-many	parent-child	one-to-many
map it as normal one-to-many many-to-one parent-child child-parent relations and that s it

2334392
mouse	keyboard
however now there are some users saying they need to be able to select a part of the item in the label say the first 3 characters or the last 2 using the mouse or keyboard

2334409
hash	md5
as a repository contains more than the artifacts poms the metadata md5 and sha1 hash files... deploying means not only copying the artifacts but making sure all this information is correctly updated

2334429
google-chrome	firefox
or when your user installs google-chrome imports their bookmarks from firefox that pointed to particular spots inside your webapp and suddenly the bookmarks don t work as they did before

2334439
inherited	properties
to get a strongly typed view you can either use the prompts from the vs mvc tools and right click on an action and choose create a strongly-typed view then select the proper business object to act as your model or you can directly alter a page by changing it s page directive s inherited attribute to system.web.mvc.viewpage where somemodel is the model that implements the list properties and is the model that will be bound to the page

2334461
put	get
i put my sqlite database file in the assets folder and i write a dao calss to get data from database but the information from log.e means i can not open the database

2334468
gif	png
if the background is a gradient or image replace the png with a gif in your ie6 stylesheet

2334471
inherited	properties
for each specific report you can create a different properties class as long as it inherited from createreportprop

2334471
ienumerable	idictionary
if you wish to do less changes within the createreport class you can have your createreportprop implement an ienumerable or idictionary interface so that iterating the parameters is more generic

2334542
int	chars
rather you supply it with a pointer to int and printf fills that with how many chars have been written so far

2334571
atomic	compare-and-swap
afaik you need either an atomic compare-and-swap instruction or you need to be able to disable interrupts

2334601
toolbar	tabs
it allows you to write text to and read text from a window without the window having any other ui chrome such as toolbar menus tabs etc

2334626
free	malloc

filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
data manipulation such as copying splitting merging alignment grouping sorting searching filtering and more

2334709
post	get
now some i know what their purpose is but many i cannot even seem to track down on google or i just get oblique references to such as a post from a forum in 1999 complaining about the process

2334761
maven	pom.xml
assuming that you have a maven pom.xml for building everything in the parent module it would now include modules like

2334903
text-align	font-size	width	text-align	width	font-size
text-align justify works best with small font-size with slightly higher line-height - line-height is for readbility and smaller font size puts more characters in one line abstract characters-per-line width therefore gaps between words justified text looks better

2334930
hide	show
therefore we get the next element and show it by removing the hide class months.eq curr .removeclass hide

2334946
put	get
put the install dvd into the dvd drive or download the package and install it to get the debug symbols

accessor	properties
in this case since you call another method when the properties is changed if you want to keep that functionality then set it using the accessor

2335037
vim	textmate
check out the blog post from textmate to vim for rails coders

2335162
pascal	delphi
both borland pascal 7 and delphi 2007 have got the procedure str which takes a number a length and precision and converts it to a string like this

2335162
pascal	delphi
i want to know because i am in the middle of porting some borland pascal code that uses doubles to delphi 2007 and when i compare the outputs i get inconsistencies that result from rounding in the str procedure

2335171
wordpress	joomla
how do all these wonderful scripts out there like wordpress joomla e.t.c

2335203
getter	setter
if you have or need java style getter and setter you can also use the beanproperty annotation

2335203
getter	setter
if you instead use the beanproperty for a val instead of a var the setter won t be created only the getter

2335204
daemons	systemd
part of this systemd includes a monitoring daemons whose purpose is to take tab-separated value files turn them into xml that dazzle recognizes and pass them to dazzle for label generation

2335270
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome does not have a separate search box like firefox ie and safari have this functionality is required

2335285
tabcontrol	tabitem
controls tabcontrol itemssource binding tabitem

2335292
nhibernate	automapper
i have two objects mapped by nhibernate automapper with a manytomany relationship

2335309
uiapplication	nsnotification
note that applicationwillterminate uses nsnotification and not uiapplication plus you also need to add the following code to the bottom of viewdidload

2335320
put	get
i have a problem with with my output when i write to i file i get squares when i put endl to change lines

2335359
ostringstream	std
if you want you can pass it std cerr std cout or an std ostringstream implementation i use it with a std ostringstream implementation

2335369
accessor	properties
to address the issue of the using the field directly or the properties accessor mutator i am in favour of the properties

2335369
accessor	properties
if you should have a default value beeing returned in the accessor or raise properties change events or the like in the mutator you will bypass this functionality by accessing the field directly

2335458
division	multiplication
bit shifting is the same as division or multiplication by 2 n

2335473
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side language and really has no way of enumerating files and directories on a web server without the aid of a server-side script anyway

2335536
strdup	malloc
however i m not using strdup nor malloc to allocate space for that string

2335547
integer	fractions
this precludes a fractions result much like integer division

2335559
put	get
what ends up happening is that all the videos get put into one list

2335618
children	parent
since i m using the aggregate pattern and instances of child class will only ever be referenced in the context of a parent i don t have a childrepository to delete the children directly - only a parentrepository

2335618
children	parent
however when i retrieve the parent object and call parent.children.clear the children from the database are never deleted

2335664
translation	localization
the localization works just fine when storing all text translation in the same file

2335665
fflush	gets
everything that is fflush to the left margin is executed when the file gets executed

2335665
fflush	gets
so the function is defined and its default arguments set once when the program gets executed because the def statement is fflush left

2335724
super	implements
i can t really explain the problem you re seeing but it seems to be related to the fact that jdk 5 will not allow override on implements methods of an interface only on overridden methods present in a super class

2335731
post	get
in case the other post aren t obvious to get the old version of webhelpers you can run

2335752
ant	maven
whenever something compiles in eclipse but not ant or maven you will need to find a way to make both compilers happy

2335753
folder	directory
open the folder you wish to recover click on the time machine icon and browse the directory as if it was 1999 all over again

2335834
pop-up	dialog
click an ajax-inserted li element pop-up a dialog box with a text input when the input is above 100 submit the information for verification against the server

2335868
skip-lists	tree
they include sample code for things like binary search tree graph skip-lists nodelist etc

2335869
spaces	delimiter
the closing delimiter is optional in php but not in xml and removing it helps prevent unwanted white spaces at the end of files which can cause problems

2335873
draggable	droppable
specifically draggable and droppable

2335877
coldfusion	cfchart
i am having an issue with coldfusion s cfchart tag

2335907
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
an argumentexception argumentnullexception argumentoutofrangeexception etc

2335955
post	get
get some data from post and the user who posted them

2336030
typedef	struct
ps in my own view java is likely to follow c# in allowing struct primitives and maybe typedef as parallelism without resorting to them is proving difficult to accomplish with good performance

2336058
hash	md5
neither md5 nor sha are encryption algorithms they re hash algorithms

2336060
int	boolean
it will work for your example since the boolean true and false values are converted into 1 and 0 because the bitwise operators work with 32-bit int

2336068
hash	md5
you can t decrypt md5 or sha1 hash they are one-way hash which means they are non-recoverable

2336130
manipulators	iomanip
in order to use parameterized stream manipulators like setprecision n you will have to include the iomanip library

2336158
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up but the lower half of the dialog is hidden and the user can t possibly click allow or disallow for that matter

2336174
post	get
i think the post redirect get pattern coupled with window.onbeforeunload in javascript like so uses would be really useful for your circumstances

2336213
vtk	itk
as somebody has mentioned you could use itk which could be used with vtk as a visualization toolkit

2336216
min	max
this is not a valid bst the 2 is out of position with regards to the 10 but if you don t send a min and max value down through the tree you will incorrectly verify it as valid

2336252
int	double
it sounds like what you want is to find each int in the s-expression then double it while keeping the rest of it the same

2336280
button	checkbox
i would like the button on my web page to toggle the visibility of my two checkbox

2336345
free	malloc
suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

2336372
free	malloc
the malloc block header contains information about the the size of the block and when free is called it returns that amount back to the heap

2336489
postgresql	mysql
postgresql scales farther than mysql

2336522
gif	png
i know that png gif are lossless while jpeg is lossy

2336546
gif	png
gif if needs animation or transparency that works on ie6 note png transparency works after ie6

2336552
gif	png
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

2336560
gif	png
compared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparency

2336561
gif	png
gif has 8 bit 256 color palette where png as upto 24 bit color palette

2336571
put	get
in order to get the width of the div to auto-adjust you ll have to convert it to an inline element using the same style as you put on the p display inline

2336574
gif	png
png files have a larger default pallet however you can shrink their color pallet so that when you do they result in a smaller file size than gif

2336575
gif	png
you should use png instead of gif because it offers better compression and features

2336582
gif	png
i usually go with png as it seems to have a few advantages over gif

2336582
gif	png
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since it uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animations

2336631
spaces	delimiter
however i would probably do something like split the string into tokens using spaces as a delimiter then iterate through until you reach the first token with no numbers in it

2336680
children	parent
i have a parent class with a list of children

2336680
children	parent
i would like to load the parent by something other than the id by name...i am using criteria.setfetchmode children fetchmode.join

2336727
put	get
from the results get all the user_id s that match put them in an array

2336730
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in firefox and opera as well so i m assuming it works in safari and google-chrome too

2336733
queue	fifo
you can use a fifo queue that stores your position and thus avoid your recursive calls

2336736
rsa	aes
if you re dealing with sensitive data you could generate a random aes key in javascript then send it to the server along with the password encrypted with rsa

2336738
ssl	https
if your host doesn t support https then a service like cloudflare universal ssl can be used to ensure all browsers connect to your site using https even if your server doesn t support ssl tls

2336738
ssl	https
https certificates can be obtained for free using let s encrypt or start ssl there is no legitimate reason not to support https

2336750
ubuntu	centos
but suppose i want to generate executables for standard ubuntu 8.04 and centos 5.3 boxes

2336752
subtract	add
if you add you must subtract but the absolute value is an implementation detail that should be ignored

2336770
hide	show
there s a lot of customization you can do to the admin by adding custom modeladmin classes hide fields show additional fields allow for editing of related-items on the same page or limit filter the options that appear in a foreign key field

2336770
sorting	filtering
you can also make things easier for users to find by adding sorting filtering to the front page search fields

2336900
setinterval	settimeout
if you are calling this function in a loop as bobince mentioned in his her comment you should change it to a series of settimeout calls or setinterval to give control back to the browser

2336923
ant	emma	ant	maven
you first need to integrate emma into your maven or ant build by following these instructions

2336923
ant	maven
for the maven example above and likely ant you do not need to specify the file path as it will automatically find coverage.xml files in your modules

2336929
folder	directory
publish the web app to a folder on the laptop and create an iis virtual directory pointing to that folder

2336937
width	height
you have to specify a height and width in your img tag or when it loads it has a has a rect of cgrectzero and doesn t show

2336940
min	max
max min distinct references to a grouping column and the

2337026
width	height
you can use document.createelement iframe and then appendchild or replacechild the new element if you use replacechild you define a dummy div that has the width height of your iframe

2337053
for-loop	loops
and now that we have the timestamp of last monday we can write a simple for-loop that loops 7 times adding 1 day each time like this

2337053
for-loop	arrays
modify that for-loop so it stores the dates in an arrays

2337058
ant	maven
likewise build management tools like ant and maven are nice for large projects with nontrivial dependencies but you certainly don t need them to write hello world

2337061
int	double
in beej s guide to networking there is a section of marshalling or packing data for serialization where he describes various functions for packing and unpacking data int float double ..etc

2337132
int	chars
it s perfectly valid according to the standard for you to set the chars data and then read 0s when you attempt to read the int or vice-versa

2337147
ubuntu	linux
operating system is ubuntu linux

2337171
int	double
it makes more sense to say than since t can be non-class types like int or double

2337189
client-side	server-side
the regularexpressionvalidator validates both server-side and client-side using the same regular expression and in the case of it fails on the client-side for length 12 but works for length 10

2337191
ienumerable	iqueryable
however you should note that this works on ienumerable and not on iqueryable the results will be pulled from the data source before the where is applied

2337198
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox and ie but not in google-chrome

2337234
std	ostream
for example cout is a std ostream and inserting data into the stream is a modifying operation so to implement the operator to insert into an ostream the operator is defined like this

2337293
disk	ram
find a library that doesn t read this stuff into ram before writing it to disk

2337334
pop-up	dialog
per the rules i describe on my blog step 8 should succeed w o user intervention no browse for folder dialog no error pop-up

2337341
children	parent
the controls collection only fetches the controls that are the immediate children of a particular parent and it doesn t recursively search through the entire page to find all the buttons

2337346
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
there is also the bsd version though if you use a bsd-based os such as openbsd netbsd or freebsd

2337382
google-chrome	firefox
i think it only works on google-chrome not working on firefox 3.6

2337391
getter	setter
since all my di mappings are defined in the way of properties getter and setter i created a base class like this

2337394
versioning	upgrade
create a new versioning that will have your changes so that if users want new features they need to upgrade their codebase

2337411
folder	directory
i tried placing the entire amazon folder inside the system libraries directory and then tried including libraries with this- load- library amazon fps client

2337430
punctuation	words
unfortunately google bing altavista yahoo and excite all strip the punctuation and just show anything with the words window in it

2337477
width	height
if i set the height and width to auto it doesn t scroll and if i set it to spefic detentions it creates a box when the window is maximized

2337524
ubuntu	centos
for generating executables for standard ubuntu 8.04 and centos 5.3 systems you could install the distributions in virtual machines and do the necessary compilation from within the virtual machine to guarantee the resulting binaries are compatible with the library versions from each distribution

2337524
binutils	glibc
it appears it may be slightly out of date but there is a matrix of build results for various architectures to help determine a suitable combination of gcc glibc binutils and linux kernel headers

2337524
binutils	glibc
not all combinations of gcc binutils glibc and linux headers will build successfully

2337549
width	border-box	width	margin	box-sizing	border-box	box-sizing	margin	margin	border-box
i know i can use box-sizing or -moz-box-sizing set to border-box to get that div s total width including borders and padding but not margin to be that computed 100

2337561
drawingvisual	rendertargetbitmap
currently i m using drawingvisual and a drawingcontext.drawellipse command for each circle then rendering the visual to a rendertargetbitmap but it becomes very slow as the number of circles rises

2337569
folder	directory
so i assumed that mysql default directory was the wamp folder

2337574
treemap	treeset
treeset treemap hashset hashmap etc

2337579
width	margin
it would help to know what s your point but knowing this all - i advice you to use wrapper div having width and padding or just having width and my-div having margin

2337601
swift	objective-c
code snippet in swift 3.x 2.x and objective-c is here

2337609
rss	feed
as part of our application we need to download a rss feed

2337609
rss	feed
our client s have an internal rss feed which works fine with ie firefox but doesn t work with our application

2337686
bash	subshell
the bourne shell would run the while loop in the current shell but bash runs it in a subshell â at least by default

2337846
min	max
convert them to datetime using parseexact or tryparseexact and then use linq to get the min and max

2337882
rss	feed
because an rss feed is simply an xml file it should be fairly simple to parse it with simplexml

2337900
queue	fifo
note - the queue isn t a fifo

2337940
pop-up	dialog
simplify pop-up dialog using simple panels only

2337940
mouse	keyboard
i m not talking about mouse keyboard junk but high level events

2337940
button	checkbox
the controller doesn t care if the user clicked a button menu or checkbox

2337985
required	placeholder
.lib can be either the same as .a or a magical so-called import library a thin placeholder which causes you to required a .dll at runtime

2337991
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
free works on dynamically allocated memory memory allocated with malloc calloc or realloc

2337999
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

2337999
free	malloc
you re essentially telling the runtime to free the memory at address 0 which has not been previously allocated by malloc

2338013
hash	whirlpool
yes hash in php should support whirlpool by default

2338065
opera	google-chrome
this is not something that can be seen in internet explorer 8 google-chrome or opera

2338082
config	ini
if you re using ini config add a line like this

2338124
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the pointers that you can legally pass to free are pointers obtained by previous calls to malloc calloc realloc and null pointers

2338139
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox 2.x+ and google-chrome seems to not have much problems with that if the request url is identical

2338150
min	max
this is similar to jeffrey s answer but instead of parsing each date it first finds the min and max dates comparing its string values and then it parses the values at the end

2338162
versioning	upgrade
one thing to note is not using client versioning 1.6x with a 1.5x svn server as this is playing havok with our merge processes until we upgrade see

2338178
freemarker	velocity
it seems velocity and freemarker look fairly similiar at least for basic usage

2338223
awt	swing
i can at least say what the edt it that s the event dispatch thread the thread where all awt and swing operations are done

2338224
implements	extends
there is thus no need to discuss technical points things like cayenne 2.0 is intrusive you have to implements an interface or to extends a superclass cayenne 3.0 has pojo support but is still in beta after more than 2 years...

2338237
int	chars
perhaps the phrase your teacher was aiming for was along the lines of ...for backwards compatibility with c types recognizing the problem that is misleading when t is a c-style built-in type such as chars or int as others have said

2338249
super	self
super simpleimagebutton self .onmouseup e #dies here

2338272
width	height
save it with appropriative width and height

2338285
jstl	taglib
it s however not builtin but all you need to do is to just drop jstl-1.2.jar in the web-inf lib and declare one of its taglib in top of the jsp page as per the tld documentation jstl core

2338285
jstl	taglib
jstl also has xml and sql taglib but they are intented for quick prototyping only and shouldn t be used in real production

2338285
internationalization	localization
then there is the format fmt taglib which is great for internationalization and localization i18n and l10n

2338285
jstl	taglib
jstl is just a taglib

2338349
rss	feed
if so then you have to know that rss are xml with a standard format and not related to wikinews and you can transform any rss feed to be displayed in -say- html with xslt

2338375
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works beautifully in ie and firefox but for the love of me i cannot get it to work in google-chrome

2338437
subtract	add
now doing the add and subtract method of this class are pretty simple

2338462
set	bag
if xml files are used for mapping purpose we can set lazy false for the bag

2338467
int	double
this library is an example of what is possible for float and double arrays similar results should be possible for int arithmetic since sse has int instructions as well

2338499
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have client side security feature to prevent phishing

2338500
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
multiplication is repeated addition division is the opposite - repeated subtraction

2338500
division	subtract
for example 3 can be subtract from 10 3 times without going 0 so the integer division quotient is 3

2338504
post	get
so even if you can launch your application as brian suggested it s not hard to get that application s components into reflector once it s running i can post a sample from windbg if someone would find it interesting

2338508
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe	wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i m not sure about svcutil.exe but for xsd.exe and wsdl.exe you have to specify all the files that are used by the .xsd file because they don t recognize elements

2338532
implements	extends
i recommend extends one of the list classes that has already implements a dataprovider property it s a lot to tackle

2338559
width	height
as an addition to the above use the me.move left top width height method

2338569
profiling	debugging
we used sql profiling too to debugging the failure but couldn t see the bulk insert statement for this table

2338602
free	malloc
the same kind of leak exists with memory allocation calling new but never delete or calling malloc but never free for instance or file pointers never closing opened file pointers

2338604
put	get
what i did was create a wrapper which is a partially-implemented abstract base class that uses any standard cache library as the backing cache just needs to implement the contains get put and remove methods

2338604
put	get
intercept all calls to the get put add and remove methods

2338604
put	get
because the getoradd still implements a get followed by an optional put this method is synchronized serialized against the put and remove methods but only to add the incomplete entry not for the entire duration of the lazy load

2338609
selecteditem	selectedindex
it should be enough to set the selecteditem or selectedindex property and then it will be rendered correctly

2338645
children	parent
example i have a parent abstract class with child1 child2 and child3 children that each could occur in my runtime foo class

2338687
nsuinteger	nsmutablearray
to fetch an entry from a nsarray nsmutablearray you can use nsarray objectatindex nsuinteger index

2338687
integer	unsigned
whereas index would be an unsigned integer nsuinteger

2338703
put	get
if you have a tip using another attribute type i just need to get this data to put in the div let me know please

2338705
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
the idea is that i can take whatever filtering grouping sorting has been set on the existing view and then create other views from that base view in effect layering or aggregating my filtering etc

2338775
post	get
take http post and get requests

2338785
uitableview	nsindexpath
i suspect that the method - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath is not being called

2338785
uitableview	nsindexpath
i suspect the above to be the case because at one point in my development debugging the release version on the iphone revealed that - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath was not being called though it was being called when debugging the debug version on the same iphone

2338799
firefox	safari
the second one creates the correct screen shot but it only works on firefox and our tests usually pass on firefox and fail in other browsers so it is crucial to capture screen shots for the other browsers mainly ie and safari

2338805
google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in ie and google-chrome on a pc but in firefox on a mac and pc it resets after four

2338824
ubuntu	debian
details are in the debian ubuntu package

2338849
int	chars
just go through the string building up an int as usual but ignore non-number chars

2338857
unix	bsd
so you will have to learn about writing a basic unix application bsd socket programming for the tcp ip network programming and the http protocol

2338877
mouse	keyboard
the view is responsible for responding to mouse events keyboard events etc

2338877
getter	setter
i don t prescribe to the notion that a dto should just be simple getter setter structs

2338884
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i know both safari and google-chrome have one and it s pretty sure firebugs includes one for firefox too

2338894
g++	gcc
it compiled fine with g++ and also with gcc

2338894
g++	gcc
i m assuming that g++ is c++ compiler and gcc is c compiler

2338915
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
lighttpd apache nginx

2338926
g++	gcc
it compiled fine with g++ and also with gcc

2338981
width	height
if you don t need user output create an iframe with width 0 and height 0

2338986
pull	push
often times i ll start work without doing an hg pull and an hg update. when i try to push my changes i get an error

2339006
translation	localization
this question might help iphone localization is it possible to translation nib files.

2339027
unsigned	short	int	chars
i figure that because an int is 2 bytes at the shortest 1 if you count chars so i should be able to store 4 unsigned int with a max value of 15 in a short int and i know i can access each one individually using and

2339070
unsigned	short
in c and for the sole purpose of saving space you can reinterpret the unsigned short as a structure with bitfields or use such structure without messing with reinterpretations

2339091
post	get
if you want to get all the approved post with their comments you can just do something like this

2339122
vb.net	vb6
10 things to avoid when moving from vb6 to vb.net

2339122
vb.net	vb6
moving from vb6 to vb.net windows forms

2339177
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
hey everyone i am new to iphone development and i m not understanding the whole uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller idea

2339219
touchescancelled	touchesended
override both touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent

2339291
onclick	onfocus
replacing the onclick event with onfocus solved the problem

2339307
hash	salt
state information is handled via php sessions while usernames salt hash passwords and user level are stored in a mysql back end

2339371
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil hey i m just quoting

integer	unsigned
255 is the largest numerical value that can be stored in a single-byte unsigned integer assuming 8-bit bytes - hence applications which store the length of a string for some purpose would prefer 255 over 256 because it means they only have to allocate 1 byte for the size variable

app is based on java 1.5 â jsf 1.2 with faclets seam jpa hibernate

2340916
google-chrome	firefox
this used to be easy - according to my then staff firefox had good standards support and the best tools - so get it right in firefox first then adapt to cope with everything else now its a lot less clear as ie8 has a very decent set of dev tools and is better behaved than its predecessors and google-chrome is now getting into the act - again with a good set of tools and extensions

2340916
google-chrome	firefox
my gut feeling is probably firefox google-chrome ie8 in that order - but i m not doing anywhere near enough css work to assert that that s right

2341239
getter	setter
getter and setter are not required in python they way they re required in java

2341239
getter	setter
first you have better introspection in python so you don t need getter and setter to help make dynamic bean objects

2341239
getter	setter
however you have the property decorator which will bundle getter and setter into an attribute-like construct

2341239
getter	setter
when necessary we can bundle getter and setter to appear as if there s a simple attribute

2341276
postgresql	mysql
i know this should work with mysql but you might want to double check for postgresql

2341464
getter	setter
i know objects are supposed to look after themselves and in an ideal world my object house would build itself but i am refactoring the build portion of this object only and i need a way to apply building algorithms dynamically and i hate opening up my objects with getter and setter just for the sake of the builder

coldbox	coldspring	coldbox	model-glue	coldspring	model-glue
that said once you get the basics of coldfusion down it s easy to transition into an object oriented approach as others have noted there are a plethora of mvc frameworks available fw 1 coldbox fusebox model-glue mach-ii lightfront and the list goes on... and there are also dependency management di ioc frameworks my favorite of which is coldspring modeled after java s spring framework and the ability to do aspect-oriented programming as well

2342236
getter	setter
the distinction is important because the setter and getter method usually don t just assign or get the value but rather retain the value

2342312

here what i have tried is to put the values in the object of class home into two textview and an imageview which may vary upon the value returned by variable item.type_text

2342368
google-chrome	firefox
also i get the same behaviour between google-chrome and firefox

2342400
accurev	cvs
we still use cvs for some projects and even it is so much better for normal operations and workflow that i d pick it over accurev

it also doesn t figure out whether there is a max page reached we always display a full range of 10

2342498
pop-up	dialog
start tcptrace and it ll pop-up a dialog and by default try to redirect traffic from port 8080 to port 80

2342504
accessor	properties
edit modified my misleading title -- i am hoping to find a solution that doesn t involve code generation or copy paste techniques and rather to be able to write the skeleton of the code once in a base class in some form and have it be instantiated into lots of subclasses as the accessor for various properties

2342527
super	extends
since this mixed list is consuming items of type a or b i applied bloch s pecs rule producer extends consumer super to determine that i need here

2342558
put	get
then to get them from javascript strings into images you d have to use data urls which don t work in ie6-ie7 and are limited to how much data you can put in them

2342618
pull	push
and the general advice seems to be to do a pull then a push

2342715

vsto	add-in
i have written a vsto add-in that needs to get the an appointment information from the exchange server

overall width height is much smaller

2342801
ciimage	nsimage
i m sorry i don t really know why your code doesn t work but approaching it a different way and i think more efficiently than your cvimagebuffer to ciimage to nsciimagerep to nsimage to nsdata albeit at a slightly lower level -

2342826
stdout	stderr
i have a program that writes information to stdout and stderr and i need to grep through what s coming to stderr while disregarding stdout

2342841
stdout	stderr
first redirect stderr to stdout â the pipe

2342841
stdout	stderr
then redirect stdout to dev null without changing where stderr is going

2342841
stdout	stderr
the operation makes file descriptor 2 aka stderr refer to the same open file description as file descriptor 1 aka stdout is currently referring to see dup2 and open

2342870
disk	ram
and look at the output you will see logical reads and physical reads logical reads are from ram physical reads are from disk

2342918
hide	show
add next back links that use js to hide the current image and show the next one

2342921
post	get
where page was the page part of the url params were any form parameters only get was supported not post which prevented file uploads and thus made burning the flash a pain udata is a token passed in that was set when you registered the function so you could have the same function serve multiple urls or ranges with different data and resp is a file handle that you write the http response headers and all out to

2342922
children	parent
the real life analogy is typically children inherit money from their parent but parent do not inherit money from their children

2342929
uiview	calayer
drawing in a view actually draws on its layer and likewise drawing in a calayer that backs a uiview will appear to draw to the view

2342970
filtering	grouping
on c# winforms project i have a small table a filtering box an add button and a done button grouping together and they all fit together within 250x250 pixels

2342974
put	get
i know it loads and executes tags when a page loads and that you can attach functions to various window events but where things get fuzzy is when for instance i retrieve a remote page via ajax and put its contents into a div

2342976
ddms	adb
if this is on the emulator use ddms file explorer or adb pull to download a copy of the database file and confirm its contents

2343021

i need to get all post via the wordpress loop but i need them to be grouped by category and cronological within each category

2343105
nhibernate	automapper
just to add this is an issue with the automapper as i am using fluent nhibernate to build the database

2343144
addition	multiplication
the only reason to use the log-likelihood instead of the plain old likelihood is mathematical convenience because it lets you turn multiplication into addition

2343162
ssl	https
pci dss section 4.1 for example requires encryption when transmitting over public open networks which you have covered with ssl and https at both ends

2343190
filtering	grouping
you need to use having for filtering grouping values

2343197
stdout	stderr
this api lets you specify a lot of startup options among which there is the possibility to redirect stdin stdout stderr but will only start executables

2343197
stdout	stderr
and it can t redirect stdin stdout stderr

2343197
stdout	stderr
iirc for gui applications stdout stdin stderr are just bit buckets they point to nothing useful and all io to them is discarded

2343197
stdout	stderr
the windows std streams are the ones that are redirected when you specify stdin stdout stderr redirection in createprocess

2343197
stdout	stderr
the crt stdin stdout stderr finally are yet another abstraction built by the c runtime library

2343217
hide	show
it works fine but i want to show and hide a div with rounded corners

2343251
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

unix	solaris
as an aside i know core dumps on solaris and i am guessing other unix flavors can be in elf format

2343334
pull	push
developers always push to the testing repository but only pull from the mainline so they only ever pull in tested code

2343334

2343474
for-loop	loops
in the for-loop have a string for the table row and append that to the big string on each loops

2343474
mouseover	mouseout
you have to handle the mouseover and mouseout events at the table level and find the tr or td tag that was the source of the event and do any behavior at this point

2343489
superclass	subclassing
i don t think it s possible to simply cast an object of subclassing into superclass and then serialize it

2343493
sorting	filtering
i have a page with a datatable with sorting and filtering functionalities both taking place in the db

2343493

2343585
dlsym	dlopen
it is also possible to load the library s weak symbols using dlopen and dlsym and pass the call on if necessary

2343607
inherited	properties
if you just want to use different properties that are declared in different master pages the you can take nick craver and nathan taylor s advice and declare a base class that would have all those fields properties and have all your master pages inherited from that base class and then have your mastertype directive specify that base class via typename attribute

2343609

when the linearlayout is show i want to detect if the user clicks anywhere outside of the panel so that i can hide it again

i already used selectedvalue selecteditem selectedindex but they all return the string representation of my object

i m trying to find an algorithm to add or subtract days to a date where day starts from 1 and month starts from 1

2344357
min	max
the array operators call valueforkeypath on the contentarray which gives an array built by calling the same valueforkeypath on each member of the array with the key path to the right of the array operator min and max

2344357
min	max
you could easily define a category on nsarray to give you back a struct of min max values

2344365
subtract	add
once the date is expressed as a number of days it s trivial to add or subtract to it

2344391

2344424
hide	show
i want a conditional that asks if the div newsinfo also has the class jopen then show else hide

uploadify	swfupload
in my opinion uploadify easier to implement than swfupload and it is very customizable

paperclip	attachment-fu
and you need some file attachment plugin on back-end like paperclip or attachment-fu

in your for-loop add a print the_file before the call to re.compile it is no problem that you are re-using a name as loops iterator that referred to file object before so you can see which strings are actually coming from the filelist

2344699
min	max
i tried to set the tick style to tsmanual the min and max position to 1 and 100 respectively and add ticks at 9 19 79 and 89 and no ticks are shown at all except the detault first and last which the control automatically shows

2344760
inherited	properties
the issue is that when databinding against interfaces that inherited from one another you can not see the properties on the base interfaces

under linux unix bsd os x posix etc. you can use opendir readdir to go through the directory structure

2344830

if you are using an executor framework to which you pass a runnable object its threads probably have their own catch block that prevent exceptions from reaching the uncaughtexceptionhandler

2344832
accessor	properties
also with the newer collection classes the count properties is not virtual which means that the jitter can inline the call to the count accessor which makes it practically the same as accessing a field

put	get
that sprite doesn t get any alpha and is put above the backing 1 therefore apearing not to be transparent

2344865

jboss	glassfish
if you want java ee 6 then the choice appears to be either glassfish 3 or the beta of jboss 6

2345126
inherited	properties
if that added functionality isn t available to you then you could certainly try to enumerate all your program s open handles and set all their inherited properties with sethandleinformation but that seems to be beyond the scope of a function whose job is to create child processes

2345145
put	get
if i put a debuger from starting line one of this code and step through i dont get anything

2345155
firefox	safari

2345483
post	get
there s no difference for post or get unless you re setting the content encoding to multipart form-data instead of usually the default application x-www-form-urlencoded

outputstream	inputstream
there are no easy ways to do it because inputstream has a pull-style interface when outputstream has a push-style one

free	memcpy
since you say or something else in the q s title -- if you choose to use ctypes you can represent a with c_void_p one of ctypes fundamental data types and access functions such as free and memcpy from the c runtime library as long as the latter s available as a dll .so dynamic library but that s true pretty widely these days

2348658
int	chars
in a c programming exercise i am asked to convert an int to chars without using the c library

2348669
division	modulo
here is integer division and is integer modulo

2348723
elementname	datagrid
lets assume in my customerordersviewmodel my observablecollection customers is bound to the view via ... binding customers and when the customer is changed from the user the relating orders are shown in the datagrid via itemssource binding selecteditem.orders elementname comboboxcustomer

2348723
accessor	properties
but i cannot raise a collectionchanged propertychanged event like before with the customers now on the orders because the orders properties is not bound to the view via public accessor

2348734
freebsd	linux
select 2 or even better epoll 4 on linux or kqueue 2 on freebsd and mac are very convenient frameworks for handling io on multiple sockets

2348753
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
however one option is typically to take advantage of inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged and track these yourself in the viewmodel

2348782
next	except
loop read calls to get a fixed number of bytes and search the n character then return a part of the string untill n and stores the rest except n to prepend to the next character file chunk

2348847
listadapter	listactivity
listadapter has a method called getview that the listactivity will use when it is drawing itself

2348868

2348967
put	get
i have asked similar questions before but i think i put it broadly and did not get answers i was looking for

2348967
cpu	processors
every cpu has peak performance depending on number of instructions processors can execute per second

2348967
multiplying	add
for example modern 2 ghz intel cpu can achieve 8 billion double precision add multiplying a second resulting in 8 gflops peak performance

2348985
mp3	wav
what sort of audio object should it support and should it bark in mp3 or wav etc

2349002

i have several rectangular images in landscape and portrait mode and want to draw them onto a transparent square image so that all images became the same size without cropping them

2349023
udp	tcp
i posted an answer to that question and provided some numbers from my own testing of udp versus tcp

2349035

the relevant glyph information width height buffer is stored in the following struct

2349106
awt	swing
addendum 2 see painting in awt and swing paint vs

2349117
int	chars
q2a calculating does not concatenate two strings because the left hand side is int not a string but instead adds the numeric value to a pointer the memory address of the first chars of the string

2349150
spaces	linefeed
matches a spaces tab carriage return and linefeed

2349154
mouse	keyboard
however there has been one useful addition inputbinding.command and inputbinding.commandparameter are now bindable dependency properties which makes it much easier to handle keyboard and mouse events

2349187
xsl-fo	xslt
if you still want to write xslt by hand take a look at xsl-fo tutorial from xml 1.1 bible

2349192
dlsym	dlopen
programmatically that d dlopen and dlsym

2349239
opera	firefox
all major browsers i ve checked ie firefox and opera completely ignore the rfc specification in this part

2349257
width	height
glyph- buffer does not point to an array of glyph- width glyth- height bytes

2349277
awt	swing
overriding the update ... method is an old awt trick and should never be used with swing

2349291
post	get
do one query per post to count how many comments it has yes those can be merged into only one to get the number for all post at once

2349447
width	height

2349471
git-rebase	amend
this happens when you amend a commit the tip of a branch or during a git-rebase or apply a patch that includes a â œfrom â header that is different from your configured identity

2349474
getter	setter
whether it is a propertyinfo or the methodinfo that reflects the setter or getter is immaterial

2349480
yacc	bison
if you want to stick to c roots try lex yacc or bison

2349484
getter	setter
the key doesn t have to be a database id it can be a guid that is new ed up when the object is instantiated and does not get changed for the entire lifecycle of the object it is a property that has a getter but no setter - as it is a property it will persist across service boundaries so your object will still be identifiable

2349513
accessor	properties
note that you must do the copy yourself when bypassing properties accessor and that you are copy ing the array on behalf of the copy.

2349515
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
you can use any aggregate-functions on dose max min avg sum etc.

2349523
width	height
might make it easier than your width 0|| width 170|| height 0|| height 200

2349550
hash	md5
how does this apply to md5 sha1 sha2 hash

2349572
x86	mips
this could include a emulator for a 68000 or mips which are arguably nicer assembly instruction sets than the venerable cisc instruction set of the intel x86 16 32-bit

2349572
yacc	bison
yacc yet another compiler compiler or bison from gnu is a tool designed to make writing a compiler or translator parser easier

2349584
hash	md5
you ll see people refer to md5 as a broken hashing algorithm when in reality it s just a poor one to use as a cryptographic hash

2349632
google-chrome	firefox
my website www.zerozaku.com is compatible with google-chrome and firefox but ie has an issue with my mini-chat overflowing out of the box

2349632
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it on ie8 firefox google-chrome

2349659
comparator	comparable
finally you can also implement your tab to be comparable or define a separate comparator for it and make tablist an ordered collection

2349715
postgresql	mysql
it seems to me that postgresql and mysql are a bit abandoned

2349741
put	get
you see if the user is found in db username and password are valid then the user will be put in session scope logged in and the servlet will redirect to some main page this example goes to else it will set an error message and forward the request back to the same jsp page so that the message get displayed by

2349741
equals	compareto
that said i am not sure if it is just playing around and shooting in the dark but the code which you posted doesn t look good such as using compareto instead of equals and digging in the parameternames instead of just using getparameter and the id and password seems to be declared as servlet instance variables mdash

2349747
int	chars
however i cannot get to cast it into anything useful get back the original int chars and for what i understood it could be because i am in a 64-bit system and the size of a pointer to void is different from the size of a pointer to int the program is supposed to be used in both 64 and 32 bit systems

2349757
textview	simplecursoradapter
the layout used by simplecursoradapter contains 2 textview which hold database data one hidden - which contains the database record _id and one displayed

2349774
multiplying	modulo
as we are working modulo 2n we must also deal with the tricky case where both factors are non-zero but multiplying to give 0 mod 2n

2349777
int	chars
the size of pointers on one system is always the same - independently of them pointing to int chars or void

2349792
subtract	add
yes the iterators for std vector are random access iterators so you add subtract integral values to get other valid iterators

2349820
rjava	jri
in a sense jri is the inverse of rjava

2349829
jhat	yourkit
you can analyze it with jhat comes with the jdk a bit difficult to use or some third party profilers my preference is yourkit - it s commercial but they have time-limited eval licenses

2349847
persistent	transient
memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data

2349895
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my application has a uitabbarcontroller at the root and uinavigationcontroller items for each tab bar item

2349921
post	get
but if the same action is requested with the get verb ie without a post body the other method will be executed

2349955
post	get
if you take a look at this post over here you might get some ideas on how listeners can work if you post the addmouselistener source we can help with your specific question of course

2349980
tcplistener	tcpclient
id suggest looking into the tcplistener and tcpclient class instead of playing around with sockets

2349981
facade	memento
many design patterns dps for short_ can help you re-factor your code to whittle down the large untestable unmaintainable fat class to a nice package of cooperating classes which can be used through facade dps for simplicity consider for example state strategy memento proxy

2350040
int	chars
if you want cin to behave more robustly read into string s instead of int s and manually verify that they contain only numeric chars

2350129
getter	setter
one thing i have been reading about is the use of getter and setter

2350203
lxml	beautifulsoup
you should be using a html parser such as beautifulsoup or lxml instead

2350270
httphandler	httpmodule
if you re developing using the local asp.net webdev server you must remove some of the httphandler and httpmodule and then add them back to the section

2350301
stdout	stderr
another trick you might try is to re-direct stderr to stdout in your command so that your program only has to read the stdout

2350314
vim	emacs
emacs and vim give you lots of functionality with a bit coarser interface

2350320
google-chrome	firefox
in terms of specific utilities i think having a good browser plugin like firebug firefox or the built-in developer console in google-chrome are really handy for seeing whats going in the specific html or javascript

2350342
pull	push
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

2350351
free	malloc
remember to free the points if you choose the malloc way

2350354
getter	setter
don t just add getter and setter to everything without purpose

2350354
getter	setter
getter setter on everything simply means that you ll have a universally inefficient implementation

2350354
getter	setter
setter getter are gatekeepers

2350354
getter	setter
many ex-java coders i ve worked with put setter getter on attributes unnecessarily every attribute

2350354
getter	setter
the total impact of getter setter is minimal in a high-level design

2350402
wordpress	joomla
imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
ease of deployment how easy is it to get up and running on windows xp 7 server 2003+ linux centos 5.2 ubuntu ubuntu server 8.04+ and os x 10.5+

2350450
padding	overlapping
and failing either of those i d start looking at any other styles that would be overlapping not necessarily being inherited just affecting the visual space on hover like padding and margins and background colors of containing elements

2350554
opera	firefox
works fine in firefox opera etc

2350578
width	height
i have a wrapper div with a height of 600px and a width of 900px

2350578
opera	safari
the thing is that opera v 10.01 and safari v

2350602
jboss	weblogic
only if your customer really mean web-application instead of console based application you need to ask if server has web-application server for java - usually it s something like apache tomcat jetty jboss weblogic etc

2350616
hide	show
if the final goal is to use them as the source of an img tag then you could do absolutely nothing to hide them as tools such as firebug will show directly all the http requests that the browser performs so it s not even necessary to look at the source of the html page to obtain the image paths

2350636
jobs	cron
cron jobs are easily done from cpanel. p.s

2350653
width	height
remember area of a triangle is width height 0.5 - you ll need to calculate the height of non-right-angled triangles.

2350670
uiview	subviews
use a subclass of uiview as your controller s view that can load and display either of your views as subviews

2350726

you try making field_name a property and do whatever in getter or setter

2350737
puts	gets
i want to make one thread that puts values to a queue when it gets empty and wait for this condition while it is not

2350753
width	height
floating works when the combined image widths don t overlap the width of the browser window but when i set the image style height to 100 they don t float left they stack up over each other

2350754
hide	show
i just want to hide show some columns at runtime of the grid in treeview.

2350788
lisp	scheme
by lisp i mean the most common dialects like common lisp and scheme

2350815
hex	binary
we know the decimal 65 hex 41 binary 0100 0001 and the ascii character a all have the same binary representation so to tell which we are using we have a series of deliminators - numbers preceded by

2350832

2350900
hide	show
the view hide show but without any animation

2350919
integer	unsigned
constants that are too large for long long as in this case are given type unsigned long long which is why you get the warning integer constant is so large that it is unsigned

2350946
min	max
calculate the birth dates corresponding to the min and max ages

2350959
ecdsa	rsa
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor

2351014
hide	show
you can then hide the container add the points get the getboundszoomlevel show it again and it should work fine

2351020
haskell	scheme
to answer your question fully haskell and scheme are two examples of languages that do not have standard for loops built in

2351029
inherited	properties
any properties overridden in copied.css will win otherwise properties from original.css are inherited

2351072
inherited	properties
snapstodevicepixels properties is inherited through the element tree

2351076
filtering	grouping
the issue i am facing is when i am trying to create a grouping result object based on filtering that are applied to jobs

2351093
pull	push
often you ll only have a single other clone to push pull from

2351093
pull	push
then foo-clone will have as its default push pull path

2351093
pull	push
you can then use hg pull alice to get her changes or hg push experiment to push to your own local experimental clone

2351093
pull	push
these are just shortcuts you can always push pull using an explicit url

2351126
ubuntu	linux
i am invisaging a similar user experiance to how an end user may update an application in a linux distrubution the update manager in ubuntu

2351145

there is no windows equivalent of ubuntu debian s apt repositories or third party repositories

2351213
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
supports all major web browsers internet explorer 6+ firefox 1.5+ safari 2+ opera 9+

2351213
google-chrome	safari
sicne they support safari though you should have very few if any issues in google-chrome

2351220
stateless	stateful
i am going through the java ee 6 tutorial and i am trying to understand the difference between stateless and stateful session beans

2351226
hide	show
just add a few calls to hide show your load screen div whatever

2351233
stateless	stateful
stateless and stateful in this context don t mean quite what you might expect

2351233
stateless	stateful
global variables inside a session bean stateless or stateful are something else entirely

2351233
stateless	stateful
stateful session beans will have a pool of beans created since a bean can only be used in one conversation at a time whereas stateless sesion beans will often only have one instance which will make the global variable works but i don t think this is necessarily guaranteed

2351247
lisp	scheme
this just refers to the common lisp and scheme standards because particular implementations have added a lot of these features independently

2351248
hide	show
now you modify your viewmodel when you want to hide or show an item in the tree

2351273
fgets	strlen
read the number in a char array a with scanf s a or better with fgets and output the char array reversed by outputting each character starting from strlen a - 1 to 0

google-chrome	firefox
all vars are ok and works perfectly in firefox google-chrome

2351305
for-loop	loops
using the for-loop can loops

2351327
ironruby	ironpython
i have embedded an ironpython scripting host into a simple c# application but now i need to know the best practices for locking down security on a user generated ironpython or ironruby script

2351341
mouse	keyboard
so that you could change the step size without actually moving the mouse or the keyboard focus from one spinner to another

2351359
hash	md5
if performance isn t important simply take a secure hash such as md5 or sha1 and truncate its output to 32 bits

2351372
getter	setter
when you synthesize your word property the setter and getter methods are generated behind the scenes so there are already functions for and you can read about this in the objective-c primer or the programming language documentation

2351372
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is possible because nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring

2351401
webrat	cucumber
i used following step-definition with cucumber and webrat and everything worked fine

2351443
boost	stl
however i prefer to use boost bind and bind a function to the stl algorithms instead -- usually although not in cases where the object has a state that seems a more elegant solution

2351477
public	protected
stuff such as autoloading which i wrote about a couple of paragraph earlier didn t exists in php 4 -- same for public private protected and lots of other oo-related things...

2351547
hide	show
i am using the follwoing jquery to show hide an other title field on page

2351571
button	checkbox
fragments of the page are annotated with the class name toggleonswitch and another class that tells what checkbox or radio button determines visibility

2351624
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however i looked at the developer tools of safari and google-chrome under windows and firebug in firefox and all three rendered the dom incorrectly

2351686
width	margin
jquery s .width allows you to do things like get the width of an image and .css can be used to modify the css of an element including width margin and padding

2351715
lisp	smalltalk
the idea of encapsulating a function as an object dates back to lisp and smalltalk

2351721
turbogears	toscawidgets
in the toscawidgets library used by turbogears you can do the following

2351783
mouseup	mousedown
there may be differences like whether it appears on mousedown or on mouseup or even on the mac on ctrl +click of the single mouse button

2351783
mouse	keyboard
you should therefore not handle mouse and keyboard events directly but handle the wxcontextmenuevent instead

2351783
mouse	keyboard
note that it will be called after both mouse and keyboard events

2351786
dlsym	dlopen
if however i modify the main application to not link against testc and testd but instead load them at runtime using dlopen dlsym then the dynamic_cast fails

2351832
pylons	turbogears	web.py	turbogears	web.py	pylons	django	web.py	django	turbogears
don t dev web code by hands use turbogears pylons web.py or django

see c# converting list int to list double

2351953
simpleadapter	convertview
i am currently extending simpleadapter and overriding getview int position view convertview viewgroup parent

2351984
jstl	taglib
if you re not using jstl at the moment then there s a learning curve involved - you ll need to set up the taglib import it at then use it

2352003
textwrangler	bbedit
you can use a tool like bbedit or its free sibling textwrangler to fix this problem

2352021
google-chrome	firefox
so appears small box when i click it in firefox or google-chrome - alert box appears

2352084
onmouseover	onclick
i think this is because inline onclick onmouseover etc

2352141
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
other browsers such as firefox google-chrome opera konqueror or links didn t have such issues

2352152
put	get	post	put	post	get
this can be very helpful if you decide that you want to serve restful urls after all and can be made to work with http request modes get post put delete head

2352155
copying	overwrite
it s much easier and safer to use revision control software instead of copying files to usb drive and back since it s easy to overwrite some changes that way

2352177
profiling	benchmarking
in general what comes to optimization first make it work only then benchmarking to see if it needs to be made faster and if so profiling to find out where the bottle neck is

2352219
namedtuple	dictionary
make a class possibly one made by namedtuple if you have something that should have accessible attributes and use notation to get an item from a dictionary

2352315
udp	tcp
tcp and udp connection tables

2352352
tunnel	packets
thus if you tunnel all your ssh traffic through netcat you reset the tos of the tcp packets to the default ones

2352352
tunnel	packets
so each time you try to ssh to example.com netcat will be called and will tunnel the packets

2352357
client-side	server-side
i would recommending learning the distinction between server-side tags and client-side tags because while similar in syntax they can have very different results for example self-closing script tags in browsers typically don t work when using third-party libraries

2352359
subtract	add
if it s a fairly small range -5.0 to +5.0 then it will be quicker to repeatedly add subtract 1.0 until you get within range rather than calling expensive functions such as floor

2352387
setinterval	settimeout
to process the links one by one instead of a bunch of simulaneous requests you could capture the nodes in an array makearray and pop one at a time at a specific rate settimeout setinterval

2352405
webkit	gecko
if you want to view online content you might be better off using gtkmozembed gecko or webkitgtk+ webkit

2352525
firefox	safari
i am developing an annual report site which needs to be compatible with major browsers such as ie firefox and safari at least

2352538
serializable	deserialization
as a more direct response to your question i d recommend not trying to do text parsing on your own but instead have classes that mean something to your domain that you can then use the json serializable deserialization logic that comes w the framework

2352553
width	height
you can fix this by setting the height and width on #container ul

2352615
put	get
4 stick with ugly schemas and put xs any within an optional extensions element - it nests it for no good reason other than the official .net framework doesn t get confused but it works

2352620
integer	unsigned
the last number there is too large to be represented as a signed 32-bit integer and so you need to tell the compiler that it s an unsigned integer by suffixing it with u as

2352680
getter	setter
your example interface has no behavior whatsoever beyond getter setter

2352689
children	parent
i have a function which gets the ids of all children of a parent from my db

2352691
collabnet	svn
for collabnet svn this is not necessary

2352721
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
i ve heard of some other options lighttpd nginx etc. and was wondering what benefit using these would provide over using apache

2352738
collabnet	svn
i highly recommend collabnet svn use the apache option in the install and tortoisesvn as a nice gui client

2352740
post	get
it seems that the simple way to move the values is to use get whereas formmail uses post

2352777
cos	sin
note of warning you can change the rounding mode used here by directly tweaking registers on the cpu but don t do that you ll break a lot of stuff including msvc s implementation of sin and cos

2352780
nginx	lighttpd
lighttpd and nginx are really fast but i would only use them for static content

2352780
nginx	lighttpd
as a fellow php developer i really recomend zend server for dinamic content and either lighttpd or nginx for static content

2352784
collabnet	svn
however svn protocol is much faster so i suggest using collabnet svn for performance reasons

2352824
centos	linux
i look at the code and did two things to work on my centos 5 linux dev box with tomcat5

2352863
width	height

width	height
w h width height of destination

2352863
width	height
w h width height of source

2352895

in an openmp parallel for-loop i can declare a statically allocated arrays as private

2352935
squash	merge	squash	branch
currently what i do is to do all cherry-picking on branch x and then do a squash merge into new branch y

2352972
int	double
you might want to change the types depending on whether you really need floats i.e a long int might do for some of these or a double if you need more precision

2352972
mpfr	mpir
if you need arbitrary precision look up mpfr mpir

2352993
inherited	subclassing
use inherited if the models are related to each other a shared parent class that contains the methods or one subclassing the other that contains the methods

2353008
memcached	apc
i m writing a wrapper for three caching mechanisms so that they can be used in a somewhat normalized manner filesystem memcached and apc

nginx	lighttpd
ideal for this is using an lightweight proxying server in front of your appserver like a nginx or lighttpd

2353161
free	malloc
a segfault within free or malloc usually means that you ve corrupted the heap somehow either by freeing something more than once or freeing something that was never allocated

2353161
free	malloc
the memory for those members ignoring any memory they might dynamically allocate internally was not allocated by a separate call to malloc new and so when you free them you mess up the heap

2353162
gtk	cairo
gtk uses cairo graphics library to draw widgets and theoretically it would be enough to set transformation matrix inside cairo.

2353175
folder	directory
what i m looking for is a way to automate this graphic creation within access so a jpeg of a certain size is created and dumped in a folder containing text that s been sized to fit from a couple of fields within the db standard text and a graphic which may be a football or a rugby ball but will be optimised and stored in a directory

2353190
memcached	apc
and we are using apc + memcached as caching systems

2353190
memcached	apc
there are two three main differences between apc and memcached when it comes to caching data

2353190
memcached	apc
apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved

2353218
for-loop	arrays
foreach can just as easily be used in multi-dimensional arrays the same way you would use a for-loop

2353233
children	parent
or can user control inherit from another user control and web server controls of parent user control be carried to its children without worrying the layout

next	except
somewhat informally by executing ++x the next command is skip which has no effect and the variables in the store are unchanged except for x which now has the value that it originally had plus one

2353309
hex	binary
things i feel i understand alright include the stack interrupts binary hex and in general what most of the basic operations do jmp push mov etc

postgresql	mysql
i don t have a mysql database so i can t say if it works for sure but it does in postgresql

2353496
calloc	malloc

i agree with mike that this is the standard way to do this but to mitigate the confusion of having to cast your provider each time you could create a base controller that all of your controllers inherited from and have a protected properties with a getter that casts it once

2353602
int	boolean
create function fifty_two_cards_deck deck int returns boolean

2353615

2353935
ready	each
have a development branch create a new release branch each time development is ready for the next deployment to production

2353957

firefox	safari
if you use silverlight you can code c# and it will work on mac safari and mac firefox

2356187

multiplying	add
normalize vector v into a unit vector and then just multiplying it with the distance d you want and finally add the resulting vector to point a

2356859
internationalization	translation
last but not least if you want to target international audiences take into account of internationalization of the error messages - hence that s why to keep it neutral because then it will be easier to translation avoid synonyms slang words etc which would make the translation meaningless - for example fiat ford the motor car company was selling their brand fiat ford pinto but noticed no sales was happening in south america it turned out pinto was a slang there for small penis and hence no sales.

since the calling app is essentially submission to a queue so that the process i ve written can process it i can have the web service just submit the item to the database or an msmq or another queue and then return success

2356901
width	height
so i d like the yellow blocks to be of equal height without giving table row cell div a fixed width relative is fine

2356965
put	get
i suspect if i can get a hold of the implementation of icache at runtime all i would need to do is call the put method to stick my data into the cache

rather than using css just resize the image using jquery s width and height methods on the image element

2357439
tostring	gethashcode
a fully generic implementation generally wonn t have the information needed to compare two objects - unless you want to sort them on gethashcode or tostring which is quite an odd thing to do

2357455
ssl	https
with the last set of rules traffic to except secure.php the url rewrites to https turns blue ssl for a second and disappears no ssl but the url is still https

2357489
google-chrome	safari
to start with you might also want to use -webkit-border-top-left-radius 5px and -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius 5px to get that same effect with google-chrome and safari

2357547
pop-up	dialog
but it pop-up the sas odbc configuration dialog sets the datasource name and waits for the user to enter the information and dismiss the dialog

2357592
accessor	properties
properties are not handled automatically. the closest that comes to being true is that synthesized accessor handle their memory management responsibilities properly

2357598
post	put
i have put up a post on my blog about them there are plenty of resources elsewhere too

2357675
accessor	properties
when you declare a properties and synthesize it all you get is the accessor there is no special automatic behaviour in dealloc

2357676
mouseleave	mouseenter
i know how to use the mouseenter and mouseleave to detect if the mouse has entered the sl box or left it

2357689
decoder	encoder
note the 1 million annual fee for a decoder encoder that runs on a non-windows os

2357720
int	chars
i ve always been taught that if an int is larger than a chars you must solve the byte ordering problem

2357795
subtract	add
i need to be able to add subtract and display the data in feet and inches and using conversion methods just gets messy

2357801
free	malloc
preferring new delete vs malloc and free which is obvious but his reasonining was very well stated

2357807
onresume	onpause
if b becomes the foreground activity hiding a onpause will be called for a and when a becomes the foreground activity again because you pressed the back button onresume will be called not onstart unless a was deleted because of a low memory situation

2357811
free	malloc
using new delete instead of malloc free and oop was all new back in 1991

2357858
gif	ico
off the top of my head image vnd.microsoft.icon will work only if the image actually is a real ico file while image x-icon is less fussy and will also work for bitmaps and gif images

2357930
pygtk	pygobject
i want to do this in a pygtk app so i tried using pygobject s gio.filemonitor but no dice

2357998
cos	sin
if you define x sin y + i cos y cos y i will be the real part of x i

2358002
cos	sin
knowing that cos i+1 y cos i y+y cos i y cos y -sin i y sin y can help if you precompute cos y and sin y and keep track of both cos i y and sin i y along the way

2358008
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
ended up accessing raw sql via mysqlconnection mysqlcommand mysqldatareader

2358010
firefox	safari
99 of the time this process seems to function properly in firefox and safari but in ie8 the process fails

2358056
ostringstream	std
in some places i use std ostringstream a lot since it is very convenient for my purposes

2358056
free	malloc
however i just discovered that the performance hit is extreme since adding data to the stream results in a lot of calls to malloc and free

2358059
folder	directory
should this directory be placed in webapps folder in tomcat container

2358092
post	get
no further communication or feedback is presented to the server which is where your asp.net webforms code runs without the browser contacting the server via a get or post form submission link ajax

2358093
jlabel	jprogressbar
splashscreen s constructor adds a jlabel and jprogressbar to itself packs and sets visible

2358095
email	dkim
now i have a requirement to sign outbound email using dominkeys dkim but i m not sure how to do it

2358159
getter	setter
i believe this error stems from the fact that i am trying to call getter setter from the name object when the person object is not yet instantiated

2358204
rss	feed
i have noticed that in google web reader that lets us read rss feed on the web the page does not seem to load all the feed

2358288
chunked	transfer-encoding
set the transfer-encoding header to chunked then output the size of each chunk before sending it

2358297
width	height
2 you need to tell the media sample that the sample is now height x width instead of width x height

2358304
swt	swing
as for speeding up the edit-compile-debug cycle i normally prototype my work in small swt swing applications before integrating them into the full product but this might not work in a lot of cases

2358344
nsurl	nsstring
i want to check if an nsstring is a valid url so i can parse it to an nsurl variable.

2358345
post	get
so if i post data to it with the output 2 the page should echo 10 and i would like to have a variable to get the file contents of when it says 10

2358355
for-loop	loops
type fore ctrl-space to insert the for-loop since eclipse usually chooses the closest iterable when constructing loops

2358375
width	height
so it looks like the fontsize is the height and the width can only be determined without knowing the actual character on monospaced fonts since proportional fonts have varying widths

2358433
google-chrome	firefox
and google-chrome didn t have a problem with this but everything else firefox and ie8 did

2358478
many-to-many	one-to-many
your business rules might only state one-to-many but in reality people companies can be a many-to-many relationship

2358542
google-chrome	firefox
the element is there because if i adjust the sizes it adjusts accordingly but it won t display images in firefox or google-chrome

2358574
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have tested it with internet explorer 8.0 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4.0 opera 10.10 both within html and xhtml

2358584
width	height
borders actually affect the height width of elements on a page

2358586
width	height
you could leave small and extra-small out and use the width and height attributes of the html img tag

2358592
width	height
you must adjust the padding margins or width height of the selected tab to compensate

2358611
width	height
let h and w be width and height of your buffer

2358658
versioning	upgrade
mercurial is a modern open source distributed versioning control system and a compelling upgrade from older systems like subversion

2358699
mvp	presenter
personally the way i have solved issues like this is allowing my mvp pattern to have hybrid view presenter that can access many views think ilistview ieditview however this would be more problematic to do if they re truly user controls since they half exist outside of the page to start with

2358712
typemock	nmock
i use nmock and didn t think it was up for the task - so i downloaded typemock as i ve done reading and heard that this was the best and that it could mock out even concrete classes non interface method calls.

2358717
implements	extends
also it has changed slightly since pre-java 5 as the javadoc says that extends and implements

2358723
typedef	struct
typedef struct

2358745
oncreate	ondestroy
coming from a ms windows background i kind of expected to find overridable oncreate and ondestroy methods or something similar but i haven t found anything of the sort in linearlayout or any of its inherited members

2358745
onresume	onpause
i make these calls from the activity s onresume and onpause methods respectively

2358749
google-chrome	safari
on safari and google-chrome i won t be able to see flush updates updating live on my page until after a certain number of flushes or sometimes it hangs altogether on safari

2358750
gtk	gdk
i just checked the gtk source code and you can call realize on a gtk window to make the gtk window create its corresponding gdk window

2358794
integer	unsigned
casting an integer type from signed to unsigned does not modify the bit pattern it merely changes the interpretation of the bit pattern

2358834
freetype	cairo	fontconfig	cairo	fontconfig	freetype
i m not sure why you re getting this error on just loading a library but we ve seen this issue on leopard due to apple s freetype fontconfig cairo libraries calling corefoundation calls

2358851
ready	each
for example let s say on page ready i do a for each on every row in a table and for a certain cell in each row i want to change the row color based on this cell exceeding a certain value

2358866
for-loop	arrays
while i was trying something special in for-loop i recognized that java doesn t seem to like putting an anonymous arrays right as the source for a for-each-loop

2358867
inherited	properties
do i need the inherited and implementation statements for courseprefix and icourse respectively if i m already supposedly exposing the properties of each within the listings wrapper class

2358901
onfocus	onblur
you could listen for the onfocus onblur events and keep track of page state that way

2358949
profiler	perf
after all is well and done i check pages in ie and use the built-in profiler in ie8 if there is some ie specific perf issue

2359055
subtraction	multiplication
if you precompute the constant 2 cos y then each value cos n+y can be computed from the previous 2 values with one single multiplication and one subtraction

2359088
maven	pom.xml
there is a versions plugin for maven which allows you to update your pom.xml to the latest greatest snapshots in visible repositories

2359127
jobs	cron
my issue is - all those email that get sent from localhost to mydom.com by php s function or possible by some cron jobs reporting some issues do not go to google s email servers but instead get picked up by localhost and it s mail server

2359154
google-chrome	firefox
also since it s an internal site i can add the site to the local intranet zone in ie not sure if that changes stuff for firefox and google-chrome

2359165
stdout	stderr
if you don t want to use raw_input or input you could log your output stdout stderr to a file or files

2359165
stdout	stderr
here s an example of redirecting stdout and stderr

2359201
accessor	properties	equals	gethashcode
you are probably thinking about this fxcop warning that you get when throwing notimplementedexception from special methods such as a properties getter event accessor equals gethashcode dispose etcetera

2359228
profiling	debugging
final update after some more intensive debugging and proformance profiling i ve come to the conclusion that between the fairly sizeable amounts of data and the incredibly bad performance of the asp.net treeview object i m gutting that in favor of a telerik grid control

2359243
folder	directory
i ve programed a plugin for an installer package i am planning to use.i ve used apple s package manager 2.4 tiger before where i could right click packages pkg navigate through the contents folder create a plugins directory and paste my plugin plus the installersections.plist file

2359260
cucumber	concordion
today i d include bdd frameworks jbehave cucumber concordion fitnesse... that all help create executable documents that describe what the system does in clear customer-level acceptance tests

2359303
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if you can t wait for that release or don t want to target that version of the framework the closest thing you will get is sortedlist or sorteddictionary neither of which allow for duplicate entries and both of which offer sorted behaviour you may find useful

2359326
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works absolutely fine in firefox safari google-chrome and ie8 but fails to appear in ie7

2359358
rss	feed
i am using a plugin that uses jquery to pull an rss feed and displays it after the content loads

2359384
rss	feed
you might also be able to use their wayback machine to pull up news articles from major site using their rss feed

2359450
rss	feed
you need a callback function on the rss feed plugin and apply the scoll bars plugin in it

2359450
rss	feed
if the rss feed plugin does not allow you to specify a callback function you ll need to edit the code to add one

2359469
width	margin
you need to give the ul margin 0 and padding 0 and the li a width 49 for example to leave some room for a margin-right

2359500
children	parent
therefore if a parent forks two children if they both have a file descriptor they didn t close it is now shared even if the parent subsequently closes it

2359548
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
you still need to carefully dispose of spsite and spweb instances in sharepoint 2010

2359555
cpu	processors
bcd exists in modern x86 cpu s since it was in the original 8086 processors and all x86 cpu s are 8086 compatible

2359572
put	get
you need to put the code to do this in your exception filter by the time you get to the exception handler much of the context information for the exception has been lost

2359605
wordpress	joomla
the proof of the pudding of this is that joomla wordpress phpbbs and many other of the well known open source php applications run straight out of the box on windows

2359637
updatepanel	scriptmanager
so i guess i really need to abandon scriptmanager and updatepanel altogether here

2359651
versioning	upgrade
be careful though -- ubuntu s update manager will happily upgrade this versioning of libodbc-ruby to the broken 0.9997-2

2359655
range	max	range	min	min	max
reason being gmaps reports the min max long as whatever is at the edge of the map but if you zoom out enough you can get a longitudinal range that excludes visible locations

2359655
min	max
the min max long are around -36.5625 to 170.15625

2359655
min	max
my code for finding the min max long is

2359655
min	max
off the top of my head i can only thing of a hack to check the zoom level and hardcode the min max lats to -180 180 if necessary which is definitely unacceptable

2359678
fflush	gets
but in general yes you should close better dispose via using so it gets shut down upon exception the stream when done otherwise you might not fflush some data to the underlying unmanaged destination

2359703
maven	pom.xml
just in case upgrading the snapshot version typically means that you are releasing some code and the maven release plugin provides support for that see the updating pom.xml versions

2359720
min	max
when reaching max value reset to min value return false

2359728
range	max
now an important property of unsigned integral types in c and c++ is that their values are always in the range 0 max where max for unsigned int is uint_max it s defined in limits.h

2359768
width	height
luckily the uitextfield can notify you whenever its text changes and luckily nsstring has methods under the uikit additions that let you get the height of the string given a certain width and luckily you can resize a uitextfield yourself

2359796
pop-up	dialog
i have my server generate and outputs csv file which the browser then pop-up a open save dialog

2359830
firefox	safari
here s my solution to the problem using mootools which works in firefox 3.6 safari 4.0.4 and internet explorer 7

2359842
google-chrome	safari
i am also at a loss as to how to solve this problem because i can t figure out how to use any of ie s debuggers if they even have one and seeing how i already tested this and made it work in two browsers technically three since safari runs off webkit just like google-chrome i just don t have the drive or capacity to imagine what could be going wrong

2359872
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven dependency in my pom.xml as such

2359882
goto	break
the end points of a break continue return goto return and throw are not reachable because all of those statements branch to another location and do not come back so that the code token immediately following them is not reachable

2359931
hash	salt
-client login details are stored as hash securely with their salt on a database stored locally on the server

2359951
firefox	safari
when i try to upload the pdf myself using firefox on os x or safari or ie 6 7 8 it works just fine

2359985
hash	salt
don t forget to hash and salt the passwords

2360021
google-chrome	firefox
i want it to do the same thing with firefox google-chrome

2360042
google-chrome	safari
it works in ie7 ie8 fx 3 safari and google-chrome so no need to handle cross-browser issues

2360095
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog box that pop-up browse to the repository you created

2360132
cvs	svn
subversion or svn is a version control system others are cvs git mercurial

2360154
put	get
they don t actually get the real model metadata the displaynameattribute to put together a more flexible localizable message

2360161
min	max
however the processor does have built-in max and min operators

2360185
objectdatasource	formview
you can use an objectdatasource to connect a method to a control but if this control is a formview you have all these problems to deal with and it simply doesn t work

2360209
slideup	slidedown
i have an interface that makes heavy use of the jquery slideup and slidedown effect to expand items in a tri-state kind of way

2360214
google-chrome	firefox
you need to change visual studio s default browser to firefox google-chrome

2360216
mouse	keyboard
instead of sendinput i would try sending keyboard or mouse messages directly to the child window

2360236
subtract	add
incidently you want to add 1 to strlen name not subtract 1

2360236
memcpy	strcpy
or if you want name stored in your record without a terminating null then you need to use memcpy to copy the string into your record not strcpy

2360256
mouseover	mouseout
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead

2360267
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on firefox safari google-chrome but not on ie

2360274
fgets	strcmp	fgets	atoi	atoi	strcmp
if that is indeed the case try not to use scanf use fgets to retrieve choice and use atoi to conver to int or strcmp to compare against 1 n etc.

2360316
integer	unsigned
if you do not require a specific value you can simply cast the object s address to unsigned long or other suitable integer type intptr_t would be optimal but it is a c99 feature that is not available in standard c++

2360320
ubuntu	debian
anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu

2360320
versioning	upgrade
upgrading via apt-get didn t get me to a high enough versioning so we instead use force to make the upgrade go through

2360320
versioning	upgrade
for me sudo port -d -f install expat pushed the upgrade through over-wrote the apt versioning and allowed me to progress

2360345
post	get
refresh isn t a postback there s no post happening it s another get it s the browser asking for the page all over again

2360374
emacs	textmate
there are some old posts out there about how to set up a pure python xcode project like this one but in the end you might be better off using an editor you re already familiar with like emacs or if you don t mind spending a little bit of money textmate all along with a free vcs like mercurial or git

2360404
button	checkbox
you probably want to call that when your value is changing in addition to when you click the checkbox ie whenever you click on your calculator button or on textboxt1.textchanged or whatever and only if your checkbox is checked

2360416
width	height
scale the image to x pixels in height maintain aspect for width

2360472
int	chars
if appends were safe you should get a file with 100 lines all of which roughly 10 000 chars long and beginning with an int

2360489
sequence	permutation
you can generate in pure xslt sequence of random numbers and also random permutation of the numbers in 1

2360495
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream just takes the inputstream in its constructor so clearly the task is implementing an inputstream concrete subclass that reads two files in sequence rather than just one as fileinputstream does

2360591
tinyint	boolean
make sure the users table has a tinyint 1 boolean column called show

2360619
opera	firefox
i changed your language check to use http_accept_language and to also not be case sensitive opera uses en-us where firefox and ie use en-us in my tests

2360631
memcpy	strcpy
the best way to copy char array into another char array is to use either memcpy strcpy or similar methods that accept pointers to src dest and size to be copied

2360640
setinterval	settimeout
side note try not to use eval this is what passing a string to settimeout or setinterval does pass a function or anonymous function instead like i have above

2360641
rss	feed
i m using pyrss2gen to generate a rss feed and i m trying to support pubsubhubbub but i need to add link elements that break rss

2360672
put	get
if you really wanted to get slick you put the database polling code in a backgroundworker thread so your gui never blanks out while you wait for a sql server connection

2360683
rubygems	bundler
i m using gem bundler v.0.9.6 and rails 2.3.5 rubygems 1.3.6 and ruby 1.8.7 on snow leopard

2360683
webrat	cucumber
however i started using cucumber and webrat in the selenium mode to test some ajaxy features of the site and whenever i was running the feature webrat was telling me that the rails server was started but i always got a xhr_error where selenium couldn t find the url

2360683
webrat	cucumber
i just want to be able to run cucumber and webrat + selenium successfully while using gem bundler but this is driving me nuts

2360689
hide	show
i d like to add some checkboxes not on each row just in a control panel besides the table to show hide groups of rows using javascript

2360693
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
according to w3 it s supported by all major browsers ie firefox opera google-chrome safari with the caveat that for first-child to work in ie a

2360742
vsto	add-in
each vsto add-in runs in its own appdomain with its own private app.config file

2360751
dateadd	datepart
the datepart millisecond is not supported by date function dateadd for data type date.

webclient	httpwebrequest
i m trying to use a .net class like webclient or httpwebrequest to do the same thing

2360832
webclient	httpwebrequest
with the webclient i get a 505 http version not supported error and with the httpwebrequest i get a 501 not implemented

2360833
tcpdf	fpdi
i have go tcpdf setup in my cake php install and am now trying to also use fpdi with it as i need to add a pdf to the start of the pdf that is being generated

2360833
tcpdf	fpdi
fpdi extends tcpdf

2360855
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
one reason you might not see it as often as you d think you would is that radix sort is not as general purpose as comparison based sorts quicksort mergesort heapsort

2360874
cvs	svn
it s not perfect you have to remember to add any new files but i thought i d mention it since it s non-obvious to we cvs svn refugees

2360892
easymock	jmock
such as easymock jmock

2360908
vbscript	jscript
if you haven t already read why vbscript and jscript custom actions suck

2360911
hash	md5
and just because it s a hash doesn t necessarily mean it s one-way well by definition it does but there are utilities to generate md5 plaintexts and i would guess it s only a matter of time before it happens to others

2360927
subtraction	addition
lagged fibonacci generators have a maximum period of 2 k - 1 2 m-1 if addition or subtraction is used and 2 k-1 if exclusive-or operations are used to combine the previous values

2360930
vmware	virtualbox
but you should be able to spin up a vm in about 2-5 min in virtualbox or vmware

2360946
cvs	svn
git svn cvs pvcs none vss

2360953
hide	show
something like that but i am unsure how to get the div that is currently show and hide it

2360957
post	get
here is the code for what i get from your post

2360962
globalization	localization
.net has some extremely rich localization and globalization capabilities

2361001
slideup	slidedown
the resolution appears to be just a small tweak to your slideup and slidedown traversals

2361021
hash	salt
edit adding salt is a good way to prevent being your hash from being reversed

2361086
put	get
exceptions get eaten by data bindings and result in the data binding being disabled i m not 100 sure this is the case here i m too lazy to put it into vs

2361110
setinterval	settimeout
when launching the settimeout also launch the function call using setinterval

2361117
implements	extends
if you want to subclass it then you have to implements all those methods which your are going to use so better write a category of nsmutablearray and extends the feature what you want and use the nsmutablearray object only

2361267
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

2361267
globalization	localization
asp.net globalization and localization

2361286
put	get
i know get and put methods are synchronized

2361286
put	get
then while getting one entry values we can put other entry values but we cant put or get at the same entry location

2361294
maven	pom.xml
and really haven t used it since - the pom.xml for the project i have doesn t have this anywhere in it - it has the absolute url where the maven repo is for the project but maven is still trying to download from the general maven repo

2361324
hide	show
here s an answer that involves a bit of mucking around using a panel and a strategy to hide and show the mdi application s main form s mdiclient object

2361324
hide	show
i m more comfortable with a strategy that hide and show the mdiclient object rather than one that removes it as a side effect of setting a property and which would then require you to re-add it to the controls collection of the main mdi form to use it again

2361329
maven	pom.xml
the default is to look in your local .m2 folder local repository and then any configured repositories in your pom.xml and then the central maven repository

2361358
opera	firefox
seems to be quite different in webkit compared to ie firefox opera

2361403
fseek	ftell
otherwise use fseek ftell function

2361409
translation	localization
i have also considered the printf function but that does not work for localization as the relative position of the placeholder can change depending on the translation

2361453
maven	pom.xml
when maven tries to build a project it will look in your local repository by default .m2 repository but you can configure it by changing the value in your .m2 settings.xml to find any dependency plugin or report defined in your pom.xml

2361462
implements	extends
the bruteforce way calculate the mouse click and see if it falls within the bars range or extends the bufferedimage class and have it implements mouselistener

2361464
x86	64bit
the man page for stat on my 64bit x86 machine says

2361476
hide	show
you could have a button somewhere that hide your own app momentarily and show it back when re-pressed and filters the new content

2361491
google-chrome	firefox
actually firefox ie 8 and google-chrome webkit renders image with parents height

2361545
g++	gcc
if you look closely the errors you get with compiling with gcc include everything you get with g++ plus extra errors

oncreate	setcontentview
this is probably the case because this does not refer to the activity or you re not assigning the view to the activity in oncreate you have to call setcontentview in oncreate

2361568
lisp	scheme
lisp taught in the course more specially scheme and i m already learning it

rsa	aes
as silky implies in his answer the way in which rsa is usually used to encrypt a document is in combination with a symmetric algorithm like aes

2361775
exponent	modulo
it contains the modulo and the exponent of the key

2361792
hash	md5
i would calculate a md5 hash of each file and compare the hash instead

2361792
hash	md5
in my testing if the files are usually equivalent then comparing md5 hash is about three times faster than comparing each byte of the file

2361792
hash	md5
example of calculating the md5 hash of two files now tested

2361811
webclient	httpwebrequest
following on skeet s hint it can be achieved by passing httpwebrequest to webclient by inheriting it

2361834
cos	sin
some sin cos stuff will probably also be needed - to determine where on the circle your menu points should be dynamically

2361842
inherited	properties
the good way might be to inherited the timer class and add the properties there.

2361922
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
a simple rule is that for every malloc or calloc there should be a free

2361953
std	ostream
it links a std string to a std ostream by providing a custom std streambuf

2361953
std	ostream
you still get the nice formatting of std ostream but you have full control over the memory management

2362040
post	put
put it in the post data then access it from or

2362047

presenter i admit - still haven t got idea of mvp completely

2362095
post	get
and yes i use same model for get post

2362099
width	height
had this problem too found that by giving the pictures i was displaying a width nn px and height nn px solved my problem

2362122
jlist	jtable
for a specific screen i m looking for a jlist that i could filter the same way you can filter a jtable using a rowfilter

it reads the config files parses partial rss feed takes links and then scrapes those links formulating in the end a rss 2.0 xml file

2362155
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	feedparser	feedparser	beautifulsoup
i utilize lxml beautifulsoup and feedparser

2362156

i have also tried with a iequalitycomparer and overrided equals and gethashcode to check on webservicecategory.id but it does not work either

2362163
postgresql	mysql
i was migrating mysql database to postgresql and stumbled across the following block in ddl note this is what i got from mysqldump

2362182
jvisualvm	jprofiler
i would suggest using something like jprofiler jvisualvm jconsole or something similar

2362199
jlist	jtable
you could consider using a single column jtable instead of a jlist

2362199
sorting	filtering
if you follow this approach you ll get filtering and sorting for free providing you re using jdk 6

2362209
jlist	jtable	sorting	filtering
imho glazedlists should do filtering as well as sorting for jtable jlist and jcombobox

2362246
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
there will soon be a new release including google-chrome safari and opera as well

2362255
folder	directory
the idea is fairly simple find files in a certain folder older than 7 days tar gzip them to another directory and remove them

2362314
post	get
i recommend to read a post about various methods to get random row from table

2362452
put	get
i cannot seem to put anything in the url like a querystring off the link to get to the page so i tried a meta tag as they can add this in the settings of the page tab in dnn

2362520
iequalitycomparer	iqueryable
i think its an iqueryable object and iequalitycomparer s wont work for this object

2362531
post	get
get means posted argument are showed in the url and post means they are sent but not shown in the url

2362531
post	get
i understand what get and post method is

2362531
post	get
what i wanna know is why do we get post why don t we call it type1 type2 or another more make-sense name like on-url off-url

2362538
post	get
the definitive guide to get vs post

2362538
post	get
get and post

2362541
packets	multicast
i want to capture the udp packets by joining to the multicast group

2362548
post	get
but essentially get is used to retrieve a resource and post is used to create a new one or make a change to a resource

2362552
post	get
so get should be used to read a resource whereas post should be used to create update or delete a resource

2362562
post	get
get and post are called http verbs

2362588
daemons	launchd
for a java application you may copy your compile classes through ftp and use a daemons that scan files in a directory and launchd them in debug may be parsing the manifest of the jar

2362600
udp	tcp
first i ll just paraphrase stevens from unix network programming section 22.4 when to use udp instead of tcp

2362600
udp	tcp
udp should not be used for bulk data transfer file transfers since you would have to build in all the functionality arleady in tcp to make it work right

2362611
bash	zsh
if you have the luxury to use different shells other than bash try zsh or ksh

2362618
width	margin
in ie7 i d like to add some margin to a element that has 100 width of it s parent

2362658
children	parent
note that you can t -- in a single standard sql query -- find all members of the family or all parent back to the top of the family or all children and grand-children

2362658
children	parent
the cascading delete doesn t work out well because the relationships in a family are directed in two ways parent to children child to parent but sql only has one kind of direction fk reference

2362672
maven	pom.xml
this combination is called the effective pom.xml and can be printed using the effective-pom goal of the maven help plugin useful for debugging

2362672
maven	pom.xml
so basically maven is unable to find the url.project project pom.xml x.x because it is not available in central

2362694
children	parent
i considered using a tree structure where each item had a parent except root and a number of children eg like

2362725
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up

2362753
ant	maven
if this question is about maven 2 then the property is excludes and takes a comma-separated list of ant patterns

i am trying to use io.popen in order to put with .puts method and to get with .gets method messages from a process to its sub-process

2362861

2362871
postgresql	mysql
what is the postgresql equivalent of the below mysql code

2362943
error-handling	exception-handling
i generally like using exception-handling in that kind of situation it allows me to have all error-handling code at one place

2362976
put	get
now each time i need to put all the params in the request scope read them again store them in hidden fields and get them back

2363021
getter	setter
wcf objects are designed to be data transport objects and any logic that resides behind setter and getter is dangerous at best

2363128
hide	show
when i show a tool window and click one of its buttons it hide itself to show another window

2363144

this works fine in google-chrome safari but doesn t in firefox ie8 and i don t understand why

2363195
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i would say gecko firefox and friends or webkit safari google-chrome and friends

2363202
folder	directory
use activator.createinstance or similar reflection method and put the new dlls in a sub folder of the bin directory

2363223

chrome 4 sends a get request for the post form

2363223
opera	firefox
none of the browsers i ve tested windows xp feature the behaviour your describe firefox 3.6 ie 6 ie7 ie8 opera 10.

2363226
extjs	mootools
i recommend looking at an ajax library though life is much easier in jquery extjs mootools whatever you prefer

2363255
invokelater	invokeandwait
invokelater adds the task to the current queue of tasks on the edt and invokeandwait runs the task and blocks until completion

2363268
versioning	upgrade
but the problem with undefined behaviour is that because the standard doesn t guarantee it if you later change os or compiler or upgrade to a later versioning of the same compiler you can t rely on the behaviour remaining the same

2363322
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox pc mac safari mac but in ie8 on pc it returns unexpected error on line 3 or any other line that uses the flashmovie object

2363329
mouse	keyboard
as you are inside the while true loop maybe even user events mouse and keyboard cant get dispatched in the message queue correctly

2363359
put	get
then you should have a thread collection who will get items from that list and get the file if he timeouts he should put the task back to the collection

2363384
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in addition be sure to preallocate any output arrays before loops and index into them instead of growing the arrays inside the for-loop

2363415
post	get
i want to code a function to get a list of entry objects whose date field is between a beginperiod and endperiod i post below a code snippet which works with a hack

2363421
ftp	smb
you could just set up a smb share or an ftp server in the remote virtual machine and then use an ant task to jar all of your class files and copy them over to the second virtual machine

2363421
ftp	smb
copies the compiled code ftp scp smb or something of the sort

2363473
accessor	properties
if you want a singleton write a singleton class perhaps with public iinterface1 and iinterface2 properties as accessor

2363487
onclick	onmousedown
use onmousedown instead of onclick within javascript and for consistency add you onkeypress event here too - taking the event out of the html tag

2363497
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is ntfs

2363539
outputstream	inputstream
you could also use public static long copy inputstream from outputstream to from bytestreams

2363546
width	height
imho and according to my tests seems that css shadow on an element is increasing both total width and height of the page if the surrounding element has width or height set to 100 as you said and i haven t found a css workaround for this problem yet

2363553
postgresql	mysql
i have done some googling and have found references to using linq with mysql and postgresql my other two db options but they are refer to dlinq which i understand to be the predecessor of linq to db

2363576

i ve created war file without jars and added to manifest.mf eg class_path .jar .jar

2363666
post	get
there is also a copy of this question on the anddev.org forums so i ll keep this post updated with any responses i get over there

2363712
many-to-many	many-to-one
it does not usually make sense to enable cascade on a many-to-one or many-to-many association

2363712
children	parent
but if you think that you will often be working with the parent and children together in the same transaction and you want to save yourself some typing consider using cascade persist merge save-update

2363765
profiling	benchmarking
i think to get a better benchmarking on these you should check the time in sql profiling not in google chrome because in the browser it may be a lot of things affect the speed on the page load

2363781
portrait	landscape
i typically create a screen for landscape and one for portrait

2363823
integer	unsigned
so as not to waste space on byte-level precision by actually storing the limit as an integer that would require a full bigint for things like 100gb you might want to instead do something like limit_amount int unsigned and limit_unit enum b kb mb gb

2363851
getter	setter
to do this you can t really use automatic getter setter and you need to set isdirty in each setter

2363923
free	malloc
generally malloc new free delete on multi threaded systems are thread safe so this should be no problem - and allocating in one thread deallocating in another is a quite common thing to do

2363926
getter	setter
when you synthesize them you overwrite the getter setter and interface builder cannot bind to them anymore

2363946
google-chrome	firefox
add that script to your page then if you re using firefox w firebug or other debugger or google-chrome you can inspect element to see what s been written to the page

ant	maven
2011-12-01 we have now migrated from ant to maven

2364006
ecj	javac
we are looking into using ecj instead of javac for several reasons but for most purposes javac works nicely

2364010
post	get
i know there are many post regarding and it works fine if the action method which i am calling is just a get method but it fails if the action method has a post attribute because in the code we do a redirect to the url and not a post

2364122
onmouseover	onmouseup
we cannot set onmouseover or onmouseup for the div id 6 because this event cannot fire

2364124
memcpy	strcpy
you can assign structs in c using but you can t assign arrays - you have to use strcpy memcpy for things like this

2364141
google-chrome	firefox
i have a form very basic and when i hit enter key nothing happens in firefox but in google-chrome it submits

2364165
post	put
he later put together this blog post that details the process of tracking memory allocations this is important to track because the lag that i was seeing was directly due to garbage collection

2364195
getter	setter
you need to initialise the the items so an auto getter setter won t help you here

2364199
ant	maven
here are many ways to execute your change log including via command line ant maven grails and a servlet listener

2364212

2364293
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction work and the bracket notation is just a fancy syntax for addition

2364309
udp	tcp
if you are talking about udp so the best message size is ethernet block which is 1496 bytes long if yiu are using tcp leave it up to network layer to handle how much to send

2364312
int	chars
i could use actual strings and strcmp but i want this to be really fast for mobile devices so i was thinking to use chars constants int id btn1

2364312
int	chars
but it looks as if chars constants can only hold 4 chars and the only thing making a long int chars constant gives you is the ability for your 4 chars to be twice as wide not have twice the amount of chars

2364320
innodb	myisam
that means you ll have to use innodb not myisam tables

2364340
hide	show
in this simple app it would be possible to just hide the other screens that aren t show but in the more complicated app there s just too much state information to manage screen information properly and easily

2364340
hide	show
edit i ve tried the hide show thing on some dialogs and it just doesn t seem to matter

2364349
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
with udp arguably the best thing to do is use path mtu discovery which tcp does for you automatically but as a general rule you are fine just using something in 500 byte range

2364351
button	checkbox
so i created a new fla i dropped a combobox an inputtext a checkbox and a button

2364373
inherited	properties
1 first ask yourself if you need another view properties beside the inherited one at all

if you need just one view for the controller just used the inherited properties

2364395
fseek	fread
there are about 40 fread in method 1 with maybe 15 fseek vs 1 fread in method 2

2364488
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
there are several changes between wss 3.0 and sharepoint 2010 foundations essentially wss 4.0 one of which is that you are no longer required to dispose of a spweb object only the spsite object when referenced from the spsite in a using block

2364488
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
in fact if you get a spsite and spweb in wss 3.0 from the spcontext object you will run into issues with sharepoint if you dispose of the object since the sharepoint runtime instantiated it

2364496
maven	pom.xml
maven can manage your batch scripts by replacing placeholders such as project.version inside the bat script with the current version number from the pom.xml

2364560

if there is a spaces or other standard delimiter

2364656
norton	mcafee
i ve seen norton and mcafee both clobber files with no indication they changed anything

2364686
daemons	systemd
resulting code runs on whatever systemd your cron daemons is on most usually a unix server but i assume there are cron ports to windows etc...

2364686
jobs	cron
any other considerations have nothing to do with cron jobs

2364691
client-side	server-side
i will de compress server-side c# and client-side javascript before after every response request

2364735
jobs	cron
most cron jobs i ve come across have been in bash or the scripting language of the system s shell. however if performance is critical i write a c++ application to do what i want although there really aren t many times when a bash script hasn t been sufficient.

2364750
int	chars
alternatively you could simply write a helper function to convert a const chars 9 in to a 64-bit int

2364751
post	get
take a look at the documentation for the querydict which is used to hold the get post attributes

2364793

2364885
public	protected
give the base class a public non-virtual method func1 that performs the operations you need and then invokes a protected virtual method

2364904
post	get
the url portion of a request get and post can be limited by both the browser and the server - generally the safe size is 2kb as there are almost no browsers or servers that use a smaller limit

2364945
matplotlib	scipy
the code is running on windows xp 32-bit with python 2.5 and matplotlib 0.99.1 numpy 1.3.0 and scipy 0.7.1

2364970
width	height
that would essentially give me the width and height of the string inside the richtextbox control

2364972
sqldatasource	formview
i m thinking of using the databound event for the formview to set the label text to the value of a field in the formview or of using the sqldatasource selected event to set the labels to values retrieved by the query

2364972
sqldatasource	formview
the formview only displays one of the two values though the other value is retrieved by the sqldatasource

2364999
listview	gridview
you can even use a listview along with a gridview if you want a multi-column list

2365059
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately the textarea in the html editor control is never displayed in google-chrome and safari both latest version

2365060
interbase	firebird
snapshot isolation per se is not new for me as i develop administer firebird interbase as well - where there no explicit locking and all works in row versioning.

2365065
button	checkbox
simple components like button checkbox and radiobutton are a good place to start

2365106
post	get
pascal sorry for that i didn t mean to just say switch to external server no talking it s just that i ve seen a lot of people on so and on gwt s google group that have problems configuring jetty that comes with gwt - in some cases it s because the configuration is somewhat different than standard because the gwt team included an older modified i can t get any solid info on this version of jetty for example see this post and comments there some quotes

2365142
inherited	properties
if you do find yourself with too complex a hierarchy because the presence of certain properties overlap you may want to look at multiple inherited or multiple interface implementation like the decorator pattern if that is supported conveniently in php

2365187
serializable	deserialization
when using only the serializable attribute the deserialization can be controlled only by attributes and is less flexible

2365229
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview is a type-of qwidget

int	double
replace these with and so on wherever possible here i am specifically referring to collections of value types such as int double long etc.

2365523
ant	maven
if you want smart dependency management then you need to look at something like maven ant with ivy or possibly some module system with explicit dependencies osgi

2365549
entities	entitymanager
my current solution is to use an entitymanager class that maintains a dictionary of all entities as well as an array of actives

2365568
vmware	esx
use vmware server esx - what we have done most recently is to actually build vm images for the server and client machine with a mountable second drive data drive

2365570
getter	setter
i could put events into all of my getter and setter to be notified of changes to my objects but i would rather avoid that

2365630
int	chars
for others say you want to push int chars or pointers of objects you can use

2365639

send http-headers for some image content-type

2365656

how can i ignore a commit locally without altering it on the remote repo after a push pull

2365684
width	height
robbie is right for the width height for loops

2365713
sorting	filtering
i think it might be reasonable to say that if two lists on a form have different filtering sorting requirements then they should be bound from different source properties even if those properties are straight clones of a single underlying source

2365747
int	chars
which is of enum int chars float...

2365757
client-side	server-side
it appears you are looking for a way to manipulate the html that is being produced on the server-side which is a very legitimate desire it s just that the approach on the server side using .net or other technologies is radically different than how you would approach it on the client-side

2365758
width	height
sometimes it might use height and width tags other times it might use css

2365778
width	height
you can t set height and width on inline elements

2365785
uninstall	upgrade
by creating a folder in there with the same name as your service app it s readily apparent where the contents come from you can grant access to it without compromising the program files folder and when you uninstall or upgrade your app you won t leave orphan folders in program files that couldn t be removed because the installer didn t know it had to delete some log files

2365787
width	height
do you simply mean you want them to appear side-by-side or do you actually want the width and height to be ignored as tom pointed out

2366660
uiview	subviews
create a uiview with two subviews

2366660

2366670
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are not interchangeable

2366670
udp	tcp
in short your server is probably only listening on tcp port and not on udp

2367153
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
i then forwarded touchesbegan touchesmoved touchescancelled and touchesended from the uitableview to all of the uiscrollviews in the array

2367211
firefox	safari
firefox 3.6 for windows works as does ie 8 and safari on both platforms

2367471
union	distinct
union means union distinct and this is relatively slow as it will check for duplicates even though there will not be any

2367496
rss	feed
rss xml validation is not neccessary since we get the feed from a well reputed company

2367514

2367716
phong	shading
phong shading

2367719
client-side	server-side
such acts should be counted at the server level the client-side may include some audit monitoring log of sorts but the server-side should be the authoritative source of info

2367727
websphere	ibm
the advantage of using spring over standard jdk 5 java.util.concurrent.executor is that if you re on application servers that need to use managed threads ibm websphere or oracle weblogic you can use the workmanagertaskexecutor to hook into the commonj work managers

2367734
nunit	mstest
i realise that there are many older questions addressing the general question of nunit v mstest for versions of visual studio up to 2008 such as this one

2367738
hex	binary
no you don t need to know any math except maybe binary oct hex dec representations for system programming and stuff like that

look into an integration of ubercart and cck so you can set up your own field for this

2367753
multiplying	add
i m trying to create a class that will allow me to add multiplying divide objects of the same class together or add multiplying numeric arguments to each member of the class

my recommendation is following if nunit satisfies you - use it forget about mstest

2367807
stdout	stderr
running this script but redirecting stdout thus showing what gets printed on stderr you get

2368100
np-hard	np-complete
my point being that the problem as stated is so vague as to admit np-complete or np-hard problems

2368103
cairngorm	mate
we recently switched to mate after using cairngorm because we found it was a much easier framework to use and understand

2368103
hide	show
you could easily use that to show or hide whatever you needed to

2368124
width	height
in order to remain a square you would have to change the height as well but you only asked to change the width

2368124
width	height
you could make a new method on rectangle that knows how to clone the rectangle with a new width or a new height and then your square could safely devolve to a rectangle during the cloning process but now you are no longer mutating the original value

2368126
hash	salt
second suppose i had an algorithm that took the microtime a 128 character salt and a random number between 1 billion and 10 billion and hash them together

2368126
hash	salt
so the salt and random number don t need to be stored just the resulting hash

folder	directory
if you re using a standard capistrano deployment put the file in the shared folder and update your deployment task to create a symlink to it in the current release s directory

2368171
hash	salt
because the salt adds a lil spice which differentiates the password hash from all the others

2368171
hash	salt
with dictionary-based and brute-forcing attacks the value for plain-text-passwd is spammed by the user which in turn gets hash with the salt

2368225

2368298
post	get
i wanted to post how i managed to get this to work

2368299
cpu	processors
when multi cpu and later multi core systems began to be built more sophisticated systems were needed to insure that lock and xchg would synchronize all of the memory subsystems including l1 cache on all of the processors

2368299
atomic	lockless
about this time new research into locking and lockless algorithms showed that atomic compareandset was a more flexible primitive to have so more modern cpus have that as an instruction

2368318
post	get
scott gu has an excellent blog post that can get you started linq to sql part 6 - retrieving data using stored procedures

2368333
opengl-es	glreadpixels

2369223
division	modulo
you need to use both modulo and division

2369233
put	get
the convention of putting the constant on the left side of isn t really useful in java since java requires that the expression in an if evaluate to a boolean value so unless the constant is a boolean you d get a compilation error either way you put the arguments

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
a good example is ienumerable and icollection

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
every icollection is guaranteed to be ienumerable so icollection derives from ienumerable

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
if it was legal or made sense to be a collection but not be enumerable then implementers of icollection wouldn t have to implement ienumerable also

2369272

but when i inspect the post data i get something like

2369327
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
instead of an onitemclicklistener add an onclicklistener to each of your views returned from your adapter

2369342
post	get
if you need extra information you will probably need to call fql.multiquery using the results from the previous queries as filters once you get the post it will have the user and so on and so on

2369347
int	chars
all three has the following members chars filename chars size int size

2369357

addition	multiplication
multiplication has higher precedence than addition + which is why 2+3 4 is interpreted as 2+ 3 4 both in c and normal math

2369467
primes	modulus
i already know that it s often a good idea to choose an initial hash table size which is a primes at least if your hash function uses modulus such as universal hashing

2369492

toolbar	docking
in the past this was not with the feature pack docking framework if you wanted to dock on startup to a specific side you had to set the side where you wanted the toolbar to be docked as the only one allowed on the right create the toolbar dock it there was a setdocked or something like that and then modify the allowed dock sides to the directions you wanted to allow

2370803

implements	extends
if the parent class has a variable and a child class extends the parent then the child doesn t need to implements the variable

2371057
implements	extends	subclass	abstract-class
if you extends an abstract-class and fail to implements an abstract method the compiler will tell you to either implements it or mark the subclass as abstract

2371059
super	extends
when you extends abstracttable the class won t compile until you add a constructor which calls super somename

2371074
superclass	subclassing
if every subclassing is supposed to have it just define it in the superclass

2371084
rvm	bundler
if your gems are installed in a subdirectory of your home dir rvm local gems and bundler do this then at one point this will check for the existence of config.ru in your home dir

2371097
free	malloc
if you change your tid array to an array of int64 s and pass tid i then you won t need malloc free and the race condition is also solved - though this only works if you re guaranteed to have only one caller to your library at once

2371105
firefox	safari
this was tested and it happens in the same way on firefox ie7 and safari

2371176
g++	gcc
code compiled with g++ gcc 3.4.4 cygming special gdc 0.12 using dmd 0.125 but it has been verified to behave the same with other compilers as well

2371195
box-sizing	border-box
either setting box-sizing border-box

2371269
union	distinct
edit i removed my recommendation to use distinct because union filters out duplicates

2371312
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the style it s correctly applied in all browsers ie6 7 8 firefox 3+ opera 9.5+ google-chrome 3 4 but in safari 4.0 it is not

2371312
google-chrome	safari
i can make work in safari but then it breaks in google-chrome

2371338
cells	tablecell
i haven t tried it but it might be possible to simply interrogate the accessoryview property of the cells and find the checkmark and replace it with another image it s almost certainly an image. i think that cells style is just a default style tablecell with an image cells that holds the checkmark

2371399
folder	dir
i could do git svn clone svnrepo dir sb-dir if i needed only sb-dir but i need all folder and files within the dir except the design folder

2371405
post	get
sorry for the double post i will update this question if i can t get things to work

2371440
switching	screens
for the moment when you start a game i switching the layout of main to the game screens layout which just contains one big surface view

2371480
daemons	systemd
if you are doing longer-term delays more than say 30 seconds or the jobs are somewhat important to perform abeit later then it also has a binary logging systemd so that any daemons crash would still have a record of the job

2371550
setinterval	settimeout
there is an alternative to settimeout called setinterval which will call the function you pass as argument at regular intervals

2371550
setinterval	clearinterval
calling setinterval will return a value which can be passed to clearinterval to stop the function from being called

2371597
hide	show
using jquery with radiobuttons to hide show table rows

2371607
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout instead of setinterval is to me often more flexible because it lets the timed code adapt and possibly cancel itself

2371620
rss	feed
maybe it s possible to simply aggregate the items on one server by using a webservice or an rss feed

2371656
jstl	taglib
you can control the page flow with taglib like jstl

2371665
firefox	safari
edit i got firefox and safari switched around due to the mac reference

2371702
int	double
because a double has a much bigger maximum value than an int supports

2371702
int	double
asking for the ceiling on a double that has a value greater than int32.maxvalue or even int64.maxvalue would not be possible if it returned an int

2371708
hide	show
if your layout is a widget this will return a on which you can call show or hide

2371708
hide	show	qgridlayout	qwidget
if your qgridlayout is not a qwidget you can nest it within a qwidget and you can show hide that widget instead

2371709
int	double
the range of the largest int type is still much smaller than that of double

2371733
maven	pom.xml
so when maven downloads a jar dependency it doesn t only download a jar but also the pom.xml file

2371761
width	height
one thing that is continuously getting in my way are the width and height properties of displayobject container s

2371761
width	height
i m finally starting to get my head around them and learned that the width and height of a sprite are determined solely by their contents for example

2371768
folder	directory
you need to fake the folder as a virtual directory which gives you access to the configuration button and remove wild card mappings

2371768
folder	directory
then remove the folder as a virtual directory

2371794
width	height
then you could use this to make all videos stretch to width height

2371800
subtract	add
i have a simple test for this add 1 to a counter when call is started subtract 1 on success

2371834
folder	directory
either create the directory programatically or offline or create the folder on the base path

2371868
octal	binary
you can also use #b for binary #o for octal numbers or #36r for base 36

2371878
getter	setter
the property directive is equivalent to declaring both a setter and a getter

2371883
punctuation	words
2 medium add the words to a hashtable then split the input into words you may have to use regular expression replacing to remove punctuation and try to find each words of input in the hashtable

2371886
hash	md5
i have then turned the user s password into a hash value using md5

2371930
agile	greenhopper
jira versions are primarily a planning tool especially if you use greenhopper aka agile where you can have a version hierarchy

2371941
button	checkbox
the trouble is that if the user hits the back button the checkbox are still selected page cached but the css is not re-applied

2371951
children	parent
since when you save parent object it also validates child objects and it contains errors for children

2371999
post	get
i get a 500 response and all future post s return a 500 error until i recycle my iis app pool and then it starts to work again

2372014
clang	llvm
llvm 2.6 + clang

2372022
imperative	declarative
both are declarative or set based rather than imperative meaning you ask for what you want - you don t loop through and process individual items one by one

2372023
int	boolean
c did not have native boolean types so this was an int

2372035
rar	zip	jar	manifest.mf
scan the entire classpath for jsf jar files and use some zip rar tool to determine the included manifest.mf file for the actual jsf version

2372042
folder	directory
and selecting that directory in order to run all tests in it or changing the run all tests in the selected project package or source folder in the test tab of the run configuration

2372098
ant	maven
i m migrating a maven project to ant + ivy it s an arbitrary decision and it has to be done

2372098
ant	maven
the thing is that comparing both war files the ant and the maven one the former has a lot more 3rd party jars than the first one.

2372161
pull	push
this will allow you to clone commit to push and pull projects and their associated libraries as a group

2372193
hide	show
qlayout parentwidget gives you the widget which owns the layout which you can then show and hide

2372334
fadein	fadeout
this way the fadeout does not start until the fadein is done

2372441
getter	setter
an additional benefit is that all your getter setter methods can use the generic parameters and expose a more sensible front to other objects which rely on the fact that you set up specialised fields in the aforementioned object

2372456
subtract	add
the only obvious difference is that instead of subtract they basically add pre-negate the bytes and add

2372519
put	get
by separating the tabbar from the navigator in this case the view stack you can put it in a different parent and get the result you re looking for

2372592
public	protected
java allows 4 levels of access private protected public and default

2372624
bash	zsh
right now i m using because bash and zsh set the environment variable to the last-run program

2372633
post	get
you probably also want to look into restful urls and the prg post redirect get pattern to maintain the integrity of the back button and enable correct bookmarking of pages etc

2372644
int	double
where a b c d e f are double and t is int

2372662
sorting	filtering
check out richfaces datatable datatable with table filtering and table sorting

2372662
sorting	filtering
but yes i forgot one small note if you need to go to the database and handle your filtering sorting on db level you will need to provide your own implementation of datamodel by extending the org.ajax4jsf.model.serializabledatamodel

2372712
vsto	add-in
assuming that you are referring to an add-in created using vsto

2372712
vsto	add-in
iirc a vsto add-in developed for office 2003 will possibly work on office 2007 without change but never the other way around

2372739
macports	homebrew
on ubuntu osx homebrew package rename macports package p5-file-rename or other systems with perl rename prename

2372752
valgrind	callgrind
have a look at callgrind part of the valgrind toolset

2372758
libxml2	libxslt
following the first steps in the guide which involved building and installing the libxml2 and libxslt packages seemed to be successful.

2372763
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie7 comp mode google-chrome and firefox

2372780
free	malloc
in my program i m not using malloc or free

2372801
free	malloc
you should be using delete with a new and free with a malloc

2372815
children	parent
so i only get the parent back but none of the children and possibly their children etc - this can in theory be indefinite

2372820
free	malloc
there s rarely a reason to use malloc and free in a c++ program

2372822
button	checkbox
note that for some input elements checkbox radio button the handling is a little weird

2372842
fgets	fgetc
use either fgets if you know that your lines will fit into buffer or use fgetc for more control over reading

2372853
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you should use new and delete in preference to malloc calloc realloc and free

2372858
post	get
you can get the post parameters with

2372873
free	malloc
new and delete can more or less to be considered the c++ versions of malloc and free

2372873
free	malloc
the malloc free pair are not c++ aware and just allocate and release a block of memory with no attached constructor destructor semantics

2372883
hash	md5
i then observed a difference in the md5 hash of the failing iso with the one that worked..

2372883
hash	md5
md5 hash 0c5c6b7e4e80b66cd299b1dba6a819db

2372903
qstackedwidget	qgridlayout
then for each widget in the qstackedwidget you should associate a separate qgridlayout

2372904
google-chrome	safari
it s yellow in google-chrome and blue in safari and gets in the way of any custom focus styles i try to implement

2372923
sorting	filtering
you will always have memory problems when the java code hauls copies the entire dataset of a datastore a rdbms in java s memory and then do the sorting and filtering right in java s memory using java code

2372923
sorting	filtering
the sql language offers you under each the order by clause to do the sorting the where clause to do the filtering and the db vendor specific limit offset clauses subselects functions to return only a subset of records based on firstrow and rowcount or lastrow

2372923
sorting	filtering
it will always require the entire dataset being available in the java memory because the filtering and sorting needs to happen with pure java code or javascripts

2372935
setinterval	settimeout
don t pass a string as the first parameter of setinterval or settimeout

2372943
jar	war
check out the jaxb versions that you have in your war and make sure that they are not conflicting with a jaxb jar that jboss may have in its lib directory

2373037
free	malloc
trying to use both means that you will inevitably screw up and delete a malloc ed item or free a newed item giving a subtle bug

2373050
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it s supported in ie firefox 3.5 google-chrome safari and opera 10.50

2373078
free	malloc
in my program i m not using malloc or free

2373078
free	malloc
there is no need to use malloc free in c++ code there are a few situations where you are using c libs that require malloced memory but they are explicitly documented and few

2373179
nunit	mstest
as many here have pointed out nunit has frequent updates while mstest is only updated as often as the ide

2373190
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
you can use nsurlrequest or nsmutableurlrequest to construct the request

2373216
postgresql	mysql
i wonder if most open-source databases mysql postgresql etc. have either a hard or a practical limit on how many tables they can manage without being impeded

2373243
put	preflight
put that into a file named preflight or preinstall and then make it executable by typing in the terminal chmod a+x preflight or preinstall

2373309
mouse	keyboard
another remark be consistent though there might be different ways get access to the same functionality all of them should work in the same way i d be very pissed of if copying with the keyboard shortcut did a different thing than copying with the right mouse button xd

2373363
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if your customexception extends runtimeexception it is an unchecked-exception then you will be fine

2373387
post	get
there isn t any need to use commentnumber to get the most recent comment as the post are already ordered by timestamp

2373400
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
also of course this extension is specific to macruby and not part of the ruby specification and not portable to mri yarv jruby xruby ironruby maglev rubinius tinyrb rubygolightly blueruby smallruby or any other ruby implementation

2373456
children	parent
mycontainercomponent is the parent control i m adding the children controls to and mycustomchildcontrol is the control i want to show the transitions for

2373487
background-image	background-color
as noted by easwee the opacity is inherited by contained elements which is why you can t override it and is why i prefer to use the background-color background-image approach

2373567
fgets	realloc
what you can do however is read the data using fgets and check whether the last character is a n or you ve reached the end of file and if not realloc your buffer and read more

2373579
folder	dir
folder the view name working dir c projects dir

2373580
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the gallery displays in ie8 and firefox but not in google-chrome opera or safari

2373580
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that in google-chrome there are 2 divs that don t get assigned the same classes as they do in firefox and the ul that contains the images is empty

2373606
put	get
the thing is i want to get all the project-related data from user1 and put it in a tree-view but on the server all the files are in the same folder with randomly generated names

2373635
gridview	radgrid
i am using a radgrid rather than the standard gridview but it seems to work there as well

2373659
sorting	filtering
another approach is to filtering the lists by sorting and doing a foldr operation combining adjacent elements if they match

2373699
folder	directory
i am trying to make a web server in c# i need to get the requested url and then list the files and folder requested.this is good to get the first directory

2373710
implements	extends
i realize i can make another comparableandclonable which extends the two but i don t have control over some of the code so i can t go make my future-s object implements comparableandclonable

2373749
realloc	malloc
this application exe allocates memory dynamically from heap using malloc and realloc

2373749
realloc	malloc
i want to calculate the maximum size allocated size allocated on heap using malloc realloc by this application program when i run particular test case

2373749
free	malloc
a there can be a scenario that some memory of 1kb is malloc ed then free and then a memory of 2kb is malloc ed

2373749
free	malloc
so i have to really see whereall malloc free is happening in this code and add code for this which i want to avoid

2373772
realloc	malloc
it you do have access to the source code that you wish to analyze replace all malloc realloc calls with calls you your own function that would perform the analysis

2373772
realloc	malloc
in this implementation you can perform the analysis and then fall back to standard malloc realloc

2373777
activemq	rabbitmq
if you want a multilanguage standard -- meaning you are not tied to using a specific broker intermediary like activemq sonicmq or webspheremq -- i strongly suggest you look at the amqp standard and related brokers rabbitmq qpid openamq

2373804
for-loop	arrays
then create a for-loop much like you ve done to add as many enemies as you want to the arrays and give them some positional info and also to add them to the stage

2373813
notepad++	textpad
you could try using a text editor such as textpad or notepad++ to try and edit the .rpt file

2373859
getter	setter
let s say i have a simple class vector2 as given below note that i am aware that x and y should be private with getter and setter these have just been omitted for brevity

2373872
google-chrome	safari
the following problem happens on both safari and google-chrome so probably a webkit issue

2373872
google-chrome	safari
on safari and google-chrome when c is rendered the form on page c has the type submit button name submit but value shows up as a

2373923
postgresql	mysql
this means taht if at any point you want to change from mysql to postgresql you simple change

2373923
daemon	cron
with both languages you could have them run intermittently via a cron job or you could have them run as a daemon which is as easy as running the script s while piping your output to a black hole such as dev null

2373925
free	malloc
if there is a reason to use a separate storage and result you will probably get better milage using and delete instead of malloc 4 and free

2374012
std	ostream
the std ostream class requires a std streambuf object for its output

2374012
stringstream	fstream
this is used by the fstream and stringstream classes which use the features of ostream by providing a custom implementation of the streambuf class

2374032
put	get
the perfect solution would be able to run stand-alone no big dependencies and require just to put in the api key login data to get started

2374051
inline	inlining
the inline keyword hardly plays a role in whether or not the compiler does any inlining

2374062
imagemagick	libjpeg
the real solution is use an image library imagemagick been the easiest or libjpeg make the file check the size and then resize as necessary

2374063
inline	inlining
if your compiler does any inlining at all it will be able to inline get and set methods defined and used within a given class

2374125
qsharedpointer	qpointer
qt also includes qpointer a guarded pointer and the qsharedpointer qweakpointer pair that implement a reference-couting smart pointer and weak-reference pair

2374164
hide	show
it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. so in other words it hide that first column and it also hide the second column

2374195
subtract	add
the advantage is that you can select the field simply by changing the number enclosed in curly braces without having to add or subtract literal copies of the pattern manually

2374224
post	get
the problem i got is that the values that comes in the post are all by the name answer so i get a list of all the elements from all forms by the name answer and i can t identify which ones belong to each form

2374284
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
opera google-chrome safari firefox .

2374321
graphics2d	bufferedimage
i m trying to create a fast image generator that does lots of 2d transformations and shape rendering so i m trying to use a bufferedimage and then acquire the graphics2d object to perform all my drawing

2374374
fflush	gets
compression buffers the data until it gets enough worth compressing or is told to fflush

2374432
getter	setter
adding logic to the getter or setter won t break existing code

2374470
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to overwrite certain pieces in kernel memory linux 2.6.31 ubuntu 9.10 in a virtual machine using virtualbox via a kernel module

2374470
ubuntu	debian
the problem seems related to ubuntu because the same code does not fail using debian

2374481
youtube	vimeo
video embeded from youtube vimeo etc

2374483
getter	setter
from inside your custom class you d specify getter and setter if you wanted to access them from outside the class

2374548
cassini	iis
if you re using a remote server not cassini or iis on localhost then change the to in the snippet above

2374640
median	percentile
all i could find is the median 50th percentile but not something more specific

2374667
hash	salt
it won t take long for somebody to figure out your hash if you re hashing plain numbers you absolutely need to salt it

2374667
hash	salt
the advantages of a salt hash is quick generation and low chance of collisions in small cases absolutely no need to verify for these so faster inserts

2374688
folder	directory
the res folder needs to be a source directory in eclipse

2374771
post	get
or optionally use an ivalueconverter to convert get your view from a viewmodel like this post shows

2374772
ubuntu	linux
using ubuntu linux server

2374777
aim	instant
microsoft office communicator is a instant messaging client similar to live messenger aim or yahoo

2374781
width	height
the site i work on must be almost completely liquid - i have many customers sharing the same site templates and i really have no idea what size width height they will want their headers menus or content to be

2374786
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as to be expected firefox google-chrome safari all render the menu correctly and use the supersubs plugin to make sure each level of the menu is at least as wide as the widest element

2374831
hash	md5
you don t have to worry about collisions no integer that your databases uses will result in the same md5 hash as any other

2374838
versioning	upgrade
in the next versioning the prerequisites have been bumped from framework 3.0 to framework 3.5 and we need an easy way to detect the framework versioning of each client machine and advise them on whether they need to upgrade or not

2374869
getter	setter
you should encapsulate the both classes in a containing class and provide a relevant interface such as setter getter for private variables

2374870
pop-up	dialog
i use this code login so the oracle odbc driver connect dialog box would not pop-up to ask password

2374959
min	max
i want to clarify that the min max values need to be plugged into the forumla

2374981
hash	md5
a hashing algorithm such as md5 is not a good solution for this as hash by definition to not assure uniqueness they create hash that have a finite number of values

2374993
int	double
now if you realize that foo should actually be a double rather than int you change it

2374993
accessor	properties
with this design you are free to introduce an address properties internally which would contain street address zip code and country code and rewrite your accessor to use the fields of this private member instead without your clients noticing anything

2375002
centos	linux
linux bash on centos linux 5

2375005
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

2375008
range	max	range	min	min	max
you need to first find the range of those values to get the min and max

2375013
min	max
i think you re going to have to run through your data at least once to get the min max or know them ahead of time

2375019
getter	setter
also in java for example you have no way to restrict access to a member variable without changing its visibility so you often find yourself prematurely creating getter and setter and making the variable itself private or protected

2375019
getter	setter
in python for example that problem doesn t exist because you can make getter and setter behave like variables for direct access they re called properties there

2375027
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
the component actually takes care of all crud operations as long as it s wired up to a properly configured data source objectdatasource sqldatasource etc

2375042
rss	feed
im using this php to get a list of title s from an rss feed

2375075
g++	gcc
i am using gcc g++ to compile c c++ applications - living on opensuse btw

2375082
width	height
i have a wpf window that contains a contentpresenter that has height and width set to 0 by default

2375082
width	height
when a user clicks a button i run an animation to transform the contentpresenter s height and width properties to 896 1024 actually it does 3 rotations whilst its growing too and this is all good.

2375082
width	height
my problem is that if the user clicks cancel and i run the animation that shrinks the height width back down to 0 0 then the usercontrol shrinks as required but the red border does not completely disappear - it leaves a single red pixel in the middle of my window

2375108
post	get
get is an http get call and post is an http post

2375108
post	get
in fact even lower than that when you request a webpage you have to either http 1.0 get or http 1.0 post or the other request methods

2375108
post	get
actually if you look at the latest jquery documentation get and post are listed under shorthand methods and equivalent methods are given

2375120
post	get
one uses post and one uses get

2375120
post	get
as far as what they re meant for - the only real technical difference please correct this post if i m wrong is that get has a much shorter limit to the query string

2375120
post	get
you should be able to make the exact same get call an unlimited number of times and get the same result every time with no consequence to the server provided of course that no one else has changed the server s state. but remember that there are no technical barriers preventing you from misusing either get or post

2375125
debian	linux
i m looking for a way to list all fonts installed on a linux debian system and then generate images of some strings using these fonts

2375142
opensuse	debian
you can search for a mingw32 package in opensuse i know there is one for debian or install it manually

2375165

realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you statically link with the crt you can overrule the implementation of malloc realloc free in fact all functions that appear in malloc.c realloc c free.c and or dbgheap.c in the crt

2375395
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you dynamically link with the crt you can redefine malloc realloc and free like this

2375395
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the implementations of mymalloc myrealloc and myfree can then simply use malloc realloc and free be sure not to use the #define in the source file that implements mymalloc ... or you could use the native windows functions

2375406
post	put
rememberme s post describes how this could work - you can still use arrows in column headers - one option would be to put an arrow icon in the header but change the state of that icon if it was sorted highlight the up or down button if the dataset is currently sorted by this column.

2375471
listview	gridview
try pure databinding with observabledictionary which internally creates your gridview datatemplates and will keep your listview in proper column order

2375647
post	get
because lytebox requirements include the rev and rel attributes to be set in an tag i couldn t use it to send get post data i ended up going with jquery using thickbox s tb_show function and a ajax call to send the selected choice to my script and show the results

2375729
put	get
besides the js code you get is heavily optimized and with gwt 2.0 the js file contains js css and even images for example when possible strings are put into variables for performance reasons - but these variables are usually grouped together and put in one place in the compiled js file so even if you could somehow get to the code that creates your form it could contain references to some undefined variables

2375738
emacs	textmate
i am switching to emacs from textmate

2375738

equals	gethashcode
i thought it was enough to simply override equals and gethashcode in the entity class for this to work the way i want it to

2376003
int	chars
rather you should get the chars at and convert it to an int

2376016

2376327
versioning	upgrade
my problem is that if in a later update i decide to store more data or store the same data in a different way i need to be careful i don t lose or corrupt data for users that upgrade i want users to be able to use data created by an old versioning in the new versioning like their high scores from before

2376327

i have implements this in the past to where i have the tiles extends jpanel and each tile just displays the appropriate segment of the sprite sheet using the bufferedimage.getsubimage while the parent jpanel simply calls paint on all of the tiles in the 2d array

2376416
awt	swing
should the tile class extend some other swing or awt component such as bufferedimage or will that not have an effect

2376466
moq	typemock
typemock has one significant benefit over moq as i see it

2376466
moq	typemock
moq and other mocking frameworks like it rhinomocks comes to mind do make you think about your code as you re writing it especially in terms of testability but i would argue that s a good thing further our team ran in to several headaches trying to deploy typemock to our continuous integration server

2376526
bufferedreader	urlconnection
get the inputstream from the urlconnection and wrap it in an inputstreamreader and then the isr in a bufferedreader

2376585
int	chars
i know that for int i should marshal it as but what about chars

2376616
versioning	upgrade
when you want to test a database upgrade you should run all the scripts from the baseline on a testing staging server to create the newest versioning of the database

int	double
which has only a real constraint int int float double .

2377095
post	get
i ve managed to get the tab layout example working with the three tabs albums songs artists thanks to other post on this site

2377121
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have different font rendering on windows

2377121
google-chrome	safari
so safari looks like os x on both systems whereas google-chrome looks like the platform it s running on

2377140
put	get
note it would be tempting to put a very high value for memory_limit to just get rid of the problem.

2377146
post	get
to do this you can use jquery either jquery ajax jquery get or jquery post

2377157
implements	extends
i ve implements a treecellrenderer that returns a jcheckbox simple code that the renderer extends a jcheckbox and sets its selection status based on a flag in the item and it works well

children	parent
what i have been trying to do almost successfully so far is to provide on the resource object 2 properties parent and children to traverse the tree stored by the association table

2377297
qcodo	qcubed
yes i do know qcodo qcubed is so nice but it is not mature enough for this task

current php contenders are cakephp kohana zend alone

2377319
apache	nginx
first i have increased speed on many of my php apps by dropping apache for nginx

sure you ll run into some blog post which describe some under-the-hood stuff but you ll have to put the pieces together yourself

2377388
gridview	datalist
eg another gridview datalist in itemtemplate

2377397
g++	gcc
i know that c++ code should be compiled and linked by g++ not gcc

2377404
g++	gcc
g++ is gcc it just automatically links to the standard c++ libraries

2377459
winpcap	pcap.net
pcap.net is a .net wrapper for winpcap

2377467
awt	swing
in swing has more features than the awt components

2377486
awt	swing
swing and awt both provide user interface components however swing is built on top of awt

2377486
awt	swing
also swing is meant to be portable while awt in theory will match more of the system s look and feel

2377486
awt	swing
awt is useful since it provides the foundation on which swing is built

2377501
pull	push
i can push and pull fine between all of these but there are some files that keep getting lost

2377503
affinity	processors
processors affinity was not helpfull in my special case

2377520
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
basic rule memory that you malloc or calloc etc must be passed to free at some point

2377561
codeigniter	kohana
i ve codeigniter prior to this and kohana as i see it is essentially all the good stuff in codeigniter without a lot of the limitations

2377584
affinity	processors
you can set processors affinity when launching your application

2377604
postgresql	mysql
then only proceed to source for database provider mysql postgresql etc

2377620
docx	xlsx
well it is working fine except some type of files like docx xlsx

2377764
int	double
in this case asuming your machine uses four-byte int and eight-byte double the float is converted to a double inside printf the first four bytes of a will be just zeroes and this gets printed

2377772
int	double
if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

2377801
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this is the php code that generate the error only on internet explorer 8 on firefox opera and google-chrome working good

2377819
preorder	inorder
the algorithm for preorder inorder is not optimal and can actually be bettered

2377819
preorder	inorder
especially look at the last two results for longer strings for which the preorder inorder approach is much faster than brute force

2377819
preorder	inorder
in any case for shorter strings you can use brute force and switch to the preorder inorder approach for longer ones to get the best of both worlds

2377819
preorder	inorder
find all trees which have a as the preorder and b as the inorder

2377819
preorder	inorder
finding a tree given preorder inorder is a standard problem and has many fast solutions

2377823
portrait	landscape
examples of when the amount of space changes include the navigation bar changing height turning the device from portrait to landscape and the status bar can also increase in height if the user is taking a call

2377873
uiview	subviews
take the simplest case where moduleview is a uiview with a multi-line uilabel subviews and padding on either side

2377881
hash	md5
this is how i started to get a md5 hash from a string

2377896
maven	pom.xml
possibly relevant we have a mix of eclipse and idea developers and in order to work around some eclipse maven integration bugs we ve set the snapshot updatepolicy to never in our pom.xml files

2377966
awt	swing
awt is slighter faster because it uses native os peer components whereas swing draws all its own components at the bit level

2377992
width	height
there is a image format in which you provide width and height on the first line and then zeros and ones

2378005
ostream	istream
i m using boost-python and want to wrap a function that has istream and ostream as arguments

2378007
awt	swing
awt was the gui package available in java then along came swing which was built on top of awt in an attempt to make things look nicer and consistent across platforms

2378007
swt	swing	awt	swing
if you want a java gui that actually looks nice well nicer than swing or awt then you want to check out swt from ibm

2378052
int	boolean
however every time i try to compile i get an error stating incompatible types - found int but expected boolean

2378127
xval	fluentvalidation
i have worked with the .mvc framework using validation frameworks such as xval or fluentvalidation

2378151

i am using a blog site as a source for my rss feed

2378209
rss	feed
as i see the rss feed its showing up as the following

2378247
single-quotes	double-quotes
you need to use single-quotes instead of double-quotes

2378257
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if i understood you correctly all you should have to do is create an nsarray with one or more uinavigationcontroller instances and assign it to the uitabbarcontroller s viewcontrollers property

2378298
erlang	scheme
i am proficient in java javascript and have dabbled in python perl erlang scheme

2378331
int	chars
the type of 1 is int in c not chars so you are reading bytes in each fread

2378331
int	chars
this is one of the places where c and c++ are different in c chars literals are of type int in c++ they are of type chars

2378343
floor	sqrt
n floor log m sqrt 5 log phi

2378346
children	parent
i want to build a tree to link up those children and parent

2378346
children	parent
1 parent may have several children and there is an object which will be the ancestor of all objects

2378399
x86	64bit
i suppose i am focussing on x86 but i am generally interested in the move from 32 to 64bit

2378409
integer	unsigned
add an identifier to your rows an id column in the database preferably an unsigned integer which is also in the table you can use it as a querystring in the url you use for editing an entry and as a hidden input in the form

2378441
getter	setter
this will enable you to change the behavior of the getter and setter for the property in the inheriting class

2378447
hide	show
a button to toggle the ime show hide

2378450
post	get
so i advice you to dig you some resources about c c++ cgi programming and probably some libraries to facilitate access to post get variable and the decoding

2378557
forth	compiled-language
x86 does not have enough registers to make compiled-language as efficient as they could be so x86 code spends a lot of instructions and memory bandwidth shifting data back and forth between registers and memory

2378579
macbook	isight
i ve done the hard work turning my isight camera on my macbook into an infrared camera converted it set the threshold etc

2378613

2378614
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
execute in webkit -based browsers i tried in safari and google-chrome but in firefox internet explorer and opera it works as expected

2378670
int	double
the type attribute can be one of string int double date or currency

2378677
dictionary	map
my own recommendation would be to expose your api only through the builtin map or dictionary interface provided by the language until such time as it becomes necessary to provide users with a higher level of control

2378680
min	max
max - min

2378680
min	max
your font-size increment would be the step - which is basically max - min spread

2378696
x86	64bit
you re probably trying to mix different architectures 32 bit and 64bit code or x86 and arm

2378733
range	minimum
i am using numericupdown controls one for setting the minimum range and other for the maximum range

2378733
range	minimum
user removes the entire value present in the minimum range numeric updown by pressing delete key or backspace key and moves to the maximumrange now in the minimum range numericupdown a default value to be displayed

2378799
inherited	properties
the properties parent inherited on every control from control.parent provides access to the parent control

2378831
haskell	ocaml
this list of bindings for d-bus includes php python perl java .net c++ haskell ocaml squeak and plenty more besides

2378838
jobs	cron
in general perl is considered to be best for text parsing but since all you need to do is print the changes to console you should simply do a tail -f rather than cron jobs etc

2378854
getter	setter
perhaps you can add a getter and setter for your tweening into your test class

2378867
children	parent
and since a parent like somecollection can contain many many myitems i feel like i need to have some sort of paging involved in getting the children from a parent

2378868
cruisecontrol	teamcity
in which case teamcity cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net or hudson are all good alternatives

2378868
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i haven t had much experience with teamcity but i know that cruisecontrol and hudon both talk to tfs by wrapping the command line which is now available cross-platform from microsoft as a free download

2378884
width	height
if you add px after your height and width measurements to indicate the size in pixels the page should display better

2378887
regasm	regsvr32
this replaces the need to registry the com components using regasm or regsvr32 for native com servers in the system registry with xml configuration manifest files

2378929
children	parent
parent contains a collection of children the children may be linked from several parent

2378942
sorting	filtering
a wcf service would only ever return data - not objects with behavior dataview contains a lot of behavior - sorting filtering etc.

2379048
submit	submission
advantage you can have multiple submit buttons submission different values

2379101
versioning	upgrade
as for a library you should definitely include a versioning number so that applications can link against different versioning and can continue using an older versioning even if a newer one exists until the application has been upgrade to handle the new versioning

2379105
versioning	upgrade
it should still be possible to create versioning 1 obejcts with the versioning 2 api so users of the library can upgrade gradually

2379244
memcached	apc
flexibility to either store in files apc or memcached

2379251
client-side	server-side
please read this article with details about client-side vs server-side coding

2379254
post	get
when the button is clicked you need to send post get the variables to the server where the php can be executed

2379259
post	get
if you want to get anything back to php you need to make a new http request and include the data in it either in the query string get data or message body post data

2379297
public	protected
within the public protected private sections find some grouping logical to any users of the library and write a one-line comment in front of each group

2379326
min	max
i have found how to change the max and min image but not the bar itself

2379367
post	get
while researching this further i came across an interesting blog post that explains how to use a set to get faster sql performance from in clauses by creating list of ids into a common table expression cte and then joining on that

2379398
width	height
that s right the table height and width is dynamically calculated but you don t have to call writeselectedrows function

2379398
width	height
you have to set either height or width

2379415
innodb	myisam
default maximum key length is 1000 bytes for myisam and 3072 bytes for innodb with additional requirement that each column in the key should not exceed 767 bytes

2379415
innodb	myisam
if your table is innodb or myisam with a single-byte encoding then you can create the constraint alright

2379417
memcached	apc
it provides backends for use with a number of caching systems among them apc and memcached

2379506
min	max
you can use the same image for both the min and max parts

2379558
vmware	esx
vmware esx server is an interesting choice since it provides the settings i need including hot memory add however it seems like a closed system

2379587
udp	tcp
udp is a stateless protocol unlike tcp which is connection oriented

2379611
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
i also tried to use nsdatecomponents instead of nsdateformatter so i changed the code for saving date with

2379614
int	chars
when you create a class it is like creating your own type just like int chars etc

2379649
vmware	esx
i don t think vmware would support modifications to the server but you can get a command line on the esx server as essentially you re right it s linux underneath redhat mod i believe

2379717
folder	directory
my application has several folder however and each time i want a cfc to work i have to save it in the same directory as those files that need access

2379727
division	modulo
i have tested some things and for me mysql the division modulo in group by won t work

2379758
int	chars
if you don t have any problem that the file is plain text my suggestion would be to write to file using string c_str which returns a const chars as well as using itoa or itoa_s to get the int as a chars

2379768
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox google-chrome and opera on both platforms â results are practically the same

2379798
seam	ajax4jsf
it can be a bug in the view handler of mojarra that it should handle empty strings as well but it can also be a bug in the view handler of either ajax4jsf facelets or seam that it should never pass an empty string through up

2379803
hash	md5
or use a md5 digest kind of logic to use specific user params like generate a string username-email-id and hash it and send it in the email when the user clicks it again try to generate the key and match it against the user key

2379893
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview and there are 5 subviews on it with index

i m trying to toggle visiblity of the dropdownlistfor and textbox based on the check status of the checkbox

2379971
folder	directory
obviously i do not want to states directory itself to be re-copied each time i backup the folder so i need to somehow exclude it from the copy

2379982
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the installation of the new versioning should simulate the upgrade process where you can test your data migration to your new model

2380005
unsigned	short
that for unsigned short is hu

fileoutputstream	filewriter
without seeing your code this is guess work but most likely you are creating a new filewriter or fileoutputstream object each time you append but neglect to call close on these objects which eventually causes you to run out of file descriptors an os level resource that is independant from memory and thus not adequately handled by garbage collection requiring manual release

2380852
width	height
secondly the height and width of your video depend on the camera it is attached to

2380852
width	height
in other words if your camera is set to 320 by 240 then it will stay that way unless you change the camera s height and width

2380852
width	height
thus this means that you have to change your camera s height and width

2380963
listview	gridview
3 stackoverflow is mvc type app you are using webforms so you could use a gridview or a listview

2381008
division	subtraction

2381039
gridview	repeater
-planning on putting an asp repeater on the page that has an asp gridview in it

2381039

2381582
int	double
the way a double is stored is quite different to an int

2381643
stdout	stderr
or to swap the output from stderr and stdout over use -

2381643
stdout	stderr
this creates a new file descriptor 3 and assigns it to the same place as 1 stdout then assigns fd 1 stdout to the same place as fd 2 stderr and finally assigns fd 2 stderr to the same place as fd 3 stdout

2381643
stdout	stderr
stderr is now available as stdout and old stdout preserved in stderr

2381676
integer	unsigned
i remember something like that there was some bit at the beginning at the number so it tells whether the integer is unsigned or signed

2381697
integer	unsigned
wikipedia s page on signed number representation shows the most common memory implementations of both signed and unsigned integer values

2381708

2381822
stdout	fflush
it s fflush to stdout err of

2381848
post	get
the best way to solve the root cause is to not make it a get but a post request

2381872
button	checkbox
if you don t mind doing a postback the easiest way would be to add an eventhandler to the onclick event of the button and then manually set the ischecked property of the checkbox to false and the text property of the label to a blank string in the eventhandler

2381874
onchange	onkeyup
you can catch the majority of changes by firing your update checker onkeyup as well as onchange

for example i want an int or double matrix something like in java

2381930
hex	binary
the hex function will convert the binary value to a hex string which you can then iterate through with substr to build your integer value

2381932
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop adds 10 frogclass objects to an enemyarray arrays

2382095
awt	swing
awt was the first try on ui for java later swing provided a better alternative because they use light components the component draw the ui them selves instead of relaying on native code and those light components were way lot flexible and maintainable then awt

2382095
awt	swing
awt still has it s place as the underlying technology that interface swing and the os jcomponent inherits java.awt.container after all so its place in the low level of ui

2382095
awt	swing
are placed in awt package and they are used by swing components

2382386
post	get
it was actually erik from the post mentioned by r0manarmy who helped get those bits out there

2382423
width	height
one method that i found was to have a text area that begins with a smaller width and height and then to dynamically resize it

2382442
many-to-one	one-to-many
in fact we think that most associations are one-to-many and many-to-one you should be careful when using any other association style and ask yourself if it is really neccessary

2382445
int	boolean
you can store it as boolean or as int when there are more types of meals

2382460
getter	setter
public getter setter are bad if they provide access to implementation details

2382460
getter	setter
yet it is reasonable to provide access to object s properties and use getter setter for this

2382464
hide	show
also if i first hide the window and then show it it somehow forces the window to redraw and covers the taskbar immediately but it flickers because of the hiding

the code is working ok if i put it in asp.net page but when i use content page and post the code in part of the code will not work which is changing the value of ajax control properties

2382604
google-chrome	firefox
here s something that kind of works quickly tested in firefox 3.5 google-chrome 3 and ie 8 that you might be able to tailor to your needs

2382635
firefox	safari
but in my browser tested on firefox 3.6 and safari 4.0.4 and i m using jquery 1.4.2 it seems the response body is empty the response code is 200 and the headers otherwise look ok

2382637
formview	entitydatasource
on an aspx page is a formview bound to this entitydatasource

2382648
min	max
how would you iterate over a group of facts and find the one with the min max slot value

2382658
accessor	properties
it provides methods and properties accessor defined by these classes and the interfaces x y and z

2382662
getter	setter
looking at the classes in these libraries you will notice that very rarely there are setter and getter which are there just to expose some internal variable

2382662
getter	setter
so i think he has a point and it is this every time you press choose generate getter setter in eclipse or your ide of choice you should take a step back and wonder what you are doing

2382665
int	chars
if the platform has 32 bit int and 8 bit chars but is little endian and or doesn t support unicode and if the serial number can vary in length then the below may be useful though it s a little workmanlike

2382723
post	get
the get is for navigating to your entry form the post is called when the form post

2382731
put	get
you may be able to put this file in your port-80-accessible localhost folder if you have one and get the job done

2382765
hide	show
option one is to load each component into your parent container grid canvas whatever with visibility collapsed and then show and hide them as needed

2382766
width	height
when the load completes you can get the width and height of the loaded movies and adjust the x y position accordingly

2382800
children	parent
my challenge is that i can t figure out how to hide parent2 s children when the other parent children are being displayed

2382820
int	chars
so i decided to use chars to write int delimiters between int are and delimeters between sequences are n r which

2382884
disk	ram
this is exactly the origin quicksort back then there was not enough ram to sort in memory so they procedure is to store partial results in disk

2383096
put	get
their definition have to be known by all translation units that use them - so put their definition only in the header file in that case - not in both the .cpp and the header file - that will yield to the error you get

2383106
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
following that i d look to a framework - cakephp is simple to get up and running codeigniter and kohana are other options and symfony is quite popular

2383131
svcutil.exe	basichttpbinding
then you re fine with the basichttpbinding as is but you cannot access a soap service just like that from a webrequest with post - you need to use the soap client generated by visual studio or svcutil.exe on the command line

2383135
action-filter	onactionexecuting
couple of options off the top of my head use a common base controller that all your controllers inherit from which adds the info in the onactionexecuting method override or you could possibly use an action-filter if it is not required globally.

2383181
trac	bugzilla
it s far more user friendly than trac and bugzilla and allows anonymous submissions and plugins

i did some digging around and found a neat thread-safe ienumerator ilist implementation on alexey drobyshevsky s post on codeproject here

2383447
fiddler	charles
i prefer charles but any web debugging proxy fiddler included should help out

2383456
innodb	myisam
this works great in myisam but i would like to change this table to innodb all other db tables are innodb to take advantages of foreign-keys and avoid table level locking

2383456
min	max
i can t force a numeric autoinc id because records are deleted added all the time and a random min id max id prediction would probably miss rows lots of times

2383464
pull	push
you should be able to use normal push pull merge to get the changes back and forth

2383473

2383626
std	ostream
fwiw i recommend against using fwrite or std ostream write on classes structures and unions

2383647
uilabel	uitextview
uitextview is not exactly like a uilabel wrapped in a uiscrollview

2383647
uilabel	uitextview
just use a uilabel if you don t need any uitextview functionality

2383647
uilabel	uibutton
if you need hyperlinks overlay uibutton that look like hyperlinks over a uilabel

2383772
sorting	grouping
i m doing a sorting of a set of users i have 4 grouping like so 2 shown

2383802
int	double
one other thing to note with your code before you go back to us with a very similar question better remove the operator int and operator double functions

2383802
int	double
in the original situation you had your addition was ambiguous because there were operator+ double double and operator+ int int builtin operators considered and they were equally well

2383864
client-side	server-side
the obvious ones were client-side and server-side but it also allowed you to write both-side code which could run on both client and server because it didn t contain any special features and also asynchronous client-side which was used for writing non-blocking code on the client essentially a continuation monad on the client-side

2383944
accessor	properties
accessor properties like readonly

2384042
stdout	stderr
in glassfish v2.1 i could look at my web-applications log all stdout and stderr in the glassfish server log gf_home domains domain1 logs server.log

2384056
firefox	safari
a clue perhaps is that when i open on firefox or safari on mac os x i don t see any dates

2384056
puts	gets
actually safari puts the date time that i opened the feed beside each element. but somehow google reader gets the unique dates for each element

2384074
rss	feed
if you look at the raw source of the rss feed at open in a web browser and view the source you ll see they did not include a date element

2384074
rss	feed
there s no special properties of rss feed to get this value when it simply isn t there

2384114
min	max
i am running a query that returns average sales max sales and min sales for a certain period -

2384114
min	max
but there are some values coming through in the min and max that are really extreme - perhaps because the data entry was bad perhaps because some anomoly had occurred on that date and store

2384114
min	max
what i d like is a query that returns average max and min but somehow excludes the extreme values

2384159
post	get
when i do the template reverts to my custom index and i get no post

2384604
super	self
form super baseinlineformset self ._construct_form i kwargs

2384658
width	height
this is not related in the direction of the loop in any way but rather to the fact that the in the original construct the loop control conditions implied dereferencing the img object to index to its width or height property for each and single iteration in the loops whereby the second construct evaluates these properties only once

2384661
width	height
it s not the loop reversal that speeds things up -- it s the fact that you re accessing the width and height properties far fewer times

2385919
serializable	deserialization
.net remoting does have its limitations such as events and external clients outside a different network cannot access the server internally on a different network because of the usage of sockets to communicate with each other on the network in that the serializable deserialization of marshalbyref objects are tied to the network itself and hence cannot be accessed externally with a firewall in place.

2385919
serializable	deserialization
modify the mono s sources for the remoting framework to remove the limitation and implement events...but afaik there is a snag with the serializable deserialization of marshalbyref objects in that they are not 100 compatible with remoting s serializable deserialization

2386015
getter	setter
in general classes are much less likely to have important code in their getter methods than their setter but it s still possible that accessing directly could break something in a future version of cocoa touch

2386018
innodb	myisam
note on version 5.5 it works on myisam but not innodb

2386022
getter	setter
the self keyword indicates that you are using the property getter setter instead of accessing the value directly

2386022
getter	setter
in case you let the getter setter be auto-generated using synchronize you have to use self in the first example because the object is retained there instead of simply pointer-assigned

2386039
min	max
in that case you will see a index full scan min max step in the explain plan meaning that the data will be retrieved directly from the index

2386039
min	max
the keys are ordered in an index so reading the first or last key gives you the min max

2386060
mouseup	mousedown
i noticed that the change in sort occurs after control has left the mouseup event - so something somewhere seems to be altering my grid state after mousedown mouseup have finished

2386072
implements	extends
you can extends blackberry controls with custom drawing or implements own one extends field class

2386097
unsigned	short
in the c++ definition you use a pointer to a short unsigned int while in the c# method you use a ushort

2386163
decoder	encoder
and to the decoder encoder you register a class alias

2386225
suppressfinalize	finalizer
you can suppressfinalize in dispose method in which case system will not call that object s finalizer otherwise it will

2386253
getter	setter
i think that i may have to fix my bindable richtextbox so that it maintains two flowdocument objects the one exposed to the world by its document getter and setter and the one inside the control itself

2386297
submit	submission
what i m trying to do is to use javascript on page loading to make each link a trigger for a form post submission ie adding an onclick handler for each link and doing a submit on a form on the bottom of the page with an hidden field containing the opid

2386644
strdup	malloc
i ve never used malloc to store more than values but i have to use strdup to order the lines of an input file and i dont get a way to make it work

2386644
put	get	strdup	malloc
i though using strdup to get a pointer to each line and later put each one into a space according to the number of lines reserved with malloc

2386649
singleton	facade
more generically some of the design patterns in gof catalogue will also suit you such as singleton for run-once facade for abstracting the processing logic strategy for different processing logic state machine maybe for the daemon

2386658
post	get
the javascript bit in asynchronous javascript and xml is rather important as it is the javascript that manipulates the page clientside so even if you were able to do an asynchroneus post to the server and get a result back - it wouldn t be possible for you to update the page content

2386685
sorting	filtering
i mean the filtering and displaying is good but paging and sorting doesnt work

2386794
int	double
the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real number

2386810
unicode	ucs
it also is the ucs value of ã in the unicode system

2386810
unicode	ucs
if you use string literal ã and get a string of two characters the string is in fact encoded in utf-8 and you may wish to parse the utf-8 coding to acquire unicode ucs values

2386813
width	height
each cell s width can be assign.but the height cannot

2386815

2386844
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup events

2386844
keydown	keyup
the only thing i can think of is a very tiny performance decrease as it needs to check for event handles on the form for each keydown keyup keypressed

2386845
nunit	mstest
in my current config every 60 seconds i am checking out the trunk using subversion running msbuild then either nunit or mstest

2386864
next	except
the next times the program should do the same except

2386882
int	double
of course sometimes even double isn t accurate enough hence we sometimes have long double 1 the above example gives 9.000000000000000066 on mac but all floating point types suffer from round-off errors so if precision is very important money processing you should use int or a fraction class

2386908
umask	chdir
detach chdir setsid umask

2386908
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 9.10

2386910
config	ini
with them you buy yourself the ability to support ini yaml xml apache-style config and more

2386952
lxml	elementtree
you now have a difficult-to-debug module that looks like it has lxml s elementtree in it but really has elementtree instead

2386953
postgresql	mysql
i don t really know hoe mysql optimizes queries but from postgresql i do know that you should explain a query on a database approximately the same in size and data as the real database

2386977

so i created a class extended the sprite class and now in the constructor i am trying to set the sprite s width and height properties which are inherited from the displayobject

2387210
width	height
when i view the livedocs i see that displayobject has width and height listed as public properties

2387210
width	height
i have been able to instantiate a sprite directly and set the width and height after it s been instantiated so i don t get it

2387231
gitorious	gitosis	gitolite	gitosis	gitolite	gitorious
more suited for collabrative development than gitosis or gitolite but open-source is gitorious

2387236
nsdata	nserror
the solution was to use avaudioplayer and the method id initwithdata nsdata data error nserror outerror

2387246
post	get
urllib2 only supports http get and post there might be workarounds but if your app depends on other http verbs you will probably prefer a different module

2387414
hex	binary
the hex manipulator only controls how a value is read - it is always stored using the same internal binary representation

2387422
google-chrome	firefox
it only loads the first drop down in google-chrome and doesnt load any in firefox

2387457
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are pretty much just addition and subtraction

2387470
mouse	keyboard
but it will also have a separate item that is under cursor movable with mouse keyboard

2387473
google-chrome	firefox
why should notepad++ have a set of tabs and google-chrome and firefox and internet explorer yes i have been known to run all 4 along with dev studios docking view various paint programs

2387475
force.com	salesforce
note that the error doesn t happen when you run the tests from eclipse force.com ide but it does happen when you deploy to salesforce and then run the tests from within salesforce

2387490
pull	push
c can push the branch to github where a can pull it again

2387498
subtraction	addition
for example addition and subtraction is now o n

2387514
waitpid	fork
just use standard system calls fork waitpid kill .

2387525
public	protected
herb sutter recommends making them either public and virtual most common case or protected and non-virtual depending on what you want to do with them

2387551
jruby	mri
jruby immediately copied the api wayne meissner wrote two c extensions for mri and yarv tinyrb supports it ironruby macruby and maglev will pretty soon

2387551
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
so if you use ffi you won t have to write a single line of c and your library will automatically work on mri yarv jruby and rubinius and in the future also on ironruby macruby and maglev

2387575
ubuntu	debian
the os there is debian i use ubuntu

2387587
rss	feed
mercurial itself provides rss feed no need to count on the ci system for those -- they re better and producing test pass fail feed and build release feed

2387640
versioning	upgrade
an upgrade of mysql to versioning 5.1.20 so i don t think this is likely to happen for me

2387647
int	double
if we try to exchange their exception specification such that a f throws int and double while b f throws only int the error does not appear

2387659
put	get
if i put a space at the beginning i get all 7 courses but no highlighting

2387674
lsp	principles
having a wider specification in the derived class breaks lsp liskov substitution principles

2387674
int	double
to expand on point 2 a s callers expect that only int comes out but if you use a b which because it s publicly derived from a also means it s usable as an a suddenly double can come out too and that would break a s contract that only int gets thrown

2387765
backwards-compatibility	legacy
node.js implements all i o libraries itself all event-based without backwards-compatibility or legacy requirements

2387845
client-side	server-side
the ui is an untrusted layer it is always possible for somebody to bypass your client-side validation and in some cases your server-side ui validation

2387917
subnet	packets
the announcements can be simple udp packets that get broadcast every so often to the subnet which other peers listen for

2387978
maven	m2e
within eclipse assuming you have m2e installed right-click on the module in question and choose run as - maven package

2388011
int	double
sadly .net generics doesn t support a numerical type contraint so you will have to implement a different version of the following function for decimal int double etc

2388032
equals	tostring
i use the above approach sometimes too but it s easier to just override equals on the objects for which you want to compare semantic equality audit and provide an appropriate tostring override that makes it clear what changed

2388047
flac	wma	flac	ogg
from the id3v1 v2 ogg flac wma

2388057
executable	upx
if you are really serious about doing this you could check what executable packers like upx do

2388062
haskell	ocaml
note that - like in ocaml or haskell - whitespace can also be used quite comprehensively

2388072
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would say to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events to prevent the extra parameters but for some reason jsbin doesn t think it is a function

2388103
tolower	toupper
i personally haven t evaluated each for performance but tolower and toupper aren t supported in linq to sql so it seems like compare is a good candidate

2388139
jobs	cron
the default environment for cron jobs is very sparse and may be very different from the environment you develop your python scripts in

2388147
firefox	safari
firefox 3.6 and apparently the latest safari maybe webkit nightly support this through html5

2388161
for-loop	loops
if you want it to compile without those warnings though you could turn the inner loops into a standard for-loop which only uses loopcount as a bound

2388237
children	parent
i need to be able to link tasks to other tasks a task can have multiple children and multiple parent

2388242
post	get
perhaps you could post the stack trace so we can get some more information

2388253
ant	maven
in the past i had a specific use case where maven completely broke down on me but ant gave me the flexibility i needed so i ended up attached to ant but i m thinking maybe i was just taking the wrong approach

2388272
folder	directory
your problem may be related to the fact that iis reloads the web service application if the directory or files contained in the main folder changes

2388285
ant	maven
maven seems to be difficult to comprehend for many people socialized on ant as it apparently requires a very different way of thinking

2388294
pop-up	dialog
once the download is done you can pop-up a dialog box telling user that you are ready for update

2388308
yourkit	jprofiler
i ve used jprofiler and yourkit on linux

2388320
ant	maven
if you have an existing ant file what is the best way to convert the project to maven

2388336
put	get
in other words the payment gateway should probably work like paypal in the respect that you put in the credit card information once and you get back a token key which you can safely store in the site s database since this token can only be used to transfer money from the associated card to the account for which the token key was originally created

2388422
allocator	stl
you can change how memory is allocated for stl containers with the combination of allocator template type and the allocator object passed to the constructor

2388434
width	height
i also avoided the height property in favour of contentheight as i found a strange issue with the image tag whereby i had to set its height to a value i only wanted to set the width really in order for the resize effect to actually do anything

2388558
int	chars
with big int support 431 necessary chars

2388558
realloc	malloc
note do not remove without at least prototyping malloc realloc as doing so will not be safe on 64-bit platforms 64-bit void will be converted to 32-bit int

2388565
equals	gethashcode
i am currently implementing a spec framework in f# and i want to hide the equals gethashcode etc

2388569
int	boolean
notice that c# does not allow boolean logic operators to be used on int

2388569
int	boolean
if you want to convert int to boolean you ll have to write code to do that as i have here

2388574
bbpress	buddypress
therefore bbpress and buddypress doesn t quite hit the mark

2388574
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter does not have an auth library however kohana does

2388599
google-chrome	safari
this works as expected in safari but does not work in google-chrome on a mac or a pc

2388683
ant	maven
in other words do not use the ide to build your ear but rather use a tool like maven or ant which are ide agnostic

2388683
ant	maven
given your actual toolset which is far from ideal there is not much community support for the tools you are using my recommendation would be to use ant or maven if you have some knowledge of it for the build and hudson for the continuous integration because it s extremely easy to install and to use and it has a dimensions plugin

you can often keep the association as a one-way relationship by letting the children raise events instead of explicitly referencing their parent

2393129
wxpython	pyqt
to my tastes it seems that wxpython s tutorial the new one in wiki form is what i m pointing to and recommending is really good and pyqt s not bad at all

2393142
width	height
it seems you might have to modify the height and width

2393155
superclass	subclassing
i also propose it since i think it makes much more sense to group superclass together and make sure superclass are defined before subclassing -- otherwise your module won t even be importable

2393161
activemq	rabbitmq
when you use a message queue like rabbitmq beanstalkd activemq ibm mq series tuxedo you expect different and more fault tolerant results

2393194
folder	directory
this folder is located in my src directory so when it is compiled the folder is copied into bin

2393282
range	minimum
openal concept of gain is relative in range of minimum 0.0 and maximum 1.0 its depend on your sound system o s sound card amplifier etc to map how db to apply to 1.0 value

2393288
screens	tablet
in the end our users ended up using the tablet just like a regular laptop with the keyboard not the touch screens

2393324
getter	setter
that s fairly rare btw lots of control property getter and setter generate a windows message to ask the native window control for the property value

2393330
children	parent
since each child is a person it can have a parent or its own children

2393354
children	parent
you must first disconnect the grid2 from its parent and then add it to the children of gridcontent like this

2393358
mbunit	nunit
for web tests i use selenium and then for testing the backend i will use nunit mbunit

2393371
voip	sip
actually we are doing thesis work where we need to make 10 voip phones which are sip based connected with each other.so they can call and talk among each other.also we want to add video calls access.another question is it possible video calls on sip

2393417
put	get
put it together and what do you get

2393441
actionscript	mxml
if it makes a difference my buttonbar is not defined in mxml but is instantiated in actionscript and an arraylist is assigned to the dataprovider property of my buttonbar instance

2393450
clang	llvm
it looks like you are trying to use clang llvm to compile your iphone project

2393453
disk	ram
you can throw faster hardware at it ssds or ram disk would be a good place to start

2393497
rss	feed
all sorts of version control wiki rss feed sourceforge.net

2393542
post	get
i believe forgery protection does not fire off for get requests only post delete and puts

2393555
put	get
i think its search option has one choice where it says get products tagged with gives you a box to put in your idea of what a tag could be which shows you a dropdown of tags it finds matching - same as stackoverflow

2393564
int	chars	int	double
valid types are primitives int double byte chars etc. and of course objects such as string or calendar or whatever class you might be using

2393590
rss	feed
another one that s recently sparked some interest and seems potentially useful i m in beta easy to get in afaik is flowdock which is basically a mish-mash of email alerts rss feed ticketing systems and plain ol realtime chat with status messages et al

2393654
put	get
it seems like what you need to do is get rid of all the positioning stuff and just set margins on it to put it in the middle of the page or whatever you re trying to do

2393681
sorting	filtering
when we re doing sorting filtering it appends to url additional query-keys

2393685
maven	m2e
i m using m2e as my maven 2 plugin for eclipse

2393685
maven	pom.xml
however if i import as an existing maven project or use mvn eclipse eclipse and then import i get the artifacts not found in my pom.xml file resulting in no maven dependencies being loaded at all

2393685
children	parent
what s odd is that i have 2 projects both children to a parent pom packaged project

2393685
maven	pom.xml
one child loads all my maven dependencies while the other cannot find any and says my pom.xml file is missing artifacts

2393685
maven	pom.xml
as soon as i remove the dependency of projecta from projectb s pom.xml file all the maven dependencies are found by eclipse

2393726
inherited	subclassing
if you have access to code before any subclassing is loaded then you can use inherited method

2393768
gentoo	ubuntu
gentoo has a program eselect which is for just this kind of thing listing versions of programs and setting the default ubuntu may have something analogous

2393793
maven	m2e
i had problems with using m2e it did not appear to be installed at all but i develop a project using iam - maven plugin for eclipse supported by eclipse foundation or hosted or something like that

2393810
maven	m2e
it sounds like your m2e install is using the embedded maven which has its own repository located under user home and settings

2393824
switching	screens
i understand how to switching views from say the home screens

2393839
nsmutablestring	nsstring
thus at runtime you ll note that you never actually have an instance of nsstring or nsmutablestring but only instances of subclasses which actually aren t really subclasses.

2393839
nsmutablestring	nsstring
and those subclasses -- the implementation class used at runtime -- overrides almost all of the methods of nsstring and nsmutablestring to provide highly optimized implementations of the specific operations

2393843
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to use the following code to make an image fadeout and only when it s faded out change its source and then make it fadein again

2393847
width	height
this is the best result i have which only fills the width of the screen not the height

2393868
hide	show
the only thing i found that worked to refresh the position of the nav bar was to hide it and show it again like this

2393876
for-loop	if-statement
rewrite the for-loop to check for already-uncompressed files to be a single if-statement

2393888
put	get
i m trying to update a random-access binary file using the std iostream interface with separate get put positions managed via seekg seekp

2393888
put	get
everything works fine with stringstream but when i create a file descriptor-based stream using boost.iostream specifically boost iostreams stream boost iostreams file_descriptor the get put positions are no longer independent

2393888
stringstream	fstream
i gather from web searches that stringstream seems to be independent but that fstream may not be

2393941
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml and beautifulsoup attempt to mimic this level of stupidity so they are the correct tools to use

2393971
rubygems	bundler
it requires rubygems 1.3.6 so do gem update --system and gem install bundler then create the gemfile

2393978
ubuntu	linux
when i compile in 64 bit linux environment with the compile gcc ubuntu 4.4.1-4ubuntu9 4.4.1 it shows the following warning mostly

2393989
nunit	mstest
jim implented a version of assert.throws for mstest at the same time as he did the original implementation for nunit nunit has included in subsequent releases mstest has not its still possible to use though

2393989
nunit	mstest
nunit can run tests in 32 and 64 bit mstest only runs them in 32 bit iirc

2393989
nunit	mstest
correct there is a lot of misconception that mstest is the same as nunit but mstest is a generalized framework

2393991
int	boolean
evalueates to boolean but evaluates to int as assignments always evaluate to the assigned values

2394011
int	chars
the strchr function in the c standard library looks for a chars in a string but its signature takes an int for the search chars

2394011
int	chars
in these two implementations i found the implementation casts this int to a chars

2394012
mouse	keyboard
value due to mouse or keyboard

2394015
disk	ram
no hit to the disk everything is in ram

2394023
int	chars
in c the type of a chars literal is int

2394026
int	chars
in some situations in the c library such as the getc function an int value is returned for the chars read from input

2394031
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your rubygems versioning this is fixed as of rubygems 1.3.6

2394035
ddms	adb
in general use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to look at the java stack trace associated with the force close dialog to see what the problem is

2394046
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the changed property from freezable class is not included - use inotifypropertychanged and or inotifycollectionchanged instead

2394062
prng	random
by definition a prng pseudorandom number generator cannot generate truly random numbers

2394093
getter	setter
you can use a tween to advance the play head add a getter and setter that will change the play head

2394106
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
i m working on a web app where i support dragging on the page by simply watching for mousedown mousemove mouseup events

2394121
int	chars
when the parameters are undeclared whenever you pass a chars value as an argument this value is implicitly converted to int and actually physically passed as an int

2394121
int	chars
in order to preserve and reproduce the traditional functionality of strchr as described above we have no other choice but to declare the parameter of strchr as an int and explicitly convert it to chars inside the function

2394121
int	double
all these functions will be declared with parameters of type int or double instead

2394121
int	chars
an argument formerly declared as chars is now written as int

2394132
bazaar	git
git and mercurial are distributed rcss like bazaar that have tools for hooks including different approaches to branch-specific hooks and global hooks

2394168
boost	stl
you can use lexecal_cast from boost then c itoa and of course stringstream from stl

2394174
postgresql	mysql
as database backend you can use mysql if the structure is simple but for more complex databases i d use postgresql as the mysql performance seems to drop fast with increasing complexity subjective opinion

2394192
bmp	png
i m having a lot of difficulty creating and writing bmp or png images in java

2394192
bmp	png
java says png bmp and others are supported on my system according to the filetypessupported method

2394192
bmp	png
here is my code for if i were to write a png with a lot snipped out and the bmp writing

2394197
getter	setter
for example calling setproperty or getproperty on the object would be slower than using an integer -- especially if that property is bound to a getter or setter method

2394200
integer	unsigned
the reason that the type is called uintptr_t is because the type is an unsigned integer value that is the same width as a pointer

2394249
opera	google-chrome
using the code below both google-chrome and opera latest versions supporting border-radius on mac show a small blue area outside the rounded corners which seems to a part of the defined background-image

2394260
width	height
if i increment the width and i recalculate the height according to the incremented width ratio sometimes i get xxx.5 decimals for the width

2394260
width	height
ex. width 4 height 2

2394281
implements	extends
this can happen when class a depends on object of class interface d which will be returned by b from factory method which will be object of class interface c which extends implements d

2394298
google-chrome	firefox
ok this works in firefox ie8 and google-chrome

2394302
width	height
the next biggest image has width w + w g and height h + h g

2394303
integer	fractions
now if you want the next largest integer fractions with the same ration then multiple the numerator and denominator by d+1

2394331
implements	modifiers
what you have to implements is that event processing object which will according to an even and modifiers call the right behaviour event+modifier handler

2394370
width	height
i want the scrollbars of the scrollviewer to show up when i zoom in enough such that the canvas is no longer visible in the scrollviewer area but it seems that they only show up depending on the width height of the canvas itself regardless of whether it is zoomed in or not

2394391
put	get
okay so i have a website where the user can put a search query into a form that uses get to send the data

2394431
hash	salt
algorithm salt hash

2394431
hash	salt
the algorithm is sha1 the salt which was generated randomly is 63a11 and the crypted hash is 85a93f217a72212b23fb0d5b95f3856db9575c1a

2394431
hash	salt
you simple concatenate the salt and the raw password and hash it with the algorithm in this case sha1

2394472
lxml	beautifulsoup
for a table that s simply logically broken though it may look ok when rendered the browser and therefore selenium may be just as helpless as lxml or beautifulsoup

2394473
button	checkbox
like checkbox radio button div

2394478
folder	directory
you could also put folder monitoring software on the severs that keep certain directory in sync

2394481
int	chars
which assumes that the primary key column is an 11 chars int rather than a 36 chars string so running migrations produces a correct database but test database is generated incorrectly and if i were to run rake db schema load it would fail as well.

2394483
google-chrome	firefox
ubuntu 9.10 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5.0.307.11

2394483
google-chrome	firefox
windows xp firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4.0.249.89 ie 8

2394581
std	ostream
shape put std ostream const

2394589
width	height
however the ones you mention name width and height are all common to tcontrol and it should not be necessary to cast to access these

2394612
put	get
off the top of my head and without trying it you should be able to put the resources in with the source files which will get netbeans to put them into the jar file

2394626
width	height
note if fixedsize true is indeed set in your code then it also means that you have set width and height values for some or all of your nodes

2394626
width	height
as long as you change the fixedsize value to false you do not have to change the height and width values because with fixedsize set to false these values just set the initial minimum height and width values passed to the layout algorithm.

2394640
fseek	fread
that said if you read a block at a time you do save on call overheads to the fseek and fread functions

2394649
getter	setter
you must implement the property getter and setter by hand.

2394672
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but not on firefox nor ie

2394772
phpdoc	codesniffer
no idea if it s any help but if codesniffer can point out the functions methods then a decent php ide i offer phped can easily inspect and scaffold the phpdoc comments for each function

2394788
put	get
the first is that if you put those integers back together you ll get

2394834
min	max
how do i set the background color for the entire slider not just from the min or max to the selected value

2394889
range	minimum
you can leave either datetime value null or perhaps set it to maximum or minimum value to represent half-infinite range like after 1900

2394890
google-chrome	firefox
eta 3 current tests indicate a speed savings using offsetwidth rather than getcalculatedstyle currentstyle of 2ms 1.8 in google-chrome and 24ms 4.3 in firefox which isn t the 10 i wanted for a solid bounty win

2394894
onclick	onkeyup
the on... attributes that is - onclick onkeyup etc

2394902
spss	hmisc
as usual i got some spss file that i ve imported into r with spss.get function from hmisc package

2394933
try-catch	exception-handling
you catch exception-handling with a try-catch block

2394948
width	height
the height and width of the image

2394949
inline	inlining
there isn t much you can do about that except not request inlining of functions that cannot be inline

2394956
for-loop	arrays
i have code in java that should make multiple objects within a for-loop then add each object into an arrays

2394956
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
however the code just copies the same which is the last in the for-loop object into each index i in the arrays once loops ends

2394970
fseek	fgetc
just relax and use fseek and fgetc which are designed and implemented exactly to solve your problem

2394970
hfs+	ntfs
of course if you re stuck with ntfs or hfs+ it s just going to be slow

2394970
fgetc	fread
if you use fgetc instead of fread to read single bytes you can save about 20 on small benchmarks

2394986
children	parent
my goal is to have a tree view where the parent is just a text block and all the children are check boxes but only one child can be checked at a time

2394991
min	max
max value is 60 min is 0

2394995
hide	show
this might be an artifact of the hide show animation since you use a duration

2394995
slideup	slidedown
if you try a different animation like slideup slidedown it works fine

2394996
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and this html5 vedio can be show on firefox and google-chrome but not safari

2395113
vsto	add-in
i m aiming to develop a vsto add-in that will allow a user to select one or more custom slide shows and then export the slide shows to their desktop and i m looking for some code to help get me on my way

2395139
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd
when you talk about kernels for unix-y operating systems like linux solaris mac os x netbsd freebsd etc

2395159
unix	bsd
src unix you can confirm this by reading lions commentary on unix or the bsd 4.4-lite which is similar to bsd net 2 which is available in tarball or via cvs from freebsd

2395181
outputstream	inputstream
copy is a method on the outputstream interface that causes it to drain the provided inputstream of all input

2395186
postgresql	mysql
2008 postgresql since version 8.2 mysql and h2

2395207
post	get
i m writing a little project which interacts with a set of servers using http 1.1 get and post

2395216
free	malloc
i can t just iterate over every key value and use free on them cause maybe some of them weren t malloc d by any programmer in the first place and i don t need to free them

2395216
strdup	malloc
in point one my suggestion was to use strdup or malloc to fix that specific problem while introducing another but that also don t look very modular to me

2395224
chunked	transfer-encoding
try sending them in chunks along with transfer-encoding chunked

2395231
post	get
a much older one was posted on comp.sources.misc in four consecutive post years ago -- i m pretty sure it d take a fair amount of work to get it to compile with a current c++ compiler

2395257
octal	decimal
each succeeding i reads and converts one integer using the normal c-style convention that if the number starts with 0x it ll be converted as hexadecimal otherwise if there s a leading 0 it ll be converted as octal and otherwise it ll be converted as decimal

2395262
jstl	taglib
jsp allows you to interact with backend via el expressions while producing html output and to use taglib like jstl to control the flow

2395263
integer	unsigned
that is the value returned by your hashing function - apparently an unsigned integer

2395263
free	malloc
i can t just iterate over every key value and use free on them cause maybe some of them weren t malloc d by any programmer in the first place and i don t need to free them

2395263
strdup	malloc
in point one my suggestion was to use strdup or malloc to fix that specific problem while introducing another but that also don t look very modular to me

2395269
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the underlying problem is that you are using a new objectoutputstream to write to an existing objectinputstream that you have already used a prior objectoutputstream to write to

2395283
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
prefer encapsulation over inherited having each of your current subclassing contain a complex properties with all the common fields

2395344
jstl	taglib
then to determine it you ll have to play a bit round with jstl functions taglib

2395355
libjpeg	libpng
i m trying to compile a project that uses both libjpeg and libpng

2395355
zlib	libpng
i know that libpng needs zlib so i compiled all the three independently and put them libjpeg.a libpng.a and libz.a on a folder called linrel32

2395357
folder	directory
just put it in the working directory or system32 folder

2395371
zlib	libpng
so it pulls the code from libpng and since it makes calls to zlib now there are references to the zlib functions

2395372
lisp	scheme
i stumbled upon this question while searching for circular lists lisp scheme

2395403
postgresql	mysql
i currently have a news website setup in php mysql that s a bit old and i m in the process of migrating it to a new django site that uses postgresql 8.4 and psycopg2

2395405
srand	math.h
srand is in stdlib.h not math.h

2395405
prng	random
if speed and security is not a concern you can store the current prng state in persistent memory and restart from that point when a random number is required

2395408
width	height
getpaneldimensions width 1024 height 768 bpp 16

2395425
folder	directory
if that s not an option you can use a virtual directory on each machine that points to one folder on one of the machines but then you lose redundancy

2395432
lisp	scheme
for example a double linked list data structure is circular in the scheme lisp point of view if you try to print the cons-structure out you get backreferences cycles

2395432
lisp	scheme
so it s not really about having data structures that look like rings any data structure where you have some kind of backpointers is circular from the scheme lisp perspective

2395432
lisp	scheme
that s the killer feature of double linked lists which are circular in the scheme lisp context

2395435
folder	directory
when deploying the app you need to copy the qt libraries it links against to the application folder on windows or you need to copy them to the app directory and launch it via a wrapper script which adds that directory to ld_library_path on linux.

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence and associativity does not tell you what happens before and what happens after

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity has nothing to do with it

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity simply tells you which operands belong to which operators

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity is this case simply tells you that the latter interpretation is correct and the former is incorrect ++ applies to b and not to the result of

2395445
associativity	operator-precedence
operator-precedence associativity once again has noting to do with what happens first and what happens next

2395465
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create a write only file in c on linux ubuntu

2395472
octal	decimal
this is seldom a coherent set of permissions in your example it appears that decimal 12 octal 014 was on the stack

2395479
put	get
i usually put things like this that will get called multiple times in a separate function bindhoverevent in the below example

2395516
rss	feed
it seems like what you need is to refresh the data source for the uitableview when the parser reaches the end of the rss feed

2395521
int	chars
under c++ it is unique built-in type like chars or int so you can legally overload void foo short x and void foo wchar_t x

2395584
unsigned	short
i have an unsigned short that represents a bit pattern i would like an array of bool 16 that has true or false set for the corresponding bit in the unsigned short

2395584
unsigned	short
where binary 2 is an unsigned short that has the bit pattern i wish to unpack

2395622
client-side	server-side
widget library integration to toscawidgets is a bonus providing automated server-side and with certain add-ons client-side validation and type coercion

2395622
django	turbogears
webcore and turbogears utilize standard wsgi middleware layers and provide helpful accessors for shared features while django takes the â œbatteries includedâ approach

2395662
width	height
the image retains it s aspect ratio and resizes it s width according to the height resizing

2395680
unsigned	short
you have an unsigned short and an array of bools

2395724
typedef	struct
typedef struct

2395740
nsstring	nserror
i am using the nsurlrequest class in my iphone app and the method that calls it returns an nsstring which is great for when the connection goes through ok but the issue is i need to convert the nserror into an nsstring so i can either return it back or run some if statements on it

2395741
udp	tcp
basically if you need guaranteed in-order delivery of your data than you are going to re-implement tcp on top of udp

2395741
udp	tcp
if the only reason you use udp is latency then you can probably use tcp and disable the nagle algorithm

2395741
udp	tcp
i would recommend steven s unix network programming which has a section on advanced udp and when it s appropriate to use udp instead of tcp

2395786
free	memcpy
those codes does not include bound checking and free allocated data don t forget to delete the returned buffer from serialize function and also you can use memcpy instead of using loop to copy byte per byte into or from std vector

2395918
udp	tcp
generally socks requires configuration on each client and isn t transparent to applications system-wide socket socksification isn t installed enabled by default on windows while nat even without upnp mostly works transparently and without any additional client configuration for outgoing tcp sockets and outgoing udp

2395925
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
openfiledialog savefiledialog

2395956
int	double
suppose you find that a lot of uses of foo take numeric types int double etc and you keep having to write code that unwraps these numbers adds or multiplies them and then wraps them back up

2395959
postgresql	mysql
i don t know enough about the internal row-versioning mechanisms of mysql or indeed if there is one but other databases oracle postgresql and more recently sql server have invested a lot of effort into allowing writers to not block readers in so far as readers have access to the version of the rows that existed immediately before the update write process started

2395970
groupbox	panel
panel or groupbox

2395975
folder	directory
you can add in your current java project a linked folder pointing to that new directory

2395975
folder	directory
since you can have several source folder simply declare that new directory as a source folder and you are done

2395995
width	height
it seems that the root view of a nib file does not allow you to specify flexible width and flexible height for the autoresizing mask in interface builder at least not as of 3.2

2395996
switching	screens
...if i change the position of one of my objects...then after switching to the other changing activeobject i got the other view on the screens after all switches .

2395998
ilist	iqueryable
in other words i would like nhibernate to return iqueryable instead of a simple ilist when i access a collection

2396038
pyopengl	pyglet
pyglet s gl api is nowhere near as nice as pyopengl s - pyglet s is at the raw ctypes layer which means you ll need to learn ctypes as well

2396042
width	height
but i can t set width height etc + i need to integrate it into my system i use php mysql jquery

width	height
you can do this pretty easily by cloning the image then removing the height and width attributes to get the real values

2396043
width	height
you also have to then insert the changed image into the page or else it wont have a calculated height width

2396047
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
they display correctly in firefox ie and opera but doesn t work in google-chrome and safari

since caching is a common concept there is a number of implementations to pick from like apc memcached and abstraction layers like zend_cache pear s cache or cachelite

2396067
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are the obvious options for an ngo i presume cost is a consideration but both sql server and oracle come in free if restricted express editions

2396120
width	height
it keeps state for an inputs text value but the principle could easily be used for your width and height

2396120
width	height
i would create a custom object that stores the original object s id width and height

2396120
width	height
when required to restore the value simply loop the array of custom objects to match id and bingo an object with the original width and height

2396128
folder	directory
however if that isn t what you want just follow the same directory structure above under the application folder

2396132
g++	gcc
edit this works with g++ --std c++0x gcc --version is 4.4.3

2396311
wordpress	joomla
from my experience - i have a lot with wordpress and some with joomla - i would recommend at least some php knowledge and understanding of the underlying code base

2396311
wordpress	joomla
if you want to increase your market value getting into the wordpress codex and either joomla or drupal is certainly a good idea

2396312
wordpress	joomla
note i don t know about wordpress nor joomla but have worked with drupal for quite some time

2396344

2396697
submit	submission
the user experience i m trying to achieve is that when a user submit the form i ll check to see if they have granted a specific permission and if not prompt them for the permission before submission the form

2396697
onclick	onsubmit
as i mentioned this js function works perfectly as an onclick action but fails as an onsubmit action so i m pretty sure that this has something to do with how javascript treats onsubmit actions

2396704
put	get
if you construct a bidirectional_seekable boost iostreams device it will support two separate get put positions which can be modified with the help of the iostreams seek function

2396725
int	boolean
strpos returns an int or boolean false

2396744
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i m just getting started with qt programming and i m trying to make a simple tabular data layout using a qtableview control with a model class of my own creation inheriting from qabstracttablemodel

2396760
stdout	stderr
linux typically reserves handles 0 1 and 2 for stdin stdout and stderr respectively

2396767
x86	64bit
on solaris x86 the x87 fpu is likely to be using its default precision of 64bit extended precision hence the difference

2396772
post	get
when talking about some of them being more dangerous than others i would indeed separate _get and _request as it includes _get out from _post as it is slightly harder to generate manipulate a post request than a get request

2396772
post	get
anybody who understands the difference between get and post or how unsanitized inputs might be exploitable won t hesitate for a second to fire up tamper data

2396784
cos	sin
to address kirk s concerns all of the solutions based on the recurrence for cos and sin boil down to computing

2396789
freebsd	linux
i want to differentiate between freebsd and linux

2396800
submit	submission
when you attach the same function to the submit handler the function returns before facebook stuff gets actually executed and it does without returning false causing the form to proceed with submission earlier than you want it to

2396800
submit	submission
what you need to do is return false at the end of your onsubmit function to prevent submission and give time to facebook stuff to finish and then manually submit form at places you want it to be submitted by calling

2396860
for-loop	loops
you did it inside the for-loop but its local scope lasts just for the body of loops

2396872
for-loop	loops
in c++ the scope of a variable declared in a for-loop is loops

2396902
rss	feed
parse the rss and later output an atom feed

2396932
google-chrome	firefox
this was proven true in google-chrome developer tools and firefox firebug

2396935
google-chrome	firefox
no they are not downloaded not at least in firefox ie8 and google-chrome

2397201
pop-up	dialog
the following code placed in my template pop-up the alerts but no permission dialog

2397214
put	get
what s really going to kill your memory management is if you get fragmentation where you might all of a sudden have a bunch of memory but still nowhere to put your objects not enough contiguous space

2397232
piston	tastypie
- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie

2397286
google-chrome	safari
if it doesn t seem to work in google-chrome or safari then it s most likely just a symptom of an error you have elsewhere

2397304
postgresql	mysql
with torque i can define a database with mysql well i use postgresql but mysql is supported too and torque can then query the database and then generate java classes for each table in the database

floating-point	integer
this will only be suitable if you don t care to differentiate between integer and floating-point representations

2397407
client-side	server-side
add this new class only to the corresponding li link either on server-side or on client-side using javascript

2397431
webclient	httpwebrequest	webclient	webrequest
there is a lot of confusion whether i can use webrequest httpwebrequest or webclient

2397466
post	get
eventually i went back to post because we needed the fix quick but it has been bugging me because semantically a get is more correct in this case

2397473
pylons	cherrypy
most popular python web frameworks support wsgi django pylons cherrypy ...

2397511
serializable	deserialization
serializable works but deserialization doesn t

2397572
lxml	beautifulsoup
ian bicking once wrote that surprisingly lxml could be better at parsing soups than beautifulsoup just mentioning for reference haven t tried that personally

2397573
width	height
do it with actionscript in the flash by using the stage width and stage height variables

2397618
boost	allocator
look up pool allocator eg boost or small object allocator eg loki

2397622
boost	allocator
regarding the allocator of your class objects take a look at the boost pool library which may be more efficient for many allocator of small objects than regular new delete via the system allocator

2397646
profiling	debugging
see my suggestion as to how you can add a -foreground switch to a service to make it easier to run it as a regular program which makes it easier to profiling and debugging

2397748
int	boolean
then iterate over the array containing the actual data and keep an int of which word you re currently at and a boolean if you already matched whitespace

2397749
post	get
i have a wordpress theme that i ve been making my own visually and can t seem to get the main content section to display regular post only - instead of the boxes

2397794
affinity	irq	cpu	affinity	cpu	irq
if anyone cares the goal is to set the irq affinity to a specific cpu and then set the other irqs to all other processors.

2397798
hash	md5
according to the fb documentation the format of each email hash is the crc32 and md5 hash of the email address combined with an underscore _

2397801
jboss	glassfish
i started developing a seam application on jboss and after a few months tried to get it working on glassfish

2397818
uiview	uitouch
i have setup a uiscrollview which handles a large uiview inside the uiview is a uiimageview i ve managed to get the uitouch to drag the uiimageview outside of the uiscrollview but inside it s not registering the event

2397842
rss	feed
for example if there is an rss feed and for some reason it is down or cannot be grabbed i want to display a simple message saying feed cannot be grabbed

2397843
notepad++	textpad
note not all method implementations are in one file like hashmap.java and so simple text editors like notepad++ or textpad may not be enough

2397847
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a php script as db has been switched from mysql to postgresql

2397862
gridview	radgrid
ok so i m trying to get my custom paging going on the telerik radgrid similar to the asp gridview but i m still hitting a wall

2397878
hide	show
here is an alternative method using jquery which would also slide up down on show hide

2397878
hide	show
and finally here is the javascript to setup the close button and functions to show and hide the message bar

2397937
accessor	properties
the properties only has a get accessor - no set accessor -- it s readonly

2397982
inherited	properties
1 if textbox element has its width properties set to inherited then textbox doesnâ t overflow

2397990
cassini	iis
the location for what you are looking for is in the solution file of your solution open the sln send to notepad you will see what i mean you can hard code the port if you are using the built in webserver cassini or you can port it all to your local iis which is what i do

2398000
for-loop	loops
i want to set up a for-loop for the first 1 3 of the main loops that will increase a value from .00001 or similar to 1

2398001
put	get
the only work around is to put the cache code inside the load of each object and to loop all properties from the caching object to get the value and to set it back to the real object

2398002
hash	md5
if you can have a third db field like the one above do a varchar 32 that is unique that is an md5 hash of the first two

2398030
int	chars
for example you have a very large value in an int that doesn t fit in chars

2398030
int	chars
anything could happen but the most sensible thing would be to take the first byte of that int and put it in chars

2398042
hide	show
i create a menu and i show and hide submenu on jquery via hover event like following code

2398079
inherited	properties
each properties may also have a specified value of inherited which means that for a given element the properties takes the same computed value as the properties for the element s parent

2398079
width	height
if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element also has an intrinsic width then that intrinsic width is the used value of width

2398079
width	height
if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element has no intrinsic width but does have an intrinsic height and intrinsic ratio

2398079
width	height
or if width has a computed value of auto height has some other computed value and the element does have an intrinsic ratio

2398079
width	height
if height and width both have computed values of auto and the element has an intrinsic ratio but no intrinsic height or width and the containing block s width does not itself depend on the replaced element s width then the used value of width is calculated from the constraint equation used for block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow

2398082
jar	manifest.mf
i run jar cmf manifest.mf hello.jar .class to get hello.jar file

2398096
cpu	processors
when you call a opengl function it will either calculate on the cpu or on the gpu graphics card s processors

2398122
super	implements
because of that i m now having problems implements methods such as new open and save - i find myself writing a lot of code the manuals say should be implements by the super class

2398176
ironruby	ironpython
languages such as ironpython and ironruby used an additional layer on top the clr to allow all the wonderful dynamics features

2398183
realloc	malloc
on program start it begins as null and i then malloc realloc as i need to add remove these structures and i was just gonna use my pointer to point at the first structure and move through it like an array

2398183
realloc	malloc
when i malloc realloc i always make the size of the array area in memory one larger than it needs to be

2398188
hide	show
start debugging and windows move show hide in order to be in the same position as the last debugging session

2398216
filesystems	fat
using fat for example but most other filesystems have at least some degree of similarity you could go in and directly manipulate the fat

2398216
filesystems	fat
most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation

2398221
getter	setter
unfortunately there is no way to shorten what you have automatically implemented properties must have empty getter and setter blocks to be syntactically correct

2398233
accessor	properties
the code that was causing a stackoverflowexception doesn t provide a backing field for the properties the get accessor is returning the properties itself which is what causes the stack overflow

2398246
accessor	properties
returning feedbackcomment in the get accessor of the feedbackcomment properties is creating a self-referential loop that keeps getting the properties so no surprise about the stack overflow there

2398257
inherited	subclassing
so each subclassing will be run a individual with it-setup method and also all inherited test-methods

2398260
getter	setter
the getter references itself as andrew points out but the setter is also wrong

2398273
getter	setter
a property cannot hold any data it is just a pair of a getter method and a setter method there are also properties which only have getter or setter

2398273
getter	setter
the getter method is basically a method which takes no arguments and returns a value of the property s type the setter on the other hand is a method with no return value and an argument of the property s type called value

2398273
implements	extends
please be also aware that the c# compiler will create a backing field automatically so basically both ways are the same but you gain more flexibility with the first because with automatically implements properties you cannot add more complex behaviour than just simple setting and retrieving of values at least in the class where you declare it making it virtual opens possibilites to extends property logic in subclasses..

2398286
cairngorm	mate	cairngorm	flex
you build a useful app for flex and air use cairngorm adobe s supported flex application framework but people seem to enjoy using others like mate and swiz connect to a backend with xml json and amf and build useful cms-like interfaces all using design patterns

2398365
implements	extends
you could either implements an interface or extends something like a plane class

2398420
width	height
i m able to resize the height with the part but the width just doesn t update according to the new content

2398427
int	double
assume the number being represented is larger than the system can handle as an actual number an int or a double etc

2398427
hex	binary
i m open to a solution for any base n which satisfies the above criteria binary hex ...

2398430
html5lib	beautifulsoup
use beautifulsoup as a tree builder for html5lib

2398447
ubuntu	linux
i ve downloaded latest linux source package from the ubuntu repository and found the mentioned source files with minor directory and file name changes

2398453
put	get
anyway if you insist on such an approach i guess the closest you get is to put the init code into the constructor and the destruct code into an override of finalize

2398474
int	boolean
it should only output json native types e.g strings int boolean and lists

2398518
width	margin
resulting margin width is the maximum

2398541
margin	height
the parent element doesn t have any non-floating elements so it s height is zero and the floating elements overlap the margin

2398542
public	protected
private protected public visibility modifiers and default visibility are not to be confused with the import directive at all

2398576
int	double
so it was actually faster to cast to double call pow with double then test for overflow and cast back than to implement it using int arithmetic

2398619
comparator	comparable
hashtable and hashmap don t use either comparator or comparable

2398622
folder	directory
for example if the file you want to change is lib generators rails templates controller.rb of inherited resources the first thing you have to do is replicate that directory structure inside your lib folder lib generators rails templates controller.rb

2398627
post	get
you could get your fragment via post append the html to a div with display none

2398660
children	parent
a child record can have a parent record selected from a node reference field this is optional -- i can have parent-less children as well

2398660
children	parent
i created a page view to display the parent then an attachment view to display all the children then attached that under the page view

2398699
cpython	ironpython
user is running ironpython jython or anything other than cpython

2398821
int	chars
so in your case the d is getting promoted to an int then printf is popping off an int and casting to a chars

2398852
int	double
if you pass it a double value and specify an int format specifier like d printf will take that double value and blindly reinterpret it an an int

2398877
mouseover	mouseout
te undefined prior to the mouseover and null after the mouseout

2398907
int	chars
1 23.45 or 1 minute 23 seconds 45 hundredths is 8345. lapcount is a simple unsigned tiny int or unsigned chars

2398918
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
in most realities malloc and memset or calloc which effectively does the same will suit your needs

2398963
children	parent
you need to get the children of the closest parent like this

2398976
lwjgl	jogl
for graphics lwjgl and jogl are both java opengl wrappers

2398980
nstextview	nsscrollview
nstextfield or nstextview without nsscrollview

2398989
button	checkbox
i would favor field controls like text boxes checkbox and dropdown menus rather than command button so that the commanded value is clearly shown

2398991
int	chars
the reason your follow-up code works is because the chars constant is promoted to an int before it is pushed onto the stack

2398991
int	chars
in fact chars constants are of type int not type chars

2399074
ati	nvidia
this is just what nvidia ati drivers do for you but you re out of luck unless your kernel supports windows linux drivers

2399107
width	height
of course if i really want to be lazy i can just google for the average height width ratio since height is known

2399107
width	height
says a width to height ratio of 3 5 0.6 is recommended for most applications

2399136
clang	llvm
since llvm clang is especially well designed

2399154
clang	llvm
llvm clang is especially well designed

2399181
min	max
i have put together a small powershell script as below to check page file pae switch 3gb switch sql server max ram min ram

2399208
hash	md5
do a recursive search through all the files sorting them by size any byte sizes with two or more files do an md5 hash or a sha1 hash computation to see if they are in fact identical

2399211
autofac	castle-windsor
there are many other di libraries including autofac ninject structuremap and castle-windsor

2399237
sctp	tcp
if you re feeling particularly bold you can look into using sctp sockets instead of tcp sockets

2399244
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have an interesting problem when using partial page update in asp.net with scriptmanager and a updatepanel

2399268
width	height
you ve set the frame to the same width and height as the content

2399307
super	self
i would expect super self but this doesn t work

2399409
inherited	properties
i d like to have the nested containers inherited that properties but when i set it in the outermost one i m not sure if it s working

2399416
rss	feed
i am creating an rss feed application

2399416
rss	feed
as a sample i have downloaded apples rss feed but the problem with it is that the words in the table cells are not wrapped

2399549
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
create qgraphicsview object to your widget and added a qgraphicsscene to view

2399567
inherited	properties
the dependency properties specifies that it will inherited down the visual tree when it is declared

2399593
g++	gcc
following are the versions of gcc g++ i am using

2399593
g++	gcc
since gcc and g++ are configured built with --disable-aix64 there are no 64-bit std libraries available ex libstdc++

2399602
put	get
i would agree that it s probably an issue with trying to get the id of the element since the element s id changes at runtime when you put it inside a user control

2399607
mp3	wav
basically now i will not write real time applications i would like to start from the processing of a wav file or even better an mp3 file so basically on vectors of samples

2399611
telerik	componentart
telerik devexpress and componentart make controls which do this

2399638
g++	gcc
be aware that gcc or g++ uses a different name-mangling scheme from other compilers quite deliberately - because it does various things such as exception handling class layouts and the like differently from other compilers

2399642
cpu	processors
in either situation make sure that your main thread yields processors time to the running threads else your wait loop will consume most all the cpu and starve your worker threads

2399664
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
subclasses such as uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller provide additional behavior for managing complex hierarchies of view controllers and views.

2399667

after uninstalling xampp and reinstalling it xampp-win32-1.7.0-installer.exe and applying the xampp-patch2-win32-1.7.0-installer i still have the problem of the php cli closing and throwing the pop-up dialog

2399797
google-chrome	firefox
i want to write a browser google-chrome firefox extension that needs to select an element on a web page

2399826
opensolaris	bsd
for an open source os such as linux bsd or opensolaris you could delve into the os source code to figure this out

2399876
width	height
as for the transparent overlay just give it an absolute position and a full width and height

2399918
int	chars
i got hold of these 2 functions to convert a 4 byte float into an unsinged 32 bit int to transfer over network which works fine for a simple c++ udp program but for qt i need to receive the data as unsigned chars

2399980
mouse	keyboard
you can alleviate this problem a by removing the mouse keyboard and the screen and only access the buildserver through rdp or something similar

2399984
int	chars
the values are the result of chars int enumvalue

2399994
width	height
suppose i have an html page with three blocks of fixed width their height can vary if that s important like shown on picture
