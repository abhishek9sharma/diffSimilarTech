firefox	safari
when i use a percentage-based width on the child div it collapses to 0 width on internet explorer 7 but not on firefox or safari

76
wordpress	joomla
try looking at wordpress drupal joomla and other well known php-based cms s to see how their api hooks look and feel

89
svnkit	subclipse
i m not sure how aptana is different but try either upgrading javahl or switching to the pure-java svnkit implementation within the subclipse config

113
versioning	upgrade
i did upgrade directly from an older versioning to 1.5.2 though and never used 1.5.1

126
getter	setter
i know that from outside of the object you should use a getter setter but from within would you just do

126
getter	setter
when i learned oo i was taught to use getter setter for every single property even if it was public and actually i was told never to make any variable property public

126
getter	setter
it appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don t need getter and setter which goes against what i was taught and what i was talking about although maybe that needs to be discussed as well

127
getter	setter
this has religious war potential but it seems to me that if you re using a getter setter you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road somebody adds code to a setter that needs to run every time that property is set and the property is being set internally w o that setter being called

139
public	protected
another approach would be to utilize a private protected method to actually do the getting caching db etc and a public wrapper for it that increments the count

143
getter	setter
if your getter setter does something you need use it

143
getter	setter
the opposite case could be made that if you use the getter setter and somebody changes the getter setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up

169
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter use them

195
post	put
if you want more info on this post something and i can put the script somewhere accessible

264
puts	gets
my application is pretty simple i ll be doing gets and puts of records that are about 1kb each

307
ironruby	ironpython
a different approach would be to consider a language that is specifically built for scripting such as ironruby ironpython or lua

307
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby are both available today

367
cpu	processors
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processors was booted

396
email	dkim
use email authentication methods such as spf and dkim to prove that your email and your domain name belong together and to prevent spoofing of your domain name

396
dns	spf
the spf website includes a wizard to generate the dns information for your site

430
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you supply an expected range where max 1000 min you can easily guess

451
dns	spf
yahoo uses a method called sender id which can be configured at the spf setup wizard and entered in to your dns

471
lxml	libxml2
it s in pure python and as i say pretty nice but if you wind up needing more performance then lxml exposes the same api and uses libxml2 under the hood

516
versioning	upgrade
i choose not to put schema dumps in under versioning control as alumb and others suggest because i want an easy way to upgrade my production database

516
versioning	upgrade
a sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the ddl necessary to move the schema from versioning n to n+1

516
versioning	upgrade
gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new versioning

516
versioning	upgrade
this ensures that it s easy to see what versioning of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once

518
folder	directory
i think you ll have to iterate through the various font folder on the system system library fonts library fonts and there can probably be a user-level directory as well library fonts

532
maven	pom.xml
we commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies

535
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i am starting work on a hobby project with a python codebase and would like to set up some form of continuous integration running a battery of test-cases each time a check-in is made and sending nag e-mails to responsible persons when the tests fail similar to cruisecontrol or teamcity

549
ssl	https
ssl https encryption

549
public	protected
secret urls public url protected by digest

555
hash	salt
instead store the salt hash

555
hash	salt
the salt is a public value so you can store them with the hash in the database

568
int	chars
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others

568
int	chars
so int is a fancy way to work with an int just as perhaps string is a fancy way to work with a group of chars

576
gmail	hotmail
sign up for an account on as many major email providers as possible gmail yahoo hotmail aol etc

583
int	double
in c# int is just an alias for system.int32 string for system.string double for system.double etc.

583
int	double
personally i prefer int string double etc

591
versioning	upgrade
on all subsequent versioning i do two things i make a new text file to hold the upgrade sql scripts that contain just the alters for that versioning

591
versioning	upgrade
then rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run whatever code i have running the create upgrade scripts uses the versioning to determine what to run

650
versioning	upgrade
i would like to be able to display a versioning number in the form of 1.1.38 so when a user finds a problem i can log the versioning they are using as well as tell them to upgrade if they have an old release

669
hash	md5
md5 sha1 and des are weak password hash

696
post	get	openbsd	centos
if anyone has run across getting everything to run natively under openbsd that would be great but what i think i may have to do is setting up a second server running centos with db2 installed most likely via zendcore for ibm since it seems to do all this for me and the driver so that i can set up a small transaction server that i can post against and get a json representation of the db2 data that i need

754
int	chars
1 to capitalize it in say c - use the ascii codes to find the int value of the chars and subtract 32 from it

766
postgresql	mysql
i can get python to work with postgresql but i cannot get it to work with mysql

798
mbunit	nunit
mbunit is worth alook it has a set of features comparable to nunit it has its own gui or can be integrated into vs if you have resharper

834
erlang	lisp
however if you opened it up to functional languages or functional language features i m looking at you linq then my colleagues here can fill this page with elegant examples in ruby lisp erlang and others

886
pull	push
if you need a change from someone else though she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her

886
pull	push
someone has to be responsible for doing that push pull from everyone else s repository resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before then doing the build and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos

893
pull	push
if it were just 2 people i d say git is also easier because you can just push and pull from eachother

906
translation	localization
if you get lazy and don t notify the people in charge of translation or you embed strings without going through your localization system it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later

1043
hex	binary
w2k edit binary select data format hex click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

1043
hex	binary
wxp right-click the value choose modify binary data click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

1061
punctuation	words
the # char is indexed as punctuation and therefore ignored so it looks like we ll remove the letter c from our words indexing ignore lists

1069
disk	ram
when running under a sophisticated debug environment rational purify vs2008 msvc9 or even microsoft application verifier the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn t crash memory-bound cpu is not getting above 50 disk light is not on the program s going as fast it can box consuming 1.3g of 2g of ram

1131
chm	winhelp
then microsoft decided that winhelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to chm up to the point they actually axed winhelp from vista

1145
free	realloc
if i try to use realloc i get an error that tells me i am doing a double free - which i don t see how i am since i am only using realloc

1149
realloc	malloc
just a shot in the dark because i haven t tried it yet but when you realloc it returns the pointer much like malloc

1154
free	realloc
as a general rule you should never do a free or realloc on a user provided buffer

1189
opera	firefox
firefox ie and opera all load successfully in the same scenario

1216
assemblyinfo	csproj
customizing csproj files to autogenerate assemblyinfo

1269
cvs	svn
the two approaches are more or less the same idea but svn was specifically designed to fix long standing flaws in cvs so in theory at least svn will always be the better choice

1272
cvs	svn
cvs only tracks modification on a file-by-file basis while svn tracks a whole commit as a new revision which means that it is easier to follow the history of your project

1272
cvs	svn
add the fact that all modern source control software use the concept of revision so it is far easier to migrate from svn than it is from cvs

1278
cvs	svn
svn has 3 main advantages over cvs

1312
turkish	thai
i was just listening to a podcast from scott hanselman this morning where he talks about internationalization especially the really tricky things like turkish with it s four i s and thai

1314
nant	cruisecontrol
we have been using cruisecontrol for quite a while with nunit and nant

1331
robocopy	xcopy
note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy

1415
imap	nntp
imap pop3 and nntp

1453
put	get
i don t want to put a magic number in there for weight since the object i am using has a defaultweight parameter that all new shipments get if you don t specify a weight

1488
subtract	addition
in addition to john downey and jdecuyper s solutions i ve also added an explicit deny bit at the end beginning of the bitfield so that you can perform additive permissions by group role membership and then subtract permissions based upon explicit deny entries much like ntfs works permission-wise

1496
emacs	aquamacs
for emacs carbonemacs xemacs and aquamacs

1517
macvim	textmate
macvim works well and certainly looks more mature than vim-cocoa moreover there is a cocoa plugin architecture in the pipeline for macvim and someone is already working on a textmate style file browser tray plugin which is a huge ++ imho

1528
inherited	properties
some of the more recent descendant classes inherited dependency properties which have become vestigial and can be a little confusing when using intellisense or using the classes in a visual designer

1595
int	chars
to capatilise it in say c - use the ascii codes to find the int value of the chars and subtract 32 from it

1595
int	chars
use library calls don t assume you can use int arithmetic on your chars to get back something useful

1718
phpunit	simpletest
this started with junit in the java world and has become a best practice in php as well with simpletest and phpunit

1762
hide	show
i am trying to set a flag to show or hide a page element but it always displays even when the expression is false

1820
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i like testdriven.net even though i use resharper and i m pretty happy with xunit.net

1821
nunit	mstest
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit

1821
mbunit	nunit
oh and testdriven.net will give you ide integration for both nunit and mbunit

1894
versioning	upgrade
i create folders named after the build versioning and put upgrade and downgrade scripts in there

1894
versioning	upgrade
each one contains the script that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your database between versioning

1936
submit	submission
one such situation is when you encounter validation errors after a form submission and need to redirect back to the form but would like the url to reflect the url of the form not the action page it submit to

1936
post	get
if i use the viewdata parameter my post parameters will be changed to get parameters

1995
int	double
i have values stored as strings in a datatable where each value could really represent an int double or string they were all converted to strings during an import process from an external data source

1995
int	double
try to convert to int and then double

1995
int	double
regular expressions designed to match the pattern of an int or double

2048
rss	feed
for all the rss feed i subscribe to i use google reader which i love

2048
rss	feed
i do however have a couple of specific rss feed that i d like to be notified of as soon as they get updated say for example an rss feed for a forum i like to monitor and respond to as quickly as possible

2057
rss	feed
i ve used pingie in the past to send me an sms when a new items appears in an rss feed

2064
rss	feed
as matthew stated you really shouldn t bother an rss feed more than the producer allows but you can use http headers to check for changes in a very light way which is something rss2email does quite well

2067
mvp	presenter
mvp designs have the presenter access the model and interact with the view

2080
rss	feed
if you have access to microsoft outlook 2007 or thunderbird these email clients allow you to add rss feed in the same way you would add an email account

2080
rss	feed
i use google reader generally but when i want to keep up-to-date with something specific i add the rss feed to outlook and it arrives in my inbox as if it was an email

2120
hash	md5
i want to get the md5 hash of a string value in sql server 2005

2328
client-side	server-side
for example if we have a client-side ajax action to add a new item to the grid and then a row is dragged the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side

2360
mouse	keyboard
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

2361
mouse	keyboard
apple menu system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts

2374
cvs	svn
from a mechanical perspective you will need to see if they use svn for example on google code or cvs for example on sourceforge and determine if they use patch or some other method

2525
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

2562
wmv	flv
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

2702
aggregate-functions	sum
i know i need to have although i don t know why a group by clause on the end of a sql query that uses any aggregate-functions like count sum avg etc

2750
getter	setter
i m wondering if it s a good idea to make verifications in getter and setter or elsewhere in the code

2750
getter	setter
this might surprise you be when it comes to optimizations and speeding up the code i think you should not make verifications in getter and setter but in the code where you re updating your files or database

2754
getter	setter
validation should be captured separately from getter or setter in a validation method

2761
getter	setter
well one of the reaons why classes usually contain private members with public getter setter is exactly because they can verify data

2865
rss	feed
i would first find out if the site s in question provide an api server or rss feed for access the data you require

2884
ubuntu	linux
if you do feel like using linux then you could try ubuntu

2884
unix	solaris
modesty mono provides the necessary software to develop and run .net client and server applications on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

2905
mouse	keyboard
if you keep at it you can use exclusively the keyboard and never touch the mouse which increases your editing speed by a significant margin

2905
emacs	gedit
update i think gedit is exclusively gui based though so it would be useful to learn emacs in case you are stuck with just a shell it is fully featured in both shell and graphical mode

2905
vim	emacs
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too

2905
emacs	gedit
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

2976
versioning	upgrade
revert your site back to a known good status and if need be upgrade to the latest versioning

2984
clang	llvm
i ve heard good things about clang static analyzer which iirc uses llvm as it s backend

3010
gmail	hotmail
personally i ran mine through a freshly installed spam assassin a trained spam assassin and multiple hotmail gmail and aol accounts

3019
getter	setter
if i remember well there was an option through which you could ask vs to create the setter and getter automatically for you

3026
getter	setter
if you are using visual studio 2005 and up you can create a setter getter real fast using the insert snippet command

3030
button	checkbox
for example if i have a treeview with checkbox think installation of a new program choose features to install page i might want a check all button which would be something like this pseudocode

3032
getter	setter
this will create a getter setter property for a variable

3032
getter	setter
i m not too big a fan of this technique as it is a little bit awkward to use if you have to create a lot of getter setter and it puts the property directly below the private field which bugs me because i usually have all of my private fields grouped together and this visual studio feature breaks my class formatting

3075
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have a simple page with my scriptmanager and my updatepanel and my contenttemplate has one listbox and one label

3106
ubuntu	linux
i m developing some cross platform software targeting mono under visual studio and would like to be able to build the installers for windows and linux ubuntu specifically with a single button click

3143
teamcity	nant
i m compiling a nant project on linux with teamcity continuous integration server

3143
teamcity	nant
update take a look at mbunittask its a nant task that uses sends messages that teamcity expects from nunit so it lets you use all of teamcity s features for tests

3217
kate	kde
kate the kde advanced text editor is quite good

3234
gif	png
i am able to display images of type gif jpeg png all i have tested so far bit trying to display .swf or .ico files gives me a nice little error

3315
ienumerable	ienumerator
but of course the compiler spits its dummy because foreach expects an ienumerable rather than an ienumerator

3457
firefox	safari
so long as it works in ie firefox safari insert other browser here you should be okay

3464
int	double
in java the primitive wrappers classes like int double float boolean.

3464
getter	setter
so that this classes only has getter methods no setter besides the constructor

3485
getter	setter	public	protected
i can be wrong because i m autodidact but i never user public properties in my java clases they are allways private or protected so that outside code must access by getter setter

3485
getter	setter
if getter method is trivial i use the property directly but i allways use the setter methods because i could easily add code to fire events if i wish

3486
post	get
precisely i don t want users automating access to forms issuing direct get post http requests to the appropriate servlet

3511
addition	multiplication
according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5

3603
mbunit	nunit
we use nunit and mbunit here

3776
hide	show
once they are added they could be flipped through using hide show or bringtofront sendtoback methods

3862
cvs	svn
the major centralized vcs are cvs and svn

3862
cvs	svn
todo write explanation on what branches are and why merging is hard with cvs svn

3862
pull	push
distributed vcs let everyone have their own server where you can pull changes from other people and push changes to a server

3869
perforce	svn
my recommendation you re safest with either git svn or perforce since a lot of people use them they are cross platform have good guis you can buy books about them etc

3869
cvs	rcs
dont consider cvs sccs rcs they are antique

3886
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
it seems like an illegalargumentexception is called for if you don t want null to be an allowed value and the nullpointerexception would be thrown if you were trying to use a variable that turns out to be null

3895
bazaar	git
please do not use git or hg or bazaar because of the hype

3895
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
use git or hg or bazaar because they are better tools for managing source code than svn

3979
mbunit	nunit
i used to use nunit but i switched to mbunit since it has more features

4080
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools cobertura emma and any others

4098
emacs	textmate
you can try emacs with ruby-mode rinari for rails and yasnippet which provides automatic snippets like textmate

4104
folder	directory
will merge any files changed in the revision 67212 in the folder trunk on the repository and merge them into your current working directory

4157
button	checkbox
as the user changes settings using the app s ui clicking checkbox choosing radio button etc. i plan to be writing those changes out to the appsettings

4166
ant	jdepend
we use findbugs and jdepend integrated with ant

4221
gridview	repeater	gridview	linqdatasource	listview	gridview
i m going to use the linqdatasource with the listview control not a gridview or repeater

4231
gridview	repeater	gridview	linqdatasource
i know that if you use a paging repeater or gridview with the linqdatasource it will automatically optimize the number of results returned but i m also pretty sure in the datasource wizard you can go to advanced options and limit it to

4260
post	get
a post with some links to get you started in that direction is here

4312
phpunit	simpletest
i like php so phpunit or simpletest work well

4332
min	max
start title dpath i min max separate | shared

4408
.htaccess	httpd.conf
another solution would be to set an include path in your httpd.conf or an .htaccess

4586
pentaho	olap
i m not completely familiar with the implications of step 2 in your approach above but if you re looking for a more robust olap solution it might be worth your while to check out mondrian the open-source olap analysis services module of pentaho

4670
bazaar	git
so i want to get a project on a distributed version control system such as mercurial git or bazaar

4678
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are typical hash algorithms

4691
tunnel	vpn
another option that is often useful as it works over a vpn or simple ssh connectivity is ssh tunnel or x11 forwarding over ssh

4692
rss	feed
i wrote a powershell provider to give me access to ie7 s rss feed store and had lots of fun with it

4692
folder	dir
it lets me cd to a drive called feed and navigate around folder and feeds using cd and dir

4706
vmware	esx
it works with vmware server and workstation but afaik it s not available for esx server

4755
lisp	scheme
two semesters ago i used scheme a language based on lisp to write an interactive program that simulated abbott and costello s who s on first routine

4755
lisp	scheme
in summary learning lisp or scheme may not yield many practical applications beyond ai but it is an extremely valuable learning experience as many others have stated

4768
tunnel	vpn
x11 forwarding with ssh is secure and uses the existing ssh connection to tunnel so working through a vpn should be no problem

4897
keydown	keyup
each time keyup or keydown is fired update the reference to the active selected item in the data structure

4924
button	checkbox
one method you can used to obtain this option is by placing a checkbox object and changing its appearance from normal to button this will give you the same functionality that i believe you are looking for

4937
vim	emacs
vim or emacs varying on religion will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click ide

4968
ready	each
then at the end of each day or whenever you merge together whatever you are ready to test and you check it out onto the dev server and test it

5036
vim	emacs
if you are taking your time switching to linux i d switch to emacs or vim at some point as well

5036
vim	emacs
the key with either vim or emacs is knowing it could probably take you the better part of the day just to figure out what you want them to do let alone how to get them to do that

5142
interbase	bde
bde administration version 5.01 installed with interbase 4.0 drivers

5179
post	get
an httpwebrequest works great if you don t want to redirect and javascript is fine in some cases but can get tricky if you really do need the server-side code to get the data together for the post

5320
gtk	motif
there s a particularly good port for python wxpython as well as versions for different languages -- c# c++ perl and ruby come to mind -- and for various guis win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince

5322
versioning	upgrade
then you put your scripts to build a new database in your versioning control and it ll either build a new database or upgrade any existing database to the schema in versioning control

5343
ada	pascal
bindings exist for ada qtada 4 c # qyoto kimono 5 java qt jambi 6 pascal perl php php-qt ruby rubyqt and python pyqt

5357
implements	extends
i don t know how java is implements internally but if the constructor of the superclass throws an exception then there isn t a instance of the class you extends

5357
equals	tostring
it would be impossible to call the tostring or equals methods for example since they are inherited in most cases

5382
int	boolean
they re called bitwise but they are defined for both int and boolean data types in c#

5445
int	boolean	int	double
it is pointless and distracting but is in relatively heavy use at my company at least for types like int strings boolean and double

5462
versioning	upgrade
the times i ve run into headaches using cs is when the client wants functionality cs does not provide but also insists on keeping the ability to upgrade to the latest versioning whenever telligent releases an update

5503
expressionengine	multisite
expressionengine with the multisite manager works great for that kind of situation

5572
hash	salt
also if you are going to store the password field i highly recommend storing the password as a salt hash binary in the database

5823
mouse	keyboard
take command does support copy cut paste from the keyboard and the mouse

5872
folder	directory
i m getting tired of making a branch and then going through the branch and deleting all of the .svn folder the docs directory and my prototyping files

5887
folder	directory
right click the root project folder tortoisesvn export and tell it where you want the .svn free directory

5943
for-loop	loops
the reasoning is that you have n iterations in the for-loop and o 1 work in side loops

5997
getter	setter
in my form class i wouldn t think twice about using getter and maybe setter around this even if they didn t do anything other than provide direct access to the variable

5997
getter	setter
however the vs designer doesn t seem to implement such getter setter for those public objects that are components on a form and therefore does not comply with good programming practice

6003
getter	setter
i always do that and if you are following an mvp design creating getter setter for your view components would be a design requirement

6003
getter	setter
microsoft violates a lot of good programming practices to make it easier to create stuff on visual studio for the sake of rapid app development and i do not see the lack of getter setter for controls as evidence of violating any such best practices

6005
getter	setter
the reason for not implementing getter and setter for components on a form i believe is cause they wouldn t be thread safe .net objects are suppose to be only modified by the form thread that created them if you put on getter and setter you are potentially opening it up for any thread

6014
put	get
the general idea i have in mind is create one that before the commit will put the new revision number in the file get it using svnlook or maybe change a bogus property on the file it has to change or svn will ignore it

6018
getter	setter
however the vs designer doesn t seem to implement such getter setter for those public objects that are components on a form and therefore does not comply with good programming practice

6018
getter	setter
a form could have forty or fifty controls it d be somewhat unnecessary and unwieldy to provide a getter setter for every control on the form

6018
getter	setter
the designer leaves it up to you to provide delegated access to specific controls via public getter setter

6022
maven	cobertura
cobertura for our coverage reports - run from maven

6095
hide	show
public methods or properties are behavior show hide position or data-oriented set data get data update data

6113
post	get
unfortunately i can t get to the jon galloway post at work so i can t judge if that will work

6188
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
standards based and works in ie6 safari firefox opera etc

6192
free	malloc
the inefficient malloc free backend

6199
folder	directory
use the export command to export to a folder called export in the same directory as a file called deploy.bat then i run the deploy script v1 stands for version 1 which is what version i am currently on in this project this script utilizes 7-zip which i have placed on my system path so i can use it as a command line utility

6285
firefox	safari
if safari and firefox support is good enough for you there is a css solution

6296
rss	feed
in my work place we ve set up a post-commit hook that generates rss feed that are displayed in various dash boards and are used for code reviewers to know when it is time to review and for us to see that new employees are committing enough

6309
integer	unsigned
typically integer values are signed unless you explicitly need an unsigned value

6344
min	max
also it won t work if your min and max are greater than 10000

6359
rss	feed
as the lead developer i get a roll-up of commits every morning via the rss feed from that basecamp forum and can see what my team has been up to pretty quickly

6371
post	put
it s about 200 lines so i won t post it though i might put it on pastebin if there s interest

6378
put	get
i m starting to get the feeling that each of these client implement different parts of the standard and i m unsure of what pieces of information we should be trying to export from the application so that someone can put it on their calendar especially around recurrence

6382
versioning	upgrade
these scripts will upgrade the current production database to the new versioning in development

6405
free	malloc
just malloc a new buffer return that and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text

6411
public	protected
edit since peoplelistview will be declared protected by default you will either need to change this to public or create a public property wrapper so that you can access it from your page

6441
firefox	safari
the following code works great in ie but not in firefox or safari

6441
firefox	safari
it works great in ie but the problem manifests itself in firefox 3 in my case and safari all on windows xp

6456
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari document.frm in your code evaluates to undefined

6471
solaris	aix
at least it didn t worked in aix and solaris

6543
implements	sealed
is there a way to implements a sealed class from an interface.

6578
free	malloc
i m reasonably comfortable with c s malloc and free concept but cocoa s references counting scheme has me rather confused

6614
free	malloc
the basic way this differs from malloc and free is that any given object doesn t need to worry about other parts of the system crashing because you ve free memory they were using

6620
config	ini
if you just need a simple way to store config information i would recommend a config file using ini or xml as the format

6651
bazaar	git
there s a nice comparison between git hg and bazaar in this infoq article

6658
junit	testng
we have been considering switching over to junit 4 for new tests being written but i have been keeping an eye on testng for a while now

6659
junit	testng	junit	easymock	junit	unitils	testng	easymock	testng	unitils	easymock	unitils
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

6671
junit	testng
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

6757
config	ini
if it s a small application and you want to have aspects of it user-configurable without making a config form go for a quick ini file

6778
firefox	safari
the background renders correctly in firefox and safari however as soon as you use the browser s scroll bar then mouse over the flash control you must click once to activate the control

6824
profiling	benchmarking
but it s a guess try benchmarking and or profiling the two to get a proper comparison

6824
profiler	perf
if you suspect a perf bottleneck then stick a profiler on your code and see where it really is

6854
png	ico
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy

6932
mp3	flv
i d like to do something like youtube or google video where users can upload whatever format they want and i encode it to flv mp3 and or mp4

6950
mouse	keyboard
the left monitor is actually a separate computer running linux and keyboard mouse shared with synergy so i have multiple ebooks or documentation pages open one on each virtual desktop.

6955
atomic	compare-and-swap
edit chris s suggestion to use an atomic compare-and-swap would certainly work

7020
processors	work-stealing
or if you prefer have one reader thread assign the lines to three other processors threads via their own queues and implement a work-stealing strategy

7031
hide	show
using javascript to show and hide buttons and php to check to see which buttons to show

7035
ubuntu	linux
i m writing a few little bash scripts under ubuntu linux

7035
sudo	passwd
so far the only input required is a passwd for sudo - and gksudo handles that fine

7080
stdout	stderr
the following will silence both stdout and stderr

7080
stdout	stderr
the following silences stdout but stderr will still appear via stdout

7087
hide	show
if you don t intend to show the buttons it s not useful to send the html and images to the browser and then hide them with javascript

7097
getter	setter
in the book he talks about how to handle mutable objects that callers pass to your code in setter and mutable objects that you pass to callers in getter

7098
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you are using a browser that doesn t implement border-radius google-chrome pre-v4 firefox pre-v4 ie8 opera pre-v10.5 safari pre-v5 then the links below detail a whole bunch of different approaches

7099
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
although this works ok in the latest versions of safari and firefox but not at all in ie7 and i don t think in ie8 or opera

7104
accessor	properties
the best you can do is detect when this happens and throw an exception by checking that instance is non-null in the properties accessor

7151
actionlink	redirecttoaction
unlike rails url_for anchor urlhelper.generateurl and actionlink redirecttoaction and so on which use it don t have a magic property name that lets you encode an anchor

7190
ncover	nant
we are currently looking at configuring cruise control to work with nant nunit ncover and trac as a test case

7192
coalesce	isnull
using coalesce or isnull for that matter as shown in the link in lance s post uses a similar method but doesn t leave you with an extra comma to remove

7206
opera	safari
there is now a firebug lite that works on other browsers such as internet explorer safari and opera built

7221
ncover	cruisecontrol	ncover	fxcop
we use cruisecontrol with nunit ncover fxcop svn and some custom tools we wrote ourselves to produce the reports

7222
opera	safari
this is the firebug lite that john was referring to that works on ie safari and opera

7257
int	double
as you have a string i d look at whether you need to know that it s an int rather than a double

7257
int	double
if int.tryparse passes then so will double.tryparse so you could half the number of checks - return either double or string and floor the double when you expect an int

7276
feedback	review
it might help if your code review feedback or discussions reference the book so he or she has a thread to pick up and follow

7343
folder	directory
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folder especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that

7345
folder	directory
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folder especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that

7367
inherited	properties
i m looking for help setting a new default properties value for an inherited control in visual studio

7385
int	boolean
darren that would work if the types were specific enumerations - for general enumerations to work you have to cast them to int or more likely uint to do the boolean math

7470
rss	feed
after a couple hours fighting with the gallery2 rss module and getting only the message no feed have yet been defined i gave up

7540
cpu	processors
i would like to be able to see what tabs are using what percent of my processors via the javascript on that page or anything in the page that is causing cpu memory usage

7669
stdout	stdio
it opens a console then shoves the right handles into stdout and stdin so the debug function which was designed as a stdio interactive function can interact with the newly created console

7682
stdout	stderr
msvcrt tries to emulate the unix handle numbers where stdin 0 stdout 1 stderr 2 and so on

7715
organization	naming
naming is hard but in every organization there is someone who can name things and in every software team there should be someone who takes responsibility for namings standards and ensures that naming issues like sec_id sec_value and security_id get resolved early before they get baked into the project

7724
organization	naming
the adventureworks sample uses a very clear and consistent naming convention that uses schema names for the organization of database objects

7729
apache	lighttpd
the server-side part of this http pseudo-streaming method is fairly simple to implement for example in php as an apache module or a lighttpd module

7756
unix	solaris
the problem is that the op s data seems to be comma delimited and solaris 8 s uniq doesn t allow you any way specify the record separator so there wasn t a super clean way to do the preprocessing using standard unix tools

7756
uniq	grep
you could probably massage the uniq output into a single regexp to feed to grep but the benefit would only be known if the op posts expected ratio of lines containing suspected duplicate keys to total lines in the file

7771
rss	feed
i use rss bandit for windows to stay up to date with my rss feed blogs

7771
rss	feed
if you don t want another big application but have windows vista you could also choose to make internet explorer monitor the rss feed and use the feed sidebar application called feedschlagzeilen in german version not sure about the english one that comes with vista to show the latest headlines

7815
post	get
i did not copy any of his answer here to ensure patrick steele get s credit for his post

7833
firefox	safari
however in firefox 3.0.1 and safari 3.1.2 you must click the play button twice to see the animation

7852
textmate	geany
when i searched for textmate alternative for linux i ended up using geany

7856
profiling	debugging
set up a profiling for development then debugging by tweaking the source code adding logging and alert s and reloading the affected window

7873
contentplaceholder	loginview
is there a way to hide this on the loginview as the contentplaceholder does an excellent job for this

7926
apache	nginx
it s a lot easier to get going than the traditional solution of apache nginx + mongrel

7949
gedit	bbedit
classic menubar-based editors like winedit gedit or bbedit

7949
emacs	aquamacs
emacs and its brethren xemacs aquamacs etc

7949
emacs	textmate
emacs and textmate are also easily extensible by user-created scripts in lisp emacs or any other command-line-language textmate

7957
versioning	upgrade
when restoring backup sets from an earlier versioning of sql server a database upgrade may be required

7958
hide	show
you can use javascript to hide the elements just before displaying an overlay then show them again once you re done

7986
rss	feed
personally i prefer to send a message to something i can get an rss feed from as an email-per-commit would overload my inbox pretty quickly

8035
int	chars
e is assumed to be an int converted to an unsigned chars and printed

8249
fseek	ftell
change the definition to int so that error messages can be transmitted and then use fseek and ftell to determine the file size

8250
fseek	ftell
a quick search in google found a method using fseek and ftell and a thread with this question with answers that it can t be done in just c in another way

8273
integer	unsigned
iirc the standard library defines off_t as an unsigned 64 bit integer which is what everyone should be using

8286
rss	feed
seconding matt miller on rss feed

8286
rss	feed
there s a useful tool called websvn that offers rss feed of every repository and individual branches tags folders with full commit messages

8369
.nettiers	codesmith
in c# i love linq to sql for anything new but i really like using .nettiers + codesmith generator to get a quick and dirty data layer to the database happening if i m using c# on .net 2.0

8371
ssl	https
i have a server on https for which i paid an ssl certification for and a mirror for which i haven t and keep around for just for emergencies so it doesn t merit getting a certification for

8381
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology -

8532
int	boolean
and why does increasing the boolean query s static max clauses int actually make this error go away when i m definitely only using a prefix query

8573
accessor	properties
this creates a proper accessor to that control that won t expose the control s whole set of properties

8574
hide	show
you can use this public property to hide or show the control or to ask the control current visibility property

8602
put	get
you could get visual c++ express and put together the startup program pretty easily

8636
int	double
for many types int double datetime etc there is a static parse method

8730
postgresql	mysql
if a query is more then just a simple select on a single table i always run it through explain if i am on mysql or postgresql

8770
cairngorm	flex
about how to develop flex applications the right way i wouldn t look too much at the cairngorm framework

8770
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
it uses flex to its full potential doesn t rely on global variables as cairngorm and puremvc and it makes it possible to write much more decoupled code

8941
implements	extends
plus if you then need to later extends to any lightweight custom types they can also implements the same interface with no changes required to the base code

8950
firefox	safari
edit browsing a sharepoint wss site on a mac whether using firefox or safari has a very similar look and feel as it does on windows ie

9030
ssl	https
enabling ssl https for iis in windows xp

9033
accessor	properties
properties accessor accessibility modifiers by xanadont

9040
put	get
even if you do get it to switch drives it still is going to put a lot of stuff on the system drive

9067
sorting	filtering
with this property in my baseclass i can automate handling of paging setting filtering values to filtering a gridview make sorting really easy etc

9102
postgresql	mysql
if you re using mysql or postgresql there s various tools for seeing query activity in real time but i haven t found a tool as good as the sql profiler for measuring query performance over time

9142
mp3	ogg
i ve been looking at the ntag project as well which handles mp3 wma ogg

9193
freebsd	linux
linux freebsd and mac os x this final one on different hardware all degrade much more gracefully in terms of aggregate bandwidth when moving from one thread to two

9193
freebsd	linux
my home unbranded pc amd athlon64 running windows xp 32-bit freebsd 64-bit and linux 64-bit with single drive

9196
folder	directory
delete the bin and obj folder in your solution directory

9218
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you

9240
getter	setter
in your business logic layer you have described your business objects getter setter accessors and so on.

9288
folder	directory
this takes all of the files in my home directory and uses rsync s archive mode -a verbosly -v lists all of the changes made -i while deleting any files that don t exist anymore --delete and puts the in the folder home me school on my remote server

9304
getter	setter
but when i want to actually implement some getter setter logic i have to use the private public pair anyway

9304
getter	setter
i see the benefit that i save a lot of code one vs six lines without losing the ability to change the getter setter logic later but then again i can already do that by simply declaring a public field public string title without the need of the get

9308
getter	setter
if you want to do stuff in getter or setter there s no problem to convert them to normal properties later on

9308
getter	setter
also the properties allow you to set different access levels for the getter and setter which you can t do with a field

9421
int	chars
for a function that returns an int and takes a chars you would do

9596
getter	setter
but then again i prefer my private public pair to be together because that allows for easier debugging of getter setter logic as you see the private and public property next to each other

9615
svg	vml
ie handles vml though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser svg vs

9615
mouseover	mouseout
the level of interactivity i need is ability to detect dom events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover mouseout click etc

9639
int	boolean
results in a null if t is a reference type and 0 if it is an int false if it is a boolean

9654
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
safari opera and firefox all support svg natively eg

9654
svg	vml
unfortunately any standards based approach is kind of destroyed by ie s willful disregard of what is happening outside its own ecosystem however there are a number of libraries that try to convert canvas svg into vml ie s proprietary vector language such as iecanvas

9749
vmware	esx
vmware esx vmware server xen installations...

9769
profiling	debugging
i d like to script flexbuilder so that i can run debugging or profiling without having to switch to flexbuilder and manually clicking the button or using the key combo

9788
subtraction	addition
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

9801
postgresql	mysql
if you really want a free alternative that is similar to ms sql and supports growth should you need it you could have a look at mysql or postgresql

9810
globalization	localization
take into consideration the fact that for globalization localization purposes some parts of the world use different calendars methods of organization of the year

9814
addeventlistener	onload
there still is an ugly solution which is far inferior to using a framework or addeventlistener attachevent that is to save the current onload event

9826
queue	fifo
while linux and others can choose between different policies before vista windows was locked in a single policy a fifo queue where all requests where splitted in 64 kb blocks

9910
post	get
a recent post from 37signals gearheads don t get it really sums up a good point about not focusing on the technical details but content and community

10048
jquery	scriptaculous
for simple js animations look at jquery or scriptaculous

10061
bluetooth	usb
i d like to be able to do this with the gps hooked up to a laptop by bluetooth or even just a usb cable

10061
pull	push
bonus points if you can show me some examples of using an api to push and pull data to and from the gps

10062
haskell	ocaml
so you might want to learn haskell ocaml or another functional language

10083
put	get
for these last ones i could always put .bat files on my path but that s going to get old fast.

10101
integer	unsigned
for example if you wanted to drop the left-most bit of an unsigned integer then you might try this as your mask

10103
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

10106
uniq	grep
unxutils for ls rm grep uniq sort .

10146
entity-relationship	diagram
i currently use toad data modeler i ve been using their beta cycles for a while now free and little to no bugs and they have a great html documentation tool that provides everything including entity-relationship diagram

10232
ant	maven
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

10232
ant	maven
that being said if you re already using ant it can be a little tricky to transition over to maven

10346
width	height
allows for auto width and auto height elements

10366
opera	safari
this works great in ie7 not at all in every other browser i ve tried ff2 ff3 opera 9.5 safari

10416
textmate	gedit
textmate is a great editor and there is a way to replicate some of the functionality in gedit

10416
textmate	gedit
check the article out here to modify gedit to behave like textmate

10478
firefox	safari
ideally i d like some function that can return the currently selected text in the browser window that works in ie7 and 6 if possible firefox 2 3 and safari 2

10485
width	height
try setting the height and width of the div and make sure it is on top by setting its z-index higher than everything else

10528
fink	macports
it s also available through macports and fink

10532
postgresql	mysql
i ve been using php mysql for ages and am about to start using postgresql instead

10536
lisp	scheme
however common lisp is very different from scheme

10536
lisp	scheme
as you mentioned sicp is for learning scheme not lisp or at least not common lisp and not emacs lisp

10634
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i currently use nant cruisecontrol.net cruisecontrol.net svn mbunit

10684
solaris	sunos
it no longer occurs in solaris sunos 5

10714
cpu	processors
the asp.net worked thread afaik doesn t come from the thread pool and shouldn t get affected by your call to the remoting service unless this is a very slow processors and your remoting function is very cpu intensive - in which case everything on your computer will be affected

10748
cvs	rcs	perforce	cvs
i ve used rcs cvs sccs sourcesafe vault perforce subversion and git

10809
listview	gridview
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

10846
lxml	elementtree
i ve also use lxml and pyxml and i find elementtree nice because it s a standard module

10856
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s not that they were deliberately not allowed on datatables it s just that datatables pre-date the iqueryable and generic ienumerable constructs on which linq queries can be performed

10870
move	drag
once the user drag over one of these areas i call dragmanager.acceptdrag this from a dragevent.drag_over handler but if the user then move out of this area i d like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the dragmanager.none feedback

10926
sorting	filtering
filtering and sorting are the main reason

10949
accessor	properties
that i haven t needed to write hundreds of public properties or other accessor

11034
versioning	upgrade
definitely upgrade to tfs 2008 and visual studio 2008 as it is the v2 versioning of team system in every way

11163
nunit	mstest
nunit mstest ect all do pretty mutch the same thing

11201
prepare	execute
what i d probably do is just prepare several queries and execute the right one depending on what i ended up needing

11288
sorting	filtering
so wpf doesn t support standard sorting or filtering behavior for views of compositecollections so what would be a best practice for solving this problem

11288
put	get	sorting	filtering
i d get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection and i d be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item

11305
vb6	vba
i m a newbie when it comes to xml since i m stuck in vb6 and vba because of the field i work in

11312
nstextview	nsresponder
note that this is an inherited nsresponder method not a nstextview method

11471
sorting	filtering
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections

11615
entity-relationship	diagram
there s a lot of here s normalization here s entity-relationship diagram have at it but not much in the way of real examples

11664
anjuta	gnome
anjuta for gtk gnome

11819
ubuntu	linux
i have warehouse installed on a linux machine running the ubuntu server edition nginx for the http server and mongrel cluster

11857
put	get
i would like to gauge what solutions other people put in place to get team system functionality

11960
post	get
yes it s ugly but it ll get you going until someone post something nicer

11970
vmware	esx
i ve only had experience with vmware esx and while it s a fairly expensive product it is also very powerful

11994
getter	setter
all properties do is give you a concise syntax for specifying both the getter and setter in a single line and allow you to synthesize their implementation

11994
getter	setter
that s generally a good pattern with properties only ever touch the underlying instance variable for a property in initializers in -dealloc and in the getter and setter for the property

12047
post	get
wow - ok - will get a post on this but will be big

12055
post	get
again sorry for the long post but i wanted to get the code here so we can discuss this

12087
opera	safari
there are various workarounds at the moment but they re different between ie and fx i don t know about safari opera etc

12093
ienumerable	ienumerator
every time you use yield you get a whole new class that implements both ienumerable and ienumerator clever optimisation unreadable code

12130
onsubmit	onblur
using onblur and the form s onsubmit event in conjunction could be a better solution

12144
config	ini
at the moment every application we distribute is using it s own ad-hoc config files whether it s property files ini style xml or json internal use only at the moment

12161
config	ini
usually this is handled by an ini file or xml config file

12161
config	ini
having config files in the database is ok but it does tie you to the database and creates an extra dependancy for your app that ini xml files solve

12194
config	ini
we are using ini style config files

12248
put	get
and with the now very small amount of application specfic code they get put into company.applications.applicationname this helps me really think about business objects a lot more since i dont want too much within this namespace so i come up with more flexible designs

12313
nant	cruisecontrol
nant is far far easier to set up your build to do automatic testing deploy to multiple production environments integrate with cruisecontrol for an entry environment integrate with source control

12349
folder	directory
i didn t reinstall php i just copied all of the dlls in the ext folder to my php extensions folder as specified in the extension_dir variable in php.ini and i copied the versions of libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll from the php download into my system32 directory

12351
width	height
i can permit things like width height 1+1 3

12353
atexit	main
it is also responsible of calling any code that should run after main like atexit

12408
stdout	stderr
as others have said this entry point will not be main but will instead be a part of the runtime library - it will do things like initialising static objects setting up the argc argv parameters setting up stdin stdout stderr etc

12509
rss	feed
its feed rather than rss

12515
rss	feed
there are a lot of rss feed readers out there that people are used to using and most importantly rss is very well known and has been around much longer

12524
rss	feed
personaly i have a large number of rss feed that i generate myself

12553
cvs	svn
but more importantly it s plain text which means it s really easy to manage with our vcs cvs svn git etc. and it can easily live right there with the code -- so there s no excuse for not updating the documentation as you develop

12561
mouse	keyboard
though they re mostly targeted at automating administration tasks or shortcuts for users autohotkey and autoit let you automate nearly anything you want as far as mouse keyboard interaction

12568
rss	feed
vincent i m not suggesting that anyone rewrite existing rss feed just for the sake of it that would be a big waste of time

12568
rss	feed
in terms of rss being the acronym that defines the category i m guessing that most users now identify with the orange feed icon rather than the specific flavour of xml behind it

12586
rss	feed
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

12586
rss	feed
rss and especially rss 2.0 are very much entrenched in the feed industry. atom hasn t taken off because it doesn t bring much except a new name

12642
webclient	webrequest
i have tried both webclient and webrequest both have their problems

12671
button	checkbox
since the two pages are separate i can t call the modalpopupextender from the aspx.cs code i can t reach the list of checkbox from the ascx.cs code and i don t see a way to populate my session variable and then programmatically activate some other hidden button or control which will then open my modal popup

12700
hide	show
the modalpopupextender uses javascript and dhtml to show and hide the controls in the usercontrol client-side

12703
config	ini
if your app s config is simple then something simple like an ini file that s read into a dictionary is probably fine

12703
config	ini
but for something more complex like server config an ini file would be a huge pain to maintain and something more structural like xml or yaml would be better

12716
put	get
some google research indicates i could #import mscorlib.tlb or put it in path but i can t get that to compile either

12762
collabnet	svn
but as others have said there are now more friendly packages containing the svn stuff - visualsvn server so badly named it makes me weep and the collabnet distribution - the later is apache only and is hand rolled on the thighs of virgins which means that it always seems to appear about three weeks later than everyone else

12896
pecl	pear
and before i get pointed at pear pecl i need actual code

12910
mouseover	mouseout
for instance if you change enter and leave to mouseover and mouseout your events fire with no problem

12928
pascal	delphi
in pascal delphi

12961
profiler	visualvm
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiler called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm

13123
mbunit	nunit
i think you can do this with the row test attribute available in mbunit and later versions of nunit where you could specify several sets to populate one unit test

13130
keydown	keyup
even if you capture the keydown keyup event those are the only events that the tab key fires you still need some way to prevent the default action moving to the next item in the tab order from occurring

13218
slug	permalinks
some people call them slug wordpress also permalinks

13271
profiler	yourkit
facing the same problem i used yourkit profiler

13277
junit	testng
testing - junit testng

13277
hudson	bamboo
there are also bamboo plugins for findbugs pmd and checkstyle but as noted the free hudson ci server has those too

13295
multiplying	add
if i have to add five numbers and multiplying then get a percentage i ll do each step on it s own line

13355
pop-up	dialog
it s annoying when i drag a window to another monitor and then if the application generates a pop-up dialog or spawns another window if that pop-up dialog gets displayed back on the primary monitor

13359
translation	localization
there is no way you should be doing this and i see this as a fault in your translation process i am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools

13435
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the increment in the original foreach loops will not affect the contents of the arrays the only way to do this remains a for-loop

13455
cvs	svn
i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move

13566
post	put
edit the preview seems to showing the links ok but when i submit the post they are all wrong so i ve had to put the urls inline

13586
interpreted-language	compiled-language
defining standard functions methods in the interpreted-language or performing the processing of those calls in the compiled-language in which the interpreter is written

13590
jquery	scriptaculous
if all you need is a sortable list then a simple scriptaculous list or jquery list with a quick webmethod callback should fit the bill quite nicely and you can obviously stick this into your own user control

13594
opera	firefox
firefox and opera ignore the o and set the max length to 2 while internet explorer ignores the field altogether

13627
ironruby	ironpython
so from jython and jruby you can easily access java code and from ironpython and ironruby you can easily access .net code

13643
lisp	smalltalk
the last twenty years of evolution in interpreters can be seen as going the other way - polymorphism eg naive smalltalk metacircular interpreters to function pointers naive lisp implementations threaded code c++ to switch naive byte code interpreters and then onwards to jits and so on - which either require very big classes or in singly polymorphic languages double-dispatch which reduces the polymorphism to a type-case and you re back at stage one

13645
lwp	libwww-perl
lwp short for libwww-perl lets you connect to websites and scrape the html you can get the module here and the o reilly book seems to be online here

13688
floating-point	fixed-point
it s fast light-weight and can be configured to run with fixed-point numbers instead of floating-point since most microcontrollers don t have an fpu

13690
client-side	server-side
you can reduce the server-side load by performing this logic client-side

13757
ftp	smb	cifs	smb
if you mean if the server provides a protocol intended for file transfer such as ftp smb cifs etc. it ll be a lot easier

13758
post	get
you could also use it to easily compile a list of all used get post variables to help you eventually replace all occurrences of say return_url with _request return_url

13809
versioning	upgrade
i m all for pushing users to upgrade to the newest available versioning of ie since problems improve with every release however i m also against telling people to upgrade or change their browsers

13809
versioning	upgrade
unless of course you re developing an internal application then i d say everyone should upgrade to the newest available versioning

13817
profiling	benchmarking
also it provides a profiling that will benchmarking your code and provide pie-charts execution time etc

13851
opera	firefox
in opera and firefox the header and the menu are neatly attached to eachother

13914
firefox	safari
this code works in safari ie and firefox - hope it s of some help

13918
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can do this by adding onkeyup onkeydown etc

14006
getter	setter
need to attach logic to a getter setter

14165
min	max
i m seeing strange errors when my c++ code has min or max calls

14169
min	max
check if your code is including the windows.h header file and either your code or other third-party headers have their own min max definitions

14177
min	max
scope it dude std min std max

14194
firefox	safari
i would launch with it working in firefox ie7 and safari and look at who goes to your site

14247
actionscript	mxml
i ve gathered that you can t have it both ways -- that is to say have the class functionality in a separate actionscript class file but have the contained elements declared in mxml

14261
actionscript	mxml
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better

14261
actionscript	mxml
this is what makes manual bindings in actionscript a little less convenient than those in mxml

14261
getter	setter
the currentemployee could be made into a getter setter pair and implemented like this only showing the setter

14373
cvs	svn
i am converting from existing cvs repository to svn repository

14373
cvs	svn
that is cvs head becomes a normal branch and cvs brancha becomes svn trunk

14373
cvs	svn
both cvs and svn repositories will be on same linux machine

14373
cvs	svn
also conversion where cvs brancha becomes svn trunk and all other cvs branches are ignored might be enough

14383
cvs	svn
it s been a while since i ve done a cvs - svn conversion and probably even longer since i did one with a nontrivial branch structure

14410
vim	emacs
pretty much every other editor that isn t a vi descendant vim cream vi-emu seems to use the emacs shortcuts ctrl + w to delete back a word and so on

14424
put	get
i ve used it a couple of times to get some decent looking class diagrams to put in presentations blogposts etc

14603
cvs	svn
i m thinking svn and cvs aren t friendly enough to non-technical users but i m curious now as to the possibly uses for version control for non-engineering projects.

14630
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this is due to the fact that files from subversion can be checked out on both case-sensitive file systems nix and case-insensitive file systems windows mac

14640
selecteditem	selectedindex
to set a default value just add the item to the combobox s collection and set the selectedindex or selecteditem to that item

14656
post	get
anytime we wish to perform a get that is not cachable or a post operation it will be performed over ssl

14661
cvs	svn
anything you can do with cvs can be done with the command line and i am pretty sure svn is the same

14718
manual	rcs
i personally use rcs for this type of thing - whilst it s got a manual aspect it s unlikely i want to push something to even the test server from my dev machine without testing it first

14796
ant	maven
a good start point could be this maven pluggin not for use it or maybe yes but this maven is build over ant task

14819
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
use the listview - it gives you the features of the gridview combined with the styling flexibility of a repeater

14893
put	get
get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents images and reports that are associated with the project and put into directory from step 5

14909
client-side	server-side
i think it would be very helpful if the client-side and server-side code both saw the page the same way

14919
bazaar	git
i ll second eridius suggestion of git but i d expand it to the other drcs distributed revision control system such as mercurial and bazaar

14943
pop-up	dialog
i am using a form as a pop-up dialog to display a progress bar and i do not want the user to be able to close it

14968
getter	setter
i ve found using setter getter made my code easier to read

14980
public	protected
private fields with public or protected properties

14989
feedback	review
after you have a set of proposals then send them out to the team for feedback and review

15011
cruisecontrol	teamcity
cruisecontrol or teamcity is probably the best choice for this because they include a lot of tools you can use to make this step easier

15011
cruisecontrol	teamcity
cruisecontrol is free and teamcity is free to a point where you might have to pay for it depending on how big the project is

15028

nant	cruisecontrol
nant and cruisecontrol are staples of my environment

15072
redmine	trac
it s got trac redmine and subversion as well as several other unrelated ones

15161
ncover	fxcop
check out these articles on continuous integration using msbuild cruisecontrol.net fxcop nunit ncover and subversion.

15177
folder	directory
if you re talking about scripts created by a user that will be run from that users crontab i typically put those in either a bin or scripts folder in the home directory or if they re intended to be shared between users a usr local scripts directory

15212
ienumerable	ilist
the list class implements the ilist and ienumerable interfaces so that you can easily iterate through them basically any way you want

15217
vim	emacs
getting it right is hard enough competing agains the likes of vi vim emacs would be extremely tough -- most people who use these editors are die hard fans and you d have to give them a compelling reason to move to another editor

15234
firefox	safari
performance even though great progress has been made with firefox and safari

15243
pop-up	dialog
i am using a form as a pop-up dialog to display a progress bar and i do not want the user to be able to close it

15261
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the defaults are 28800 mysql kills connections after 8 hours but maybe the default for your platform is different or whoever administrates the server has configured things differently

15277
put	get
you can then put the re-usable sql code inside one of these or if you want to get really high tech you can use a library which does it for you

15286
post	get
if you find a log file but can t get any clues from it post it here

15362
trac	bugzilla
any of bugzilla trac or fogbugz will help you with your bug tracking and each offer an export feature so you can always change your mind later on

15412
srp	principles
an answer to a stack overflow question stated that a particular framework violated a plain and simple oop rule single responsibility principles srp

15412
srp	principles
now don t get me wrong - i believe srp to be the key to most good oo designs but i feel there are cases where this principles can and should be broken just like database normalization rules

15412
srp	principles
i aggressively push the benefits of srp and the great majority of my code follows this principles

15427
ant	maven
maven is a joy to use when it s working but as an old ant hacker i find maven to be hard to follow once things go wrong

15432
srp	principles
srp is a software engineering principles that can apply to the role of a class or a function or a module

15448
notepad	textpad

my only suggestion is to programmatically remove the dojotype on the server-side or client-side

15583
wan	lan
all of my visio experience is with lan wan documentation

15672
public	protected
public protected private and static properties of classes all work roughly as expected

15683
ubuntu	debian
this is my install scrpt i use it on debian servers but it will work in ubuntu ubuntu is built on debian

15731
post	get
i am looking for either a firefox extension or a similar program that allows you to craft get and post requests

15783
entity-relationship	diagram
now you should think of designing the database entity-relationship diagram class design dfds deployment etc

15810
folder	directory
you can set the build action copy to output directory property on individual files select the file and hit f4 to open the properties window to control what happens to them during build but not for folder

15902
png	ico
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy

15928
onmouseover	onclick
either a library like jquery that has been mentioned or by modifying the suckerfish code to use onclick instead of onmouseover out

15947
coldfusion	railo
there s a swiss company called railo who are currently in the process of releasing an open source coldfusion engine that is affiliated with jboss

edit for full disclosure i m biased toward aptana and radrails as i know a few members of the original radrails dev team

16086
aptana	radrails
i ve been using aptana eclipse radrails but if i were to do it again i d definitely try netbeans

16095
aptana	radrails
i have been using eclipse aptana radrails and unlike gaius have been pretty happy with it

16101
robocopy	xcopy
you can achieve that using tools like rsync unix or xcopy robocopy windows

16155
implements	extends
when i implements the ishipper interface i don t have to make the shipper object extends the vendor object that implements the ivendor interface

16164
rss	feed
i wondered if anyone can give an example of a professional use of rss atom feed in a company product

16169
rss	feed
they use rss feed for updates on your search

16180
rss	feed
sharepoint provides rss feed from its lists

16180
rss	feed
many faceted navigation products allow you to get an rss feed based on a selected filter

16180
rss	feed
for example you can navigate to view 24 lcd monitors on newegg.com and then get an rss feed of that view

16181
rss	feed
mantis bug tracker includes rss feed although i wish they were more configurable

16181
rss	feed
also we use mediawiki for documentation which has all sorts of rss feed including a per page watch and recent changes

16186
wxpython	pyqt
one of the fastest ways is to use python with a gui binding like pyqt pyfltk tkinter wxpython or even via pygame which uses sdl

16193
rss	feed
our website has a news page that i wrote an rss feed for as well

16215
switching	screens
i occasionally switching back to a monospace to disambiguate something but mostly find that a good clean sans-serif font is easiest to read and doesn t waste screens estate

16245
implements	extends
this allows you to both extends interfaces and also have a class that implements multiple interfaces both allowed and very useful in many cases without worrying about having to satisfy a particular constructor

16245
implements	extends
all shippers ups fedex etc now implements ishipper which extends ivendor and extends the abstract class shipper which has all common non-abstract methods for shippers defined in it getname getzip etc

16255
firefox	safari
safari and to a lesser extent firefox 3 have support for font-face in css which lets you use custom fonts

16305
rss	feed
i just added rss feed to the ticketing system i use at work ticketdesk and that feature should be in the next release of the product

16305
rss	feed
i m looking at implementing an rss feed for calls for service that our agency takes to provide the administrators a quick and easy way to see what has been going on

16381
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

16408
hash	md5
the md5 hash you re using has 128 bits with billions and billions of possible hash

16454
spaces	delimiter
then move on to state again use the spaces as the delimiter

16455
accessor	properties
what that means in the long run is that when you come back to make a change to your string format you will either have the ability to pop in and make a few adjustments to the format string or wrinkle your brow and start moving around all kinds of properties accessor mixed with text which is more likely to introduce problems

16507
spaces	linefeed
however if you are trying to use the 2 spaces rule in sentences throughout your site you ll soon find that the other characters the pre tag preserves are the linefeed carriage returns or lack of will muck up any styling you try to do

16552
rss	feed
my rss feed have served me well- i found that javascript roguelike

16564
nant	cruisecontrol
we actually use a combination of nant and msbuild with cruisecontrol

16601
equals	gethashcode
you should never override equals gethashcode for mutable objects - this goes for .net and java both

16630
button	checkbox
select the radio button a redirection to a url enter the url for the new site and check the checkbox for the exact url entered above a permanent redirection for this resource this second checkbox causes a 301 redirect instead of a 302 redirect

folder	directory
if you are referring to the folder the ide has as the current folder then you can just change the shortcut that launches delphi to set the current directory where ever you want it to be

16746
rss	feed
some of my team s new systems generate rss feed that the developers syndicate

16757
hide	show
won t work if you have the form on the content page itself like you do now but you could show hide the link to the special submission page based on noscript

16777
postgresql	mysql
basically postgresql and mysql supports the non-standard

16850
bazaar	git
i like mercurial other folks swear by git and bazaar

17009
scrummaster	sprint
what you want to do is done during the sprint planning where the whole team product owner scrummaster developers should be present

17018
aptana	radrails
aptana more or less is radrails or it s based on it

17120
nant	cruisecontrol
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build script that can be run by msbuild or nant

17177
ienumerable	ilist
and if you don t even need everything in ilist you can always use ienumerable too

17179
ienumerable	ilist
this will allow me to do generic processing on almost any array in the .net framework unless it uses ienumerable and not ilist which happens sometimes

17233
sorting	grouping	client-side	server-side
yeah it s bloatware but you get a lot of functionality that wouldn t be much fun to re-invent sorting paging grouping column reordering inline editing templating server-side and client-side

17249
kde	gnome
kdevelop is a kde project but run on gnome

17249
anjuta	gnome
anjuta is an equivalent project on gnome but i find it unusable for real work

ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
so when writing a function or method that takes a collection write it not to take a list but an ilist t an icollection t or ienumerable t

17299
int	double
it takes in a double pointer array to an array of int and sorts the double pointers based on the dereferenced value of the int

17331
stdout	stderr
it looks to me like mk and daniel fone interpreted it as wanting to see manipulate the stdout of the command neither of their solutions capture stderr fwiw

17342
wordpress	joomla
if you re familiar with html javascript basics i d look into a cms - wordpress drupal joomla nuke etc

17344
post	get
one reason i like this is that http is such a widely used protocol that it s easy to accept or create http post or get requests in any language in the event that you decide to change either the client or server language in the future

17350
listview	gridview
mainly i like the form view and listview the gridview still needs some work

17371
glut	glew
initialize glew using glewinit after you ve initialized glut or gl

17377
vb.net	vb6
.net rocks for when you want to hear the billionth interview about databinding controls in the trenches during the transition from vb6 to vb.net

17414
hash	salt
make sure to salt your hash for extra security vs rainbow tables

17419
hash	salt
about salt add the username in your hash salt will prevent someone who knows your salt and have access to your password file to write a rainbow table and crack number of your users s password

17475
valgrind	gprof
we used gdb extensively with the occasional use of valgrind and gprof

17570

you ll need to use chown chmod to make sure the correct users have access to them

17660
ubuntu	linux
although i would prefer linux specifically ubuntu over windows any day

17664
client-side	server-side
if possible i do not want to use any client-side read javascript code but if it cannot be done server-side javascript would be ok as well

17678
chown	chmod
you ll need to use chown chmod to make sure the correct users have access to them

17717
postgresql	mysql
we are currently using mysql for a product we are building and are keen to move to postgresql as soon as possible primarily for licensing reasons

17735
cvs	svn
when i first started using revision control systems like cvs and svn i didn t really understand the concepts of the trunk branching merging and tagging

17757
ssl	https
charles can act as a man-in-the-middle for http ssl communication enabling you to debug the content of your https sessions

17782
post	get
for example what tests get run who reviews pre post a change what action happens if a build breaks

17865
queue	fifo
my challenge is that the queue is not a fifo meaning that new items are prioritized and can be inserted somewhere in the middle of the queue

17959
pop-up	dialog
after wrestling with windows installer setup i figured out the best way to include the wse30 redist and pop-up a dialog if it is not installed

happens a lot with directx gdi and others

17989
int	chars	int	double
decimal places etc and the informs c c++ what the variable you ve given it is chars int double etc

18086
getter	setter
now this class is a monster as in frankenstein it has 167 field members all of them of type string 167 getter setter pairs 1 for each field a constructor that receives all 167 fields as parameters an equals method that compares all 167 fields in a strange way

18241
putty	winscp
take a look at putty psftp and pscp or winscp for windows or rsync and openssh for unixes

18249
octal	decimal	octal	hex
this one takes most of what has already been mentioned into consideration but includes hex and octal numbers negative scientific infinity and has removed decimal scientific 4e3.2 is not valid

18289
int	double
and int tricks for comparing double and floats are nice but tend to make it more difficult for the various cpu pipelines to handle effectively

18413
charindex	substr
i ve tried a bunch of variations on substr charindex convert and replace but i still can t seem to get something that works in all combinations

18437

mvp	presenter
i layer out the application and at least unit test from the presenter controller whichever is your preference mvc mvp to the data layer

18627
profiling	debugging
after doing some manual debugging the basic profiling for mono on linux didn t help much we were able to narrow the issue down to a specific chunk of code

18655
put	get
one thing i have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity orm

18672
put	get
if you do use windows you can get a whole slew of unix command line tools from here - unzip them and put them somewhere in your path

18856
quicksort	mergesort
this is where you teach the really advanced algorithms like mergesort and quicksort

18877
ncover	fxcop
all the results msbuild ncover nunit fxcop etc are in xml so you can build relativity simple report pages out of xslt

18943
ubuntu	debian
i realise that with apt.conf that you could set chmod 600 which it isn t by default on ubuntu debian

18949
min	max
assuming no nulls you group by the unique columns and select the min or max rowid as the row to keep

18959
filesystems	ntfs
try to mount each of them with either ntfs or vfat filesystems

19030
organization	naming
i have a bunch of files tv episodes although that is fairly arbitrary that i want to check match a specific naming organization scheme

19042
erd	diagram
the tool we found most valuable in these review sessions were erd s class diagram and sequence diagram

19042
erd	diagram
erd s and class diagram were done only in visual studio so the time required to create them was trivial for the students

19079
coalesce	isnull
terrapin there are a few other differences between isnull and coalesce that are worth mentioning besides ansi compliance which is a big one for me

19185
mouse	keyboard
there is some documentation on the internet that shows that windows changes the behavior of the notifyicon.balloontipshown command if the user is currently idle and this is detected by checking for keyboard and mouse events

19187
mouse	keyboard
see detecting idle time with mouse and keyboard hooks

jquery	jqmodal
i would like to recommend this jquery plugin though jqmodal

19326
inherited	properties
the class we are going to use is windowsformsapplicationbase and inherited our instance manager off of it and then leverage properties and events to handle the single instancing

19329
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i tested it in firefox 3 true and false in safari ie7 and opera

19370
cassini	iis
you are on vista iis got better 7 cassini stayed crappy

19395
shoes	fxruby	awt	swing
aside from interface builder which is included as part of the xcode tools you can also use qt gtk+ awt swing for your java background tk squeak for your smalltalk background shoes very cool little ruby gui toolkit fxruby more ruby wxwidgets xulrunner and others i m sure i ve forgotten

19398
put	get	goto	break
you can put in a conditional statement or several and when conditions are met properly you can use a goto statement to get out of all the loops instead of having a break statement at each level of nesting with a conditional statement for each

19403
goto	break
they are not adding a real goto but extending the break keyword to use static labels

19404
goto	break
then you don t have to worry about using multiple break statements or goto d

19419
postgresql	mysql
it goes through methods for doing this in mysql postgresql microsoft sql server ibm db2 and oracle the following is copied from that link

19433
mp3	flac
re-encoding audio file from flac - mp3 or vice versa

19467
mp3	flac
just about every language has bindings to c so you ll probably want to get the applicable c libraries for encoding decoding mp3 s and flac files

19555
postgresql	mysql
i m currently a fan of postgresql which is also freely available and i think if you read the licensing of mysql actually turns out to have a more amenable license for commercial use

19660
profiler	visualvm
visualvm should be the profiler from netbeans as standalone

19732
int	boolean
use int instead of boolean

19732
x86	64bit	128bit	64bit
in principle such a thing could be written cmpxchg the underlying processor instruction can operate on 8 16 32 and 64bit operands on x86 8 16 32 64 and 128bit operands on x64 but in practice most apis stick to pointer and double pointer 32 and 64bit on x86 64 and 128bit on x64 operands because they re all you really need

19767
yourkit	jprofiler
as mentioned both jprofiler and yourkit are both fairly good and not prohibitively expensive

19793
ostream	istream
the best thing to do is create public print ostream and read istream functions

19796
jlist	jtable
i d probably be looking to use a jtable rather than a jlist and since the default rendering of a checkbox is rather ugly i d probably be looking to drop in a custom tablemodel cellrenderer and celleditor to represent a boolean value

20049
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you are querying a sql server database version 7 and up you should replace the oledb classes with corresponding classes in the system.data.sqlclient namespace sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader as those classes have been optimized to work with sql server

20114
button	checkbox
click the validation button and uncheck the checkbox for checking validity

20126
idictionary	ilist
the xaml serializer and deserializer handles generics without a problem collections of base classes and interfaces as well as long as the collections themselves implement ilist or idictionary

20148
innodb	myisam
i ve read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between myisam and innodb and myisam seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database tables that i ll be using for this task

20192
cassini	iis
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

20195
postgresql	mysql
mysql quietly truncates varchars that exceed max length whereas postgresql complains - quick workaround is to have these columns as text instead of varchar and use triggers to truncate long lines

20195
int	boolean
boolean fields are compared using is and is not operators however mysql-compatible int 1 with and is still possible

20263
profiling	debugging
i find using sql server profiling extremely useful during development testing and when i am debugging database application problems

20483
implements	extends
however apply that interface to the extends class and the method only needs implements in the extends class

20533
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs and closer to the original emacs

20568
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs - emacs for os x emacs in a shell window is also an option

20607
getdate	strtotime
strtotime and getdate are two functions that can be used to get dates from strings and timestamps

20631
getter	setter
alt + s r to generate getter and setter

20641
hash	md5
a cryptographic hash such as sh1 or md5 allows you to verify that file you have has been downloaded correctly and has not been tampered with

20642
hash	md5
sha1 and md5 hash are used to verify the integrity of files you ve downloaded

20654
hash	md5
with a has md5 sha-1 one input matches only with one output and then if you down load the file and calculate the hash again should obtain the same output

20666
hash	md5
to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

20713
rss	feed
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details

20752
waitpid	fork
of course shells do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork execve and waitpid

20762
rss	feed
i need to consume an xml-based data source that conforms to a specific format think atom or rss feed but want to be able to consume data sources that have been published which contain invalid hexadecimal characters per the xml specification

20795
emacs	aquamacs
if you ever plan on making a serious effort at learning emacs immediately forget about aquamacs

20795
emacs	textmate
that might sound well and all but once you realize that it completely breaks nearly every standard keybinding and behavior of emacs you begin to wonder why you aren t just using textedit or textmate

20850
timemachine	hfs+
one is an hfs+ volume which i use for timemachine backups

20859
symlink	realpath
you may try using realpath to get what the symlink points to then trying to determine if it s a valid file using is file

20861
mbunit	nunit
i would like to do some integration testing of a web service from within nunit or mbunit

20866
int	boolean
a bitset is usually implemented as an array of int the boolean are packed into those int

20866
int	boolean
so the first 32 boolean bits in your bitset will only take up a single 32bit int but to read each value you have to do some bitwise operations first to mask out all the values you don t want

20866
int	chars
so if speed is an issue you ll be better off using a vector of chars or even int or even just use an old school bool array

20873
put	get
having a tags table and a map table makes it pretty trivial to generate tag clouds such since you can easily put together sql to get a list of tags with counts of how often each tag is used

20948
getter	setter
the worst thing you can do is add comments to obvious methods like getter and setter when they don t do more than what they should - get or set the named field

20966
put	get
on the other hand most people would love to get 5-10 pages of simple class diagrams with some basic descriptions of how the system is put together

20999
entity-relationship	diagram
i d definitely recommend gliffy.com for simple entity-relationship diagram it s an online flash based tool so cross platform

21137
mbunit	nunit
i would have thought that templates be readily available for nunit xunit mbunit et

21143
mbunit	nunit
mbunit and later versions of nunit also contain project templates for unit tests

21149
ironruby	ironpython
the ironruby guys have got some internal builds of mvc to work with ironruby and ironpython 2 and ironruby have a lot of code in common with the dlr

21149
ironruby	ironpython
i m not sure if they ll support ironpython ironruby when mvc is released but it s definitely worth keeping your eye on anyway - the old asp.net forms-based development model is old busted and the sooner it goes away the better

21464
post	get
this is my first post here and i wanted to get some input from people doing iphone development

21636
children	parent
you need some form of identifier to see the structure of the tree and grab all of a nodes children and a list of the parent path to a leaf to update

21644
memcached	apc
you can avoid stating the same file repeatedly by caching the results via memcached apc or some other in-memory caching system

21668
emacs	aquamacs
in much the way that aquamacs makes an os x-friendly version of emacs the emacsw32 project makes emacs out-of-the-box work just like a windows text editor

21697
mvp	presenter
so with mvp the presenter handles events raised by the view

21773
int	chars
int main int chars

22074
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

22096
client-side	server-side
that way you can combine server-side og client-side scripting and still dont have to hardcode _id ct100_nav _

22168
unicode	ucs
utf-8 8-bit ucs unicode transformation format is a variable-length character encoding for unicode

22169
rss	feed
for example if you wanted to dynamically create an rss feed you could write an http handler that handles all requests for .rss files creates the output and sends it back to the user

22177
post	get
handlers are usually done for specific extensions and http request types post get

22185
pop-up	dialog
if that is cleared then your web application users will see a pop-up ntlm dialog

22219
jython	pypy
of course if i run jython or ironpython or possibly pypy then the garbage collector won t necessarily run until much later

22259
gif	png
i want to allow users to upload avatar-type images in a variety of formats gif jpeg and png at least but to save them all as png database blobs

22271
gif	png
it uses imagecreatefrom jpeg gif png and resize and converts the image and then outputs to the browser

22376
versioning	upgrade
implementing the forced upgrade to ensure users have the latest versioning when running is so much easier in clickonce and a main reason for my usage of it

22443
cvs	svn
get familiar with coding standards patch types unified diff and checkout a copy of their cvs or svn if they allow anonymous access

22459
memset	malloc
as you can see i m not trying to use memset with a size larger that what s originally allocated with malloc

22658
folder	directory
one of the things about subversion that irks me is that it puts its own folder in each directory of a project whereas git only puts one in the root directory

22730
hide	show
for example as i am typing this answer i like the way it show a real-time preview of the answer with an option to hide preview - i would definitely want to use similar type of interaction while building a user forum interface

22792
versioning	upgrade
we need a db compare tool to generate diff scripts to be able to upgrade a db from one versioning to another

22829
put	get
allowing multi-tag search such that the user can put subversion svn or subversion svn well from programmers to programmers in the search box and get both

22873
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme

22892
innodb	myisam
switching between myisam and innodb is trivial so load some test data and fire jmeter against your site and see what happens

22912
free	malloc
we ve had pretty good luck by writing our own malloc and free functions

22912
free	malloc
in production they just call the standard malloc and free but in debug they can do whatever you want

22912
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you have a ton of code it may be a big job to replace calls to malloc and free to the new malloc and free don t forget realloc

22912
free	memset
memset the memory with a marker on allocation to find usage of uninitialized memory and on free to find usage of free d memory

22912
strcpy	strncpy	printf	strncpy	printf	strcpy
another good idea is to never use things like strcpy strcat or printf -- always use strncpy strncat and printf

22931
lisp	scheme
if you want to learn lisp scheme read sicp

22966
httphandler	httpmodule
you will need to learn the asp.net http pipeline and how to implement the ihttpmodule and the ihttphandler interfaces to create your own httpmodule or httphandler class to handle your routing

22988
textarea	textbox
the main difference between this textbox and the others is that this is a multi-line box for inputting notes which i believe is rendered as an html textarea tag instead of an input tag in asp.net

23048
easymock	jmock
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me

23137
post	get
a better way would be to retrieve the post read by the current user and then use activerecord calculations to get a count without retrieving all the post in the database

23193
haskell	ocaml
i posted a bunch of links to haskell and ocaml references that are books with examples et cetera that seem right up your alley

23203
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

23219
mouse	keyboard
sounds like maybe if it s a keyboard or mouse windows grabs it exclusively

23220
put	get	post	put	post	get
for each of those urls try running a get post put or delete http methods with different parameters so that you can ensure that you re only giving access to what you want to give access to

23232
perl	tcl
for my own future reference i ll offer the regexp syntax summary page which contrasts the syntax for grep egrep emacs perl python and tcl

23241
int	chars	int	double
i think that what makes pointers tricky to learn is that until pointers you re comfortable with the idea that at this memory location is a set of bits that represent an int a double a chars whatever

23244
rss	feed
for instance this one sends you to google reader to view the rss feed for a page

23273
haskell	ocaml
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular

23322
cvs	svn
i think that using cvs with tortoisecvs and eclipse s would be nice as well though i prefer the way svn handles revisioning

23335
erlang	lisp
in functional school we would have nearly functional some considered them to be impure lisp family and ml family and many purely functional haskell erlang etc

23376
rar	zip
we tried zip in the past but once the database files crossed the 4gb boundary we had to use rar zip is 32-bit only

23392
jobs	cron
under linux you can use cron jobs to schedule tasks

23457
lisp	prolog
try prolog or lisp and see what you can do with those

23511
hash	md5
i understand that it uses a function referred to as md5crypt but i can t seem to find a description of the algorithm beyond that at some point it uses md5 to create a hash

23557
hash	salt
we can safely store the salt value with the hash password since even knowing the salt value won t help to decode the hash

23592
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
for example let us assume that i have about 200 podcasts downloaded to my pc in the form of mp3 wav and ogg files

23658
vim	notepad++
a fast loading text editor for when your ide is too much vim notepad++

23703
websphere	ibm
for example for all the people who dislike the stop-the-world approach of the default sun java vm gc behaviour there are vm such as ibm s websphere real time which allows real-time application to run on java

23737
disk	ram
my machine has 2 gb of ram dual core processor and a 7200 rpm hard disk

23804
versioning	upgrade
thus you may want to upgrade your mysql 3 server to 4 - this compatibility mode allows for the export your database or individual tables to create a sql file that can import into a mysql 4 versioning server should work in 5 also

23819
clang	llvm
for c and objective-c you can also use the llvm clang static analyzer

23835
for-loop	loops
for-loop and while loops are entry condition loops

23939
vim	textmate
for python stuff a good text editor textmate on os x g vim on linux programmers notepad on windows vcs i m mainly using git currently

23966
post	get
if you just use get and post it s still restful

23966
post	get
your web service may only do things which only required get or post so that s fine

24035
integer	unsigned
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

24046
firefox	safari
in ie and firefox you see the alert box again in safari you do not

24053
firefox	safari
i think it is because firefox and ie when going back are retrieving the page from the server again and safari is not

24065
put	get
people seem to get the concept better you put it in those terms

24103
post	get
i m no expert but from what i learned so far the golden rule is not to trust any user data get post cookie

24119
valgrind	gprof
once thatâ s done the shell is your command interface to interact with the various tools â debuggers gdb profilers gprof valgrind etc

24142
client-side	server-side
for instance if you have a form field that will only ever accept integers make sure you re implementing something at both the client-side and the server-side to sanitise the data

24142
onmouseover	onload
likewise if you re going to display any user-inputted information onto a webpage make sure you ve stripped any script tags or anything else that might result in javascript execution such as onload onmouseover etc

24148
getter	setter
your application isn t going to take any real-world performance hit either way but using a class lets you use getter and setter methods and is generally going to be better for code encapsulation and code reuse

24150
min	max
most min max macros will include the parameters multiple times and may not do what you expect

24156
g++	gcc
you should however know all the important parameters for g++ and ld the gcc linker tool that s invoked automatically except when explicitly prevented

24174
anjuta	gnome
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users

24270
lsp	principles
few people use oop in any rigorous sense few people adhere to or understand principles such as lsp

24299
cpython	ironpython
you can also access the .net framework through ironpython a microsoft implementation of cpython

24313
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it worked great in every browser i tested it in ie6 7 firefox safari opera

24322
irc	telnet
telnet onto an irc server and witness the simplicity of the protocol first hand

24455
goto	break
in perl use of a label to goto from a loop - using a last statement which is similar to break

24476
goto	break
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

24495
getter	setter
i have a struts + velocity structure like for example a person class whose one property is a car object with its own getter setter methods and it is mapped to a velocity form that submits to an action using modeldriven and getmodel structure

24513
goto	break
sometimes it s clearer to use a flag variable of some kind to effect a kind of pseudo-multi-level break but it s not always superior to the goto at least a goto allows one to easily determine where control goes to unlike a flag variable and sometimes you simply don t want to pay the performance price of flags other contortions to avoid the goto

24516
haskell	ocaml
i m trying to parse a grammar in ocamlyacc pretty much the same as regular yacc which supports function application with no operators like in ocaml or haskell and the normal assortment of binary and unary operators

24549
firefox	safari
it s supposedly being ported to firefox and safari but that s been happening for a while now

24595
vim	emacs
i have really tried to use emacs and vim but i don t have the time to learn them

24602
screens	tablet
to some extent it really depends if you want only a tablet no video feedback on the device or a screens having video feedback which i find nice but is also a bit pricey...

24613
kate	kde
kate kde syntax-highlighing

24638
firefox	safari
there is currently no way to programmatically disable the safari spellchecker as there is in firefox and ie7+ so most rich text editors choose to let safari do its own thing by leaving the browser in control of the context menu

24641
inherited	subclassing
inherited - subclassing - tends to

24645
implements	extends
i exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client api and it would have been awesome to extends the client api class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface

24661
implements	extends
i exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client api and it would have been awesome to extends the client api class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface

24682
minix	linux
as a side note if you ve read just for fun linus actually was playing with minix before he wrote linux but it just wasn t enough for his purposes

24707
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
i ve used tapestry 3 wicket echo and jsf fairly extensively

24707
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
in the end i d recommend just taking a look at tapestry wicket and jsf and just picking the one that feels the best to you

24732
vmware	virtualbox
aside from the good books already mentioned opeating system design implementation is particularly good get a hold of a 1.x release linux kernel load it into vmware or virtualbox and start playing around from there

24734
rss	feed
i m trying to add support for stackoverflow feed in my rss reader but selectnodes and selectsinglenode have no effect

24820
ironruby	ironpython
we use wix to automate msi builds for ironpython and ironruby

24841
cifs	smb
you need something that speaks smb cifs on one end and your own code on the other

24841
cifs	smb
winfuse which is kind of a barebones cifs smb server that can host your own filesystem

24908
free	malloc
to fix you need to call free for everything that is obtained with malloc after you finish using it

24910
int	double
for primitive types int double ... the operators are built in so the compiler will probably be able to optimize your code

24941
phpunit	simpletest
tips on gui s for phpunit would also be appreciated but my main focus is simpletest for this project

24943
cvs	svn
oh yeah don t forget support for source control directly from inside the tool svn cvs tfs scc

24969
getter	setter
if it is completely trivial getter setter etc do not test it unless you don t have confidence in the code for some reason

25008
lsp	principles
also due to lsp liskov substitution principles one can use derived class where base class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance code using base class may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected

25011
memcached	apc
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them

25035
vb.net	vb6
were they in vb6 i think i would consider upgrading them to vb.net just for maintainability

25049
width	height
you can only change the height and width of a span element when it is set to display block

25056
memcached	apc
memcached is nice if you have clustered servers and youtube-like load but i d try out apc first too

25077
hash	md5
but i am confused as to how both files came out to the same md5 hash

25079
memcached	apc
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them

25079
memcached	apc
actually many do use apc and memcached together .

25105
unix	bsd
unix and bsd courses courses and videos

25105
unix	bsd
not quite related but i ll also recommend the video history of the berkeley software distributions as it gives a nice introduction to the bsd parts of the unix history and culture as well as plenty of hilarious anectodes from back when

25110
width	height
you can set any element to display inline-block to allow it to receive a height or width

25158
hide	show
use one form and hide and show controls

25170
hide	show
the method i often use is actually to pre-setup all my controls on individual panel controls and then show and hide these panels as i need them

25170
hide	show
and if you show or hide the panel the controls on it do the same

25171
post	get
tamper data this can be helpful for debugging get post requests

25171
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i also install safari and opera but mostly just use them for testing and benchmarking since their dev tools aren t as robust as firefox and they aren t as buggy as ie

25196
actionscript	mxml
flashdevelop hooks up nicely with the flex compiler which is available for free it compiles both mxml the language flex applications are written in and actionscript 3

25256
httpcontext	httpmodule
essentially you need to remove the httpmodule s reliance on httpapplication and httpcontext replacing them with an interface

25469
hide	show
show and hide these panels as i need

25511
jobs	cron
it sounds like you need to put some scheduled jobs in place with cron or windows equiv

25581
firefox	safari
if you learn css to the point where you can code most things without having to look up the reference if you re still looking up reference regularly you don t really know it and can t claim to complain i think and then develop for firefox safari it s a pretty nice place to be in

25581
firefox	safari
leave the pain and suffering of ie compatibilit to the end after it works in firefox safari so your mind will attribute the blame to ie where it damn well belongs rather than css in general

25614
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
i ve used jdom in the past and have looked briefly at xom and dom4j

25646
width	height
the width and height are correct and 800x600 buffer and m_pixelbuffer is correctly filled with 0xaa00aa00

25701
jdom	xom
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

25784
getter	setter
they become part of the method signature available from the runtime which do can look at to determine how to best serialize a transaction. there are also the attributes within property declarations copy retain assign readonly readwrite nonatomic getter and setter

25815
super	implements
c.__bases__ is an array of the super classes so you could implements your hypothetical function like so

25855
udp	mtu
for linux according to the udp man page the kernel will use mtu discovery it will check what the maximum udp packet size is between here and the destination and pick that or if mtu discovery is off it ll set the maximum size to the interface mtu and fragment anything larger

25892
int	boolean
several new data types including long long int optional extended int types an explicit boolean data type and a complex type to represent complex numbers

25983
jdom	xerces
if you want to benefit from an xsl transformation engine like xalan or an xpath engine like jaxen or saxon i would recommend sticking to the more popular framework available like xerces jdom

25983
xslt	xquery
of course if you need blinding speed and do not care about xpath xquery or xslt you can surely find yourself something that is much faster and or resource-hungry

26015
hash	salt
the way i ve been doing it is a rather conventional approach of sending the score and player name in plain text and then a hash of the two properly salt

26025
apache	nginx
i have heard of mod_wsgi and mod_python on apache nginx and lighty

26068
apache	lighttpd
you may not want to server all files using apache and use lighttpd lighty to server static files

26080
postgresql	mysql
edit i should mention that i ve only used this syntax with access sql 2000 2005 express mysql and postgresql so those should be covered

26127
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if you size your elements and space the content within using padding you can make many layouts work great in ie6 7 firefox safari and opera without any hacks

26133
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
design your own class structure containing multiple higher order datatypes like double or int64 variables and define basic math operations for them using operator overloading in c++ or via methods named add subtract multiplying shift etc

26162
boost	stl
this is also used in the stl and in many libraries including boost

26162
boost	stl
edit i ve amended the code to reflect boost stl conventions as pointed out by daniel in his comment.

26228
button	checkbox
the tools that visually-impaired people use to access the web need the label s to read-out the meaning of checkbox and radio button

26240
disk	ram
it s possible that your using up most of the ram and causing the disk the trash or some similar problem

26350
lisp	scheme
for lisp and scheme hell functional programming in general there are few things that provide a more solid foundation than the little schemer and the seasoned schemer

26364
ncover	fxcop
msbuild is responsible for updating from svn on every commit compiling and running fxcop and ncover nunit

26397
ford-fulkerson	dijkstra
dijkstra and ford-fulkerson algorithms on graphs i like the fact that the second one has many applications

26398
int	chars
if you need to index simple chars or int values then the normal b-tree index is the best

26468
persistent	transient
this is basically the catch-all method as it converts a transient object into a persistent one save updates the object if it is existing update or even handles if the entity is a copy of an already existing object copy

26602
hide	show
which code decides to show hide the button that leads to the action is irrelevant

26602
hide	show
that leaves us with only one drawback of doing show hide logic in javascript - the html sent to user is bigger than necessary

26602
hide	show
having show hide logic in php does have a minus though

26602
hide	show
so if you already have a script that runs when your document load for other reasons i would seriously consider having show hide logic there

26668
vtune	shark
vtune and shark are both excellent as well

26682
profiling	instrumentation
it has several types of profiling built in performance memory windows handles exception tracing static analysis etc. and instrumentation the code to get the results

26851
perforce	svn
we used perforce for well over a year before switching to svn recently

26851
perforce	svn
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

26851
perforce	svn
contrary to perforce visualsvn does not work with the ms scc interface but rather directly with the svn client which i personally see as an advantage

26851
perforce	svn
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

26863
folder	directory
deleting the visual studio 9.0 folder in my application settings directory

26873
mvp	presenter
i think another benefit of using the mvc pattern is that it opens up the doors to other approaches to the design such as mvp presenter first and the many other mv patterns

26879
opera	firefox
however when the content gets larger opera and firefox show a scrollbar at the left so you can scroll to the content not on the screen

26912
hide	show
i have ran into issues using the ajaxcontroltoolkit on repeated fields and usually side with using a lighter weight client-side option up to and including rolling your own show hide method that can be reused just by passing in an dom understood id

26920
struts	wicket
i had successfully developed an online banking application with struts when i discovered wicket and saw how easy web application development can be

26929
perforce	cvs
perhaps after years of using a centralized model in one format or another perforce subversion cvs i just found distributed source control difficult to use

26942
swt	swing
don t know if it works with swt as well because i used only swing in my apps

26965
boost	stl
if you look into stl boost mfc atl and many open source projects you can see there are so many assertion statements and that makes project going further more safely

26969
cvs	svn
and cherry-picking merges while not trivial is not terribly difficult and far more advanced than anything svn or cvs can do

26973
client-side	server-side
because merges are performed client-side they are much faster and less error-prone than initiating a server-side merge

27000
nullpointerexception	indexoutofboundsexception
on the other hand nullpointerexception s and indexoutofboundsexception s might actually often be appropriate

27032
min	max
rather than just dropping controls on the form you ll have to play a bit with panels padding min max sizing and docking

27035
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is supported in opera and firefox and i recon in safari but haven t tested

27132
put	get
last in first out lifo means that the last thing you put in is always the first thing you get back out - if you push 2 items on the stack a and then b then the first thing you pop off the stack will be b and the next thing is a

27132
cpu	processors
don t break your programs up too far into smaller and smaller functions - even without counting local variables each function call consumes as much as 64 bytes on the stack 32 bit processors saving half the cpu registers flags etc

27148
rss	feed
i want to merge multiple rss feed into a single feed removing any duplicates

27160
csv	tsv
from my experience even just excel makes a pretty good tool for quickly whipping up graphs of perfmon if you relog the data to csv or tsv

27162
rss	feed
here is an article on merge multiple rss feed into one with yahoo

27244
rss	feed
simplepie is a php library that supports merging rss feed into one combined feed

27254
extjs	mootools
it could be that prototype or mootools or extjs are as good as jquery

27256
jquery	scriptaculous
to put some names out there prototype scriptaculous jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs

27292
folder	directory
unfortunately svn places .svn hidden directory everywhere which cause problems especially when other developers make folder structure changes or copy move website directory

27340
post	get
considering the callback is buried in the client code it would take someone with equal determination to get either the querystring or the post request

27391
width	height
and why expect a certain minimum width or height

27393
rss	feed
in the latest podcast jeff and joel talked about the rss feed for tags and joel noted that there is only the current ability to do and on tags not or

27418
avr	microcontroller
on my platform avr 8-bit microcontroller running gcc

27430
jboss	resin	jboss	weblogic	weblogic	resin
it support many servers not only weblogic including tomcat jboss resin jetty and websphere

27435
postgresql	mysql
i am working on a web application using python django and would like to know whether mysql or postgresql would be more suitable when deploying for production

27439
postgresql	mysql
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

27440
postgresql	mysql
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27443
postgresql	mysql
if you are writing an application which may get distributed quite a bit on different servers mysql carries a lot of weight over postgresql because of the portability

27443
postgresql	mysql
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

27445
postgresql	mysql
i haven t used django but i have used both mysql and postgresql

27445
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a little more scalable it doesn t hit the brick wall as fast as mysql as data size client count increases

27450
accessor	properties
in addition you can serve out additional server-side objects from the myserverobject instance if you include public accessor for them in iremoteserver interface so accessing those objects become the simple matter of method calls or properties accesses on your main server object so you don t have to use activator for every single thing

27463
ssl	https
443 when used for https relies on ssl not ssh for its encryption

27481
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying by 3 can be done by simple shifts adds if no multiplying instruction exists or if multiplication only works with 8 bit operands

27483
avr	microcontroller
on my platform avr 8-bit microcontroller running gcc

27503
put	get
you should be able to take this and do some mild pruning of it to put in your username password dbname to get it up and working for you

27508
folder	directory
red gate s sql compare product not only allows you to do object-level comparisons and generate change scripts from that but it also allows you to export your database objects into a folder hierarchy organized by object type with one objectname .sql creation script per object in these directory

27529
postgresql	mysql
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

27587
x86	64bit
both 32 and 64bit x86 and 64bit ppc

27598
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere 6.1 it s supossed to support jsr 160 javatm management extensions jmx remote api

27630
public	protected
public dispose calls protected dispose true - deals with both managed and unmanaged resources

27642
boost	stl
so no stl or boost

27674
firefox	safari
in our project sharpwired we re trying to create a download component similar to the download windows in firefox or safari

27687
disk	ram
it is limited to 4gb of disk space 1gb of ram and will only use 1 processor

27711
gridview	linqdatasource
i m having a problem obtaining the total row count for items displayed in a gridview using paging and with a linqdatasource as the source of data

27786
easymock	jmock
i started using mocks through jmock but eventually transitioned to use easymock

27905
disk	ram
wcm - actually to nit pick the table variable isn t ram only - it can be partially stored on disk

27993
redhat	fedora
just happened across this article which point out shortcomings in redhat centos fedora implementations of perl which affect uri profoundly

27993
redhat	fedora
i realized that anyone running perl code with the distribution perl interpretter on redhat 5.2 centos 5.2 or fedora 9 is likely a victim

28059
svnkit	subclipse
i used the update url and i installed the javahl adapter the subclipse project itself and the svnkit adapter beta

28115
int	boolean
if you re converting anything other than simple types like int or boolean you d need to write your own function method for the type that you re trying to convert otherwise php will just print the type such as array googlesniffer or bidet

28132
range	max	range	min	min	max
the real power of arrayformula comes when you take the result from one of those computations and wrap it inside a formula that does take array or range arguments sum max min concatenate

28172
post	get
if you plan on doing it from the command line that is the impression i get from your post then you should probably define a strict set of allowable inputs only single letter variables no whitespace and only certain mathematical symbols +- etc.

28256
yacc	bison
it s simple enough that i don t see the need for yacc or bison

28272
yacc	bison
note that using a grammar does not at all imply using a specific tool a la yacc bison ...

28286
cos	sin
if you want it to be really really general such as be able to parse mathematical functions as well like sin 4+5 cos 7 3 you will probably need a parse tree

28317
mouse	keyboard
i also made sure that some of the mac os keyboard and mouse shortcuts were not registered in vmware fusion to stop strange things happening

28470
getter	setter
i would advise using setter getter instead

28541
aptana	radrails
i started out with radrails then moved to aptana when they took it over wasn t too bad

28551
submit	submission
in a day or two i ll be ready to submit my iphone app to the appstore and i m curious whether people who have gone through this process have any tips suggestions for a smooth submission process

28758
datamapper	activerecord
in his book on patterns martin fowler points out that activerecord tends to break down under conditions where your model is fairly complex and suggests a datamapper as the alternative

28758
datamapper	activerecord
whether your datamapper classes contain raw custom sql or calls to a data abstraction layer api or even access an activerecord pattern themselves doesn t really matter to the controller code that is receiving a nice populated user object

28769
ilist	icollection
there s also ilist or icollection if you want to use a construct that is still somewhat flexible but also has the feature you require

28820
vbscript	jscript
i d like this to be a little more friendly for the admins who are familiar with scripting in vbscript jscript etc

28827
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend code-named sparkle - visual user interface builder for windows presentation foundation and silverlight applications

28838
vbscript	jscript
there is definitely not a vbscript engine i ve ever heard of nor jscript

28849
tolower	toupper
what steve says is right but i guess that if your code had to support several languages you could have a factory method that encapsulates a set of methods that do the relevant toupper or tolower based on that language

28874
post	get
i am reluctant to post a chunk of ms framework code here but you could use either reflector or this to get the source code for the relevant bits of the framework so that you could try implementing various bits to see where it fails

28878
domxpath	domdocument
in php i m using domdocument and domxpath which closely corresponds to c# xmldocument

28885
solaris	aix
however having done a lot of development on ancient versions of solaris aix and hp-ux just recently - yes these platforms are still alive in the fortune 50 i can tell you that if you really care about portability you should use templates as little as possible

28919
ilist	icollection
if possible you might want to consider changing to use an icollection or ilist icollection being more widely scoped than ilist which has a count property on it

29046
postgresql	mysql
if you want to build a web site you really need a database server engine like ms sql postgresql mysql oracle or their brethren

29053
firefox	safari
the extra comma in the array is being ignored by safari and firefox while ie treats it as another object in the array

29053
firefox	safari
most people say that ie is correct but then safari is also doing the same thing as firefox

29124
cos	sin
my only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the shunting yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parser is that little toy languages 1 may someday turn into big actual languages with functions sin cos log and variables conditions and for loops

29124
multiplication	exponent
3 snippet of a haskell parser using parsec a four function calculator extended with exponent parentheses whitespace for multiplication and constants like pi and e

29144
perforce	svn
edit to clarify i know both perforce svn allow locking merging but svn encourages a liberal edit merge method whereas as i understand it perforce encourages a checkout-checkin method

29174
jquery	simplemodal
i m using jquery and simplemodal in an asp.net project to make some nice dialogs for a web app

29177
mousemove	mouseleave
i have found a blog post describing one mechanism but it involves a good deal of manual bookkeeping including status flags mousemove events manual mouseleave checking etc

29235
superclass	subclassing
if you don t declare your own constructor in the subclassing trying to instantiate it will throw a fatal error because it tries to call the superclass constructor

29238
perforce	svn
perforce supports merging and in fact had better merge support than svn until svn 1.5 where named merges were added as well as change lists which perforce has always had and i mis very much moving to a shop that used svn but we won t upgrade until 1.5 has been a bit more time tested.

29238
perforce	svn
it s worth noting that svn and perforce both allow you to do a locked checkout so you can do the unmerged model if you want but aside perhaps from managing binaries with version control i don t see much use for this

29242
stdout	stderr
edit clarification i am looking for code that i can easily drop in to my own programs to write to stderr stdout log files or other such output streams

29274
getter	setter
they are all emulated by using getter and setter

29277
daemon	cron
i think your best bet would be a ping daemon cron job that checks the status of each box periodically and sends an email if one doesn t respond

29319
put	get
if you put .tostring to a var query variable you get the sql

29358
ati	nvidia
for something that s not crazy expensive go with either a nvidia geforce 8000 series card or an ati 3000 series card

29422
decoder	encoder
running it through an encoder of some kind this is so so useful as it can just be run through the decoder

29521
int	chars
or you can convert the int to its chars value

29524
put	get
on the other hand it s possible to log arbitrary exceptions and if they get put in the stream as well my point stands.

29532
integer	unsigned
typically you should maintain the two-element buffer but handle a machine word 32 64 bit unsigned integer at a time

29545
put	get
once you get the count to 0 via the attribute you then put in a rule that new checkins may not introduce fxcop violations

29557
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

29562
ubuntu	debian
my main goal is to create a .deb package for debian ubuntu users but i don t understand make configure files

29563
nunit	mstest
we are in fact moving away from nunit to mstest

29622
put	get
you also have to get your game rated by the esrb which will put you back another 2500

29640
swt	swing
it allows you to design user interfaces for swing swt and even the google web toolkit gwt

29680
pop-up	dialog
whenever the user provides invalid credentials the ntlm dialog box pop-up in internet explorer

29694
integer	unsigned
i keep mysql s auto_increment as unsigned integer fields of various sizes in order to make use of the full range as i know there will never be negative values

29694
integer	unsigned
ms sql does not support the unsigned attribute on all integer types so i have to choose between ditching half the value range or creating some workaround

29705
put	get
basically you get data from somewhere your outgoing articles do something to it aggregate and put it somewhere else your aggregates table data warehouse etc

29726
opera	firefox
someone has done it in ie6 but it does not work in firefox or opera afaik

29752
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you can use either a sortedlist or sorteddictionary both sort by the key or a dataview

29754
post	get
to get around that you could implement a processing page like rob suggests that post back until the response is ready

29760
installation	upgrade
installation upgrade runs.

29770
vim	emacs
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in

29770
vim	emacs
also plugs into vim and emacs

29792
postgresql	mysql
i have worked with oracle ms sql server mysql postgresql sqlite and sybase that i can think of

29831
profiling	benchmarking
and if after all this your profiling and benchmarking reveals that the lexical_casts are an unacceptable bottleneck that s when you should consider doing some macro horror

29836
igraph	networkx
as already mentioned networkx is very good with another option being igraph

29837
cvs	svn
maybe keep the doc s under cvs or svn and set it up so that emails are generated to whoever has checked out a copy when updates for the same doc

29862
min	max
the basic way of handling this is to group by your fixed fields and select a max or min for some unqiue value a datetime usually works well

29923
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
at the place where i work we decided to move from svn to bazaar after evaluating git and mercurial

29923
bazaar	git
bazaar was easy to start off with simple commands not like the 140 commands that git has

29923
bazaar	git
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

29934
opera	firefox
the firefox model opera uses the handy variables input .selectionstart and selectionend

29972
teamcity	nant
i use teamcity with an nant build script

29972
teamcity	nant
teamcity makes it easy to setup the ci server part and nant build script makes it easy to do a number of tasks as far as report generation is concerned

30066
stdout	stderr
by default these stderr streams are redirected to the stdout of an interactive bash

30066
stdout	stderr
i would like to get them on the stderr of this interactive bash process in order to prevent my stdout to be polluted by error messages and be able to treat them separatly

30069
int	chars
if you do it either of the first two ways it is too easy to either start adding new meaning to the int without going through a proper design or ending up with that chars field having y y n n t t f f values and having to remember which section of code uses which table and which version of true it is using

30091
tinyint	boolean
oracle doesn t support boolean bit or tinyint data types so char s one byte is as small as you can get

30126
intersect	contains
check that your denominator isn t zero line doesn t intersect or is contains in the plane and you ll be good to go

30134
post	get
without that abstraction you work much more closely with the html and the http post and get commands

30152
folder	directory
i was zipping the contents of my subversion sandbox using winxp s inbuilt send to compressed zipped folder capability and was surprised to find that the .zip file created did not contain the .svn directory and their contents

30171
int	double
i have tried with other primitives int double and the same thing happens

30184
move	drag
but i would like the user to be able to click anywhere in the form and drag it to move it around on the desktop while it is still being displayed

30187
mouse	keyboard
this event fires when the keyboard or mouse state changes after dodragdrop has been called on that control

30187
mouseup	mousedown
just a note though as i call dodragdrop from within the mousedown event handler in my example this code should never actually get a direct mouseup event to fire

30195
folder	directory
it looks like the compressed folder shell extension ignores directory but not files whose names begin with a dot unless explicitly given as a parameter selected for the send to command

30197
google-chrome	firefox
google gears workerpool demo not a good example as it runs too fast to test in google-chrome and firefox although ie runs it slow enough to see it blocking interaction

30243
textmate	gedit
for very simple linux support if you like textmate try just gedit loaded with the right plugins

30243
textmate	gedit
gedit how to set up like textmate

30397
hide	show
it is trivial to modify this example to check the users group and show or hide the menu based on membership

30471
getdate	strtotime
you can avoid having to use strtotime or getdate in php by using mysql s unix_timestamp function

30490
post	get
users can post questions comments and feedback about and application and get answers to their questions either from other members or from members of the development team themselves

30564
x86	64bit
you can target x64 and it will generate dll s specifically for 64bit systems or you can do x86 which will run on 32-bit and 64bit but will have the same restrictions as 32-bit on a 64bit system

30598
implements	extends
by contrast i can also create an object that does not extends from account say a user abstract class and still implements listable and editable but not versionable which doesn t make sense here

30598
implements	extends
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable

30620
ubuntu	linux
i use windows at work and windows linux ubuntu osx at home

30669
decoder	encoder
most filters in this list are codecs so contain both a encoder and decoder

30677
xstream	jibx
but if you are want to deal with java objects then you should look at castor jibx jaxb xmlbeans xstream or something similar

30691
post	put
let me know if you need more detail and i will see if i can put together a step-by-step blog post but hopefully this gets you off on the right direction

30699
mouse	keyboard
manipulate with the keyboard and or mouse

30931
kde	gnome
i m looking for a way that is standard works with gnome and kde based systems and can be done automatic when my program is installed or run for the first time

30939
kde	gnome
2 gnome and kde have different methods to accomplish this

30949
salt	md5
md5 or sha1 + salt

30952
salt	md5
if you use md5 or sha1 use a salt to avoid rainbow table hacks

30964
ssl	https
we have an external service that is currently accessible via the http port 80 non-ssl and https port 443 ssl addresses

30967
salt	md5
i second the vote for md5 or sha with a salt

30971
hash	salt
you need to be using an uni-directional hash algorithm like sha-1 suggested above with a salt

30979
hash	salt
a salt is a constant value that you mix in with the input before using the hash function

30995
pop-up	dialog
occasionally while attempting to save a crystal report that i m working on in vs2008 a dialog titled file save failed pop-up saying the document could not be saved in c users phillip appdata local temp xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx .rpt

31042
perforce	svn
i use perforce right now and for some reason i like svn better

31042
perforce	svn
personally i feel like svn s price tag makes up for anything it lacks compared to perforce

31059
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
in vs .net when you are selecting a folder for a project a dialog that looks like an openfiledialog or savefiledialog is displayed but is set up to accept only folders

31119
getter	setter
static functions often require you to use setter and getter which clutter a class s api and makes things more complicated in general

31211
inherited	properties
this is totally off the cuff but you could make the user control expose some protected methods and properties to return validation information and then have a testing user control inherited it

31238
accessor	properties
the thing i don t know how to do is take the string prop1 in the config file and turn that into the actual properties accessor in the code

31285
ubuntu	linux
i am using vmware tools for ubuntu hardy but for some reason vmware-install.pl finds fault with my linux headers

31288
getter	setter
core data also gets you features like visual modeling of your entities automatic generation of property getter setter fine-grained control over migration from one schema version to another and so on

31295
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
are there any good libraries that don t create this problem in safari but are also good for internet explorer and firefox and hopefully opera

31304
disk	ram
as long as you have the resources separate hard disk for the virtual machine sufficient ram i don t see why you would have any problems

31332
ccl	clisp
sbcl ext saveinitmem in clisp and ccl save-application in

31358
implements	extends
in my example my foo class extends thread i then implements the run method which is where the code that you would like to run in a thread goes

31372
put	get
edit i should also point out that you can put some of the code in c c++ if you want to get around the gil as well

31425
postgresql	mysql
the long answer expanding on what the op said is to be more compatible with apache and mysql postgresql

31425
x86	64bit
they are all 64bit apache is a fat binary with ppc ppc64 x86 and x86 and x86_64 the others just straight 64bit

31446
entities	entitymanager
in my program i eventually have to call flush on the entitymanager which would persist all changes from attached entities to the underyling database but i want to exclude specific objects

31625
getter	setter
i use to be a fan of the java and worse c# practice of making getter and setter get set properties throughout an object

31625
getter	setter
you really only want to add as much complexity as is required to get the job done and getter and setter while simple in themselves add complexity in heaps when added in mass

31648
mbunit	nunit
i used to use nunit but now tend to use mbunit for two key features

collabnet	svn
svn solved both those is easy to set up i use collabnet server and tortoisesvn client although there are two good visual studio plugins visualsvn - commercial and ankhsvn - open source easy to use and administer and well documented

31768
udp	tcp
almost all games have a need for the fast-reacting properties and to a lesser extent the connectionless properties of udp and the reliability of tcp

31783
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp	udp	tcp
take a look at sctp which has a combination of tcp and udp features

31799
ienumerable	icollection
i ran into problems with a couple of classes i have that implement ienumerable and icollection t

31835
bazaar	git
the distributed nature of git and the option of private temporary checkins assuming i ve understood what i ve read is attractive - hence my looking at bazaar

32027
ant	cruisecontrol	nant	cruisecontrol
i m new to nant but have some experience with ant and cruisecontrol

32035
folder	directory
another alternative approach you may want to consider could be to have a folder that contains symlinks to each of your projects or frequently-used directory

32049
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager allows a script to run on startup inside of an updatepanel

32145
getter	setter
i see a lot of debate about getter setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get set methods defined blah blah blah

32145
inherited	subclassing
since you can t have true multiple inherited in php you can make your subclassing have a propertyhandler instance as a private variable

32145
getter	setter
another good argument against handling getter and setter this way is that it makes it really hard to document

32146
post	get
i did get a bit of a shiver at the similarity of the post though..

32198
udp	tcp
i am looking for any strategies people use when implementing server applications that service client tcp or udp requests design patterns implementation techniques best practices etc

32203
button	checkbox
off the top of my head i think you have to check the type attribute of the checkbox to determine if it s a radio button

32219
getter	setter
i like having methods instead of just using public fields as well but my problem with php s default implementation using __get and __set or your custom implementation is that you aren t establishing getter and setter on a per-property basis

32219
getter	setter
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which property you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic

32222
postgresql	mysql
or use something like mysql postgresql etc on linux

32310
public	protected
i have a rule that i only use assertions in public and protected methods

32356
getter	setter
my problem with this is that adding more logic later requires that you add blanket logic that applies to all properties accessed with the getter setter or that you use if or switch statements to evaluate which property you re accessing so that you can apply specific logic

32376
disk	ram
ideally this library supports the b-tree index to be stored manipulated as a disk file so that large trees can be built using a configurable ie minimal ram footprint

32448
versioning	upgrade
the product-group i work for is currently using gcc 3.4.6 we know it is ancient for a large low-level c-code base and want to upgrade to a later versioning

32448
versioning	upgrade
we are however very scared of c-compiler bugs for a good reason historically and wonder if anyone has insight to which versioning we should upgrade to

32477
affinity	processors
at that point you could experiment with using native api s to give the underlying native thread processors affinity

32484
put	get
another possibility is to put the if statement within your logging function you get less code this way but at the expense of some extra function calls

32507
getter	setter
however it s compact and uses the reflection classes to only add getter setter for properties you have already set won t add new ones

32507
getter	setter
simply adding the getter setter explicitly will add more complex functionality

32511
dxcore	coderush
there s also a dxcore plugin the foundation upon which coderush refactor pro are built that does current-line highlighting

32521
prng	random
personally i do think there are places where constant random data is useful in testing - after you think you ve done all your carefully-thought-out corners using stimuli from a prng can sometimes find other things

32717
inherited	properties
i just finished setting up an out-of-place build system for our existing c++ code using inherited properties sheets a feature that seems to be specific to the visual c++ product

32717
inherited	properties
building out-of-place requires that many of the project settings be changed and the inherited properties sheets allowed me to change all the necessary settings just by attaching a properties sheet to the project

32744
gmail	hotmail
first server gmail to second server hotmail

32744
gmail	hotmail
however i don t understand how gmail server transfers the message to the hotmail server

32765
gmail	hotmail
step 2 to 3 gmail to hotmail would normally happen through smtp or esmtp - extended smtp

32775
gmail	hotmail
knowing ip address of hotmail server gmail server will sent the message using smtp protocol and will wait for an answer

32775
gmail	hotmail
if hotmail server goes down gmail server wiil try to resend the message it will depend on server software configuration

32779
rundll32	shell32.dll
rundll32 shell32.dll control_rundll systemroot system32 timedate.cpl z 1

32783
folder	directory
this recurses directory only copies files that have been modified and suppresses the message to replace an existing file the list of files folder in backupexclude.txt will not be copied

32797
wan	lan
you should be able to block wan connections to the server on the router and still leave it open to accepting lan connection

32813
gmail	hotmail
also it would be possible to send the message without using gmail server by sending it directly from your pc to hotmail using smtp

32866
button	checkbox
manageofflinestatus.aspx contains an offline online checkbox textarea for offline message and an update button

32867
gmail	hotmail
you might also be interested to know why the gmail to hotmail link uses smtp just like your thunderbird client

32867
gmail	hotmail
the historical aspect is that in the old days the link between gmail and hotmail was likely to be intermittent

32878
firefox	safari
tested on safari firefox 3 ie 7

32925
int	double
so you know instantly when looking at dpvarname that it s a pointer to a double and that lvarname is a long int

32986
for-loop	loops
i know that if you have a loops that modifies the count of the items in loops using the nsenumerator on a set is the best way to make sure your code blows up however i would like to understand the performance tradeoffs between the nsenumerator class and just an old school for-loop

32996
pagemethods	registerstartupscript
traditionally you were supposed to register scripts via pagemethods such as registerstartupscript and page.registerclientscriptblock

33010
comparator	comparable
if your class is also comparable the equals and comparator methods should be consistent too

33019
width	height
i halfway looked at swffit but the height and width sometimes but mainly height would be dynamic - swffit let s you declare a maxheight but that number would be constantly changing...maybe i could figure out how to set it dynamically

33031
public	protected
the design guidelines that you linked specifically state that they only apply to static public and protected fields

33035
for-loop	loops
the one step that you save over the classic for-loop is not having to call objectatindex i each time inside loops

33071
vmware	virtualbox
perhaps this can be easily accomplished with some virtualization software like vmware or virtualbox

33104
jquery	jqmodal
at the moment website a opens a modal window containing website b using a jquery plug-in called jqmodal

33133
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint	mint	live-cd
creating your own custom ubuntu 7.10 or linux mint 4.0 live-cd with remastersys

33159
pop-up	dialog
when you do this the ide pop-up a warning dialog that there is an unsafe entry point in your project - but you can ignore this and you can make it not appear at all by editing a registry entry evidently

33159
put	get
now to get the output path to refer to it - unfortunately when you add a string like myspecialpath debug to the output path field and save the project the and chars are converted to hex and your file get s put in a debug directory under a directory named myspecialpath

33159
inherited	properties
sadly this is more work and a less elegant solution than the properties sheet inherited mechanism in c++

33236
xctest	ocunit
xcode includes xctest which is similar to ocunit an objective-c unit testing framework and has full support for running xctest-based unit tests as part of your project s build process

33236
xctest	ocunit
despite using ocunit rather than xctest the concepts are largely the same

33313
allocator	stl
stl classes by default allocate their internal buffers from the heap although these classes also allow custom allocator that allow a user to specify an alternate location to allocate from - a shared memory pool

33466
allocator	stl
the default allocator for stl containers uses operator new and delete so it s whatever those route to for the type being contained

33486
stdout	stderr
when you log in interactively stdin stdout and stderr are set up for you and so your script works

33502
firefox	safari
and it only fully works in safari 3 and partly in firefox 3 although there is an experimental port to internet explorer as well

33585
sharepoint	splist
not sure on exactly which web service to use but if you are in a position where you can use the sharepoint .net api dlls then using the splist and splibrary.items.add is really easy

33592
folder	directory
it has a task for building the app calling msbuild to do the heavy lifting in compiling and then uses ruby to zip the build output and copy to a specified location create a folder in virtual directory and copy the build output to see the build results in action

33602
opera	firefox
it works in saffari and firefox 3 opera 9 and people are developing support for ie

33626
children	parent
the stream functionality is great because it makes merging no brainier as all changes from parent streams are automatically propagated to all children

33679
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
should never go outside the testing phase then leave the system throw it or if there are side-effects reaching that point check for null at the beginning and throw either illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception

33847
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
use a source control system â subversion perforce git mercurial bazaar etc

33854
hide	show
one potential way to solve it is to hide and show the div whenever you change the content that in turn changes the height

33881
opera	firefox
mainly in opera and firefox also in ie7 but not quite as bad

33891
vpn	lan
cifs is really geared towards lan with a reasonably calm trafic so you have zero chance to not suffer intermittent lag accessing a share through a vpn

33919
opera	firefox
viewed in ie 8.0 opera 9 firefox 3

33940
post	get
when the cookie resets during an asynch post back from ajax you will get this error

33957
superclass	subclassing
after having used them extensively on a couple of projects i feel they tend to lead to code that is satisfyingly dry to write but very hard to read and maintain later because functionality is spread across so many different places and subclassing are so dependent on every implementation detail of the superclass and mixins

33967
wan	lan
it has to be called on the machine you are interested in - the mac is not transferred across network boundaries lan and wan

34018
chgrp	chmod
sure chgrp apache the_writable_file and chmod g+w the_writable_file

34046
onchange	onsubmit
another solution would be to somehow get rails to inject the onsubmit code into the onchange field of the select tag but i m not sure if there s a way to do that

34054
restrict	shared
unfortunately in shared hosts that use mod_php there is no way to restrict access to secure files to your web app and login user

34104
yacc	bison
flex and bison are the new lex and yacc though

34115
firefox	safari
but you get lucky in firefox ie and safari with their corresponding blocking of 3rd party cookies because they violate rfc2965 in multiple situations

34195
opera	safari
by the way it s a little buggy in some versions of safari and opera - check out this quirksmode page for more

34227
sorting	filtering
on the search results page there are a ton of ui controls for filtering sorting the search results to find what you are looking for

34227
sorting	filtering
this latency is fine in case where the user is initially filtering sorting their results.

34295
emacs	aquamacs
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

34310
versioning	upgrade
when i had problems with lc.exe in the past most times it was because the licensed component was upgrade the versioning number increased but the licx file still contained the old versioning

34338
phpunit	simpletest
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

34377
pop-up	dialog
it will pop-up a dialog with a couple of filtering options and then show you what s out of date

34429
next	except
obviously the next prissioner must skip the already known boxes except for the last choice if the box which contains his number is already known

34443
padding	overlapping
you could also use a background image on the li elements with a padding to keep the text from overlapping it

34465
spweb	spsite
the using statements are to ensure that you do not create a memory leak as the spsite and spweb are unmanaged objects

34474
phpunit	simpletest
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

34474
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is nice but the only thing it really has over phpunit in my opinion is the web runner

34474
phpunit	simpletest
the reasons i like phpunit are that it integrates with other php developer tools such as phing as does simpletest phpundercontrol and xinc

34566
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

34566
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

34566
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

34583
actionscript	mxml
better choices to try would be -incremental which only recompiles the parts that have changed and -keep-generated-actionscript which stops the compiler from deleting the actionscript files it has generated from your application s mxml files

34589
bazaar	cvs
i ve used visual sourcesafe hopefully never again cvs subversion and bazaar

34589
bazaar	git
bazaar is the one i ve used that does this but the other major distributed vcs systems git and mercurial also do

34600
switching	screens
since we are not in the same place most of the time the only option is to use some kind of screens sharing and skype to have one of us drive while the other consults and then switching

34758
toolchain	binutils
you can use the nm -g tool from the binutils toolchain

34828
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode should always be in sync with equals and equals isn t necessarily guaranteed to check for all of the fields in your object there s certain situations where you want that to not be the case

34876
jboss	glassfish
jboss or glassfish are good alternatives

35016
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
the reason i asked is that perforce provides a completely different way to create branches from svn or cvs

35018
getter	setter
if you re simply looking to expose a collection on your instance then using a getter setter to a private member variable seems like the most sensible solution to me your first proposed option

35063
postgresql	mysql
it is really much easier to install ubuntu on an old junk computer with postgresql or mysql

35092
pop-up	dialog
what i m not sure of is how to get rid of the dialog box that pop-up that asks for your confirmation

35103
hash	md5
i d like to do this by storing an md5 hash of the file inside the executable

35109
hash	md5
just make a const string that holds the md5 hash and compile it into your app .

35154
getter	setter
i never expose a private collection property because other parts of the program can change it without parent noticing so that in the getter method i return an array with the objects of the collection and in the setter method i call a clearall over the collection and then an addall

35177
jquery	scriptaculous
but i found that while mochikit has very expressive syntax it didn t feel nearly as comfortable to me as prototype scriptaculous or jquery did for me

35218
pop-up	dialog
for example checking in code shouldn t pop-up a modal dialog

35229
updatepanel	onclientclick
i would leave the onclientclick and set it as the trigger for the updatepanel

35248
firefox	safari
firefox does not have this problem haven t tested safari yet

35317
pop-up	dialog
the dialog box that pop-up doesn t automatically gain focus so pressing enter serves no purpose

35327
debian	linux
i describes the foundation for almost any linux distribution and is officially endorsed by debian and the linux standards base lsb

35333
typedef	struct
same goes for using the typedef of the struct

35417
typedef	struct
because you ve already made a typedef for the struct because you used the s1 version you should write

35490
udp	tcp
in one of the answers to broadcast like udp with the reliability of tcp a user mentions the spread messaging api

35561
radeditor	radgrid
in previous releases they were definitely a bit sluggish i m thinking specifically of their radgrid and radeditor

35575
versioning	upgrade
you should also upgrade to the rtm versioning of fxcop 1.36 the beta will not automatically detect the newer versioning

35584
put	get
get the book linq in action it is an easy read for a coding book and really teaches you how to use linq and the new features of .net 3.5 some of the cool parts they put in for the language

35601
filesystems	ntfs
i don t know enough about the guts of the filesystems to answer the first except when i read the first descriptions of ntfs it sounded an awful lot like the berkley fast filesystems

35605
filesystems	ntfs
windows primarily has had support for fat16 32 and their own filesystems ntfs

35608
filesystems	ntfs
well the nix filesystems do a far better job of actual file managment than fat16 32 or ntfs

35627
filesystems	ntfs
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

35627
disk	ram
for example if you move your program files to a second disk you probably have to refer to them as d program files while in unix usr bin could be a hard drive a network drive a cd rom or ram

35636
getter	setter
the only thing that changes this is if a property has a getter and or setter attribute specified

35667
nltk	opennlp
there is a python port of parts of opennlp called nltk but i don t have much experience with it yet

35674
ready	each
if you have a lots of parallel development you ll want to have branches for each of the efforts but that ll also require more discipline making sure your branches are tested and ready to merge back

35704
folder	directory
if your concern is in how to write apps that can be moved from machine to machine without losing settings you should probably write all your configuration to a file in the same directory as the executable and not touch the windows registry or create any dot directory in the home folder of the user that s running the program on linux or mac

35734
post	get
post your questions if you get stuck along the way and we ll be happy to help

35758
haskell	ocaml
you can sort of imagine this getting nasty in c# or c++ but in haskell ml and ocaml this is central to the language design and syntax so coding style supports it in a much more convenient manner via pattern matching

35762
kde	gnome
are frameworks such as kde gnome usable for this objective or is better to use something more generic other than x

35762
kde	gnome
i feel like if i chose one of gnome or kde i m closing the market out for a chunk of the linux market who have chosen one over the other

35768
kde	gnome
gnome apps work on kde desktops and vice versa

35770
kde	gnome
it s also important to make the distinction between gnome libraries and gtk and likewise kde libraries and qt

35777
int	boolean
and it is easy to end up with messy code that has methods returning either int or boolean or object or some sort under unknown circumstances

35848
width	height
in my vb6.0 application some of the mdi child formâ s height is 17000 and width is 13000

35848
width	height
now i want to set the same form size in vb.net forms but it allows maximum form width 1036 height 780 for resolution 1024x768

35852
vb.net	vb6
i think the vb6 units are not the same with the vb.net one

35867
jar	war
for persistence.xml specifically you can put a persistence unit in a separate jar which you can deploy separately from your web application war or both together in an ear archive depending on what your application server supports

35911
pull	push
thanks to the fact it doesn t need to communicate with a central server constantly pretty much every command runs in less than a second obviously git push pull fetch are slower simply because they have to initalise ssh connections

35922
gtk	ncurses
i ve played around with gtk tk wxpython cocoa ncurses and others

35922
gtk	ncurses
gtk tk wx ncurses all seem to basically be direct-ports of the appropriate c libraries and cocoa basically mandates using both pyobjc and interface builder both of which i dislike

35925
kde	kubuntu
or if you re using kubuntu kde

35935
wxpython	pygtk
there are were several other attempts to create a very pythonic gui as a layer on top of pygtk or wxpython such as wax and pygui which seem to be stuck at various degrees of being complete

35946
min	max
that gave me a min and max lat and a min and max long

35960
post	get
a modicum of security by obscurity - it s slightly more work to tamper with post submissions than get

35960
post	get
caching and resubmit rules are more restrictive for post than get

35960
post	get
different browsers have different max lengths for get requests - but none of them are as large as post

35967
freebsd	linux
if you have spare physical resources and have the technical skills and experience to maintain production machines running different operating systems i d recommend going running lighttpd on either linux or freebsd

36010
actionscript	mxml
one way to separate the mxml and actionscript for a component into separate files is by doing something similar to the asp.net 1.x code behind model

36010
imperative	declarative	actionscript	mxml
in this model the declarative part the mxml in this case is a subclass of the imperative part the actionscript

36108
width	height
a resizable gui would be quite horrible if you had to play with height width minheight minwidth etc

36197
post	get	srp	principles
i ve looked around online codecampserver etc... and they all seem to suffer the same issue wherein controller methods violate srp single responsibility principles pretty consistently - such as a controller method that simply renders the view if the request is a get but updates the model if it s a post

36219
lxml	libxml2
it seems that lxml does not expose this libxml2 feature grepping the source only turns up some #defines for the error handling

36219
lxml	libxml2
from the catalog implementation in libxml2 page it seems possible that the transparent handling through installation in etc xml catalog may still work in lxml but if you need more than that you can always abandon lxml and use the default python bindings which do expose the catalog functions

36234
gridview	repeater
if your textbox was in a repeater or gridview then this method would work

36344
g++	gcc
this is on a mac 10.4.11 my googling turned up some hints that this can happen if gcc is called instead of g++ but i believe that is set up correctly

36398
hbase	hypertable
since hbase and hypertable are all about performance being modeled on google s bigtable they sound like they would certainly be much faster than hive at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve they don t have joins or the sql-like syntax

36419
post	get
url params shows get and post variables

36425
codeigniter	cakephp
examples include cakephp zend framework and codeigniter

36441
rss	feed
alternatively you can use the pipe s rss feed by appending your html-encoded tags separated by + s

36455
free	malloc
older k r 2nd ed. and other c-language texts i have read that discuss the implementation of a dynamic memory allocator in the style of malloc and free usually also mention in passing something about data type alignment restrictions

36466
int	chars
this is because the compiler enforces a 4 byte alignment for int but only 1 byte for chars

36501
mouse	keyboard
to allow the capture of window events keyboard mouse window creating drawing etc

36512
public	protected
i prefix every public or protected method or property with the following comment structure

36548
qmail	exim
exim qmail and postfix are all popular alternatives that are a bit more modern

36593
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
sqlbuddy is another web interface just like phpmyadmin

36682
inherited	properties
properties inherited

36718
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
the javaworld article why getter and setter methods are evil article also might be of interest to you in thinking about when not to implement accessor and mutators methods

36734
getter	setter
it s like defensive programming - someday getter and setter may be helpful and it doesn t cost a lot to create use them

36734
getter	setter
in practice most fields have simple getter and setter

36761
wxpython	pyqt
i think wxpython is nice but it s too limited and pyqt is well qt

36856
emacs	gedit
i haven t settled on an ide but if i m not using gedit i ll use emacs as my editor

36891
getter	setter
then there s little point in wrapping them up in getter and setter

36891
getter	setter
getter and setter will only slow you down

36891
getter	setter
this should really use getter and setter

36928
cvs	svn
svn tracks resources on a per-file basis just as cvs does so it can do sticky to the same effect

36944
getter	setter
it may seem sensible to omit getter setter

36945
lisp	scheme
however scheme common lisp and many other languages have what s called lexical scoping - in addition to storing the operation + x y we also store the namespace at that particular point

36997
comparator	comparable
sort both lists by id ascending using custom comparator if objects in lists aren t comparable

37024
public	protected
also some tools some o r mappers expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables

37025
inherited	properties
they have no particular advantage over protected methods properties once upon a time they might have a slight performance advantage and they were also used more in an era when very deep inherited was in fashion which it isn t at the moment

37103
width	height
i have a container div with a fixed width and height with overflow hidden

37114
gif	png
modern browsers also support png and gif images

37162
portrait	landscape
web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape

37203
apache	nginx
the standard way to do this with rails is to run a pack of mongrel instances ie 4 copies of the rails application and then use apache or nginx or some other piece of software to sit in front of them and act as a load balancer

37204
ncover	fxcop
lots of documentation and very easy to set up nunit ncover fxcop etc

37204
rss	feed
taskbar app that will let you know the status of your projects at any time and it can also fire off an email or keep an rss feed with the same information

37267
git-rebase	amend
by replacing the command pick with the command edit you can tell git-rebase to stop after applying that commit so that you can edit the files and or the commit message amend the commit and continue git-rebase

37278
serializable	deserialization
xml serializable deserialization largely without coding

37364
width	height
you don t need to call getimagesize to get the width height for imagecopyresmapled

37374
inherited	properties
previously we had being using a base dal class that implemented a cache manager properties that all our dal classes inherited from but now we don t have that

getter	setter
i don t believe that they are ever necessary however because any use of a protected member variable can be replicated using a private member variable and a couple of getter and setter

37391
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
what i m trying to do though is create a class that could represent an arbitrarily large binary number and be able to perform simple arithmetic operations on two of them add subtract multiplying divide

i d recommend basing your system on debian - the apt system has become the de-facto way to quickly install and update programs on linux

37400
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is debian based with an emphasis on usability and compatibility

37408
daemons	launchd
the use of a unix-domain socket means that the erlang daemons could be launchd on-demand by launchd and the cocoa front-end could find the path to the socket to use via an environment variable

37408
daemons	launchd
ultimately this means that the entire process of the front-end opening the socket to communicate with the daemons launchd launchd the daemons and the daemons responding to the communication can be secure even if the front-end and the daemons run at different privilege levels

37409

wtl	atl
the dialog itself is an atl wtl cpropertysheetimpl

37973

38000
bazaar	git
gitty will essentially be bazzarx with the bazaar backend ripped out and a git backend put in instead and any ui tweaks made for git differences from bazaar ie hashes instead of version# s etc

38097
arrayiterator	arrayobject
eventually i found the spl extensions to php and particularly arrayobject and arrayiterator

38139

vmware	esx
vmware virtual machines are portable across different vmware products although you may need to use their converter tool to go from some hosted virtual machines to esx or esxi

38384
put	get
i guess they put compatability first and are now trying to get the performance up to par with other ruby implementations out there

38421
post	put
i m concerned about making sure i have put in place appropriate measures so that only my ajax calls can post data

38470
getter	setter
the only catch iirc was making sure dispids id attribute were correct on automation interfaces dispinterfaces for property getter setter - there was some invariant that tlibimp expected but midl didn t guarantee

38519
post	get
http post get etc

38543
qtkit	quicktime
there are layers on top of it like audio toolbox audio queue services quicktime and qtkit that you can use if you want a simplified api for common tasks

38769
vb.net	vb6
the application can be written in perl vb6 vb.net or c# but must be easily scheduled from a windows based server

38809
free	malloc
graeme s suggestion of custom malloc free is a good idea

38809
free	malloc
for example if it is always in a block of the same size say 64 bytes then change your malloc free pair to always allocate 64 byte chunks in their own page

38839
lisp	scheme
common lisp code can be converted into scheme code with relative ease

38839

but the new internet explorer 8 beta 2 and the just announced google-chrome browser are heading in that direction so i suppose firefox will be heading there too

39092
direct3d	directx
edit - yes i really meant direct3d not directx thanks to graham.reeds for clarification

monodevelop - link text this is based on sharpdevelop 0.9 if i remember it correctly

39267
free	malloc
the container itself is allocated where you decide it can be the stack the heap an object s member etc but the memory it uses is by default as others described taken on the free store managed through new and delete which is not the same as the heap managed through malloc free

39309
filesystems	hfs
the setfile tool sets a custom hfs filesystems property on the directory to tell finder that it is an app but giving it a .app extension serves the same purpose

39449
post	get
if you get the output stream then i believe it sends it as a post as it assumes you ll be writing data to it you may need to call setdooutput true for the output stream to work

39469
ienumerable	ilist
depending on how you need to filter the collection you may want to create a class that implements ilist or ienumerable if that works for you but that mucks about with the indexing and access to only return the values you want

39496
ienumerable	ienumerator
in earlier versions you had to create your own ienumerable and ienumerator objects to do stuff like this

39503
drive	createfile
also you can write to the bootsector at least as administrator on xp by call createfile with the device name of the drive that contains the mbr

39503
drive	createfile
also you can write to this drive by simply calling writefile and passing the handle of the device created by calling createfile

39533
vmware	virtualbox
i guess there are more or less easy ways to identify specific vm systems especially if the vm has the provider s extensions installed such as for virtualbox or vmware

39564
wordpress	phpbb
in my host i currently have installed 2 wordpress applications 1 phpbb forum and one mediawiki

39786
cvs	svn
have a look in the svn manual here scroll down to svn keywords or here for cvs

39858
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
note this has become a popular answer but it is important to point out that if y has any non-string keys the fact that this works at all is an abuse of a cpython implementation detail and it does not work in python 3 or in pypy ironpython or jython

39867
stdout	stderr
if i run this as cron job works fine i see encrypting file in the log but the file doesn t get encrypted and gpg silent fails with no stdout stderr output

39868
superclass	subclassing
it may be best to subclassing jdialog so that you can just add the doannimation logic to the setvisible .. or show method before calling the superclass implementation

39917
stdout	stderr
redirect the stderr to stdout for gpg and then redirect stdout to a file to inspect any error messages which might get printed you can do this a command line

39945
put	get
to get right unless you put in extra restrictions like using only immutable data

39948
apache-poi	excellibrary
i ended up doing this a lot when working with the apache-poi excellibrary

39963
salt	md5
that s the login a colon apr1 the salt and 1000 times md5 encoded as base64

40025
postgresql	mysql
for example if you are writing an open source web application chances are that you need to support mysql and postgresql at least if not mssql and oracle

40034
dbml	edmx
i haven t tried it myself but huagati dbml edmx tools is recommended by other people

40034
dbml	edmx
huagati dbml edmx tools is an add-in

40063
gendarme	fxcop
gendarme is an open source rules based static analyzer similar to fxcop but finds a lot of different problems

40117
httphandler	httpcontext
httpcontext exposes the current instance for the request under the httpcontext.current property however the current context can also be passed in httphandler in the processrequest method

40119
jhat	jprofiler
ok i ve read the answers so far but let s just say i am a cheap bastard meaning i am more interested in learning how to use jhat than to pay for jprofiler

40141
jobs	cron
there is a --batch parameter missing gpg tries to read from dev tty that doesn t exist for cron jobs

40143
client-side	server-side
personally i use a set of methods i have developed for bridging the server-side asp.net magic i have yet to use the ms mvc stuff yet and my client-side code because of the munging of the ids that happens

40146
jrockit	yourkit
there are tools that should help you find your leak like jprobe yourkit ad4j or jrockit mission control

40277
pop-up	dialog
the designer even included detailed explanation of some subtle behavior in pop-up dialog that would appear when hovering over mock links

40289
getter	setter
then make getter and setter functions for each property so that the default values could be changed

40344
sorting	filtering
however this is slow for very large tables and sorting and filtering is cumbersome

40344
sorting	filtering
opening a large table is much faster this way and access has easy-to-use right-click filtering and sorting

40346
rss	feed
so we have coding books coding rss feed and music to code by

40548
dictionary	map
also note that hashtable extends the dictionary class which as the javadocs state is obsolete and has been replaced by the map interface

40630
int	chars	int	double
in general java has primitive types int bool chars double etc that are passed directly by value

40669
children	parent
one gotcha i have found is where two objects contain references to each other one example being a parent child relationship with a convenience method on the parent to get all children

40678
domparser	saxparser
instead of using a domparser use a saxparser

40728
post	get
that should be enough to get you started i will try and post more later

40934
lisp	scheme
i recall there being a scheme or lisp too

40985
ldf	dbcc
you can create an empty log file if the ldf is missing or corrupt or run dbcc checkdb and if there are still errors run it again with repair_allow_data_loss which obviously may lose data - but if you had a good backup you probably wouldn t be asking this

41003
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps a bit anecdotal but comparing runs between firefox and google-chrome showed a significant difference in benchmarks

41029
google-chrome	firefox
212ms in google-chrome 341ms in firefox 3 and 2188ms for internet explorer 7

41069
folder	directory
here the first argument is the window that owns the dialog box the second is the title of the window and the third is the default path to start at you need the at the end otherwise it ll start a directory higher with the user s home folder selected

41176
opera	firefox
can t say that for firefox or opera

41228
3des	aes
later edit note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category for example 3des and aes - both being symmetric block cyphers are of comparable strength

powerpc	i386
sqlite jdbc driver for mysaifu jvm sqlite jdbc driver for mysaifu jvm and sqlite jni library for windows x86 and linux i386 powerpc

41283
folder	directory
if you absolutely can t rename the folder because other software depends on it another technique is to go ahead and rename the directory to end in .noindex but then create a symlink in the same location pointing to the real location using the original name

41357
ilist	icollection
actually it uses icollection instead of ilist but the result is the same

41446
versioning	upgrade
i already created a first versioning of the client in javascript but i m parsing the soap envelope by hand and i doubt that my code can survive a service upgrade for example seeing how complex the soap envelope specification is

41447
submit	submission
you can submit your site to search engines using their site submission forms - this will get you into their system

41479
int	double
there is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted ienumerable int and ienumerable double the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type

41502
pull	push
considering just parsers and ignoring the question of whether they perform validation there are two main flavors tree-basedâ think domâ and streaming event-basedâ think sax push and stax pull

41521
button	checkbox
one is the usual click button and the other is a toggle button that acts similar to a checkbox

41541
bmp	png
however i m not entirely sure that the bmp file format supports transparency - so you would have to save the file as perhaps a png file instead

41545
vim	emacs
there are quite a few vi clones vim and also various emacs implementations gnu emacs vs

41589
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
in .net threadpool threads won t return without setting up manualresetevent s or autoresetevent s

41634
int	double
that isn t quite true - if a method is overloaded to both ienumerable int and ienumerable double then it may silently pass the unexpected inferred type due to some other change in the program to the wrong overload hence causing incorrect behaviour

41660
min	max
there are often already many binary functions like + min max concatenation and in my case make_and and make_or

41668

nvl replaces isnull

41847
getdate	sysdate
sysdate replaces getdate

41931
put	get
i ve used simple sine wave generators mixed together with some phase and amplitude noise thrown in to get signals that sound and look interesting to humans when put through speakers or lights but i don t know what you mean by interesting

41932
google-chrome	firefox
i have compared mozilla firefox 3.0.1 and google-chrome 0.2.149.27 on sunspider javascript benchmark with the following results

41969
kde	gnome
is there a standard way to do this or do i have to special case gnome kde etc and manually run the appropriate application nautilus konqueror etc

41986
put	get
don t be put off by the in java part if you don t know java as the concepts and their implementation are well enough explained that you get the gist without needing a detailed understanding of java

41999
kde	gnome
there might be an function that launches the defaults for kde or gnome in their respective toolkits but i haven t had reason to look for them

42039
kde	gnome
i know gnome does and it s important to do this in kde since there are two possible file managers konqueror dolphin that may be in use

42047
metaphone	soundex
i would suggest using metaphone not soundex

42068
google-chrome	firefox
with json.parse data i see similar error messages unexpected token â µ in google-chrome and unterminated string literal in firefox and ie

42089
spaces	delimiter
bush is because the bourne shell is spaces delimiter

42105
disk	ram
setup a multi-gigabyte ram disk and then

42105
disk	ram
i d guess the ram disk part is where all the problem would be since the size of the ram disk would be os and file system dependent

42105
disk	ram
you might have to create multiple ram disk and have your code jump between them

42105
disk	ram
or maybe you could setup a raid-0 stripe set over multiple ram disk

42246
put	get
the question is how to get just the updated files out of subversion so that they can be physically transported through the firewall and put on the deployment server

42314
margin	height
you will then need to add a padding or margin to the bottom of your #sidebar and #content to match the height of #footer or when they overlap the #footer will cover them

42315
put	get
you could use position absolute following to put the footer at the bottom of the page but then make sure your 2 columns have the appropriate margin-bottom so that they never get occluded by the footer

42333
post	put
i found this blog post that shows how to do it with a regular video object but i d much prefer to use videodisplay or something else that can be put directly in the mxml

42377
sfx	setup.exe
i suggest using something like sfx compiler to package the two together into one self-extracting .exe and then launch the extracted setup.exe

42470
outputstream	inputstream
i d just use commons io then you could just do an ioutils.copy inputstream outputstream

42513
g++	gcc
if you have access to gcc g++ then the -m option will output the dependency list

42536
public	protected
i d also add a protected constructor to myclass to prevent the compiler from generating a public default constructor

42583
stdout	stderr
if your exe happens to be a console app you might be interested in reading the stdout and stderr -- for that i ll humbly refer you to this example

42698
fadein	fadeout
while john sheehan s approach works you run into the jquery fadein fadeout cleartype glitch in ie7

42702
ironruby	ironpython
without getting into the relative merits of the languages which would be an entire pissing contest in itself ironpython stable 1.1.1 beta 2.0 is further along in development than ironruby alpha

42747
teamcity	nant	teamcity	ncover	ncover	nant
i would recommend you take a look at nant + nunit + ncover + teamcity with svn for your build system

42790
jobs	cron
skinp cron jobs are executed by sh whereas most modern unixes use bash or ksh for interactive logins

42793
pop-up	dialog
non-blocking notifications floating dialog like in firefox3 or vista s pop-up messages in tray area

42801
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie8 seems to me to be more of the same from microsoft who just can t seem to grasp the ui goodness and overall speed of safari firefox and now google-chrome

42835
jobs	cron
scheduled tasks or cron jobs

42843
subtract	add
to do this i try to find layers of usefulness and add subtract from the layers until it seems clean

42848
jobs	cron
the problem with scheduled tasks or cron jobs is that they don t share memory space with the web server

42854
onresize	onload
you can then set this function as a handler for onload and onresize events

42902
postgresql	mysql
you can use sqlite mysql postgresql or any other dbms with a c language binding

42908
google-chrome	firefox
while browsing with google-chrome i noticed that it responds extremely fast in comparison with ie and firefox on my laptop in terms of rendering pages including javascript heavy sites like gmail

42918
openbsd	freebsd
editor s note the above works with gnu readlink and freebsd pc-bsd openbsd readlink but not on os x as of 10.11

42957
pull	push
for example if you design a door well you should never have to add labels that say push and pull. if you want them to pull put a handle

42960
disk	ram
this may seem dirty but in the real world i find it gives a lot of flexibility you aren t doing a lot of processing in asp.net process space and you could easily adapt this style to farm processing out to cheap linux servers running the agent process on mono for when you start needing more ram cpu disk

43043
scheme	prolog
hell i d rather code in scheme or prolog than php

43122
temp	tmp
you might want to look into using tmp in nix or c users username local settings temp in vista or c documents and settings username local settings temp in 2k xp

43135
disk	ram
if you have enough ram sql will do an outstanding job determining what to load into ram and what to seek on disk

43157
outputstream	inputstream
i was surprised to find today that i couldn t track down any simple way to write the contents of an inputstream to an outputstream in java

43213
matlab	s-function
i think i am going to have to take the xpcserial c code that comes with matlab take the code that sets the rs-232 speed and wrap it in my own s-function

43221
opera	firefox
the biggest chink i ve found is its lousy proxy support compared to ie firefox and opera

43267
vim	emacs
i m interested in making console apps like vim or emacs

43267
vim	emacs
well not exactly like vim or emacs but one that takes over the entire command prompt while it is in use and then after you exit it leaves no trace behind

43308
int	chars
in php it is seen as binary data usually chars if you tried to convert it to an int it would take the first 32 bits of data platform dependent and push that into the variable

43321
bash	zsh
give two good reasons to respectively stick to bash and switch to zsh

43324
post	get
i know i can get the session id through session.sessionid and i know how to use yui to post it to the next page

43331
swift	objective-c
that said objective-c and swift really are not too scary.

43360
stdout	stderr
you could chuck file redirection onto either the command shown or the actual command in the crontab for both stdout and stderr - like

43368
django	turbogears	django	web2py	turbogears	web2py
with web application framework i mean products project such as pyhons django turbogears web2py etc

43394
jobs	cron
use mailto in cron and redirect the email to any other single address for all your cron jobs

43472
hide	show
if you append a span containing ellipses to the end of each query a simple logical test in javascript with a bit of css manipulation could be used to hide show them as needed

43497
pascal	delphi
there is turbo delphi pascal based or turbo c++ both free editions

43525
google-chrome	safari
for some strange bizarre reason my images in my website just will not display on webkit based languages such as safari and google-chrome

43542
margin	height
yeah i ve found manually layout out controls incrementing their top property by the height of the control plus a margin as i go to be reasonably effective

43571
onchange	onblur
for a cross-browser solution you will just have to use an onchange or onblur handler to check the length and handle it however you want truncate the value silently notify the user etc.

43590
postgresql	mysql
linux web hosted - mysql postgresql maybe

43647
codeigniter	cakephp
for php i ve used zend framework codeigniter and cakephp only maintenance of an existing cakephp project briefly

43702
put	get
.net and java put more information about the original program in the executables method names variable names etc. so you get more of your original information back

43709
django	web.py
and a huge lot of stuff in between like web.py pyroxide and django

43733
freebsd	linux
once i got it installed currently slightly difficult on os x but it s trivial on linux freebsd i had written a plugin in a few minutes and it worked first time

43733
munin	cacti
munin mrtg and cacti are basically all far-nicer-to-use systems based around this graphing tool

43780
subtract	add
one stupid way of calculating a modulus is to subtract or add the modulus until the resulting value is between 0 and modulus âˆ 1

43782
division	modulo
in modular arithmetic a modulo is simply the remainder of a division and the remainder of -2 divided by 5 is 3

43794
division	modulo
however the most agreed-upon mathematical definition states that the modulo of a and b is the strictly positive rest r of the division of a b

43825
hide	show
you can add a beginrequest listener and endrequest listener to show and hide the element you want to display inline

43838
nofollow	noindex
you could accomplish this by puting a noindex nofollow meta tag in the html every page but the home page

43874
onmousedown	onfocus	onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onfocus
i ve tried using onmousedown onfocus onclick and setting each to blur or return false but with no success

jquery	scriptaculous
easy to use a custom dialog from prototype scriptaculous yui jquery .

44005
websphere	ibm
we are not planning on using a traditional java ee server for example ibm websphere which may have support for propagation not that i can find any definitive documentation

44012
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
the design is neat intuitive well documented and avoids a lot of the clumsiness of the original java.util.date java.util.calendar classes

44072
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
mdn s browser compatibility table says essentially all of the current popular browsers google-chrome ie firefox safari on both desktop and mobile are compatible

44130
getter	setter
there are only 2 places where you could mess up typing mykey in the getter and setter and this would be very easy to spot

44165
post	get
post 4.5 you can now use the callermembernameattribute as part of the method parameters to get a string of the method name - this may help in some scenarios but really in say the example above

44196
union	distinct
in oracle at least there is union and union all union all will return all results from both sets even if there are duplicates where as union will return the distinct results from both sets

44229
for-loop	loops
unless performance is critical i prefer the foreach loops over the for-loop

44278
folder	directory
in addition to the other answers there s a nice powertoy for xp called open command window here. it adds an option to your right-click context menu when you click inside a folder to open a command window using that directory as the starting path

44289
cvs	svn
as someone who is in the middle of switching between cvs and svn initially we switched all of our projects with cvs2svn and then decided that we would transition by only using svn on new projects here are some of the problems we have had

44322
uninstall	upgrade
thanks to the wspbuilder menu deploy upgrade uninstall of a solution is just one click away

44367
equals	compareto
not that performance usually matters with 99 of the times you need to do this but if you had to do this in a loop several million times i would highly suggest that you use equals or because as soon as it finds a character that doesn t match it throws the whole thing out as false but if you use the compareto it will have to figure out which character is less than the other leading to slightly worse performance time

44380
mouse	keyboard
either participant can choose to share their screen and the other participant can request control of the keyboard mouse vnc style

44391
post	get
then when the form post even though i don t receive any cookies from the browser i know they re logged in because i can decrypt the hidden form field and get the username

44421
administration	activation
when i try to run the code from the server i get a dcom source error message that states the machine-default permission settings do not grant local activation permission for the com server application with clsid 000c101c-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 to the user this security permission can be modified using the component services administration tool. i have modified the permissions using the component services tool but still get this same error

44443
postgresql	mysql
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle

44461
min	max
double nextdouble random rng double min double max

44461
min	max
return min + rng.nextdouble max - min

44523
put	get
to get around this you could put a wrapper around the dll and use it to delegate the calls to the ui thread by using the invoke method of the form

44560
subtract	add
well if you know the current page it s pretty trivial to just subtract the number by 1 and add it by 1 then check those numbers against the bounds and display the first and last page always then if they aren t in sequence add the ellipses

44575
chmod	mkdir
it s useful for the chmod and mkdir functions in unix land but aside from that i can t think of any other common uses

44602
cvs	svn
i implemented this change at a previous employer first to cvs and then to svn and while it was successful we had to build a lot of bits around the edge and rely on a lot of sometimes unreliable open source projects to get all the tools we needed

44602
cvs	svn
having evaluated these i could have made a proper value judgement on whether cvs svn were worth their free price tag

44607
vmware	virtualbox
of course using paralles vmware virtualbox or any other virtual machine with a windows guest as you describe will also work fine

44635
vbscript	jscript
you can try wmicodecreator it generates vbscript jscript vb.net and c# code

44638
merb	ruby-on-rails
ok ruby-on-rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to ruby-on-rails

44708
cvs	svn
the hassle in cvs svn comes from the fact that these systems do not

44708
children	parent
note how a and b have two children whereas m has two parent

44708
cvs	svn
cvs does not record this information nor did svn prior to

44752
perforce	svn
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

44781
int	boolean
as ricardo reyes suggested if it contains non-string types such as int floats boolean none then do

44803
vsto	add-in
from within a vba macro or vsto add-in we re trying to access the metaproperty on the document to set get the user name

44916
pascal	delphi
method references in delphi object pascal

44921
cil	ildasm
this is actually quite easy to verify by writing various c# switch statements some sparse some dense and looking at the resulting cil with the ildasm tool

44926
width	height
height constrained by style z on element q or width contributed to by inner elements a b and c

44927
int	chars
if the type of the switch expression is sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or an enum-type then that is the governing type of the switch statement

44927
int	chars
otherwise exactly one user-defined implicit conversion â 6.4 must exist from the type of the switch expression to one of the following possible governing types sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string

45040
3des	aes
so using system.security.cryptography aes or 3des in cbc mode without rolling your own checksum can be dangerous

45072
inherited	subclassing
sealing these subclassing also discourages deep levels of inherited which works well for gui frameworks but works poorly for business logic layers

45101
pull	push
i have found that generally the most performant and stable way to push pull large amounts of data of a device over activesync is to use a socket

45239
google-chrome	firefox
today i started testing on webkit and google-chrome and discovered that not only are the styles inconsistant with both firefox and ie but javascript is not executing at all probably due to a syntax or parse error

45241
google-chrome	safari
just so you ve got one less browser to worry about google-chrome uses the same rendering engine as safari

45241
google-chrome	safari
so if it works in safari it should work exactly the same in google-chrome

45241
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit for rendering which is the same rendering engine as appleâ s safari browser so if your site is compatible with safari it should work great in google-chrome

45364
int	chars
int myfunction in chars name inout chars address out chars phone

45405
pull	push
the fact that you never connect your repository to anyone else s to push and pull changes doesn t mean that tool won t be right

45406
cvs	svn
you don t want to complicate things going from svn or cvs to clearcase for example

45431
mstest	typemock
i m using mstest 9 ncover 2.1 and typemock 4.1

45440
subclipse	visualsvn
can integrate with most of ides visual studio ankhsvn or visualsvn -- more info or eclipse subclipse -- here someone asked about that

45440
cvs	svn
i do merging for about 4 years including about 2 years in cvs -- that was terrible but doable and about 2 years with svn

45499
pull	push
that code sample tries to turn xmlreader style code into sax style code - if you re writing code from scratch i d just use xmlreader as it was intended - pull not push

45512
disk	ram
hard disk - when there s not enough ram data is paged to hd which is really slow not really under cpu control as such

45512
profiling	debugging
always profiling release optimised builds profiling debugging code is pointless

45518
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
therefore if your method wants to explicitly disallow null as opposed to just happening to have a null value raise a nullpointerexception you should throw an illegalargumentexception

45554
width	height
in page_load function you need to define the width and height of the list box properly so that it won t overflow with the div

45557
postgresql	mysql
regarding untrusted languages i heard a podcast from josh berkus a postgresql advocate who discussed an application of postgresql that brought in data from mysql as part of its processing so that the communication itself was handled by the postgresql server

45592
post	get
as things have moved on since the original post on 3by9.com here are the steps that i had to follow to get the environment working on my powerbook g4

45592
powerpc	i386
on the build tab change the architectures to standard iphone simulator i386 powerpc

45606
ninject	spring.net
for the rest i think spring.net castle windsor ninject and structuremap aren t that far apart anymore

45616
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is actually a little different to safari it uses a completely different javascript implementation and problems have been reported with both prototype and jquery

45681
gif	png
if a to implement a website with user profiles logins extensions gallery s etc s a newbi then a cms like joomla etc are good but else if you presently have only static content then its good to go with good old html about jpeg i though presently its better to use png or gif as its less bulky

45803
rss	feed
point podcatcher at new rss feed

45823
rss	feed
once you have the audio files you can reconstruct the rss feed to link to the audio files if so desired

45835
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
of course you could go the other way and only count requests from things you know are web browsers covering ie firefox safari opera and this newfangled google-chrome thing would get you 99 of the way there

45858
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit the same engine as is used by safari omniweb icab and more

45866
google-chrome	safari
as has been mentioned google-chrome has the same rendering engine as safari iphone etc. webkit which passes acid3 so there should be minimal issues if you follow the standards

45866
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome currently uses a slightly older version of webkit than safari

45889
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is a sip pbx and may or may not work for you depending on exactly what you re trying to do

45899
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses a new javascript engine so you ll have to test your javascript using google-chrome as well as safari

45904
width	height
img width 100 height 100 alt fpo lady src uploadedimages temp_photo_small.jpg

45918
isnull	nvl	coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl
if you replace your isnull and nvl nonsense with coalesce it ll work in t-sql and pl sql

45945
qtkit	quicktime
hopefully we ll get all the features of the quicktime c apis in the next version of qtkit whenever that may be

45954
hex	binary
i m working on a utility which needs to resolve hex addresses to a symbolic function name and source code line number within a binary

45954
elf	dwarf
the mips binaries are in elf format using dwarf for the symbolic debugging information

45963
free	malloc
are you using new delete or malloc free or both

45963
free	malloc
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

45997
rpm	yum
i transfer these rpm s into a yum repo and puppet handles making sure the latest or correct versions of software are installed in the cluster

46014
post	get
the load should just be a normal get request and the saving of new data should be a post to the url which currently has the data.

46014
put	get
a put request could be used when creating a new record put the data at a url which doesn t currently exist but in practice just posting is probably a better approach to get started with

46053
mbunit	nunit
i like the sound of combinatorial tests in mbunit i ve tried the abstract base class interface test technique with nunit and although it does work you d need to have a seperate test fixture for every interface a class implements since in c# there is no multiple inheritance - although inner classes can be used which is pretty cool

46061
mouse	keyboard
i also found that you can paste text into the text box using the mouse - it just won t accept keyboard input

46087
move	drag
in tortoisesvn use can move file via drag drop

46128
profiling	debugging
the other great thing about this technique is that if you re looking in sql profiling you can see the query you generated and debugging it much easier than seeing a stored proc call with 20 parameters come in

46204
hash	md5
it would seem that an md5 hash would work fine

46209
int	chars
why don t you do something like 1stchar + 10 x 2ndchar + 100 x 3rdchar .... where you use the simple int value of each chars a 1 b 2 etc or just the int value if it s not a letter

46210
short	base
if they are very short then a unique id can be generated by considering the characters as digits in base 36 26 + 10 that form a n -digits number where n is the length of the string

46216
int	chars
if you have a string of more than 4 ascii chars or more than two unicode chars then there are more possible string values than possible int values

46216
int	chars
you can t have a unique int value for every possible 5 chars string

46241
hash	md5
using a credit card number you could perform a hash on it md5 or sha1 or something similar

46247
int	chars
assuming it s n chars in length and assuming you only need uppercase letters and the numerals 0-9 then you need to have an int representation that can be as high as

46247
int	chars
if you want to handle 72 possible values per chars uppercase lowercase numerals punctuation... and you need 10 chars then you ll need 62 bits - two 32 bit int or one 64 bit if you re on a system that supports 64 bit computing

46247
integer	unsigned
cast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array and compare the string 4 bytes at a time or 64 bits 8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor

46255
getter	setter
extract an interface from the helper class add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class used through its interface and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper

46268
hash	salt
the next thing you need to do is hash that value using a secret salt value and base32 encode the hash

46268
hash	salt
you just take the left side of the code hash it using your secret salt and compare that value to the right side of the code

46290
versioning	upgrade
this can be useful in maintenance or upgrade scenarios where you have an updated versioning of your type that won t work in some old code but you need to upgrade it to the new versioning

46294
phpunit	simpletest
i ve used both phpunit simpletest and i found simpletest to be easier to use

46296
bazaar	git
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames

46465
rsa	dsa
you normally don t want to use public key encryption rsa dsa for the bulk data encryption due to its large computational time

46492
oledb	dataadapter
once your oledb connection is made you can easily create your datareader dataadapter and process as needed

46508
put	get
the only way i know of to get a reasonably accurate estimate that is it to break the project into individual tasks and get the developer who will be doing the actual work to put an estimate on each task

46544
bazaar	git
in a dvcs like bazaar or git the merged revision ends up with two parent revisions

46558
hide	show
what i ve done is obfuscate it when it s rendered and hide it then use javascript to fix the obfuscation and show the link

46582
post	get	submit	submission
we have the requirement to take a form submission and save some data then redirect the user to a page offsite but in redirecting we need to submit a form with post not get

46585
post	get
never use get and use post

46585
post	get
never use post and use get

46595
post	get
the original intent was that get was used for getting data back and post was to be anything

46602
post	get
using get will allow linking to a particular page possible too where post would not work

46614
post	get
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

46614
post	get
one final note post can transmit a larger amount of information than get

46639
post	get
i know the question was about get and post but i ll return to post in a second

46639
post	put
typically a post would be used to create a new resource for example creating a new so question though in some designs a put would be used for this also

46639
post	get
in practical terms modern web browsers typically only support get and post reliably you can perform all of these operations via javascript calls but in terms of entering data in forms and pressing submit you ve generally got the two options

46639
post	put
in a restful application the post will often be overriden to provide the put and delete calls also

46639
post	get
but even if you are not following restful principles it can be useful to think in terms of using get for retrieving viewing information and post for creating editing information

46655
put	get	post	put	post	get
rails utilizes post get put and delete but it apparently has to do some fakery for put

46663
gmail	hotmail
answers with any of using hotmail yahoo or gmail are acceptable

46666
post	get
there is an excellent podcast on software engineering radio that gives an in depth talk about the use of get and post

46700
post	get
you get the added advantage that you don t have to name all of your server controls to make the 3rd parties form you can do this translation when building the post string

46709
int	boolean
when designing a database to use mvcc multi-version concurrency control you create tables with either a boolean field like islatest or an int versionid and you never do any updates you only insert new records when things change

46727
junit	testng
i have info on my migration from junit to testng here and here

46731
versioning	upgrade
to me it s important that the consuming projects explicitly know which versioning of the common library they are consuming and for them to take a deliberate step to upgrade that versioning

46821
profiler	yourkit
i ve used yourkit java profiler 7.5 and was reasonably happy with it

46855
udp	tcp
i plan to use tcp packets for strategic data and udp packets for tactical data

46855
raknet	lidgren
i have found a few options such as garagegames torque network library c++ raknet c++ and the lidgren network library c#

46978
try-catch	exception-handling
for portability one thing to try is using try-catch blocks for most vanilla exception-handling and then set a terminate handler set_terminate_handler to have a minimal hook available for catastrophic exit conditions

47000
hash	md5
as long as it s a hash function be it string.hashcode md5 or sha1 collision is unavoidable unless you have a fixed limit on the string s length

47113
postgresql	mysql
today most languages platforms java .net php perl etc. can work with almost any dbms sql server firebird mysql oracle postgresql etc. so i wouldn t worry for one second

47116
put	get
do a reverse google lookup meaning put their answer into google as soon as they click submit and see if you get exact matches

47125
punctuation	words
if you get to design the entire course try to have some online homeworks as well so that you can build a profile for each student such as a statistical analysis of how often they use certain common words and punctuation

47209
extjs	mootools
i ve used extjs and mootools as frameworks in this kind of area

47209
extjs	mootools
if you don t need all the extjs widgets i d say well away from it in future and look at something like the mootools dynamic sortables demo

47236
vim	emacs
cscope does this in a standalone xterm and also can be used inside your favorite editor - it has great emacs and vi vim support

47309
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to install godi on linux ubuntu

47320
hash	salt
if you only need to test for equality between two strings ie is this string the same as the one i had earlier store only a salt hash value of it

47335
post	get
get may yeild marginally better performance some webservers write post contents to a temporary file before invoking the handler

47335
post	get
transferring more data than that should use a post to get better browser compatibility

47346
put	get
oh and we have this method too that allows you to put in a whole url string without having to get the querystring out of it

47389
post	put
wow i think that s the most raw work i ve ever seen put into a stackoverflow post

47413
sorting	grouping
unfortunately the last keyword in a grouping gives you the last physical record in the database not the last record by any sorting

47434
punctuation	words
remove-first-word finds the first words boundary of sentence then takes that section of characters including space and punctuation and removes it and returns new sentence

47434
punctuation	words
add-first-word finds the first words boundary of sentence then takes that section of characters including space and punctuation and adds it to reverse-sentence and returns new reverse-sentence contents

47472
goto	break
i could just have easily declared a boolean break variable and used it as part of the conditional for each loop but in this instance i decided a goto was just as practical and just as readable

47512
goto	break
until c and c++ amongst other culprits have labelled break and continues goto will continue to have a role

47519
ubuntu	linux
the system in question is ubuntu 7.04 but that is irrelevant as i m looking to fix it for at least the majority of if not all linux users

47591
int	double
int and double

47591
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
cgrect cgpoint cgsize and cgaffinetransform structures

47615
int	chars	int	double
the + operator can work between a string and a string chars int double or float data type value

47617
put	get
all objects with a finaliser get put on a special finalise queue by the garbage collector where the finalise method is invoked on them so it s technically a performance hit to declare empty finalisers

47658
post	get
amongst other sections which i may post here as i get to them i am writing a section on code formatting

47659
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
once you associate your project to maven and update the dependencies using m2e any change to pom.xml are reflected to entire project even java version definition causes it to be compiled in right jre if you have it installed and properly configured into eclipse.

47665
try-catch	exception-handling
to make our lives easier we also have a safedispose method in our infrastructure which calls the the dispose method of its argument within a try-catch block with error logging just in case although dispose methods are not supposed to throw exception-handling

47670
post	put
put the data in a standard form with no runat server attribute and set the action of the form to post to the target off-site page

47670
submit	submission
before submission i would submit the data to my server using an xmlhttprequest and analyze the response

47674
maven	m2e
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

47710
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you should be using illegalargumentexception iae not nullpointerexception nullpointerexception for the following reasons

47735
post	get
by definition the browser will make that via a get request even if the original request was a post

47735
opera	firefox
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs

47743
winforms	shell32.dll
there is actually no managed way to do that form of animation to the tray in native winforms however you can p invoke shell32.dll to do it

47748
many-to-many	many-to-one
for example when using object-relational mapping technology you ll have a rich set of semantics for various many-to-one and many-to-many relationships

47869
rss	feed
we have a list of permalink url s as well as the rss feed

47902
int	chars
the jdk is full of examples like in int chars and math classes

47929
udp	tcp
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

48001
superclass	subclassing
simple superclass name qualified subclassing name

48015
vim	emacs
i came from emacs to vim when i realized how organized vim s documentation is and how chordable many of the features are

48015
emacs	textmate
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

48018
bbedit	jedit
i m a bbedit user but i keep jedit around for writing xquery

48053
division	modulo
i read somewhere once that the modulo is inefficient on small embedded devices like 8 bit micro-controllers that do not have integer division instruction

48065
vim	emacs
for background i m also a long-time vim user but i learned emacs about 2 years ago and now use them interchangeably

48065
vim	emacs
there are still some things that i find easier in vim block-select mode simple macro recording diff mode and things that are easier in emacs line alignment file buffer management window screen management

48069
rss	feed
blogs almost always have an rss feed for comments

48069
rss	feed
even if the blog is your own if you are already generating an rss feed then don t bother making a call to your db

48093
division	modulo
all the assembly language i have seen x86 68000 implement the modulo using a division

48103
division	modulo
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

multiplying	subtract	multiplying	division	multiplying	modulo	division	subtract	division	modulo
processors with multipliers have interesting division routines using the multiplier but you can get from division result to modulo with just another two steps multiplying and subtract so it s still comparable

48103
division	modulo
so in that vein here s a very low level look at the math of modulo for an example of x which should show you how simple it can be compared to division

48128
public	protected
if i come up with a good solution i ll remove any ip protected code and put it out for public use

48170
google-chrome	firefox
all three worked well in ie 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome

48184
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere mq site

48219
apache	nginx
nginx is great but if you don t fancy a whole new web server apache 2.2 with mod proxy balancer will do the same job

48228
post	get
you can submit form on the web page from you program by sending post get request to a website

48236
g++	gcc
gcc g++ 4.2

48265
google-chrome	safari
its based on the open sourced engine - webkit which is used in apples safari and googles google-chrome browsers.see this blog for details

48282
nunit	mstest
look at unit tests - they re loaded by reflection at least in nunit and mstest

48405
nunit	mstest
i haven t tried it - but i would advise clients who have a large investment or who have a strong preference for it over the mstest tool in nunit who are interested in implementing tfs to continue with nunit as opposed to trying convert all their existing tests

48451
dictionary	map
use map if you need something like a dictionary

48509
allocator	stl
memory management pointers allocator etc basics of stl and templates since stl uses templates

48533
width	height
the html width and height attributes do not allow for units

48533
width	height
you re likely thinking of the css width and height properties

48533
width	height
in the width and height attributes might cause a rendering engine to balk

48555
post	get
note method 2 in the definitive post on gzipping your css looks like a good solution but i couldn t get it working

48660
innodb	myisam
and myisam works differently from innodb

48704
drive	createfile
createfile - the createfile function creates or opens a file file stream directory physical disk volume console buffer tape drive communications resource mailslot or named pipe

48745
udp	tcp
think of it this way if a packet goes missing would you rather just get the next packet as quickly as possible and continue use udp or do you actually need that missing data use tcp

48760
subtraction	addition
if you had a math class you might have a few static methods to deal with addition and subtraction because these are concepts associated with math

48761
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox ie and opera probably safari too all send the if-modified-since header when they receive content with a last-modified header attached so this works fine

48900
expression-blend	silverlight
microsoft has positioned expression-blend versions 2.0 and 2.5 for designing the ui of silverlight 1.0 and 2 applications respectively

48903
actionscript	mxml
flex actionscript 3 and mxml for ui definition

48974
getter	setter
ruby and c# both easily let you create accessors by specifying getter setter methods for an attribute much like in python

49060
int	double
type-inferred constants can only be scalar values - things like int double etc

49060
pascal	delphi
to explain why historically typed constants in early delphi and its predecessor turbo pascal are writable and thus essentially initialized global variables we need to go back to the days of dos

49060
pascal	delphi
a lot of people took advantage of this since turbo pascal and delphi did not at that time have initialized global variables as a feature

49131
udp	tcp
so the answer to your question depends a fair bit on whether you are using udp or tcp as your transport

49131
udp	tcp
this applies to both udp and tcp

49133
getter	setter
the reason for this is that daos should only be responsible for holding properties of the real world objects they are modeling and only have getter and setter methods or just direct property access

49182
hash	md5
based on the documentation on msdn and my experience binary is better since the md5 hash does not vary in size

49185
put	get
without knowing what your tag is actually doing presumably its its outputting something in the body section then there is no way that it will be able to get at the head to put the declaration there

49197
submit	submission
if you want the user to be able to select something from the dropdown and that changes the submission url then you re going to have to use javascript to achieve this by intercepting the form submit and formulating the correct url

49217
cout	cin
i m feeling your pain i also learned php first and i m trying to learn c++ it s not easy and i am really struggling it s been 2 years since i started on c++ and still the extent of what i can do is cout cin and math

49220
set	bag
i ve consulted the nhibernate reference material but i can t seem to figure when to use set bag and the other nhibernate collections

49232
rsa	3des
ok forget the last answer i can t read you are working with 3des keys not rsa keys

49263
rss	feed
and then we need to process texts from various sources like rss feed web-sites forums etc. - we extract parts of those texts there are entire sets of rules for that but that s irrelevant and we need to match those against the search-list

49282
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
as noted in answer by joseph pecoraro you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers such as those starting with 0x for hex and 0b for binary and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsed as octal

49315
des	aes
you can go with a tripple des implementation which will give you 112 bits key often referred to as 128 bit but only 112 of them are actually secure or as previously stated you can use aes

49421
disk	ram
to speed things up i have experimented a little with ram disk specifically changing the compilation attribute in web.config setting the tempdirectory to my ram disk

49443
voip	sip
a feasible architecture would probably be to use a sip trunk they optimize on using voip as much as possible and thus can provide much lower rates than a gsm provider generally does

49443
asterisk	pbx
also they allow for concurrency an asterisk box - a free pbx some custom made flash client and a custom made sip client on the server

49524
cvs	svn
the other classic integration would be your source code repository svn or cvs

49575
getter	setter
if there s no hope of changing the canonical names you could alias the getter and setter manually

49576
pascal	delphi
at the time i was programming windows 3.0 using borland s turbo pascal 1.0 for windows which later became delphi

49604
ingres	mysql
limit 10 works for mysql and others ingres uses

49630
hide	show
i m using javascript to hide an image and show some text thats hidden under it

49630
hide	show
but when the text is show if you scroll over it it fires the mouseout event on the container that then hide the text and show the image again and it just goes into a weird loop

49666
hash	md5
i d suggest you take the pieces of information you want in the key and hash it with md5 and then just take the first x characters where x is a key length you think is manageable

49674
crypt	hash
we keep it simple store every license data to an xml easy to read and manage create a hash of the whole xml and then crypt it with a utility also own and simple

49687
mouseover	mouseout
and catch the mouseover and mouseout events on this div instead

49687
mouseover	mouseout
because it has no child elements you shouldn t get spurious mouseover and mouseout events propagating to it

49687
mouseover	mouseout
what i believe happens is that when the cursor moves from a parent element onto a child element a mouseout event occurs on the parent element and a mouseover event occurs on the child element

49698
mouseover	mouseout
i m not sure if this would fit with the rest of your styling but perhaps if you changed the css on the text div so it was the same size as the image or fixed the size of the outer div then when the mouseover event fired the size of the outer div wouldn t change so much as to cause the mouseout event

49702
quicksort	heapsort
with an array i d use either quicksort or possibly heapsort and just change the comparison to use texample.sortorder the swap part is still going to just act on the array and swap pointers

49722
cvs	svn
best thing is you can incorporate more developers to your project seamlessly as opposed to having to give them access to your main centralized svn or cvs repository

49767
cpu	processors
if you can limit your code to one cpu setthreadaffinity you can use rdtsc assembler instruction to query performance counter directly from the processors

49859
getter	setter
there is some additional language elements like properties think getter and setter and the ability to overload operators

49890
post	get
i will post my code below but the problem is after it hits the first custom tag in the page it calls it and prints the response but does not get anything that comes after it in the wikitext

49890
wikitext	mediawiki
update george mauer -- i have seen that as well but this does not stop the page from rendering just the mediawiki engine from parsing the rest of the wikitext

49943
profiler	vtune	profiler	yourkit
i have tried pretty much every .net profiler on the market ants vtune optimizeit devpartner yourkit and in my opinion dottrace is the best of the lot

49953
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
java has basic types which aren t objects which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions for boolean byte chars double float int long object short

49954
cobertura	emma
you could also use code coverage tools like cobertura or emma for java analysis

50003
versioning	upgrade
so i guess our solution will be to upgrade our development installs with the full versioning of sql 2005 we have an msdn subscription of course

50064
awt	swing
this is pretty simple i come from a swing awt background

50079
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga
i m after loaders for bmp gif jpg png and tga

50170
opera	google-chrome
but this doesn t seem to generate markers in either ff3 google-chrome or ie8 beta 2 and if i recall correctly not opera either although i ve since uninstalled opera

50199
post	put
edit i put together a sample implementation of this pattern and published a blog post walking through the code

50220
joystick	keyboard
i m not sure off the top of my head for keyboard or joystick

50258
cvs	svn
note to implement this i had to write a custom script that checked out the latest version from the repository compared it with the local copy and issued svn or cvs commands to add remove and update any changed files

50280
firefox	safari
the floated content and the content that has an additional margin both appear fine in firefox ie but on safari one of the divs is completely hidden

50378
put	get
you need to put the burden of proof back on him- get him to convince you otherwise- and that will force him to do the research and discover the answer for himself

50396
norton	mcafee
typically the real reason a modern machine starts running slow is due to everything from malware to virus scanners mcafee norton s etc are prime targets in my mind

50472
hex	binary
there are 26 characters in the alphabet and we have a number system just like hex or binary just with an unusual character set a..z representing positionally the powers of 26 26 2 26 1 26 0

50488
cassini	iis
since for various reasons i can t use iis for an asp.net website i m developing i run cassini from the command line to test the site

50558
width	height
i know the width of the data 22 values but i do not know the height estimated around 4000 records but variable

50569
vb.net	vb6
i m a bit rusty on vb6 and never learned vb.net but this should give you a jagged array

50632
integer	unsigned
your i will be converted to an unsigned integer by adding uint_max + 1 then the addition will be carried out with the unsigned values resulting in a large result depending on the values of u and i

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

50632
integer	unsigned
referring to 3 above since both operands have the same rank your i will need to be converted to an unsigned integer

50632
integer	unsigned
a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

50798
put	get
i m not sure what you mean about recognizing a path - if any of the above paths are passed as a parameter to a program the shell will put the entire string in one variable - you don t have to parse multiple arguments to get the entire path

50820
width	margin
float the first column left then set the margin to the width of the first column

50842
free	malloc
first you have to provide the entrypoints for malloc and free and friends

50848
free	malloc
since you re worried about memory leaks and talking about malloc free i assume you re in c

50861
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you can set __malloc_hook __free_hook and __realloc_hook to point to functions which will be called from malloc realloc and free respectively

50909
youtube	vimeo
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

51014
haskell	ocaml
languages with type inference like ocaml and haskell will probably make this easier on you although their error messages can be confusing as well

51027
postgresql	mysql
rdbms mysql postgresql etc..

51036
oodbms	db4o
db4o as mentioned by eric is an object-oriented database management system oodbms

51047
exif	xmp
you can embed your data in the xmp tag within a jpeg or exif or iptc fields for that matter

51056
haskell	ocaml
i agree that haskell s type classes are really well done but it s a bit different in that haskell has no oo semantics but ocaml does support oo

51071
ant	maven
if you are working on several projects with similar directory structures and want to stick with ant instead of going to maven use the import task

51071
post	put
it even allows overriding of the tasks in the template which allows you to put in project specific pre or post target hooks

51101
ubuntu	linux
linux supports a technology called pae that lets you use more than 4gb of memory however i don t know whether ubuntu has it on by default

51159
firefox	safari
css3 will have last-child too this is currently supported by firefox safari but not ie 6 7 beta 8

51178
profiler	yourkit
or you can use a commercial profiler like yourkit or any number of other profilers

51196
ilist	iqueryable
you may want to consider just returning an iqueryable customer instead of an ilist customer from your data-access method

51196
ienumerable	iqueryable
since iqueryable t inherits from ienumerable t the rest of your app should be able to deal with it quite well

51199
put	get
if you have to concatenate large strings put the string parts into an array and use the array.join method to get the overall string

51302
gif	png
the img tag lets you embed external image files jpeg gif png swf files and movie clips inside text fields

51307
prepare	execute
this utility method combines prepare execute and fetchall_arrayref into a single call

51348
organization	naming
blitz project naming conventions organization guidelines

51360
width	height
put the spinner in a div the same size as the chart you know the height and width so you can use relative positioning to center it correctly

51385
postgresql	mysql
postgresql sqlite and mysql as databases

51409
ubuntu	linux
the packages that could use more than 4gb of memory on ubuntu and other linux distro s are compiled with pae support

51558
profiler	yourkit
if you are worried about speed i d really recommend a good profiler and get evidence as to where your bottlenecks are - i use yourkit and have been very pleased

51602
free	malloc
you only need to manually free strings when you manually allocate the memory yourself using the malloc function in c or the new operator in c++

51611
inherited	properties
you have 2 choices interfaces and inherited otherwise you can t access similar properties of different types of objects

51619
pull	push
i want to make centralized push pull git repository available to all my team members over the internet

51640
stdout	stderr
you shouldn t be comparing the file descriptor with anything unless checking for stdin stdout stderr or doing math with it

51656
disk	ram
ram the drive is a ram disk

51664
free	malloc
there are also potential problems if you are passing memory between your main .exe and .dll files as if each of these static links the runtime you can end up with malloc free mismatch problems

51728
profiler	aqtime
in addition to the refactoring and source control tools listed here aqtime is a great windows profiler

51753
outputstream	inputstream
as wmr mentioned org.apache.commons.io.ioutils from apache has a method called copy inputstream outputstream which does exactly what you re looking for

51893
portrait	landscape
when possible i love me some portrait mode for writing code my current monitors are landscape bound

51934
put	get
every gis data of the same type should be a class but my user has the possibility to get new set of data and put it in the database

51994
mouse	keyboard
getting a big external monitor will help as will a nice mouse and keyboard

52098
keydown	keyup
edit apparently i can capture the keydown and keyup events on the combobox which allows me to set the focus or tab to the next control

52099
gridview	repeater
the best solution i was able to come up with was to nest the gridview in the repeater

52099
gridview	repeater
then i bound each repeated gridview during the repeater s itemdatabound event

52111
for-loop	loops
also in all honesty i ve never used a while loops so there is a good change you would end up with a nice concise list comprehension or for-loop instead

52116
keydown	keyup
i believe directionals are only captured on keydown and keyup not on keypress

52140
pop-up	dialog
when we chose flash 6 years ago we did so for its large number of features for user interaction like dragging stuff opening and closing menus tree navigation elements pop-up dialog etc

52179
put	get
in the end i can probably put up with 200 ms response times but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks

52179
postgresql	mysql
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

52266
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

52266
mouse	keyboard
if you had one controller running on the box in front of which you sit you could use keyboard and mouse input to switch it between open sockets with different renderers

52345
goto	break
using a break while looping is remarkably similar to a goto except it isn t a goto but again is an indication that the code may not be optimal

52357
stdout	stderr
usually stderr is the same as stdout so clog is the same as cout

52401
profiler	yourkit
so the only correct way is to ask the jvm which a good profiler i use yourkit which probably isn t what you want

52414
vbscript	jscript
a lot of people use vbscript for classic asp but you can use javascript jscript on the server as an alternative

52458
profiling	debugging
jvmti is the debugging and profiling protocol

52486
internationalization	localization
flash used well allows easy localization and internationalization

52541
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3.1 start to go in a better direction but it will take years for them to be mature enough to create javascript applications that actually can fully replace desktop apps

52549
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
addition subtraction multiplication division

52565
boost	stl
really c++ templates are the enabling technology for stl and much of boost and c doesn t have them

52586
profiler	vtune
i like using intel vtune as a profiler primarily because it is non-invasive compared to instrumenting profilers which change behaviour too much

52616
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
i would look at a few options cvs subversion git bazaar visual sourcesafe and see which one s meet your team s desires the best

52633
width	margin
your problem is that the 100 width does not include any padding or margin values

52634
gridview	linqdatasource
i ve got a linqdatasource that points to my model and a gridview that consumes it

52634
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
i thought it might have to do with the linqdatasource so i added a sqldatasource and the same thing happens

52646
width	height
so i thought iframe - even though i m not a fan of frames i thought that i could create a frame that matched the width and height of the content so that it would appear native

52670
put	get
that would constitute one spot to get those resources and also the ones the asp.net mvc team put out

52703
ubuntu	linux
machine running ubuntu linux 8.04 with php version 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.3

52725
gridview	formview	gridview	repeater
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

52732
post	get
once i get it figured out i ll post what i did here

52881
codeigniter	cakephp
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with

52896
width	margin
the correct box model states that the width applies only to the content and padding and margin add on to it

52896
width	margin
the original ie box model also known as quirks mode includes padding and margin in the width

52994
ant	emma
first you need to setup where ant can find the emma libraries

53056
tostring	gethashcode
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for

53239
gridview	repeater
personally i hate gridview so i wrote a paging sorting repeater

53246
elementtree	beautifulsoup
python developer fredrik lundh author of elementtree among other things has a function to unsecape html entities on his website which works with decimal hex and named entities beautifulsoup will not work with the hex ones

53260
post	get
that redirect works find for a url with only get parameters but if the request originally contained some http post data that is now lost

53359
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
also be aware of the affects that the current accepted solution may have on parsing hex octal and binary numbers

53359
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
in ruby numbers that start with 0x or 0x are hex 0b or 0b are binary and just 0 are octal

53486
unix	solaris
at university when i was doing most things under unix solaris i used gdb

53507
httprequest	httpresponse
this is true because it uses the new abstractions classes for httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc

53518
children	parent
the children would need to be notice when the parent dies either through a failed ipc heartbeat or just wfmo wfso on the parent s process handle

53548
equals	gethashcode
we had a requirement to overload the equals operator and therefore the gethashcode function of our objects as they had become volatile and stateless and sourcing themselves directly from data so in one place of the application we needed to ensure that an object would be viewed as equals to another object if it was sourced from the same data not just if it was the same reference

53550
easymock	mockrunner
if you want to be able to test without a running container you can either simulate its components with your own mockobjects with easymock or you could try mockrunner which has pre-defined stubs for testing servlets jdbc-connections etc

53695
postgresql	mysql
can t you live with postgresql or mysql

53724
fasta	blast
fasta and blast biological sequence matching algorithms

53753
mouse	keyboard
i use a great piece of software called synergy this allows me to use one keyboard and mouse across 3 machines and use the copy paste buffer between machines including images

53766
jobs	cron
we use cron jobs on unix to schedule the build and host a simple apache web server to view and monitor the build

53787
ant	maven
in the end you should use the nicer build tools msbuild ant maven make ... where you can and fill the gaps for the odder tools with custom scripts

53816
textile	bbcode
one common way to do this is to use a markup language like textile markdown or bbcode

53822
implements	extends
since you say you have no control over it might i recommend extracting an interface from it of the methods that you do care about and making a mydbconnection extends db_connection class that implements your interface

53835
phpunit	simpletest
thus automated testcases like unit-tests - see phpunit or simpletest - and frontend-tests - see selenium are all the more important for big php projects to ensure the good health of the code

53839
mouse	keyboard
characters can change appearances make sounds move other characters respond to the keyboard and mouse etc

53883
ubuntu	debian
the erlang compiling process described in ciaran s post described for ubuntu 6.10 btw can be easily skipped using apt command in any debian based distro

53908
factors	mean
this is a problem many people have solved on a variety of platforms and the fact this you re on a microcontroller doesn t mean that the same tools and such don t apply - the relevant factors is the language you re using

53913
xsl-fo	xslt
i m trying to produce sheets of photographs with captions arranged in a grid using xslt and xsl-fo

53967
dictionary	map
i have a class that map objects to objects but unlike dictionary it maps them both ways

53988
single-quotes	double-quotes
you ll need to escape them for php too unless you change your double-quotes to single-quotes

53989
width	height
however if you link directly to a swf file it will open in the browser window and without looking in the address bar you can t tell that it wasn t embedded in html with the size set to 100 width and height

53999
ienumerable	ienumerator
just implement the ienumerable interface no need to implement the ienumerator unless you want to do some special things in the enumerator which for your case doesn t seem to be needed

54022
post	get
raymond chen s recent series of blog post the implementation of iterators in c# and its consequences is a good place to get up to speed

54026
required	placeholder
well i can but that would required scanning innerhtml content for script tags and replacing them in the string by placeholder and then inserting them using the dom

54038
rss	feed
for example read a bunch of rss feed and post a daily digest of all new entries

54188
put	get
or put another way can part of the write be complete and get interrupted and then the read happen

54219
inherited	properties
this was probably a mistake of the initial design but i ve spent a few days thinking about it and the classes really don t have much in common other than a guid properties that uniquely identifies each item so i can see why the original designer did not relate them through inherited

54270
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and the upcoming firefox 2.1 promise an order of magnitude better performance in javascript

54403
debian	linux
debian live provides the best tools for building a linux live cd

54403
ubuntu	debian
sudo apt-get install live-helper # from debian unstable which should work fine from ubuntu

54426
submit	submission
like the delicious submission bookmark-let i d like to have some standard javascript i can use to submit any visited url to a 3rd party site when that s possible by url

54444
atomic	interlocked
use atomic operations like interlocked on windows and the equivalent on linux

54527
vim	textmate
in regards to code chunks i have found and started using a vim plug-in called snipmate which mimics textmate s snippets feature

54557
min	max
you could also use max or avg instead of min it is only important to use a function that returns the value of the column if there is only one matching row

54656
getter	setter
however as soon as the data requires flow control getter setter that maintain or protect an internal state or starts acquring any major functionality basically more object-like it will get upgraded to a class to better communicate intent

54708
gridview	datalist
i can t seem to get at the data the way i would in say a datalist or a gridview and i can t seem to come up with anything else on google or quickly leverage this one to do what i want

54757
rss	feed
software that has an impact on human safety has much different requirements than say an rss feed reader

54765
rss	feed
to the user of an rss feed reader the value of high quality is considerably lower

54811
uptime	reboot
if someone will swear at the computer and looses productivity while it reboot when your software goes down then uptime is worth spending thousands on most internal software

54817
accessor	properties
throw the invalidoperationexception exception if a call to a properties set accessor or method is not appropriate given the object s current state

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

54830
typedef	struct
struct are also handy for various metaprogramming tasks like traits templates that just expose a bunch of dependent typedef

54876
spaces	delimiter
the microsoft.visualbasic.fileio namespace in microsoft.visualbasic.dll has a textfieldparser you can use to split on spaces delimiter text

54887
try-catch	exception-handling
you should be catching the exception-handling in a try-catch block

54975
free	malloc
usually i just replace calls to malloc and free with functions that keep better

55029
ssl	https
i d suggest looking at the request in the code that renders the form and if it is not using ssl issue a redirect to the https url

55090
getter	setter
you might be tempted to avoid creating those setter and getter but they also help in maintenance in case it becomse pertinent to do some modification of outputs or validation of inputs

55147
pop-up	dialog
however for a variety of reasons it needs to be embedded in the parent control not a pop-up dialog

55203
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks ok on that dialog box i want to insert that piece of text into a textbox on the page that initial popped up the dialog pop-up page

55215
subtraction	addition
+ - binary addition subtraction

55254
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable and ienumerable both work

55348
rss	feed
if you have asp.net generating an rss feed it will sometimes put an extra line at the top of the page

55377
firefox	safari
instead it neutralizes one possible attack and currently does that only on ie firefox exposes httponly cookies in xmlhttprequest and safari doesn t honor it at all

55441
put	get
i usually put the source into my project and then i can get better intellisense and a better understanding of them

55484
rdf	owl
microsoft interactive media manager is a metadata management system developed on the microsoft sharepoint platform that heavily leverages rdf owl and sparql

55489
vb.net	vb6
one of the big differences i noticed between a vb6 project and the converted vb.net project winform was with the built-in controls

55578
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
update microsoft now provide virtual machine images for various versions of ie that are ready to use on all of the major os x virtualisation platforms virtualbox vmware fusion and parallels

55578
vmware	virtualbox
the developer disk images we re going to use are will work with either vmware fusion or sun virtualbox

55578
vmware	virtualbox
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

55578
vmware	virtualbox
download q.app from and put it in your applications folder you will need it to convert the disk images into a format vmware virtualbox can use

55578
disk	ram
this will probably take a while it takes around 30 minutes per disk image on my 2.4ghz core 2 duo macbook w 2gb ram

55610
vim	textmate
and as of late 2010 i m making the push to use vim for development even over textmate on os x

55642
ienumerable	ilist
actually one of the great arguments for var is that it can make refactoring simpler because you no longer have to worry that you made your declaration overly restrictive you used list when you should have used ilist or ienumerable

55651
httphandler	httpmodule
in an httphandler or httpmodule implementation you cannot always access session from the beginrequest event

55677
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
no legacy browser compatibility required safari opera and firefox will do

55736
inherited	subclassing
blindlyequals is overridden by subclassing equals is inherited and never overridden

55742
getter	setter
you can also write some method of your own todo comparison using getter setter

55744
post	get
a bit of researching found that greasemonkey has a a function built into it where you can send get post requests to the server called gm_xmlhttprequest

55767
post	get
you could do a redirect to buy.php after saving to the session object which then does a server redirect to check.php it would mean when the user clicks back they re going back to the get request not the post request

55788
outputstream	inputstream
instead aquire an inputstream for the data and copy the data to the servlet outputstream in pieces

55862
hash	salt
basically i m extrapolating from the common way to implement web-site passwords when you re not using openid that is which is to store the salt hash of the user s password in your db and never save the actual password

55876
implements	extends
if you do need to extends this to cover many many file types look at the associated file command which implements the engine to use the database correctly it s non trivial for many file formats and is almost a statistical process

55879
gif	png
# png portable network graphics or png s not gif images

55882
hash	salt
additionally i would recommend using a salt to reduce the possibility to create a dictionary of all password hash

55884
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere solution suite obtained through their ascential acquisition includes qualitystage

55904
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
regarding your desire to store a hash of the password if you use pbkdf2 to generate the key you could use a standard password hashing algorithm big salt a thousand rounds of hashing for that and get different values

55904
hash	salt
the salt changes the hash resulting from each password

55927
hash	salt
can t you just use the password or hash password with some salt and then encrypt the file with it

55964
installation	upgrade	folder	directory
the installation is correctly detected as an upgrade but the directory selection screen is still shown and with the default value not necessarily the current installation folder

55983
try-catch	exception-handling
i ve seen too many try-catch blocks where the catch does nothing but rethrow the exception-handling

55999
n-gram	words
however if you really want something even faster you could include all n-gram in your pre-process where an n-gram is any string of n words in a row

56005
serializable	deserialization
if we let each object of the graph serializable itself using a deserialization constructor we get a lot switches for all the different modes of deserialization

56005
serializable	deserialization
another approach would be to have some sort deserialization factory classes methods one for each mode that does the serializable and deserialization externally graphserializer.serializeobjecttypex objecttypex objecttoserialze

56109
nant	cruisecontrol
we checked them all out but after careful consideration we decided to roll our own with a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild and msdeploy

56113
rmdir	xcopy
if your build uses custom tasks they should still work if they don t depend on windows executables such as rmdir or xcopy

56269
lxml	elementtree
another way is using the e factory builder from lxml available in elementtree too

56298
interbase	firebird
i ve written dlls for interbase firebird and t-sql sprocs for sql server but never a clr routine

56342
spaces	delimiter
some are tab delimiter some are spaces delimiter some we simply don t know yet

56422
idictionary	ilist
i can tell you that xaml serialization of collections rely on them implementing either ilist or idictionary so non-generic collections are going to be with us for some time to come

56460
min	max
you could check that the standard deviation looks reasonable that the min is reasonable and the max value as well

56464
post	get
to make get post requests and update your ui accordingly

56498
submit	submission
as a more draconian approach you can always write a submit trigger which will reject submission of change-lists if they contain a certain file or files with a certain extension etc

56578
csla	.net
frameworks like csla in .net have a lot of aspects from this patterm i think entity framework looks a bit too much like this too

56595
subtraction	addition
while for most datetime operations i would normally convert to unixtime and perform addition subtraction etc

56596
typedef	struct
typedef struct _image_nt_headers

56596
typedef	struct
typedef struct _image_optional_header

56615
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have a very similar console and right-click options for inspect element

56629
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
from there you can do such things as getelementbyid on an htmldocument or getelementsbytagname on htmlelements

56630
switching	screens
it will be in one place if you scroll to the top of the page and as you scroll down at some point where its original home is about to scroll off the page it will switching to fixed position and stay on your screens

56682
folder	directory
scanning an entire directory recursively will not work for me because the folder is much too large

56698
hash	md5
i have been looking into using a md5 hash but i can t find any good examples of traversing an object like this and returning a manifest of the specific differences not just indicating that they are different

56713
profiling	instrumentation
it is a slightly different mindset to a traditional profiling that instrumentation the code

56753
multiplying	add
so take your prtime multiplying it by 10 and add it to the number of ticks representing the epoch time and you have your conversion

56771
firefox	safari
i m using the html5 element in firefox 2.0.0.16 and in safari 3.1.2 both on my imac

56825
pthreads	fork
since you mentioned fork i assume you re on a unix-like system in which case pthreads usually referred to as pthreads are what you want to use

56835
voip	sip
ekiga uses the open source opal library to implement sip communications opal has support for several voip and video over ip standards - see www.opalvoip.org for more info

56860
lsp	principles
i have heard that the liskov substitution principles lsp is a fundamental principles of object oriented design

56873
inherited	subclassing
the gang of four stated in their book because inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s implementation it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation

56900
mktime	strtotime
you can use a combination of strtotime mktime and date todo the arithmetic

56904
lsp	principles
the liskov substitution principles lsp lsp is a concept in object oriented programming that states

56904
width	height
board provides both the height and width properties and threedboard provides the z axis

56904
lsp	principles
this allows us to use good object oriented principles like encapsulation and reuse and doesnâ t violate lsp

56961
public	protected
base classes can declare protected and public functions that can be accessed by derivations

57006
hide	show
apparently ie8 show the cells by default and you have to hide it with empty-cells hide but it doesn t work at all in ie7 which hide by default

57054
implements	extends
i ve got a collection that implements an interface that extends both ilist t and list

57078
northwind	adventureworks
for microsoft sql server there is the northwind sample db and adventureworks

57091
width	height
the parent has to have a fixed width and height

57104
postgresql	mysql
btw i want to be using postgresql and or mysql as the backend database

57166
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
you may also want to look at casting yout ilist to ienumerable for serialization since ilist just wraps ienumerable and icollection

57202
put	get
i would like to put a link to a webpage in an alert dialog box so that i can give a more detailed description of how to fix the error that makes the dialog box get created

57262
versioning	upgrade
your only alternative in 2008 is to get your users to upgrade their framework versioning now

57276
filesystems	ntfs
it explains how to use the ntfs filesystems with c++ through windows 2000

57291
websphere	ibm
i was hoping there would be a similar mechanism for websphere that doesn t involve calling the ibm libraries or rely on rad to be installed on your workstation

57310
jython	jacl
one way to do it could be using jython or jacl scripts

57320
migrate	upgrade
if you have a few spare cycles you could migrate a separate branch of your apps in your scm which is running with the 3.5 runtime and when you actually need to upgrade you have a working branch assuming that you keep it up-to-date with some bi-weekly merge

57335
agile	sprint
as to the more general how does fogbugz fit with the agile methodology your best bet is to do sprint as mini-releases

57416
solaris	bsd
for linux bsd solaris

57479
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in all other browsers aside from firefox ie6 7 opera safari my append call actually appends the information below my existing option - select an

57528
vbscript	jscript
i seem to recall reading somewhere that the command object shouldn t be used in vbscript or jscript because of security vulnerabilities but i can t seem to find that article

57547
gmail	hotmail
my university does not allow our student-mailbox to forward to a private e-mail account everybody uses either gmail or hotmail here

57573
for-loop	loops
indeed i seem to remember steve mcconnell s code complete advising against even using comma operators in a for-loop for readability and maintainability loops should be controlled by only one variable and the expressions in the for line itself should only contain loop-control code not other extra bits of initialisation or loops maintenance

57609
put	get
right now i m placing the cal values into registry keys that get put into the os image at build time

57619
goto	break
there probably is some overlap with arguments about goto but as far as i m concerned the use of continue is equivalent to using break statements in loops or return statement from anywhere in a method body - if used correctly it can simplify the code less likely to contain bugs easier to maintain

57641
profiling	debugging
phped also offers great debugging and profiling and the ability to add watches breakpoints etc in php code

57641
profiling	debugging
browser plugins also enable quick integration with firefox or ie visit slow url with browser then click button to profiling or debugging

57668
goto	break
you can goto anywhere thus break flow control arbitrarily

57681
for-loop	loops
if you have to write large for loops i would try to stick to using continue close to the top of the for-loop

57699
children	parent
so you need to create the state object in your parent appdomain and then pass it to any children that want to use it

57720
datediff	difference
it takes into account the fact that datediff computes the difference without considering what month or day it is so the month diff between 8 31 and 9 1 is 1 month and handles that with a case statement that decrements the result where appropriate

57759
opera	firefox
i ve tried installing some other commercial apps opera foxit firefox only firefox will install under nonadmin and only if you select something other than program files which i was aware is off limits to nonadmin acounts

57802
mri	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
will probably go up to four or five. update it s now 5 mri jruby yarv the interpreter for ruby 1.9 rubinius and ironruby

57802
jruby	mri
actually production-ready mri and jruby

57884
mef	prism
mef s heritage ala prism certainly shows through but i think it would be odd if it didn t given that both frameworks are about composition

57958
gridview	repeater	gridview	checkboxlist
i can t argue with the utility of gridview repeater checkboxlist etc so i use them when i need that functionality

57967
processors	hyperthreading
iirc the coolthreads technology is referring to the fact that rather than just ramping up the clock speed ever higher to improve performance they are now looking at multiple core processors with hyperthreading effectively giving you loads of processors on one chip

58070
getter	setter
so the classes folder had just the class properties and getter setter

58091
post	put
you could certainly put the static methods in post into the post class this is how csla works but they are still factory methods

58094
post	put
if you put the code to populate the post in the post class then your business layer is interceded with data access code and vice versa

58175
pascal	delphi
you might take a look at free pascal as it includes a 64 bit version and is mostly delphi compatible syntax

58218
actionscript	mxml
mxml just provides a quick way to build the ui etc but if you want to do it yourself with actionscript there s nothing stopping you this would also probably be easier if you already have that ui in as2 code

58232
mouse	keyboard
the way we use it is to replace users inputs by automating mouse mouse and clicks and keyboard presses

58248
firefox	safari
unless you re using some really esoteric browser features in general if something works in firefox i ve found it works without modification in windows safari

58301
directx	gdi
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

58304
struts	stripes
in our evaluation we considered an alpha version of struts that supported annotations and a lot of other frameworks but stripes won because of it s superior documentation stability and clean-ness

58340
mvp	presenter
using win forms with an mvc mvp architecture i would normally use a class to wrap a view to test the ui while using mocks for the model and controller presenter

58363
memcached	apc
i would recommend memcached or apc

58369
opera	firefox
then there s an ie way to get the cursor position that also works in opera and an easier way in firefox

58375
sorting	filtering
if its something that will take fewer lines of clr code to tackle it string manipulation complex custom sorting or filtering etc. use this approach

58398
mouse	keyboard
if you plan on working off of the laptop by itself without external mouse kb monitor more than 60 of the time than the macbook pro with it s larger keyboard and monitor would be better suited

58432
firefox	safari
i m assuming you would like to be ablt to use if globally or at least in ie firefox not just be installing safari as other have suggested

58500
qtkit	quicktime
if you want to manipulate the camera directly from your code you must use the quicktime capture apis or the cocoa qtkit capture wrapper much better

58543
width	height
easy just set height and width to 100

58556
disk	ram
to clarify my question a little bit i can of course do the math to calculate the amount of ram and disk space i need to run 5 instances given the constraints stated above

58620
width	height
remark using use_cw_default for width and height results in a 0 0 size button so that s not a solution

58689
width	height
to get your own dialog base units you have to retrieve current text metrics with gettextmetrics and use character height and average width tmheight and tmavecharwidth of the textmetric struct respectively and translate them with muldiv by your own unless you are in a dialog then mapdialogrect will do all the job for you

58689
width	height
if buttons are the only control you want to resize automatically you can also use bcm_getidealsize message button_getidealsize macro windows xp and up only to retrieve optimal width and height that fits anything the button contains though it looks pretty ugly without any margins applied around the button s text

58700
robocopy	xcopy
i find robocopy is a good alternative to xcopy

58713
integer	fractions
and you want a least common multiplier n such that n each fractions an integer then n a b c gcd a b c

58785
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy functionally replaces xcopy with more options

58835
gdal	arcgis
i was originally using arcgis 9.2 but that doesn t work well with c# and 64 bit so i am now using gdal

58864
disk	ram
coming from a mac background i ve never really spent much time tinkering with assembling tweaking my own computer beyond occasional ram upgrades and swapping out hard disk

58923
goto	break
having an unsupported keyword ie continue or goto would break that

58929
postgresql	mysql
postgresql db2 mysql and mssql all refuse to run the first query as it s ambiguous

59006
getter	setter
the way getter and setter work a rectangle should satisfy the following invariant

59018
children	parent
hierarchical structure easy definition of a document tree with automatic links to siblings parent and children

59037
hash	salt
if you do not salt your password you re suspect to rainbow table attacks precompiled dictionaries that have valid inputs for a given hash

59037
hash	salt
the problem is that if you have a collisions two inputs with the same hash adding the salt to the wrong side will not change the resulting hash

59038
hash	salt
normally hashing functions allow you to provide a salt which makes the use of known hash table a waste of time

59038
hash	salt
based on the above as well as the fact that if you do somehow get clear-text expose a salt hash value is of little value to someone trying to get in

59054
hash	salt
the usual solution is to use a secret salt plus additional user information to make the hash results unique- something like

59093
actionscript	mxml
flex seems to be thier name for the flex builder ide based on eclipse and the general approach of building flash files using mxml and actionscript rather than the normal flash tools

59093
actionscript	mxml
i think the mxml and actionscript approach flex is designed to appeal much more to programmers where as the flash side is designed more to appeal to graphic designers

59097
versioning	upgrade
if you need more advanced database features sql server express can be seamlessly upgrade to more sophisticated versioning of sql server

59132
junit	testng
they all support junit and most support testng as well

59260
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so to do have a tooltip show up in both ie and firefox safari google-chrome opera use both an alt attribute and a title attribute

59281
hash	salt
i d symmetrically encrypt aes a secure salt hash sha-256 + salt

59281
hash	salt
the salt hash would be enough with a big salt but the encryption adds a bit extra in case the database and not the code leaks and there are rainbow tables for salt hash by then or some other means

59298
nant	cruisecontrol
we use a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild to generate a release version of the app

59307
nant	cruisecontrol
we use a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild to generate a release version of the app

59430
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

59434
scheme	racket
racket formerly dr scheme has a nice editor several different scheme dialects an attempt at visual debugging lots of libraries and can run on most platforms

59460
httphandler	httpmodule
i did the parsing of the user-agent string at the page level but of course you could do this kind of logic in the httpmodule or httphandler level also

59480
hide	show
this is likely due to blocking from one of the controls wrapping it my gut feeling is that it s the popupcontrolextender - it tends to have odd behavior with updatepanels as it is intended to manage the events inside it for it s show hide purposes

59481
boost	stl
see boost pointer container for a container that does the automatic deletion of contained pointers for you while maintaining a syntax very close to ordinary stl containers

59540
caldav	webdav
icalendar is a calendar synchronization format specification and caldav is an implementation of icalendar atop the webdav protocol

59549
google-chrome	firefox
when downloading both firefox and google-chrome i ve noticed that the default version i got was in my native tongue of hebrew

59600
versioning	upgrade
personally i would suggest you stick with delphi maybe just upgrade to a new versioning

59600
versioning	upgrade
another option would be to upgrade to a more resent versioning of delphi for .net and port your code to .net that way

59638
ubuntu	linux
i have set up 3 laptops with linux 2 ubuntu and 1 fedora 8

59644
ubuntu	linux
that is how i found the linux distribution that would run on my laptop ubuntu

59723
ready	each
then in the page programaticly refresh the update panel using javascript once the page has loaded and you ll get each individual gridview rendering once its ready

59853

i ve been playing with rss feed this week and for my next trick i want to build one for our internal application log

60009
rss	feed
i want to create an rss feed off of this table but i m not sure how to handle the volume- there could be hundreds of entries per day even on a normal day

60061
rss	feed
you can then have multiple rss feed for the various categories and severities

60137
ubuntu	debian
i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

60154
disk	ram
first you measure the number of visitors the site currently receives and how much demand each user places on the server and then you calculate the computing resources cpu ram disk space and network bandwidth that are necessary to support current and future usage levels

60155
ubuntu	debian
slicehost referral link if you so choose offers reverse dns multiple ips 2 month ip ubuntu debian along with others

60203
memcached	apc
i also use apc and memcached for different things but the other answers i ve seen so far are more for more complete and complex systems

60227
fflush	gets
also the fflush is necessary because by default sys.stdout only fflush its output after a newline or after its buffer gets full

60271
firefox	safari
i ve written a couple xul extensions for firefox and now i d like to write versions of them for safari

60302
outputstream	inputstream
if i start a process via java s processbuilder class i have full access to that process s standard in standard out and standard error streams as java inputstream and outputstream

60302
system.in	system.out
however i can t find a way to seamlessly connect those streams to system.in system.out and system.err

60316
background-image	background-position
you don t use an img tag but an element with a background-image css attribute and set the background-position on hover

by selecting questions that are tagged with stackoverflow you get only those post that people have explicitly identified as being about stackoverflow

60382
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

60443
consistency	acid
use the properties defined by acid atomicity consistency isolation and durability to help decide when this might be the case

60482
folder	directory
when you start emacs using an ms windows shortcut the default-directory is initially the folder directory specified in the start in field of the shortcut properties

60485
post	put
design the representations s accepted from the client the xml format you can put or post

60490
textarea	pre
try to add the following style on textarea style white-space pre

60496
postgresql	mysql
if you re connecting to a database other than mysql there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to pg_prepare and pg_execute for postgresql

60496
prepare	execute
then when you call execute the prepare statement is combined with the parameter values you specify

60496
prepare	execute
another benefit with using prepare statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsed and compiled once giving you some speed gains

super	implements
it seems like most of your objectives would be meet by some sort of super source control system which could be implements with cruisecontrol

60564
width	height
the font is fixed width and height so making a background bitmap dynamically isn t difficult and is probably the quickest and easiest solution

60609
google-chrome	safari
whilst i ve not yet found a way to automate safari i have found a way to automate webkit inside of google-chrome

60628
expression-blend	silverlight
this is a preview version of expression-blend for designing silverlight 2 experiences

60662
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
it combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

60672
isapi	httpmodule
i want to implement an isapi filter like feature using httpmodule in iis7 running under iis integrated request processing pipeline mode

60728
httpcontext	httpmodule
i would suggest storing your custom data in httpcontext or global application object or your database from your httpmodule and then reading that shared value in the aspx page

60758
hash	salt
you could store the salt for the hash password in another table of course each user would have their own salt

60815
postgresql	mysql
i know that postgresql and mysql have the ability to order by a random function so you can use this in sqlalchemy

60836
inline	inlining
excessive inlining of functions can increase size of compiled executable which can have negative impact on cache performance but nowadays compiler decide about function inlining on their own depending on many criterias and ignore inline keyword

60864
hash	md5
it is important to use a well known hash function such as md5 or sha-1 implemented in a library

60864
hash	salt
bondy the reason you use salt is to make dictionary attaks harder the attacker can t hash a dictionary and try against all the passwords instead she have to take the salt + the dictionary and hash it which makes the storage requierments expode

60893
formview	linqdatasource
in my application i have textbox in a formview bound to a linqdatasource like so

60910
emacs	aquamacs
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

60940
hide	show
show hide â font panel

60955
bash	zsh
- is a process substitution that is a nonstandard shell feature of some posix-compatible shells bash ksh zsh

60958
bazaar	git
git mercurial of bazaar are examples of source code control tools that are not intrusive because you do not need to set up a master server

60983
formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview	listview	gridview
it also adds great flexibility and functionality to the detailsview formview gridview and listview controls in the form of smart validation and the ability to easily change the display of these controls using templates

61029
hide	show
as select elements are displayed inline by default an alternative to the last step is to remove the #make and #model divs and and apply the show and hide classes to the model select element directly

61037
cvs	svn
no broad support for either cvs or svn but rather a commercial relative for most things

61061
persistent	transient
in effect you want a transient heap and a persistent heap or heaps that group things of similar lifetimes

61104
width	height
while you can use the height and width attributes in the img tag this does not change the size of the images that is downloaded to the browser

61196
inherited	properties
you can also extend inherited classes and override properties methods using the prototype chain spoon16 alluded to

61218
bazaar	git
if you want to be super-modern consider a distributed versioning system such as git bazaar or mercurial

61218
mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
trac mantis and bugzilla are widespread open-source choices

61229
int	chars
the key point here is that the comparison is done with int types instead of signed chars types

61230
int	chars
it casts to an int for the first comparison since 0xff is still considered an int meaning your chars is -128 to 127 but the 0xff is still 255

61230
int	chars
in the second case your telling it that 0xff is really an signed chars not an int

61232
int	chars
when p is -1 which is then converted from a signed chars to a signed int it is still -1 which has a representation of 0xffffffff which is not equal to 0xff

61237
public	protected
i use explicit checks that throw exceptions on public and protected methods and assertions on private methods

61258
irix	linux
the closest to cross-platform i ve seen is fam which seems to work for linux bsd and irix but i m not how easy it would be to port it to windows and macos

61277
windbg	mdbg
like mdbg or even windbg

61303
profiling	debugging
don t forget to add a check to skip profiling if you are in debugging mode

61372
submit	submission
i want to write an onclick event which submit a form several times iterating through selected items in a multi-select field submission once for each

61438
children	parent
normal flow is how elements and their children will layout top to bottom for block elements and left to right for inline elements inside their containing block usually the parent

61438
width	margin
you will tend to rely on width margin and padding to define the spacing and layout of the elements to the other elements around it be they or otherwise html is mostly semantic at this point

61447
emacs	textmate
textmate s snippets are the most closest match but it is not a cross-platform solution and not for emacs

61494
getter	setter
just go private int _age and normal getter setter as you normally would

61535
rss	feed
fails a but b would return their rss feed

61537
rss	feed
if so run it through an html parser and look for elements with rss feed relations

61538
rss	feed
this type of link is the one used by most browsers to auto-discover feed causing the rss icon to appear in your address bar

61546
rss	feed
b lookup feed provides the rss feed for a given url

61546
rss	feed
theres also a find feed function that searches for rss feed based on a keyword

61706
rss	feed
the .net framework 3.5 has added a syndicationfeed class which allows you to create and or consume feed in atom 1.0 and rss 2.0 formats

61775
macbook	bootcamp
i currently run bootcamp on a macbook pro and do all my development on a series of virtual pc vms for many different environments

61795
websphere	ibm
i m looking for a java profiler that works well with the jvm coming with websphere 6.0.2 ibm jvm 1.4.2

61804
postgresql	mysql
i haven t tried it myself but i ve been interested in playing with postgresql as an alternative to mysql

61868
getter	setter
don t go about testing getter and setter

61873
stdout	stderr
here the redirection 2 1 which sets file descriptor 2 stderr to point to the same stream as file descriptor 1 stdout gets evaluated before the redirection dev null which sets file descriptor 1 to point to dev null

61873
stdout	stderr
the effect is that what you write to stderr gets sent to stdout and what you write to stdout gets thrown away

61881
jquery	scriptaculous
all of this means that you could use yui jquery prototype scriptaculous in your application but you may find that using a single library makes it a lot easier to maintain things

61891
put	get
the thing that would put me off that idea is that for general use any binary data would get copied over anytime it changed whereas the text content scm systems are based around can easily be updated in the form of diffs

61906
javassist	cglib
the bar member of foo is a proxy object in our case javassist proxy but it can be cglib one depending on the bytecode provider you use that is not initialized

61971
switching	screens
for example only switching bluetooth on when you need it similarly the phone capabilities turn the screens brightness down when it isn t needed turn the volume down etc

61974
nant	cruisecontrol
our company uses the cruisecontrol svn nant jira combination with great success

62017
asterisk	pbx
i m interested in learning more about asterisk open source pbx so i thought i would try building a hobby system for my home

62045
getter	setter
use getter setter all the time if you started using them from the getgo and or are used to working with them

62045
getter	setter
as an aside i personally find that using getter setter makes the code easier to read and to debug later on

62207
testdriven.net	ndepend
i m always amazed that more people don t know about use ndepend - it shows all dependencies at every level of your code and will even draw pretty box and arrow pictures showing how confused your architecture really is together with testdriven.net i can t imagine working without it any more

62220
postgresql	mysql
however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

62336
vbscript	jscript
the short version is to place a vbscript stop statement or jscript debugger at the beginning of the procedure before any statements that you will want to step through

62362
width	height
it means a layout which adjusts dynamically to the browser or whatever client width and height to make efficient use of all available screen space as opposed to mostly fixed width layouts which are made to fit a common denominator resolution at that particular time 800x600 used to be the norm for websites for many years

62381
post	get
the most obvious way to me would be to make an http request and call the webservice using an actual http get or post

62410
int	boolean
so you could have name string age int active boolean etc

62512
allocator	stl
i would like to find out safe ways of implementing three dimensional arrays of integers in c++ using pointer arithmetic dynamic memory allocator or alternatively using stl techniques such as vectors

62513
put	get	post	put	post	get
having created a typical api using specific calls for specific functions i am considering simplifying the api by using a rest type api get put post delete or crud type create read update delete interface

62625
getter	setter
and do i even need to worry about testing the properties since they are .net s getter and setter

62649
16-bit	64bit
however we thankfully don t see much 16-bit any more and when 64bit started to get popular people were more concerned with making it compatible with older software and 32-bit had been around so long that for most compilers an int is just assumed to be 32 bits

62659
allocator	stl	boost	allocator	boost	stl
using the stl or boost are quite good approaches if you don t know beforehand how many entries you will have in each dimension of the array because they will give you dynamic memory allocator and i recommend either of these approaches if your data set is to remain largely static or if it to mostly only receive new entries and not many deletions

62669
getter	setter
if you implemented some specific functionality in the getter and setter i think they are worth testing

62671
getter	setter
as i understand unit tests in the context of agile development mike yes you need to test the getter and setter assuming they re publicly visible

62671
getter	setter
since the getter and setter are externally visible you need to test them along with authenticate and save

62672
getter	setter
it doesn t hurt to write unit tests for your getter and setter

62680
getattr	setattr
then your class is already a dictionary and if you want you can override getattr and or setattr to call through and set the dict

62684
getter	setter
i would test your getter and setter

62684
getter	setter
depending on who s writing the code some people change the meaning of the getter setter methods

62689
int	chars
looking through the o reilly cow books on c i realize that i can t simply index the bits of a simple chars or int type variable as i d like to to do bitwise comparisons and operators

62696
getter	setter
this includes getter and setter especially in case the members properties are complex classes which requires large memory allocation during their initialization

62698
getter	setter
if on the other hand you are doing something clever like encrypting and decrypting the password in the getter setter then give it a test

62700
getter	setter
of course if the getter and setter have no special logic then the tests of the authenticate andsave methods should cover them but otherwise an explict test should be written

62715
getter	setter
testing boilerplate code is a waste of time but as slavo says if you add a side effect to your getter setter then you should write a test to accompany that functionality

62727
getter	setter
so if your setter and getter are just propertyvalue value and return propertyvalue it makes no sense to test it

62737
activemq	rabbitmq
beside activemq which should work for your demands you could also take a look at rabbitmq or openamq

62749
getter	setter
really trivial code like getter and setter that have no extra behaviour than setting a private field are overkill to test

62750
getter	setter
testing default getter and setter doesn t seem very useful to me unless you re planning to do some validation later on

62760
getter	setter
i believe it s silly to test getter setter when they only make a simple operation

62770
jquery	scriptaculous
so far i see a very large difference the approach using something like ext and others like jquery ui scriptaculous mochikit etc

62779
getter	setter
i hope this means we can move on from getter and setter

62797
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed

62837
post	get
the httpconnection class and the get and post methods are always supported

62884
g++	gcc
ubuntu includes a package called build-essential which installs gcc g++ make etc

62888
int	chars
chars whose int representations are 0-31 less than ascii space

62951
versioning	upgrade
some of our developers have already upgrade to versioning 2.4.7 though and they get project creation errors when compiling

62972
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

63039
setinterval	settimeout
try setinterval or settimeout

63044
getter	setter
i usually don t test setter getter but lets says you make one for user.name which concatenate first and last name i would write a test so if someone change the order for last and first name at least he would know he changed something that was tested

63084
puts	gets
the multiple gets must be replaced by an equal number of puts before another thread will be allowed to get the mutex

63084
puts	gets
even if the thread gets the mutex and then calls a function that further modifies the object and gets puts the protector mutex around its own operations the operations should still be safe because they re all happening under a single thread

63084
rtos	threadx
for an example of this kind of mutex see the threadx rtos

63126
firefox	safari
firefox would work but i don t think i can uninstall safari from a mac

63128
16-bit	64bit
long as you probably know in c# is 64bit but in native c++ it ends up as 32-bits or char is unicode 16-bit while in c++ it is 8-bits

63131
getter	setter
right now you have getter and setter but one day you might change them somewhat maybe to do validation or something else

63213
getter	setter
as others have stated unit tests for getter and setter are overkill unless there s conditional logic in your getter and setter

63222
getter	setter
for simple modules that may end up in a toolkit or in an open source type of project you should test as much as possible including the trivial getter and setter

63222
getter	setter
adding getter and setter is minimal code and can be handled without much thought

63224
lisp	scheme
then find an interpreter in plain c for the iphone and one in java for android. scheme lisp and javascript could fit the bill

63248
svg	vml
raphael is a javascript framework for manipulating vector graphics either with svg or vml depending on what the browser supports

63387
dictionary	map
you could create a dictionary to map from textinput - node or you could stash the node in the textinput s data property

63469
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you need to store an integer in memory in your application and you are concerned about the amount of memory used then you could go with int16 since it uses less memeory and has a smaller min max range than int32 which is what int is.

63480
int	boolean
you only need to do the cast if you want the result as a boolean value if you are happy with an int this works

63511
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
version control - there are lots of emacs bindings for various vcs backends cvs sccs rcs svn git all come to mind

63560
vb6	vba
the c# way gives you the right information but the vb way is what users of vba or vb6 will expect

63599
apache	lighttpd
we support apache microsoft iis lighttpd and zeus using php 4.3 or later including php5

63606
rss	feed
you can set up rss feed and see all the revisions et cetera

63679
websphere	ibm
there are 2 jvms for winmo mysaifu for j2se and ibm websphere everyplace micro environment for j2me

63682
folder	directory
but subversion s multitude of .svn directory can get in the way for that not just when searching but in some cases like .d folder poorly designed systems might interpret the .svn folder themselves as containing configuration data

63694
int	double
the fraction can be represented by two int or two double or whatnot

63719
openbsd	freebsd
i am using the out of the box dhcp client on freebsd which is derived from openbsd s and based on the isc s dhclient and this is the out of the box behavior

63720
vmware	esx
we recently migrated the back-end server in our largest office -- new york -- from a msc cluster to a new virtual machine hosted on vmware s esx technology

63782
profiler	aqtime
we do unit testing of all logic code using dunit and use the code coverage profiler included in aqtime to check that all paths through the code are executed by the tests

63812
alloca	malloc
it s also not portable it crashes on solaris but some alloca implementations might return an error here or call malloc

63834
pull	push
guide a friend by phone through installing mercurial tortoisehg creating a repository and setting it up for working together using seperate push his and pull mine repositories - after installing it only once on a windows machine i only run gnu linux

63877
ubuntu	debian
there s also the pv command - available in debian ubuntu repostitories which shows you the throughput of your pipes

63906
dmz	was
the issue i had was that the window.open call would only work within the client network and not on a new web server located in their dmz

63916
rss	feed
in particular i m looking for a relatively easy-to-deploy out-of-the-box solution and would prefer not to hack rss feed together or write too much custom code

63951
post	get	rss	feed
get the users to post there and then use the rss feed from it or the xml rpc blogging api to update the joomla installation

63964
hash	md5
even with really really big spaces like md5 128 bits there are still two strings that can generate the same resulting hash

63967
128bit	64bit
moving to 64bit hashes or even 128bit hashes isn t really the solution though it reduces the probability of a collision

63984
hash	md5
the system.security.cryptography namespace contains multiple classes which can do hashing for you such as md5 which will probably hash them better than you could yourself and will take much less effort

64000
stdout	stderr
when launching a process from java both stderr and stdout can block on output if i don t read from the pipes

64085
getter	setter
the global class simply consists of static getter and setter like so

64097
setlocale	strftime
if so you have to use setlocale and strftime

64118
hash	salt
for example if the only time the cc# will be used is when the user is logged in thin online store type scenario then you can encrypt the cc# with the a hash of the user s plain-text password a per-user salt and a dedicated cc# salt

64142
subtract	add
edit fixed definitions of add and subtract for

64182
hide	show
have a different control for each data set and show hide the controls

64183
stdout	stderr
set the redirecterrorstream property on processbuilder to send stderr output to stdout

64214
hide	show
now the form show to the user in the case of basic operations is simplified to hide away the entries details the accounts are selected among 5 default by the kind of operation requested by the user intialise account - equity to accout spend assets- expenses earn revenues- assets borrow liabilities- assets pay debt assets- liabilities ... i want the entries created from default values

64218
versioning	upgrade
then upgrade to the newest production versioning of rails and view the latest railscasts.com videos

64253
ant	maven
make ant maven or any other build

64360
kde	kubuntu
when i cut kill text in emacs 22.1.1 in its own window on x in kde on kubuntu i can t paste yank it in any other application

64371
accessor	ivar
if you write your own accessor then you just use the underbar ivar in your implementation and keep the non-underbar method name

64376
getter	setter
so from an api evolution point of view it s usually a good idea to bite the bullet and use getter setter

64378
unix	solaris
bouml runs under unix linux solaris macos x power pc and intel and windows

64412
emacs	kate
from the reference to kate i take it you re on linux or similar and probably using emacs in x one way or another.

64421
disk	ram
if you really want to do server side rendering you may want to separate the web server part and the rendering part onto two computers with each configured optimally for their task renderer has opengl card minimal hd and just enough ram server has lots of fast disk lots of ram backups and no opengl

64422
cpu	processors
next you need to know that the fourth number in these lines is a measure of idle time and thus the fourth number on the cpu line is the total idle time for all processors since boot time

64422
cpu	processors
edit remember that when you calculate your process s cpu utilization you have to take into account 1 the number of threads in your process and 2 the number of processors in the system

64446
hash	md5
if you get a positive you could compare the actual data to make sure it s not a false positive - though this would be extremely rare you could go with a quicker hash algorithm like md5 or crc instead of something like sha which is slower but less likely to collide just so it s quick and then compare the actual data when you get a hit

64469
vb.net	vb6
i have a vb6 program that someone recently helped me convert to vb.net

64504
post	get
it should be enough to get you started but if you wish to start getting into processing binary post you re probably going to have to deal with some mime-type content too

64518
inherited	properties
now glade has automatically set the events properties inherited from gtkwidget of that treeview to some value gdk_pointer_motion_mask | gdk_pointer_motion_hint_mask | gdk_button_press_mask | gdk_button_release_mask

64529
versioning	upgrade
everyone should upgrade to the same versioning of nunit

64570
explode	substr
php s explode function returns an array of strings split on some provided substr

64572
xml-rpc	json-rpc
in the rpc field json-rpc will bring a big performance improvement over xml-rpc

64574
posix	getcwd
php is grounded around the standard c library and posix standard and uses many of the same function names strstr getcwd ldap_open etc

64590
ant	maven
do however use maven or ivy for ant builds to keep track of what versions of external libraries your project uses

64596
subtract	add
subtract the height of the old content node from the current scroll position reseting the browser s scroll to the content node s 0 change the node content then add the new node s height to the scroll position

64600
vb.net	vb6
if you re porting vb to vb.net you should probably go ahead and use the datetime.today property rather than the vb6 compatability code

64604
boost	stl
there is also boost while not a gui library boost is a really great complement to c++ s stl

64605
vbscript	jscript
can i call vbscript functions from jscript and vice-versa

64638
vbscript	jscript
edit the specific gotcha of all jscript being executed first then vbscript is related to how asp processes scripts

64643
shibboleth	opensso	cas	opensso	cas	shibboleth
there are a number of open source cross-domain sso packages such as josso opensso cas shibboleth and others

64644
vim	emacs
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

64727
int	double
for value types int double etc. the function receives a copy of the value

64759
tiff	png
ideally i d like to be able to place it like the png tiff or jpg objects with the zend_pdf_image object

64771
innodb	myisam
if it s a myisam table actually this may work with innodb too try issuing a lock table before the delete

64836
punctuation	words
to reduce the chances of inappropriate or offensive words from being generated in english or in the recipientsâ languages i limited runs of consecutive alpha characters to two with numerals or punctuation characters betwee

64836
punctuation	words
using the just the rules above some offensive words are possible now that some numerals and punctuation are substituted for letters

64844
innodb	myisam
myisam innodb and memory are the main ones

64844
innodb	myisam
at the least the candidate should mention that myisam issues a table-level lock whereas innodb uses row-level locking

64876
versioning	upgrade
it is worth the upgrade for me for the main reason that i can target different .net versioning 2 3 3.5 from the same ide whereas in the past one versioning of visual studio supported one versioning of .net

64934
portrait	landscape
orientation -- portrait and landscape for all paper sizes

65079
wideimage	phpthumb
i have good experiences with both phpthumb and wideimage

65079
wideimage	phpthumb
wideimage is the more modern php5 approach while phpthumb has much more features

65117
apache	lighttpd
if you require authorization for download of the music files and assuming that you run lighttpd or apache in front of your zope looking at a solution based on x-sendfile is probably the best option

65130
versioning	upgrade
remember that the ssl level is auto negotiated between the server and the client best encryption used first so you don t necessarily need to disable older versioning but you could pop up a message to the user encouraging them to upgrade

65136
implements	extends
if you extends arrayobject or implements arrayaccess then you can do what you want

65212
mouse	keyboard
this applies to keyboard as well as mouse events onclick etc

65216
fasta	blast
check out blast and fasta

65216
fasta	blast
if you give more information i might be able to direct you to the right variant of blast fasta etc for your purposes

65216
fasta	blast
in any case you might consider adapting blast and fasta for your needs

65305
jquery	scriptaculous
it provides a common distribution network and a loading architecture for jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools and dojo

65379
wordpress	joomla
after learning php might put cms with joomla a blog with wordpress etc..

65420
ubuntu	linux
pd for the ubuntu part you are in luck they say that ubuntu is our linux distro of choice

65423
icomparable	compareto
and then use the compareto method defined by the icomparable interface

65472
bazaar	git
any dvcs bitkeeper git bazaar mercurial etc because being distributed will cut down the load on the central canonical scm server

65510
mouse	keyboard
seems a bit longer than some other methods suggested but i like to do things with the keyboard instead of the mouse

65528
opera	firefox
moreover if your visitors use a higly customisable browser such as firefox or opera there is a high risk that they have either configure their own shortcuts or use additional plug-ins that define some additional ones

65589
16-bit	64bit
a simple solution is to use a 64bit integer where the lower 16-bit is the first vertex coordinate next 16-bit is the second and so on

65603
public	protected
fxcop will detect public protected methods with no upstream callers

65627
children	parent	min	max
most of the columns are the same for the parent and for the children so i d like to show the first value of the group as the summary rather than the max min or avg

65747
client-side	server-side
admittedly this seems to be a client-side approach to a server-side problem but since it s a nice command line program you should be able to capture its output for use fairly easily

65847
perforce	cvs
what i like about perforce say compared to cvs is that the branch management is must more sophisticated but still reasonably easy and you don t need to bug a central bureaucracy to create branches labels and the like

65856
vmware	esx
vmware esx esxi and virtualcenter are supposed to be able to support http put uploads since version 3.5

i m using the vbo extension for storing vertex normals and color buffers glbindbufferarb

65912
firefox	safari
tested in the latest firefox beta and latest safari

65925
ethernet	wireless
configuring them through scutil is no help because it seems that if the wireless or the buildin ethernet interface is inactive basic network functions don t seem to work

65925
ubuntu	linux
in linux for example ubuntu it is possible to turn off the wireless adapter without turning of the network capabilities

65938
imagemagick	graphicsmagick	imagemagick	magick++	magick++	graphicsmagick
using graphicsmagick or imagemagick along with magick++ you can then use imagick

all the files are sitting in an xfs filesystems mounted on a linux server over iscsi

65962
avr	microcontroller
i m using it to unit test c microcontroller code for avr

66017
client-side	server-side
you can generate the xslt server-side even if the transformation is client-side

66042
many-to-many	one-to-many
my company has lots of schemas which operate on exactly this basis - indeed our object-relational framework creates them automatically to manage many-to-many relationships and sometimes even for one-to-many relationships depending on how we model them

66122
division	modulo
division and modulo are your friends

66221
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
modern browsers either don t appear to support sslv2 at all google-chrome opera 9.52 firefox or have it disabled by default ie7 ie8

66228
public	protected
if you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy

66259
hash	hmac
here s what i do use a strong checksum cryptographic hash or hmac and prepend it to your plaintext before encrypting

66307
int	double
such as int and double export

66356
punctuation	words
there seems to be a catch-22 in that you must tokenize a field with an analyzer in order to strip punctuation and stop words but you can t sort on tokenized fields

66401
accessor	properties
vb.net if you send an object via a properties s get accessor into a function with a byref keyword it will actually attempt to update the object using the set accessor for the properties

66438
switching	screens
i ve noticed that on some devices when i switching from one canvas to another e.g from the main menu to the game the screens momentarily flickers

66455
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
even more important i d like to change it globally so the new behavior applies to jtextfield jpasswordfield jformattedtextfield jtextarea jcombobox jspinner and so on

66494
division	modulo
at a basic level what you want to do is define an array of image names then take the number of days from a given point in time then modulo remainder after division by the number of images and access that index in the array and set the image untested code

66535
awt	swing
keep in mind that the opengl paradigm is quite different from swing awt or the java 2d api

66546
accessor	properties
the exact same properties accessor code pasted into every one of my implementations

66574
imagemagick	mogrify
if you can guarantee the presence of imagemagick you can use their mogrify -flop command

66577
awt	swing
jogl provides full access to the apis in the opengl 2.0 specification as well as nearly all vendor extensions and integrates with the awt and swing widget sets

66602
subclass	abstract-class
obs. do not use a field in an abstract-class that should be initiated in a subclass like david b suggestion

66605
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger secondary click

66605
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
set system preferences keyboard mouse trackpad to use two finger screen zoom for magnifying an area in the screen by holding the control key and scrolling up or down

66647
swt	swing
just keep in mind that swing swt and opengl are generally used for entirely different things

66654
qtkit	quicktime
i m trying to convert old quicktime framework code to the 64-bit cocoa-based qtkit on os x which means that i can t drop down to the straight c function calls at any time

66654
qtkit	quicktime
specifically i m trying to find a way to write quicktime vr movies with qtkit as they require some special metadata to set the display controller

66678
decimal	ieee
floats were according to ieee 754 always binary only the new standard ieee 754r defined decimal formats

66680
ilist	ienumerator
alternatively you could write your own implementation of ilist and ienumerator that allows the kind of parallel access you need

66719
post	get
if you can t get it to clip with html or move with the javascript post the simplest demonstration of the problem here for us to debug

66728
collabnet	svn
the svn 1.5 packages available for etch are 1.4 and i really need the cool new merge tracking feature in svn1.5 according to collabnet its as good as clearcase...an interesting statement in oh so many ways

66728
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a test versioning of lenny

66741
folder	directory
it s the same basic concept but supports transactional backups if the update goes wrong in the middle by storing each checkout in a separate folder and symlinking the latest to your www directory

66745
jar	war
each module is packageable as a jar or a war in the case of the web module and thus allows for easier code reuse we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project

66771
capitalize	capitalization
you may not want to change the capitalization -- different cultures capitalize different words for example in german you capitalize every noun not just proper nouns

66799
put	get
using this method could get painful though you could put it all into a shell script and it doesn t allow you to pass variables in the same way eg won t work

66852
dlsym	dlopen
a standard-ish api is the dlopen dlsym api

66861
post	get
my guess is that one is a straight http get post request the other soap over http s

66873
accurev	cvs	accurev	rcs	cvs	rcs	perforce	accurev	perforce	cvs
i ve used bitkeeper clearcase accurev perforce subversion cvs sccs and rcs and out of all of those bitkeeper was far and above the best

66876
maven	buildr
if you want dependency management for java-like libraries maven is the canonical choice but i personally like buildr a lot better

66930
accessor	properties
one nice thing about this approach is because managed c++ is a .net language you get to expose accessor as properties __property

66937
chown	chmod
another option is that she will do chown nobody and chmod +s on your binary executable and you ll be able to execute it directly

66963
solaris	bsd
chartdirector is available for lots of platforms win linux solaris bsd osx and has an api for lots of languages too perl asp .net java php python ruby c++

66982
post	get
in order to get a good answer for this you ll have to post the code

67048
post	put
it uses a post not a put but the technique is practically identical

67063
getter	setter
but when there s complex calculations or database involved we should use a getter setter

67085
getter	setter
when it gets compiled it turns out to be getter setter functions either way

67093
innodb	myisam
this needs to work with innodb which stores things very differently than myisam

67110
cvs	svn
so all files that aren t checked out would be marked as read only if you are using vss not sure about svn cvs etc

67215
getter	setter
also my instinct like yours is to use getter and setter as a signal that a process may be long-running spawn threads or do some other non-trivial work

67215
getter	setter
also if a setter has non-obvious prerequisites in the class i might use a getter or setter instead since people rarely read documentation on properties and properties are expected to be accessable at all times

67217
getter	setter
forget the getter and setter methods

67217
getter	setter
an interesting thing to mention is that properties are ending up as setter and or getter method s in the assembly

67217
getter	setter
setter and or getter become a property just by a little bit of metadata

67217
getter	setter
so in fact properties setter getter methods

67227
folder	directory
you have the files in your local directory the so called working copy and one in the repository which can be located in another local folder or on another machine usually accessed over the network

67259
pyopengl	pyglet
i mention pyglet instead of pure pyopengl because pyglet handles a lot of ugly opengl stuff transparently with no effort on your part

67275
outputstream	inputstream	outputstream	zipinputstream
if i don t try copying the file into another inputstream via the outputstream mentioned above and just pass the zipinputstream to my 3rd party library the library closes the stream and i can t do anything more like dealing with the remaining files in the stream

67308
division	modulo
you don t do division modulo to get the digits in production code firstly because it s suboptimal your cpu is designed for binary arithmetics not decimal and secondly because it s unintuitive

67312
addition	multiplication
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

67378
free	malloc
what i have done to solve this is to override the malloc new free delete operators such that they keep track in a data structure as much as possible about the operation you are performing

67483
jobs	cron
i also have several page watcher scripts running on cron jobs that use regular expressions to check that the website is rendering key pages properly

67547
extjs	mootools
performance-wise they are all pretty close however mootools dojo extjs and prototype all run faster in my environment

67622
switching	screens
the flicker is probably caused by the app attempting to draw to the screens while the switching of the canvas is still ongoing

67626
opera	google-chrome
works better with opera and google-chrome though

67640
vim	emacs	vim	bbedit
i m not looking for solutions with vim or emacs nor editors like bbedit that support syntax highlighting but a full fledged ide with

67659
inherited	properties
i think that if within my dbml file i set the isdiscriminator properties of the isroot column then my rootpage class will inherited the page class

67682
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
target browsers ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera safari

67687
textmate	bbedit
textmate is an editor like bbedit but it has the ability to run commands such as compilation debugging refactoring though it will do so via xcode

67700
mp3	flv
most flv audio is encoded in the mp3 format meaning you can extract it directly from the flv container

67700
mp3	flv
i d check out libavcodec which handles flv mp3 nellymoser natively and should let you get to the audio

67714
ssl	https
an https or secure sockets layer ssl certificate is served for a site and is typically signed by a certificate authority ca which is effectively a trusted 3rd party that verifies some basic details about your site and certifies it for use in browsers

67714
submit	submission
strictly speaking if you are submission a form it doesn t matter if the form page itself is not encrypted as long as the submit url goes to an https url

67751
calloc	malloc
if you want to allocate a block and initialize it to 0 use calloc which is like malloc only with initialization an an element size parameter which you set to 1 if you want to emulate malloc

67764
mp3	wav
i ve got a project converting wav files actually asterisk voice mails into mp3 s

67764
mp3	wav
i have a web process written in php to actually convert the files from wav to mp3 on the web server s local file system actually php is just supervising the command-line sox tool via exec

67878
google-chrome	safari
your example works as expected in google-chrome safari windows and ie8

67878
opera	firefox
the text breaks out of the 150px box in firefox 3 and opera 9.5

67952
rss	feed
if you re on .net 3.5 you now got built-in support for syndication feed rss and atom

67995
rss	feed
the best way to grab an rss feed as the requested string would be to use the system.net.httpwebrequest class

68078
textview	imageview
each of these tabs is also a view and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label it s almost certainly some other viewgroup maybe a linearlayout but it doesn t matter that contains an imageview and a textview

68186
folder	directory
i usually name the copied directory v1.0 or whatever is appropriate and keep them all in a folder that is the main project name

68199
client-side	server-side
this is generally not a problem for long-running server-side applications but is a serious problem for client-side software and applications run on smaller devices with limited capabilities

68208
postgresql	mysql
i m assuming you re referring to indexing tables on a relational dbms like mysql oracle or postgresql

68225
getter	setter
private variables that are exposed as public getter setter properties and do get serialized deserialized as such through those properties

68253
cvs	rcs
sccs rcs cvs subversion teamware

68253
bazaar	perforce
clearcase perforce and bazaar

68314
pascal	delphi
why because in previous versions of delphi the typed constants were assignable by default to preserve compatibility with older versions where they were always writable delphi 1 up to early pascal

68362
yacc	bison
don t try to use yacc or bison with a context-sensitive grammar they are far to strict to express such concepts easily

68367
vim	emacs
i believe that cscope can be configured to work with vim and emacs although i ve seen people use other editors also

68369
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
i would recommend a distributed version control system mercurial git bazaar darcs rather than a centralized version control system cvs svn

68387
vim	geany
i usually just use vim but i ve actually found the ide geany quite intuitive with a lot of good features but not really overblown

68400
udp	tcp
dev tcp and dev udp

68511
metaphone	soundex
sounds like you re looking for a phonetic-based algorithms such as soundex nysiis or double metaphone

68548
put	get
this is not as big as what is being done in the real world but it a fun project and i am having a lot of fun doing it and if i can get it quite advance in the next month i will probably put in on sourceforge

68610
firefox	safari
in firefox 2 3 and safari everything work fine but for some reason the text doesn t appear centered in ie 6 or 7

68652
ienumerable	ilist
this is certainly doable by creating a custom ienumerable object with perhaps an integer index but only if you can control all access to your ilist object for locking and maintaining the state of your enumeration

68673
qtkit	quicktime
here s hoping that quicktime x will have a more fully featured qtkit set of apis

68674
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

68679
bazaar	git
for the second question well try some good dvcs git mercurial bazaar and see if any can help you

68694
dns	spf
if your email is business critical then you need to get a dedicated server with a white-hat hosting company control over dns to set up your spf senderid record and to register with the hotmail aol and yahoo postmasters for whitelisting and feedback loops

68725
stdout	stderr
it allows to easily verify the stdout and stderr and the exit value of programs

68807
ubuntu	linux
but i teach a first semester linux admin course in which we install configure several distributions and i usually start with ubuntu since it s generally the smoothest and requires minimal tweaking after the install

68821
hide	show
i want to dynamically hide show some of the columns in a nstableview based on the data that is going to be displayed - basically if a column is empty i d like the column to be hidden

68831
post	get
this instructs iis to pass all requests for example_link_list.axd via post and get to the processrequest method of myproject.mytinymce class in myassembly assembly the name of your .dll

68871
mouse	keyboard
you ll also want to get rid of all your built-in events such as onenterframe and you ll want to take a close look at nontrivial mouse interaction such as dragging and keyboard interaction such as detecting whether a key is pressed

68928
x86	mips
depending on the cpu architecture arguments can be passed in registers for example a0 through a3 on mips or by pushing them onto the stack as in the original x86 calling convention

69040
actionscript	mxml
mxmlc an actionscript and mxml compiler to output the final swf file for deployment to flash player

69040
actionscript	mxml
mxml is actually converted to actionscript during the compilation process

69045
django	web2py
i m really new on python but i tried quiet a few specially django and web2py

69080
cpu	processors
it seems that you are referring to x86 processors family that is not built with real-time systems in mind so there is no real guarantee for constant time execution cpu may reorder micro-instructions than there is branch prediction and instruction prefetch queue which is flushed each time when cpu wrongly predicts conditional jumps...

69104
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

69156
min	max
the built-in summary functions for sum min max avg and count all return a number containing the summary data

69304
decoder	encoder
the biggest area i ve run into problems with the xmlencoder decoder solution is if you have a bean that returns an immutable list for one of it s properties - the encoder doesn t handle that situation very well

69335
typedef	struct
the c++ open type dialog not only allows incremental filtering by type but also selecting of definition .h or declaration .cpp and even filtering by element type typedef struct class etc

69474
width	height
note after a bit more thought - you d need to have these covers be linked so clicking on them would take you to where the tab was supposed to which means you could should do this with the anchor element set to display box width and height set as well as the transparent background image

69482
yacc	bison
contrary to other contributors i say you should play with simpler parser generators like yacc and bison first and only when you get burned because you can t do something with that tool should you go on to try to build something with an ll parser like antlr

69516
bazaar	git
git mercurial bazaar darcs

69545
richfaces	icefaces
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

69581
cvs	svn
this is framed in terms of alternatives to cvs rather than to svn but no matter - it lists several alternatives including other non-distributed ones

69603
vb.net	vb6
we re currently making pdfs this way vb6 app drops a record into sql with filename create date user and final destination and the xls or doc gets moved into a server directory share and the server has a vb.net service that has a filewatcher monitoring that directory

69616
imperative	declarative
for the second and third persons will is declarative while shall is imperative while the first person is the reverse

69714
put	get
i personally use emacs for editing xml but i m willing to put up with the learning curve of the editor for the sheer power it gives me - editing xml is now rather easy and painless for me but it took me a bit to get it to that point

69718
getter	setter
generate getter and setter

69817
redmine	trac
other options here are trac or redmine

69825
put	get	super	extends
the get and put principle use an extends wildcard when you only get values our of a structure use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure and don t use a wildcard you both get and put

69854
x86	64bit
you can t convert adobe s activex control to 64bit yourself but you can force your application to run in 32bit mode by setting the platform target to x86

69898
google-chrome	safari
google s google-chrome uses the webkit rendering engine which is what safari uses

69935
next	except
the next byte would be similarly processed except the offsets would be 16 and 20 respectively since that byte is 8 bits down

69948
swt	swing
to expand slightly on my answer we were using swt not swing so ymmv

69989
post	get
you d have to add ssl as all methods post get and http auth well except digest hhtp authentication send plaintext

69989
post	get
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

69995
post	get
in some senses there s no real security difference between get and post requests as they both go across in plaintext in other senses and in practice.

69995
kerberos	ldap
or as suggested by the other posters use a different method entirely like http auth digest auth or some higher level authentication scheme like ad ldap kerberos or shib

70046
jsf	seam
they basically abstract all the sql jpa in a seam component that jsf can easily use

70083
installation	upgrade
there are plenty of 3rd-party addons for different payment-providers and other things and the built-in download-manager handles the installation of these as well as upgrade to the core code really well

70136
hash	md5
2 in a client-server aplication with direct connection with the db to compare the user sent password to the application not the db user password hash with md5 so that the password not travel by the net in plain text

70204
client-side	server-side
you can either do this server-side or client-side

70261
vb6	vba
unfortunately you can t use a vb6 vba function as a callback directly as vb6 only generates stdcall functions rather than the cdecl functions sqlite expects

70275
128bit	64bit
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p 64bit vector of input values vector a - 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 0g 0h 0i 0j 0k 0l 0m 0n 0o 0p 128bit vector of indices vector b

70296
hide	show
however if you remove the parameter to application.run then the application will be started with no form show and you will be free to show and hide forms as much as you like

70299
daemons	systemd
on the systemd you are initiating the transfer from you can run an ssh-agent daemons and add the private half of the key to the agent

70375
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

70375
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

70375
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

70384
vim	emacs
vim is rapidly turning into the emacs of the new century

70402
quicksort	mergesort
they re both o nlogn and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort

70421
mergesort	in-place
is in-place mergesort requires extra memory linear to number of elements to be sorted

70423
quicksort	heapsort
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70427
quicksort	mergesort
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons

70428
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort and heapsort and can be

70430
quicksort	mergesort
i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is î n that quicksort implementations don t have

70440
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440
quicksort	mergesort
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70440
quicksort	mergesort
i personally often will use mergesort or a quicksort variant that degrades to mergesort when quicksort does poorly

70452
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
i d like to add that of the three algoritms mentioned so far mergesort quicksort and heapsort only mergesort is stable

70471
getter	setter
however i can also swear that i have seen property getter setter code in java in one codebase but i cannot remember where

70501
regasm	tlbexp
when using regasm or tlbexp from the .net 2.0 sdk to create a com type library for the containing assembly i get the following warning

70522
public	protected
therefore the rule of thumb is to try to define static nested class with as limited scope as possible private class protected public and then convert it to inner class by removing static identifier and loosen the scope if it s really necessary

70527
getter	setter
if you re using eclipse then it has the capabilities to auto generate the getter and setter method for the internal attributes it can be a usefull and timesaving tool

70531
loops	if-statement
shell for simple batching of commands with perhaps a loops or an if-statement

70535
getter	setter
there is a standard pattern for getter and setter in java called bean properties

70548
getter	setter
most ides for java will automatically generate getter and setter code for you if you want them to

70548
getter	setter
eclipse even includes automated refactoring that will allow you to wrap a property up in a getter and setter and it will modify all the code that accesses the property directly to make it use the getter and or setter

70561
switching	screens
if it s an old crt imac then you can t switching off the screens without switching the computer off - the convection from the crt is used to cool the processor

70627
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

70653
django	turbogears
i have found several method in web framework such as django or turbogears

70687
implements	extends
such a declaration creates a new instance of an unnamed class which extends object and implements interfacename

70687
implements	extends
if you want a local inner class which implements multiple interfaces or which implements interfaces while extends some class other than object or which specifies its own constructor you re stuck creating a regular named local inner class

70723
yacc	bison
yacc bison definitely gives you a leg up since good linting would require parsing the program

70772
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you want a reliable iteratior order there s linkedhashmap and treemap

70848
openbsd	linux
in linux and openbsd popen produces unidirectional pipes which are read-only or write-only

70848
freebsd	netbsd
on os x freebsd and netbsd popen produces bidirectional pipes

70851
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	multiplication	exponent	addition	multiplication	exponent	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	exponent	division	multiplication
the traditional bodmas brackets orders division multiplication addition subtraction or pedmas parentheses exponent division multiplication addition subtraction are just subsets of all the possible operations and denote the order that such operations should be applied in

70881
addition	multiplication
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

70900
superclass	subclassing
the name scrambling is used to ensure that subclassing don t accidentally override the private methods and attributes of their superclass

70916
jruby	rubinius
the work done by the jruby and rubinius teams in creating a ruby spec is probably the most important outcome so far as it will help ensure that all implementations remain compatible

70945
yacc	bison
antlr looks to be an alternative path to the more common ok i heard about them before yacc bison approach which it turns out also commonly use lex flex as a front end

70991
width	height
you ll encounter a very subtle problem here because most video and audio formats especially in ordinary containers use global headers meaning at the start of the file they have a single header which specifies compression information like width height etc for the whole file

unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	irix	solaris	aix
we have a collection of commercial mfc c++ applications which we sell using stingray objective toolkit we have source code license and have ported it in the past to solaris irix hp-ux aix using bristol technologies windu windows api on unix including mfc

71105
verilog	hdl
ladder logic can be transformed to one of the modern hdl s like verilog

71118
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in almost all browsers firefox ie google-chrome but whenever the page is opened in ie it prompts javascript error like

71150
folder	directory
i just found it out myself if you add a trailing backslash to the project folder setting changing it from c dev to c dev the vsmacros80 directory will no longer be created

71152
prepare	execute
it offers features like prepare + execute emulation for dbs that don t support it properly and allows you to use placeholders which is good practice to avoid sql injection problems

71152
postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
it will work with mysql mysqli postgresql postgresql oci8 oracle sqllite msql mssql microsoft sql server sybase informix fbsql ibase odbc

71171
ant	cruisecontrol	nant	cruisecontrol
you might want to use a combination of cruisecontrol or cruisecontrol.net and ant or nant

71190
nunit	mstest
you can unit test your clr code inside of vs using any of the standard unit testing frameworks nunit mstest and you don t have to write a bunch of set up and tear down scripts that can be difficult to manage

71196
ubuntu	linux
i use it with eclipse in linux ubuntu and fedora core windows xp and mac os x.5

71214
free	malloc
it emulates your program and intercepts calls to malloc free etc

71242
google-chrome	safari
there are anti-aliasing differences between safari 3.1 and google-chrome for whatever that s worth

71322
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera safari google-chrome all work

71336
notepad++	jedit
jedit was kinda big in 2004 but now notepad++ seems to have taken the lead on windows

71397
vim	emacs
you can easily do things in vim in the normal course of editing that would require you to drop down to scripting in emacs

71406
bazaar	git
at least hg bazaar and git can use external merge utilities

71412
emacs	jedit
other than that i m quite happy with jedit - it s the best general editor i ve found so far for linux ducks as hordes of vi and emacs users light up their flame cannons

71475
folder	directory
when the user clicks one of the those items the contents of the related directory are zipped in place and the resulting zip file is stored in a cache folder

71477
google-chrome	firefox
strangely firefox google-chrome does not prompt error but ie does which is bit different than what it used to be

71482
put	get
put on some music close down your email and get busy

71491
rss	feed
the most difficult part i think is extraction of meaningful information from web pages if it isn t available as rss or atom feed

71511
google-chrome	firefox
sorry firefox google-chrome both report this error but in very silent way

71511
google-chrome	firefox
you need to go to firefox 3.0 javascript errors dialog to see if is there any error and for google-chrome you need to go to javascript console

71511
google-chrome	firefox
in my view there should be at least some ui indications like icon would turn red for such errors in firefox 3.0 as well as google-chrome

71582
jboss	glassfish
if you need to support more than one app server or eventually want the option to move from jboss to glassfish etc. you will essentially be carrying your container spring with you rather than relying on compatibility between different implementations of the ejb3 specification

71642
textmate	jedit
i also paid for textmate and ultraedit at different times both very good but in the end jedit comes out on top for me

71743
tapestry	sitemesh
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

71743
tapestry	sitemesh
tapestry components can take other components as parameters which allows the sitemesh style wrapping

71750
opera	safari
fyi this hack only targets safari 3 and also targets opera 9

71786
notepad++	jedit
the most highly recommended editors are jedit and notepad++

71790
httphandler	httpmodule
you could use an httphandler instead of an httpmodule

71794
mktime	strftime
if you want to continue with awk then the mktime and strftime functions are useful

71815
kate	nano
until now all work on the codebase has been done purely with nano or perhaps kate

71826
versioning	upgrade
firstly the different versioning of oracle you re using is the reason for the table statistics error - i had the same issue when some of our oracle 10g databases got upgrade to release 2 and some were still on release 1 and i was swapping .dmp files between them

71892
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if you are trying to make a site cross browser compliant i d recommend writing the site to look good in safari firefox opera using correct css and then making changes for ie using conditional css includes in ie

71929
ndepend	fxcop
corey my answer of using fxcop had assumed you were interested in removing unused private members however to solve the problem with other cases you can try using ndepend

71937
rss	feed
email co-workers scrums rss feed twitter lunch coffee breaks etc

71970
post	get
when you want to display your front page you just get the top n post from your database based on that score

71977
notepad++	jedit	emacs	jedit
something like vi is great emacs is also fine or if you absolutely must be on windows something like notepad++ or jedit will be decent

71987
client-side	server-side
it has a good client-side and server-side api and it provides a progress bar for big file uploads

72006
n-gram	words
there are a few ways you can also pay some attention to n-gram strings of two or more words kept in order

72035
post	get
here s a couple blog post to get you started down the path

72073
width	height
i found that setting height 0 width 0 worked the same as hidden true and solved the problem

72126
metaclass	subclassing
you could then wrap this up in a metaclass to make it easier for people who are subclassing

72129
inherited	properties
if this is a user control i would recommend renaming the properties so you don t hide the inherited member

72444
free	malloc
i ve changed the code to use malloc free

72464
google-chrome	safari
in safari the password label and input box are directly below the email label and input box while in google-chrome the password label and input box are indented approximately 75 pixels to the right

72543
cruisecontrol	teamcity
change cruisecontrol for jetbrains teamcity

72586
ant	emma
better to just use emma on its own via ant if required

72599
int	chars
if all that is visible is the forward declaration the translation unit can t know what storage size will have been chosen - it could be a chars or an int or something else

72633
int	double
but as you already have a working c# code porting it to actionscript might requires a redesign due to actionscript having a different way of thinking programming they use different primitive data types for example they use just a number instead of int float double etc

72651
pop-up	dialog
you then have the choice of showing just a small pop-up window below the property area or a full blown dialog box

72658
eurekalog	madexcept
there do exist a few libraries that can help you in analyzing runtime exceptions like madexcept jcldebug and eurekalog

72698
int	chars
the ascii int code for these chars would be out of the normal alphabetic ranges

72709
eurekalog	madexcept
as previous commenters wrote you can also add a mother of all exception handlers like madexcept or eurekalog to catch the uncaught

72760
unsigned	short
in visual studio 2008 you may get a compiler error because bstr is defined as a pointer to unsigned short while wchar_t is a native type

72826
getter	setter
basically it generates a superclass with the getter setter and many other code generation options

72888
capitalize	substr
however if you are not working with a .net langauge then it depends on what the input looks like - if you have two separate fields for the first name and the last name then you can just capitalize the first letter lower the rest of it using substr

72942
stdout	stderr
enable tracing logging in all third party apps and libraries you are using such that the errors are logged to files instead of stdout or stderr

72951
versioning	upgrade
i did and i even upgrade from 2.x versioning to 3.x

73003
object-pascal	delphi
i know i m being a stickler but delphi is the ide object-pascal is the language and vcl is the graphical framework

73008
submit	submission
unfortunately we can t submit the information in chunks during each form submission so we have to store it the users session until the end of the process and submit it all at the same time

73021
ada	pascal
in c++ ada pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference you can actually change the variable that was passed

73065
mouseover	mousedown
this has the advantage that normal win32 forms functionality will continue to work such as taskbar-flashing of the form when you click on one of its modal dialogs or the management of mouseover mousedown events would still work normally etc

73101
google-chrome	safari
i ve got a psp it has a browser that s based on webkit also google-chrome and safari use webkit engine so pretty any site that works fine on safari google-chrome will work fine on psp

73101
opera	safari
so generally if you want to target mobile devices you will have to make sure your ecommerce website works fine in small resolutions it doesn t use activex since it won t work on iphone safari opera mini and psp browser etc

73104
client-side	server-side
it depends on whether you want to do client-side or server-side paging

73109
innodb	myisam
the error shows up using both myisam and innodb table engines

73112
public	protected
public protected and then private and within each section alphabetically although i often list constructor first and deconstructor last

73134
free	malloc
would i be better off changing this code to use malloc and free instead

73150
snmp	mib
if that is not possible then it is okay to use oids as they should not change per the snmp mib guidelines

73150
snmp	mib
this is obvious but be sure to look at the attributes of the snmp mib variable

73157
free	malloc
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors

73195
getter	setter
getter and setter are uninteresing mostly so there is no need to read them

73202
yacc	bison
bison is readily available and at least on linux yacc is usually implemented as bison

73219
free	malloc
just small addition if you don t have any constructor or and distructors so you basically need allocate and free a chunk of raw memory consider using free malloc pair

73295
free	malloc
rather than switching to malloc free if only because it s a simpler change to make without making mistakes

73295
free	malloc
so i guess it s probably as easy to switch to malloc free after all

73318
class-method	delegation
creating an object of type delegation actually creates a variable which can hold functions -- be they lambdas static methods or class-method

73352
width	height
if you really want the image to stretch to fit you can go a little further and add an image into that div and define its style to fit width height 100

73381
hide	show
then simply hide the part that is filled out and show the next part of the form.

73418
xslt	xquery
you can tell tidy to generate xhtml which is a type of xml which means you can use all the usual xml tools like xslt and xquery on the results

73519
boost	stl
i would like to remove stl boost debug symbols from libraries and executable for two reasons

73519
boost	stl
debugging jumps into stl boost code which is annoying

73574
ssl	https
ssl..or rather https http over ssl sends all http content over ssl and as http content and headers are in fact the same thing this means the headers are encrypted as well

73574
post	get
seeing as get and post data is sent via http headers then it only makes sense then when sending data securely you wouldn t just want the response code or content to be encrypted

73621
ethernet	wireless
you need to have a default route which would either be your ethernet or wireless

73670
tunnel	vpn
one caveat with modifying routes - vpn tunnel are not too happy about chnages in static routes once the vpn is set up so be sure to set it up at windows boot up after the nics are initialized through some scripting

73670
tunnel	vpn
static routes- these will work fine unless you are using a vpn tunnel

73688
tolower	toupper
so you are gonna have to call toupper on the first char and tolower on the remaining characters

73722
ssl	https
yes if you are using the https http over ssl protocol instead of plain http

73745
put	get
after a couple years i don t get all the files off that i put on them

73747
getter	setter
it will be true for property getter and setter

73750
spaces	delimiter
i have two functions one is called numstringparts which returns the number of parts in a string with a specific delimiter in your case above the spaces and getstrpart returns the specific part from a string with a specific delimiter

73763
serializable	deserialization
when you also want to be able to serializable your object you need to make sure that deserialization won t create a copy

73863
cvs	rcs
because cvs uses rcs it can only store successive full copies of a changing binary file

73870
client-side	server-side
your choice depends on several different factors including whether you want the work done client-side most javascript frameworks or server-side echo2 etc.

73915
inherited	properties
if the properties you try is inherited or overridden from object then this works for any class

73946
vsto	add-in
the advantage to a range becomes apparent when you are working with large amounts of data because vsto add-in are hosted outside the boundaries of the excel application itself so all calls to excel have to be passed through a layer with overhead

73986
postgresql	mysql
you can start with a desktop tool like microsoft access or use the free sql server express or postgresql or mysql

74003
kde	gnome
gnome will generally look in the kde icon directory to see if there are other icons there also..

74063
submit	submission
when they submit the score you can check they ve actually got an open game and they re not submission a score too soon or too large

74236
free	malloc
looking at the source it appears that someone did a search and replace for malloc and free and the above is the result

74288
width	height
this fills out a provided xwindowattributes structure which includes integers for the x and y position of the window as well as its width and height and other useful facts

74316
int	chars
if possible i try to match my source code file with me header files but generally it s if void a uses int b chars foo than int b chars foo comes first

74327
free	malloc
this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free

74368
gmail	hotmail
i am trying to create an email two column flexible layout which works in outlook 07 i have created a successful version in outlook 03 hotmail gmail yahoo and aol in both ie and mozilla firefox however when testing in outlook 07 it strips out my float left css

74372
solaris	aix
i am involved in the process of porting a system containing several hundreds of ksh scripts from aix solaris and hpux to linux

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux the output is flag true on linux the output is flag false

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux ksh is a variant of ksh88

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux dtksh and ksh93 where i have them installed are consistent with ksh

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and linux bash is consistent giving the incorrect from my perspective result of flag false

74406
postgresql	mysql
starting with a proper database like oracle or sql server or mysql postgresql if you are looking for free options is a good idea

74409
svg	vml
i m starting to think that it would be a simpler though less flexible to just use the free svg continent maps on wikipedia convert them to png and create an image map of all the countries - then use canvas and vml to draw an element on top of the countries - but this just seems like a huge pain and very error-prone compared to a flash solution

74425
rss	feed
probably the easiest solution is to just have the images uploaded to flickr edited in picnik built into flickr now and then loaded onto the users site using either the flickr rss feed or apis

74446
solaris	aix
aix and solaris use versions of the original ksh so the kornshell.org version is usually feature- and bug- complete

74446
solaris	sunos
having cut my teeth with sunos solaris installing kornshell.org ksh is usually one of the first things i do on a new linux box.

74448
hash	salt
this page returns two values a randomly generated salt value and a cryptographic hash of that salt value combined with the shared secret

74448
hash	salt
the flash game combines the salt value with the shared secret and calculates a hash to verify that this matches the one provided by the server

74448
hash	salt
the flash game combines the salt value with the shared secret high score value and any other relevant information nickname ip timestamp and calculates a hash

74448
post	get
it then sends this information back to the php backend via http get or post along with the salt value high score and other information

74483
inherited	properties
phrogram includes support for class-based programming with methods and properties - but that s only encapsulation not inherited or polymorphism

74605
hash	salt
this was a common issue in unix many years ago and was resolved by separating the user identity components username uid shell full name etc. from the authentication components password hash password hash salt

74612
width	margin
edit unfortunately i can t hard-code the width as i m dynamically generating the html and it includes nesting the divs recursively inside each other with left margin on each div this creates a nice nested effect

74668
fortify	checkmarx
these include fortify and ouncelabs expensive and for many languages visualstudio.net codeanalysis for .net and c++ free with vsts decent but not great owasp s lapse for java free decent not great checkmarx not cheap fantastic tool for .net and java but high overhead and many more

74675
stdout	stderr
the script can print to stdout or stderr and that output should be visible to you in the visual studio build output window the window that usually shows stuff like build 3 succeeded 0 failed

74688
zipoutputstream	zipfile
you can use java s zipfile and zipentry classes to read the contents of a jar file then use zipoutputstream to create a new one

74689
rss	feed
one of the usefull tool is rss feed reader

74715
width	margin
a guideline though is if you set width on an element don t set margin or padding on the same element

74752
rss	feed
like you say most sites have a rss feed today

74752
post	get
get a rss reader that sync between computers if you use more than one computer so you don t have to mark alot of post as read

74756
versioning	upgrade
when you need to upgrade to a new versioning of the library just reference the new file name versioning from the relevant pages

74782
eruby	erb
my plan is to template the config files using embedded ruby via either eruby or erb within the source files to do things like iteratively generate all the interface config blocks for a router these blocks are all very similar differing only in a label and an ip address

74782
eruby	erb
which when run through an embedded ruby interpreter either erb or eruby produces the following output

74807
eruby	erb
erb is pure ruby eruby is written in c so it s a bit faster

74823
eruby	erb
eruby is an external executable while erb is a library within ruby

74823
eruby	erb
it is more common to use erb simply because it is more flexible but i ll admit that i have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute .rhtml files for quick little utility websites

74857
perl	tcl
according to this vim-enhanced is just vim with the perl python tcl and cscope options compiled in. you should be able to find everything you need to know about these compile options in the documentation

74913
width	margin
microsoft lost and now it s either width or margin padding border for an element

74921
jquery	scriptaculous
i tried prototype and scriptaculous first but then switched to jquery and there is no looking back

74931
postgresql	mysql
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

74951
width	height
so i followed the technique suggested and it only works if i explicitly set the width height on the proxy image

74971
yacc	cup
i would imagine you could use tools like lex flex cup antlr or yacc or their equivalents for whatever programming language you are using

74992
bash	zsh
i don t have experience with ksh but i have used both bash and zsh

74992
bash	zsh
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

75015
put	get
put all the ideas together and you might get a model-t.

75021
fpdf	fpdi	tcpdf	fpdi	tcpdf	fpdf
so if you want place another pdf inside another dynamically generated pdf document like an image use fpdi + fpdf tcpdf

75051
profiler	yourkit
the yourkit java profiler is an excellent commercial solution

75114
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
most unix systems like solaris aix and hpux have ksh as default

75118
fflush	gets
caveat like with using cfheader cfcontent you need to do this before the cache gets fflush to the browser since it s basically doing the same thing without having to store the file

75166
width	height
the methods for detecting screen width and height are accurate for all handsets in my experience

75185
folder	directory
enter that as the only content in your index.php in your root directory and any requests sent to that folder will then redirect the user to the forum

75193
vim	emacs
i remember when i first started learning emacs it was after i was already very comfortable with vim and i was in the same or similar boat that you were where i knew how to get a lot done in another editor so as i started using emacs it was always painfully slow

75205
put	get
synchronizing via collections.synchronizedxxx won t do good since it does not guarantee iterator safety it only synchronizes writes and reads via put get set .

75238
int	chars
on most platforms signed chars will be an 8-bit two s complement number ranging from -128 to 127 and unsigned chars will be an 8-bit unsigned int 0 to 255

75261
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for jmm

75280
int	chars
if you want to use a chars as a small int the safest way to do it is with the int8_t and uint8_t types

75319
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
in most cases public apis will expose ilist or icollection or ienumerable as appropriate

75491
vim	emacs
you can edit it with emacs or vim or eclipse or whatever you are most comfortable with

75495
width	height
when creating a usercontrol in wpf i find it convenient to give it some arbitrary height and width values so that i can view my changes in the visual studio designer

75495
width	height
when i run the control however i want the height and width to be undefined so that the control will expand to fill whatever container i place it in

75517
wordpress	joomla
you should look into setting up wordpress or some other blogging engine and then simply have joomla consume the content and display it in the joomla site

75527
width	height
this will set the design height and width to 500 and 600 respectively

75574
onenote	ms-office
but if you use ms ms-office you shall explore ms-office onenote

75575
nhibernate	entityspaces
you can generate doodads nhibernate easyobjects entityspaces etc

75590
gif	png	tiff	png
you could also use pdf2ps ps2image and then convert from the resulting image to tiff with other utilities i remember paul paul - yet another image viewer displays png tiff gif jpg etc.

75606
width	height
in visual studio add the width and height attribute to your usercontrol xaml but in the code-behind insert this

75606
width	height
if not runtime it will set the width and height to nan not a number which is the value you set it to if you remove the width and height attributes in xaml

75606
width	height
so at design-time you will have the preset width and height including if you put the user control in a form and at runtime it will dock depending on its parent container

75638
lisp	scheme	lua	scheme
the guys behind lua have repeatedly listed scheme and lisp as major influences on lua and lua has even been described as scheme without the parentheses

75705
dbf	dbase
i have searched for various techniques on how to read write dbase iii dbf files using oledb or odbc with c# .net

75714
int	double
currently i use int double strings and enumerations so the code will have to be adaptive based on the type

75747
sorting	filtering
i d prefer to render each list item as a single cell with complex rendering for instance the way that stackoverflow shows its lists of questions. i d also like to get as much of the sharepoint-standard ui as possible such as the sorting filtering and paging controls

75789
width	margin
i ve never come across a problem caused by using width padding and or margin together

75792
xen	raid
the raid controller in those does not play well with the xen kernel

75798
profiling	debugging
however it s written in python which means there s little real support in the way of deployment packaging debugging profiling and other tools that make building and maintaining applications much easier

75810
postgresql	mysql
same interface so if you like me use oracle ms-sql mysql and postgresql then at least your day to day query management tool will look the same for all platforms

75811
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
summary ie renders width different then the standard rendering if padding and margin used with width or height

75869
post	get
if you relate that to http basically it s either get or post parameters

75883
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer of usually 8 bits

75892
innodb	myisam
postgres is acid-compliant like innodb and when well-tuned nearly as speedy as myisam

75904
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
many common desktops including gnome kde and xfce where relevant implement the specifications laid out by freedesktop.org

75985
versioning	upgrade
if the distro ever comes out with an official package for a newer versioning of some random module it will automatically be installed when you apt-get upgrade

75994
pop-up	dialog
another feature that i find useful is that it can pop-up a dialog box that shows all the js and css scripts used on the page

76040
xna	slimdx
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna

76242
width	margin
by setting the width of the table to 100 and it s margin to zero you will remove the space between the borders of the table and it s container

76276
ant	maven
i would assume you run separate build scripts or have separate targets in the same script - ant and maven can both easily handle conditionally grabbing files and copying them

76295
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
tested and working in firefox 2 safari 3.1.2 for windows ie 6 and opera 9.52

76314
notepad	textpad
opening it up with notepad or textpad just shows a bunch of gobbledy-gook

76334
cos	sin
i generally use gcc and recall that it can calculate certain values at compile-time when all inputs are known ex sin cos etc...

76478
width	margin
from another angle if your parent div does have a width set and the margin is still affecting your table then you are probably in quirks mode

76601
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried ie firefox google-chrome and i do not see the error

76608
ssl	https
it should be https not ssl

76608
ssl	https
can you double check this in your example client and make sure it is https not ssl

76763
procmail	exim
if exim or sendmail is what s writing into the pipe then procmail is a good answer because it ll give you file locking serialization and you can put it all in the same file

76789

rather than using raw sockets some applications use a higher numbered tcp or udp port

77055
inherited	properties
you can also inherited the controls into your own classes and set the properties in there

77089
getter	setter
most importantly watch for the existence of setter and getter indicating that you are operating on values from a class and not asking the class to operate on it s own values --or using extends without applying the liskov substitution principle stuff like that

77205
icmp	tcp
useful as icmp packets to an address will not necessarily end up at the same place as a tcp connection to port 80 for example

77208
post	get
if you can get the window handle maybe using findwindow you can send post any message to it as long as the wparam lparam aren t pointers

77232

you ll have to benchmarking and or profiling your application on production grade hardware to find out

77234
valgrind	memcheck

77278
unix	solaris	solaris	netbsd
based on the test reports it works on the windows mac os x linux netbsd and solaris but theoretically it should work on other unix systems as well

77310
udp	tcp
like udp and tcp this is accessible through the normal sockets api

77310
udp	tcp
only udp and tcp port numbers less than 1024 are protected from use other than by root

77328
textwrangler	bbedit
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

debugging profiling and other tools

77693
profiling	debugging
the downside is it s written in php and as far as i know php doesn t have superb tools for debugging profiling and packaging of apps

77724
g++	gcc
i agree with iulian è erbäƒnoiu code blocks is a very good solution usable both from linux it will use g++ gcc and from windows it will use either the ms compiler or gcc

77726
rss	feed
i am coding an rss reader and i believe i made the wrong choice in using xml over a sqlite database to store a cache of all the feed items

77727
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
bazaar is reasonably fast very fast for trees with shallow history but presently scales poorly with history length and is easy-to-learn to those familiar with the command-line interfaces of traditional scms cvs svn etc

77727
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
about the author i use git and perforce for work and bazaar for my personal projects and as an embedded library

aqtime is also a good code profiler

77748
debian	linux
the server is linux debian 4.0

77834
perforce	cvs
the only real difference between cvs subversion clearcase perforce visualsourcesafe and all the other cvcses is in the workflow performance and integration that each product offers

77883
bazaar	git
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

77885
post	put
as for what to store in a session variable put your data there if you want to refer to it again on another page like a shopping basket but don t put it there if it s just temporary data used for producing the result of this page like a list of tags for the currently viewed post

77943
bazaar	svn
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience

77945
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better than mergesort

77945
quicksort	mergesort
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

77975
gmail	hotmail
also keep in mind many people use webmail such as gmail hotmail yahoo mail etc

78000
post	get
things like what object is being viewed edited should really be get post variables passed around between the screens so a user can use multiple browser windows to work with your application unless you d like to prevent that

78024
postgresql	mysql
i think the only way to know for sure what is going on is to look through the code or get one of the mysql postgresql programmers in here to say how it processes fk constraints

78044
versioning	upgrade
so you have to upgrade mongrel to a versioning that supports --clean to get around the stale pid file issue monit alone can t do this

78055
stateless	stateful
overall it sounds like the current implementation is abusively using session objects to try and simulate a stateful application in a supposedly stateless environment

78102
stdout	stderr
it can capture stderr and stdout

78104
children	parent
a quad tree is a 2 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 4 children each of which covers 1 4 of the area of the parent node

78104
children	parent
an oct tree is a 3 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 8 children each of which contains 1 8th of the volume of the parent node

78217
postgresql	mysql
use ldap ad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profile authorization server using some sort of traditional database mssql postgresql mysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera

78231
filesystems	fat
if you re sure that for larger writes you can get sufficient throughput and i m not sure that s the case but the filesystems might be doing something stupid like updating the fat after every write then having an encoding thread piping data to a writing thread with sufficient buffering in the writing thread to avoid stalls

78238
put	get
i can put together a very nice looking app the prototypes look slick - but when i need to interact with the user to ask questions get input i have to use wx

postgresql	mysql
use ldap ad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profile authorization server using some sort of traditional database mssql postgresql mysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera

78368
free	malloc
if you use malloc free instead of new delete malloc and free won t care about the type

don t use atoi and atof as these functions return 0 on failure

78569
atoi	atof
atoi and atof will convert the number even if there are trailing non numerical characters

78569
strtol	strtod
however if you use strtol and strtod it will not only skip leading white space and an optional sign but leave you with a pointer to the first character not in the number

78580
atoi	atof
using sscanf you can be certain if the string is a float or int or whatever without having to special case 0 as is the case with atoi and atof solution

79118
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is an open source software pbx that runs primarily on linux

79134
width	height
simply set the width and height values to auto where you instantiate your control and this will override the design-time values for that usercontrol

79134
width	height
another option is to set a combination of minwidth and minheight to a size that allows design-time work while width and height remain auto

79163
int	chars
is of type long the macros will work just as well on chars s short s int s

79182
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
as others have noted worst case of quicksort is o n 2 while mergesort and heapsort stay at o nlogn

the only other editor with a superset of vim s features is emacs

79281
super	extends
generics can also have their bounds defined with the keywords super and extends

79358
vim	emacs
its true that vim and emacs are very powerful tools but the learning curve is very steep

79358
kde	gnome
i use gnome and i m yet to see a kde app that looks good in gnome sorry i m sure its a great program

79358
geany	kdevelop
my advice is to investigate kdevelop geany and code blocks as a starting point

79446
ssl	https
to clarify earlier answers the http protocol is registered with port 80 and http over ssl aka https is registered with port 443

79449
width	height
you should use width height

79459
width	height
aspect should be a function of your window width and height

79459
width	height
specifically width divided by height but watch out for division by zero

79474
put	get
i can put them in one of the shell rc files that get sourced and this solves the environment variables for processes spawned from the console

79490
uptime	reboot
after a reboot i dont see an option for the uptime command to print a history of uptimes

79495
perforce	cvs
there is a simlar page for cvs to perforce conversion here although i don t have direct experience with that

79496
gmail	hotmail
i have seen several other sites do this and also connect to yahoo gmail and hotmail contacts

79515
uptime	reboot
you could take the difference between each successive reboot and that should give the uptime of the machine

79550
width	height
if you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want

79577
bazaar	git
sun did an evaluation of a href rel noreferrer git a a href rel noreferrer mercurial a and a href rel noreferrer bazaar a as candidates to replace the sun teamware vcs for the solaris code base

this is the case in windows linux solaris aix etc.

79658
kde	gnome
linux gnome or kde

79688
percentile	max	min	max	min	median	median	max	median	percentile
i d like to be able to select the 25th median and 75th percentile for a single column of scores preferably in a single record so i can combine with average max and min

79695
installation	upgrade
when appropriate quality control teams should be able to conduct security regression usability performance stress installation upgrade testing and not developers

79699
uptime	reboot
whenever the uptime reduces there s been a reboot since the previous record

79709
terminate	timeout
ideally i d like to be able to terminate the function or have it fail due to network timeout without losing all the information processed prior to termination

79727
vxworks	rtos
in the vxworks rtos there is a shell that allows you to issue command to your embedded system

79771
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72

79771
multiplying	multiplication
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

79771
cos	sin
example since you re using fixed-2 representation there s only 100 values in the range 0.0 1 0-99 and sin cos repeat outside this range so you only need a 100-integer lookup table

79787
stdout	stderr
i ve investigated this and it appears that i need to access console stdout and stderr buffers

79845
checkstyle	cpd
for static analysis tools i often use cpd pmd findbugs and checkstyle

79867
expression-blend	silverlight
as brian stated you can just use expression-blend and create any wpf silverlight apps

79890
onmousedown	onmouseup
just put the below toggleon in the onmousedown and toggleoff in the onmouseup of the button

79901
strace	systemtap
some applications can trick strace ptrace not to run so the only real option i ve had is using systemtap

79948
checkstyle	cpd
i use maven2 for builds and with it you can configure a series of reporting plugins including pmd cpd checkstyle coberturba etc

80008
hash	salt
salt the password then hash the password and repeat 10 000 or so times

80142
free	malloc
the reason for this distinction is that the original free store was implemented with a data structure known as a binomial heap. for that reason allocating from early implementations of malloc free was allocation from a heap

80225
put	get
most write a check to a consultant and get their annual and or lifetime certificate to some club so that they can put a graphic on their website or a label on the box their product comes in

80225
versioning	upgrade
your business model is from selling versioning upgrade and tech support and as far as software developers any old robot will do that can write the same code in the same way

80225
verilog	vhdl
i had the pleasure of learning both vhdl and verilog and becoming productive in both within a week from what was almost a dare from such a hardware engineer despite my diploma saying electrical engineer my job title is software engineer

80281
division	multiplication
also i ve found that it is best to have macros or functions for multiplication and especially division or you quickly get unreadable code

80311
srp	principles
test driven development done right should make developers highly aware of design pitfalls like tight coupling violations of dry don t repeat yourself violations of srp single responsibility principles etc

80314
firefox	safari
it generates completely separate javascript for each major browser family ie firefox safari etc.

80341
winpcap	wireshark
i m thinking adam mintz s answer is probably best though we used winpcap and wireshark for the application

80406
next	except
if you take tdd to an extreme without any forethought except the next unit test you may make things harder on yourself

80408
inherited	properties
set layout properties back to browser defaults and set formating to inherited from the parent

80450
strlen	substr
if you just use the strlen substr functions to split strings you may split a string in the middle of a character

80485
public	protected
edit2 maybe you can map it as a protected ilist string and convert to public ilist eaction just as i do with a simple property

80531
vb6	vba
with vba vb6 you can just declare a byte array and assign a string value to it and it will be converted for you

80548
opera	firefox
this is not a problem in opera or firefox only internet explorer

80577
anjuta	geany	anjuta	kdevelop	geany	kdevelop	codeblocks	kdevelop	codeblocks	anjuta

it uses the standard compiler debugger gcc g++ gdb on linux and the ms compiler debugger on that platform

80612
jobs	cron
the scripts are intended to be run as cron jobs

80634
ubuntu	linux
note that i m using firefox3 on linux ubuntu 8.04 where the tools- java console menu option does not appear for some reason

80697
equals	tostring
each time i have to reverse-engineer the tables and so i lose every customization i made on the mappings .hbm.xml files like adjusting the identity columns picking the fields used in equals and tostring

80732
merb	ruby-on-rails
yaml is very popular in the ruby community where it s mainly used in preference to xml for configuration files in ruby-on-rails and merb for example

80733
perforce	cvs
watch out for differences between single-file checkins cvs and multi-file changesets perforce

80859
short	base
in short this means i can t use the trick of going through the activerecord base connection

80882
put	get
you ve put in an arbitrary 1000 into the loop condition but you get my drift if you wanted to go through all the items in the array

80910
folder	directory
i include the java virtual machine inside the application folder in a jre sub directory to ensure that the right java version will be used

80989
opera	firefox
when running in a browser the application is wrapped in a thin layer as an activex control for ie and as a netscape browser plugin for firefox mozilla netscape opera

81022
unix	aix
in the kornshell ksh on aix unix version 5.3 with the editor mode set to vi using

81113
qsort	bsearch
i think you should look at the c standard functions qsort and bsearch for inspiration

81145
rss	feed
you could have a look at the nuclblog project as that has the capability to generate an rss feed for the blog entries it maintains

81171
inherited	properties
if someone want to use your abstract class he will have to implement a class that inherited from it and explicitly implement the abstract methods and properties but can chose to not override the virtual methods and properties

81223
alloca	malloc
btw i would discourage the use of alloca since stack tends to be much more limited than heap use malloc instead

81224
apache	lighttpd
i don t think that s possible right now since mod_dav_svn is an apache module and afaik there is no lighttpd module available

81238
folder	directory
edit dizzler was still getting in probably wasn t indicating referrer in all cases so instead i moved all my mp3s to a new folder disabled directory browsing and created a robots.txt file to hopefully keep it from being indexed again

81260
maven	pom.xml
the maven pom.xml file was apparently broken too so i ll have to fix that before fixing jrst .

81343
bash	zsh
if you want to increase your bash zsh prowess

81344
bgp	ospf
i was wondering from an ospf routing bgp protocol user s perpspective

81345
superclass	subclassing
one superclass knows how to rip apart the class hierarchy but relies on its subclassing to actually do something useful with it

81409
int	boolean
no you must be thinking of the operator which yields a boolean expression of type int in c and indeed bool in c++

81411
int	chars
since c doesn t have a real bitfield type the expression here an assignment expression usually gets the type of the bit field s base type in your example unsigned int but it is possible for a compiler to use a smaller type internally in this case probably unsigned chars because it s big enough for one bit

81435
hash	salt
you ll have to add some security to the token ttl a hash a salt

81455
octree	quadtree
however to answer your original question about octree quadtree 2 n-trees in n dimensions you start with a hyper -cube that contains the area of space that you are interested in

81497
mp3	wav
it is a little bit slow to transform mp3 files to wav and then to he-aac

81526
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
admittedly this can be a bit of overkill sometimes but it not hard to set up improves readability and reduces the chances of the author incorrectly remembering whether true means yes do to comparison in a case-sensitive manner or yes do to comparison in a case-insensitive manner

81527
cos	sin
calculate the size of the chord sin of cos -1 of ratio of normal length to radius of sphere

81563
bazaar	svn
ddaa.myopenid.com mentioned it in passing but i think it s worth mentioning again bazaar can read and write to remote svn repositories

81574
eruby	erb
as jordi said though it depends what context you want to run this in - if you re literally going to use templates like the one you listed eruby would probably work better but i d guess you re actually going to be passing variables to the template in which case you want erb

81622
int	chars
in particular i have tried various compilers which give me sizeof int instead of sizeof chars even if i apply this to a bitfield with only has a single bit

81644
terminate	timeout
if i run this after locking the table on the database i get the message that the timeout is hit but i don t know how to then get the mysql_query line to terminate

81654
boost	stl
the stl and boost symbols are name-mangled because of the namespaces they re in

81675
ant	cruisecontrol	ant	maven
in order to be sure that you are generating the correct artefacts you should have a dedicated server build your deliverables cruisecontrol either with the help of ant maven or any other tool

81686
folder	directory
the app itself writes some files and creates some directory to its app folder

81728
int	double
the java language always promotes arguments of arithmetic operators to int long float or double

81765
put	get
the best way of doing it natively is to get into a final variable check for null and put it back in with a 1

81779
folder	directory
in nt4 you can create that folder in your installation directory and in windows 98 and below it doesn t matter anyways due to these systems not having a permission system anyways

81784
mbunit	nunit
on the other hand if you mix up code and its tests in a single project you end up with binaries related to your unit test framework be it nunit mbunit or whatever else and your own binaries side by side

81923
vmware	virtualbox
if it doesn t you might seriously want to consider vmware or virtualbox as these do have this feature and it s really useful for things like this

81924
maven	pom.xml
i use maven and check in just the pom.xml source

81965
google-chrome	firefox
if you were using firefox and were talking about javascript within an extension to manipulate and theme the window google-chrome then this would be a different story

81982
robocopy	xcopy
at least use xcopy robocopy is even faster

81983
datediff	difference
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

81991
post	get
every time a user post something containing or in a page in my web application i get this exception thrown

82111
ws-addressing	soap
as others have said in this thread the problem with soap is its complexity when the other ws- specifications come in and there are countless interop issues if you stray into the wrong parts of wsdl xsds soap ws-addressing etc

82154
width	height
i would use flash if i m trying to add sound into a webpage you can embed a flash document with no width or height so it will be invisible but still play noise

82215
public	protected
personally i like to make all inheritance public so as to avoid wasting time with should i make inheritance relation protected or private discussions

82304
instances	transient
loggers are not serializable so you must use transient when storing them in instances fields

82304
serializable	deserialization
if you want to restore the logger after deserialization you can store the level string indide your object which does get serializable

82379
wav	ogg
compressed wav files are always tricky - i always try and use an alternative container format in this case such as ogg or wma files

82407
accessor	properties
this feature lets you write classes that can be mapped over the top of native javascript objects to easily provide accessor methods for properties of those objects and other extended functionality

82464
getter	setter
because at the il level a read write property translates into two getter and setter methods

82468
perforce	cvs
in perforce p4 sync -n doesn t give output like cvs -n -q update

82480
min	max
you can use max and min widths as well as set percentages for cell sizes or hard code cell width s but dynamically growing cells work fine for 1 row it s the next row below it that won t match up

82552
instances	transient
usually logger fields are declared static but if you need it to be an instances field just declare it transient as its usually done for any non-serializable field

82573
rss	feed
after you customize the content query web part to display the fields and content you want you can set up the web part to emit a really simple syndication rss feed of that content.

82734
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
the python lxml library acts as a pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

82782
rss	feed
i want to be able to take two or three feed and then merge then in to a single rss feed to be published internally on our network

82949
junit	testng
i m having other problems with testng so i m looking to port back to junit

82975
vbscript	vb6
in vb6 you could change the array to start with 0 or 1 so i think vbscript can do the same

83022
subtract	add
the index function you write could then add or subtract 1 to all index s passed in

83129
datediff	difference
the only way to achieve that in sql is to get the timestamp field for two different records and calculate the difference datediff

83199
versioning	upgrade
instead that number is there to allow you to smoothly upgrade your css and javascript files from one versioning to the next

83281

83445
post	get
currently i can t easily post a new version of the xap and expect the users to get it

83497
subtraction	addition
the benefit is that you can reformat the time however you like including am pm adjustments for timezone addition subtraction etc

83516
postgresql	mysql
there s possibly a phobia of stored procedures with mysql partly due to not being overwhelmingly powerful compared to postgresql and even mssql mysqls stored procedures are greatly lacking

83519
vim	bbedit
concerning an ide i use either dreamweaver or bbedit on os x or vim

83648
int	boolean
according to the php docs strpos and stripos will return an int for the position or a boolean false

83670
dateadd	datepart
use datepart and dateadd to do this

83681
button	checkbox
for every input field radio button checkbox and textinput you should have

83725
width	height
you may find it happens if you are using min- width height or max- width height

83754
bash	zsh
you can probably do all of these things in bash but my experience with zsh is that if there s something i want to do i can probably find it in zsh-lovers

83771
post	get
the idea is to get some value to limit the query at the last post that we need in this case the publishdategmt column will suffice and then limit the second query with that value instead of take

83809
srp	principles
i typically don t expose my business data entities across the wire since i like to adhere to the single responsibility principles srp

83814
firefox	safari
first i develop the site using commonly accepted css to look good in safari and firefox 3

83876
haskell	ocaml
f# stems from the ml family of languages and has a core language compatible with that of ocaml though also draws from c# and haskell

83928
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can use a stringwriter but it s still writing into a stringbuilder

83946
google-chrome	firefox
a lot of app stylist things don t translate over to firefox well and the webcombo blows up horribly in the new google-chrome chromium browser

83952
vmware	virtualbox
also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authorize the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen

83995
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
i ve frequently seen invalidoperationexception or argumentexception when the underlying cause is actually out of memory

84010
opera	safari
it is supposed to be the full url but some browsers opera safari 2 apply a different cache strategy for urls with different params

84010
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
while internet explorer and firefox ignore this opera and safari donâ t - to make sure all user agents can cache your resources we need to keep query strings out of their urls.â

84013
maven	cobertura
our team use pmd and cobertura actually our projects are maven projects and there is very simple to include plug ins for code analysis

84034
distance	polygons
bear in mind that it is not a simple case of taking the points that make up the vertices of the polygons as values to test for distance as they may not necessarily be the closest points

84041
versioning	upgrade
update move to separate spindle or upgrade sql server versioning as gulzar aptly suggests

84122
unix	solaris
it s essentially a rewrite of the .net runtime the equivalent of the java virtual machine that works on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

84135
distance	polygons
computing the frã chet distance between simple polygons

84149
tapestry	struts
i ve made extensive use of jsp and the various associated frameworks jstl struts tapestry etc as well as more comprehensive frameworks not related to jsp gwt openlaszlo

84179
unix	solaris
there is one interesting initiative called mono which offers .net support on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

84187
superclass	subclassing
one very good use case is so you can declare the logger in a superclass and use it in all subclassing the only downside is that logs from the superclass are attributed to the subclassing but it is usually easy to see that

84228
distance	polygons
a hybrid might work -- we could find the distance from the center points assuming we had some notion of the relative size of the blue polygons we could cull the result set to the closest among those then use raytracing to narrow down the truly closest polygons s

84239
distance	polygons
for each vertex in the red polygons compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84307
quicksort	shellsort
regarding sorting usually quicksort is hard to beat in performance an optimized one that cuts off recursion if size goes below 7 items and switches to something like insertionsort maybe shellsort

84307
distance	polygons
thus i guess the question is how to quickly calculate the distance between two polygons after all you need to make this computation 50 times

84307
distance	polygons
minimum polygons distance in 2d space

84335
solaris	aix
those run-time libraries handle the memory management calls to the os in a os independent consistent syntax and those run-time libraries are responsible for making malloc and new work consistently between oses such as linux windows solaris aix etc..

84335
free	malloc
calls to malloc and free may occur in any order

84371
distance	polygons
now you can collect say the 5-10 closest polygons to the red one find the distance center to center subtract the radius sort the list and take the top 5 and then do a much more exhaustive routine

84438
distance	polygons
testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more

84447
collabnet	svn
if you use the svn protocol and use svnserve can be setup as a windows service that auto starts on your server it should take you 1.5-3 hours to setup depending on how much you want to read see collabnet for the windows package download

84547
imperative	declarative
i believe that techniques to declarative express side effects in an object oriented framework will allow compilers to decompose imperative statements into their functional relationships

84713
pull	push
i can t speak for anything but .net 2003 parser where i did some informal performance tests on push vs pull xslt code

84713
pull	push
this is similar to what you are asking apply-template push and call-template pull

84755
rxtx	usbserial
i m using the rxtx library over usbserial on a linux distro

84756
google-chrome	safari
if anything you should be detecting webkit since as far as page rendering is concerned google-chrome should behave exactly like other webkit browsers safari epiphany

84838
translation	localization
your question could use some clarification as to exactly what aspects of translation localization you need help with

84859
rxtx	usbserial
i m using the rxtx library over usbserial on a linux distro

84859
rxtx	usbserial
one of my biggest problems is that the rxtx serialportevent.output_buffer_empty does not work on linux over usbserial

84878
folder	directory
such a handler must be registered in hkcr directory background instead of usual locations like hkcr directory hkcr folder etc

84896
post	get
you didn t say in your original post what language so here s a regex pattern that should get you started

84940
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in my experience opera firefox and safari all behave similarly when it comes to basic stuff positioning floats divs etc and it s just ie you ll have to tweak for

84942
postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
sqlinform is an automatic sql code formatter for all major databases oracle sql server db2 udb sybase informix postgresql mysql etc with many formatting options

84960
jpql	hql
i really like the ability to write my hql or jpql and view the generated sql real time

84974
union	distinct
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85010
restrict	shared
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time

85021
solaris	aix
linux windows solaris aix etc..

85021
free	malloc
they re free for instance to make one giant call to malloc and then manage memory within the block however they wish

85040
profiling	debugging	profiling	benchmarking
the eclipse tptp can be incredibly useful for finding the slow spots in code and for anything else that would requiring debugging profiling or benchmarking

85082
jquery	scriptaculous
most frameworks yui mootools jquery prototype scriptaculous etc. have sortable list functionality

85085
arraylist	linkedhashmap
i hadn t known the network cost so it makes sense to rework the function to return a linkedhashmap instead of the two arraylist

85118
imperative	declarative
declarative imperative object oriented .

85215
put	get
get all the projects put on a website and see which gets the most hits..

85223
integer	fractions
in general we have the integer part before the decimal point the fractions part after the decimal point and the exponent

85223
multiplying	subtract	integer	fractions
i m thinking of multiplying the integer part with 10 n where n is the number of digits in the fractions part and then adding the fractions part to the integer part and subtract n from the exponent

85271
turbogears	cherrypy
i use cherrypy as my web server which comes bundled with turbogears and i simply run multiple instances of the cherrypy web server on different ports bound to localhost

85277
vim	emacs
in the vim and emacs terminal apps the color schemes look horrid

85372
subtract	add
you can add subtract that to from any date type and you get the right answer

85386
opera	safari
what may have confused the author of the thinkvitamin article is the fact that hitting enter in the address location bar in safari and opera results in different behavior for urls with query string in them

85402
ienumerable	ienumerator
iterators aren t exactly translatable to the .net way but they are roughly replaced by ienumerable t and ienumerator t

85402
ienumerable	icollection
if you do want to control iteration or make the collection a bit more custom have your collection implement the ienumerable t and or icollection t interfaces as well

85414
vmware	virtualbox
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

85416
integer	fractions
if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

85422
vim	emacs
in addition if there are dev s using emacs or vim you probably want to add and # #

85431
folder	directory
and don t forget to give it rights to all files and folder in your virtual directory

85452
solaris	aix
i ve developed on numerous multi-platform c++ apps the largest being 1.5m lines of code and running on 7 platforms -- aix hp-ux pa-risc hp-ux itanium solaris linux windows os x

85477
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox uses a couple of schemes for networking that are a bit different than vmware

85491
ienumerable	ilist
you are most often better of using the most general usable type in this case the ilist or even better the ienumerable interface so that you can switch the implementation conveniently at a later time

85500
updatepanel	formview
i have an updatepanel with a trigger pointed to an event on a formview control

85500
updatepanel	formview
when the updatepanel refreshes it needs values from the formview control so that on the server it can use them to query the database

85511
put	get
however if you re timing some hardware for example some algorithm you put in the gpu then time.clock will get rid of this time and time.time is the only solution left

85511
factors	mean
note whatever the method used the timing will depend on factors you cannot control when will the process switch how often ... this is worse with time.time but exists also with time.clock so you should never run one timing test only but always run a series of test and look at mean variance of the times

85532
jsf	seam
my environment is seam 2.0.1.ga jboss 4.2.2.ga and i m using jsf

85536
profiling	benchmarking
however if you re timing the execution of a block of code for benchmarking profiling purposes you should take a look at the timeit module

85614
fink	macports
i would like if possible not to rely on macports or fink though if they can be made to work with the default apache 2 install that would probably be ok

85619
post	get
it only allows get post and others necessary for browsing

85656
int	double
int double and so on

85664
kerberos	ntlm
you just have to be sure that it s authenticating using kerberos and not ntlm or some other digest authentication because the digest is not trusted to use as an impersonation token

85715
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
hey juan i d recommend that you use the vector3 class as suggested by several others since it s easy to use and above all - supports all operations you need like addition multiplication matrix multiplying etc... without the need to implement it yourself

85742
nlb	iis
haven t done it yet with wcf but plan to have a local dns entry pointing to our network load balancing nlb virtual ip address which will direct all traffic to one of our servers hosting services within iis

85770
put	get
i get this out put

85802
inherited	properties
the inherited class solution from scott nichols should work although i will need to derive a class and relationships for around 30 tables - ouch although i need to figure out how to check for a null value in my derived class discriminator value properties

85803
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok

85803
postgresql	mysql
the mysql one was more stable than the postgresql one

85807
versioning	upgrade
it is not in my power to upgrade to a newer versioning of ie corporate bureaucracy

85817
width	margin
most of the layout problems you ll have will probably be caused by internet explorer s wrong interpretation of the box model you can avoid this by never setting a width and margin or padding at the same time

85817
width	margin
this might seem annoying but it s not just apply the padding or margin to the content which is inside your element which has a width set

85852
svnkit	subclipse
on a recent install i tried the beta drivers i have eclipse ganymede and svnkit pure java svnkit v1.2.0.4502 that you can optionally install with subclipse and they worked pretty much straight out of the box although a colleague found he had to go through a few hoops to make sure eclipse installed them and their dependancies correctly

85868
ant	maven
i have a sufficient amount of experience with ant so far but i am interested in learning more about maven

85878
submit	submission
if you have a form page that is served up via http i m going to be nervous about submission data -- i can t see if the submit goes over https or http without doing a view source and hunting for it

85888
post	get
you should redirect to the pay page only using a form post no get

85928
getter	setter
in visual studio 2008 there is the ability to auto generate getter and setter accessors by right clicking on a private variable - refactor - encapsulate field.

85994
cvs	svn
would a svn cvs etc work

86003
ssl	https
an ssl wrapper pound will decrypt https requests from client browsers and pass them as plain http to the back-end servers

86014
inherited	properties
edit bitwiseplatypus is correct that unless you use the hasownproperty method you will get properties that are inherited - however i don t know why anyone familiar with object-oriented programming would expect anything less

86014
inherited	properties
now that said hasownproperty is useful for filtering but we don t need to sound a warning as if there is something dangerous in getting inherited properties

86029
maven	pom.xml
also find projects that are utilizing maven and look into their pom.xml configurations learn more about what is possible with maven

86030
put	get
it took some editing to remove control declarations as they get put in a generated file and conflict with the decompiled base class but nothing a few hours didn t cure

86052
inherited	properties
while svn 1.8 adds the concept of inherited properties the svn ignore properties itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories

86052
inherited	properties
this is similar to svn ignore except it makes use of svn 1.8 s inherited properties feature

86083
mp3	ogg
convert compressed to to raw audio data and if possible raw audio data to mp3 ogg aac .

86083
mp3	wav
jmf original from sun reads mp3 and turns it into wav

86173
cpython	pypy
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas

86175
temp	tmp
i checked the tmp and temp environment variables and also and and they re identical

86200
temp	tmp
if iis is executing check the values in registry for tmp and temp under

86211
daemons	systemd
queue d systemd and daemons either wake periodically and copy or run as services

86212
vbscript	vb6
since the question didn t specify .net this should work in vbscript or vb6

86256
designer	design-view
when i say design-view i mean that i right+click on the file and choose view designer - this gives me access to the toolbox and tabs for designer split and code-view which is the view i primarily work in

86260
lisp	prolog
i think in addition to your mainstream language you want to have a scripting language high productivity for smaller and one-off tasks and a language with a seriously different cognitive style haskell prolog lisp etc.

86306
inherited	properties
to avoid including inherited properties in your enumeration check hasownproperty

86306
inherited	properties
edit i disagree with jasonbunting s statement that we don t need to worry about enumerating inherited properties

86306
inherited	properties
there is danger in enumerating over inherited properties that you aren t expecting because it can change the behavior of your code

86325
stdout	stderr
note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout

86427
cpython	ironpython
ironpython and jython use the runtime environment for .net or java and with that comes just in time compilation and a garbage collector different from the original cpython

86427
cpython	ironpython
a downside in using jython or ironpython is that you cannot use native c modules they can be only used in cpython

86437
cvs	svn
viewvc provides a nice web interface to cvs or svn and is reasonably easy to setup

86499
integer	fractions
you cast the datetime into a float which represents the date as the integer portion and the time as the fractions of a day that s passed

86517
client-side	server-side
if there is a lack of seamlessness to your applications because the server-side and client-side are not communicating well then you might want to reconsider how you architect your applications

equals	gethashcode
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode

86693
concave	convex
it works on convex and concave polygons

86693
distance	polygons
the distance between the polygons is at most r

86812
children	parent
for example a single abstract class that can have child nodes if no children its a leaf if no parent its a root but this can change in its lifetime

86861
post	get
if you look at the comments of that post there are some ways to get around this but they re not very elegant

86865
children	parent
so you have nodes which have children and a parent and you have sectionnodes which are the roots of these special subtrees

86881
equals	gethashcode
when two object are the same the equals method returns true they must have the same value returned from gethashcode

86881
equals	gethashcode
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode

86901
width	height
i have tried setting the rootpanel width and height to 100 and that still didn t work

86956
mouse	keyboard
think about the number of mouse keyboard clicks it takes a user to get to something

86980
width	height
however if you wrap your items in some sort of frameworkelement-derived object before adding them to the listbox you can use transformtovisual to get the relative size and use height and width to set the size of the item

87006
accurev	svn	accurev	cvs	cvs	svn
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

i would like to find a way to take jpeg or gif png images and reduce the amount of colors to 20

87111
jsr311	jax-rs
i would look into using jax-rs java.net project jsr311 it is pretty simple to use it supports marshalling and unmarshalling objects to from xml out of the box

87214
mouse	keyboard
you ll normally only get mouse keyboard events to a window or control when it has focus

87221
post	get
so this post talked about how to actually implement url rewriting in an asp.net application to get friendly urls

87288
versioning	upgrade
can be difficult to upgrade and to keep current versioning available

87339
debian	linux
to find some best practices look how linux distro s debian write their init-scripts usually found in etc init.d

87360
public	protected
but otherwise protected should be avoided as much as possible use private by default and public when you must expose the method

87403
equals	gethashcode
just use resharper to create you equals gethashcode methods

87410
put	get
if you put your regex in parentheses you can get the length and thus the end using

87457
implements	extends
the classic example is the activerecord class from rails if you try to implements something similar in php which would look like this class user extends activerecord and then try to call user find 1 the method that gets called is actually activerecord find because you haven t overloaded find in user - but without late static binding the find method in activerecord has no way of knowing which classed it got called from self within it will always point to activerecord and thus it can t fetch your user-object for you

87487
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
i often throw runtimeexception rather than try to develop an exception class for every conceivable error case - but your opinion on that will depend on where you sit on the checked vs unchecked-exception debate

87519
equals	tostring
similarly even objects with expensive equals methods have inexpensive tostring calls

87519
equals	tostring
for example the java.net.url class has an equals method which makes use of an internet connection to determine whether two urls are truly equals but it still has a simple and constant-time tostring method

87556
gmail	hotmail
maybe gmail hotmail and all others do have api s which users can use....need to look into it more i guess

87602
getter	setter
setter and getter are commonly inlined

87648
range	minimum
at least because the c++ standard only gives the minimum range of values that each numeric type is required to cover

i have recently run into an issue where i wanted to add a folder to the directory structure of my project that would become the new root directory for the previously housed files

87709
move	drag
or you have the option of doing it straight from within windows explorer drag the files folders you want to move with the right mouse button when you drop them in their new location you ll get a menu one of the options is move in svn

87726
lxml	libxml2
my preferred python xml library is lxml which wraps libxml2

the only way i can think of so far is to calculate all the points around the perimeter and find the max min x and y values

87802
passenger	webrick
running rails 2.1 either via mongrel webrick or passenger in development mode if i make changes to my views they don t update without me having to kick the server

87837
versioning	upgrade
also try the usual stuff make sure you ve upgrade to the latest versioning check out any development versioning that may contain bugfixes etc

87842
addition	multiplication
probably the most important thing to remember when performing an extended precision multiplication is that you must also perform a multiple precision addition at the same time

87849
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
i am about to move to svn as my rcs of choice after many years using cvs and have a basic question.

87849
cvs	svn
back in my cvs days i would of used a unix symbolic link in one of the project folders but as my new svn repository won t necessarily be hosted on a unix box i can t do the same

87868
multiplying	multiplication
just do normal long multiplication as if you were multiplying a pair of 2-digit numbers except each digit is really a 32-bit integer

87868
128bit	64bit
note that we re discarding the upper 64bit of the result since a 64bit number times a 64bit number is a 128bit number

87892
ubuntu	linux
web site for linux kernel asynchronous i o support here says that sockets don t work but the aio.h manual pages on my ubuntu 8.04.1 workstation all seem to imply that it works for arbitrary file descriptors

88020
min	max
which should give you many solutions for t two of which you are interested in plug that back into 1 to get your max and min x

88031
interbase	firebird
if you use firebird or interbase there s a tool called ibdesc that does a great job

88049
hash	salt
-server never knows password only salt hash

88058
x86	64bit
even the ia64 cpus the intanium that was intended to replace x86 before amd invented x86-64 that was true 64bit and could only emulate 32 bit unlike x86-64 that can be both is one of the cpus that can be switched to big endian

88100
udp	tcp
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

88196
getter	setter
also it removes that nasty problem of having two getter and setter for the same actual data

88218

88444
post	get
why don t you post more information about the limitations of the platform you are working on and perhaps some of the clever folk here can help get your bug list down

88536
int	chars
the reason you would not use tables for non-tablular data is the same reason you don t store int as chars strings - technology works much more easily when you use it for the purpose for which it is desgined

88541
getter	setter
lets say i have a business object with getter setter for the properties on the object

88632
opera	firefox
for example even .net developers occasionally use firefox maybe even opera

88632
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome are possibilities too now

88632

it must run reasonably in internet explorer 6 firefox 3.0 opera 9+ and safari for windows not everything has to be flawless but it can t look downright ugly either

88733
client-side	server-side
perhaps you should look at having both client-side and server-side validation

88733
client-side	server-side
the attributes can then be processed and used to automatically create both client-side and server-side validation methods to avoid the problem of duplicating business logic

88743
testng	jmockit
i m using jmockit for unit testing with testng and i m having trouble using the expectations class to mock out a method that takes a primitive type boolean as a parameter using a matcher

88783

fpdf tcpdf and php s included pdf libraries allow me to create an image and plop it on a pdf but the more advanced layouts and crop marks are a bit beyond me

88853
accessor	properties
adding to nescio s thoughts - i d suggest in code reviews actively hunting down expensive transparent operations in properties accessor db round tripping

88895
openmesh	cgal
as far as i understand your question it seems to me that you do not clearly see the point of libraries like cgal and openmesh

88904
gridex	janus
we re making heavy use of 3rd party controls janus gridex infralution virtualtree and .net magic docking and we do a lot of dynamic loading and rendering of content based on metadata in our database

88985
put	get
on the other hand if you don t put any validation in your app you might not have any bad data but you may have users thinking they entered stuff that doesn t get saved

89040
jobs	cron
in fact it often depends on application logic user roles and sometimes you might want to bypass validation altogether cron jobs and maintenance scripts

89073
ubuntu	linux
it appears that it s in ubuntu linux in the cutils or cdecl package and it s probably available elsewhere

89133
post	get
this post should get you started on the various options..check the post tagged with debugging

stdout	stderr
the advantage of subprocess vs system is that it is more flexible you can get the stdout stderr the real status code better error handling etc...

89249
hex	binary
here is the table of all the values note that you can add up values to hide multiple drives also the value is binary type but must be entered in hexadecimal so if you add up a few drives get ready for a little hex math

or if the input vectors are small enough but not constant size just use alloca instead of malloc

89454
sorting	filtering
however if your queries are quite similar but you have huge numbers of permutations in your query conditions like complicated paging sorting filtering etc an object relational mapper tool is probably the way to go although the process of overhauling your existing code to make use of the tool could be quite complicated

89530
apache	nginx
actually since you re using nginx you re already in great shape and don t need apache

89530
nginx	lighttpd
i also happen to do what the nginx wiki suggests and use spawn-fcgi from lighttpd as my cgi-spawner lighttpd is a pretty fast compile w o weird dependencies so a quick and easy thing to install but you can also use a short shell perl script for that

89578
free	malloc
the second makes a number of functions more expensive but has a huge impact on malloc and free

89578
allocator	stl
i believe with the msvcp stl implementations it also eliminates all the allocator pooling that is usually done so that leaks show exactly the block you d think and not some larger chunk of memory that it s been sub-allocating

89612
kubuntu	gnome
since you re using ubuntu and not kubuntu i assume you re using gnome

89619

ones that are definitely not dead are ie6 starting to push it ie7 ie8 latest opera 9.x latest firefox 3.x latest safari 3.x and others that have about the same capabilities

89714
opera	firefox
firefox 2.x isn t dead either and is needed for win9x users if they don t want to use opera

89726
int	boolean
the simplest implementation using a boolean array and int values runs extremely quickly

89727
floor	sqrt
remember to test any if n is prime by brute force you only need to see if its divisible by any prime up to floor sqrt n + 1 not n 2

89780
bash	subshell
i m using ksh-style subshell here i m not totally sure that it works in bash

89786

90138
lxml.html	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup	html5lib	lxml.html
use beautifulsoup html5lib or lxml.html

there might even be a vim or emacs script that already does something similar

90196
profiler	yourkit
use a profiler e.g yourkit

90197
put	get	post	put	post	get

90242
int	boolean	int	double
the double equals operator is used to compare values such as a pair of int and returns a boolean

90245
getter	setter
as for the getter and setter

90245

less duplication http already represents operations like delete put get etc

90477
quicksort	mergesort
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

90482
post	get
the reason for this is that rest is based on normal http requests which enables intent to be inferred from the type of request being made get retrive post write delete remove etc... and is completely stateless

90539
postgresql	mysql
most other database servers like mysql and postgresql have similar interfaces for connection and manipulation

90575

once you can get this value and set the element s height you need to attach event handlers to both the window onload and onresize so that you can fire your resize function

90934
irrlicht	ogre3d
like previously said ogre3d and irrlicht are probably your best options in regards to free

90939

if you want c++ and your just starting out i d go with irrlicht its free and its code although not blazing fast like ogre its very well structured and a good example of what a c++ should look like

91109
junit	testng
there are a large number of add-ons for junit testng available including

91121

91122
redmine	trac
-project management and issue tracking eg trac redmine etc

91123
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception

91149
jboss	glassfish
i would choose jboss or glassfish for a start

91165
redmine	trac

91575
put	get
the following code shows how to get at the pixels inside of a bitmap change them and put them back into the bitmap

91665
getter	setter
in your example those getter and setter don t seem to be adding any value to the code - in fact it is really just asserting that the getter setter mechanism in c# works

91672
int	chars
another method was to use a unicode string where each chars is the int denoting a group and this makes searching easy but is a bit of a fudge

91695
addslashes	multibyte
if you re using some form of multibyte character set it s possible although probably only through poor design of the character set that one or both halves of a sixteen or thirty-two bit character representation is identical to the eight bits of a character addslashes would add a slash to

91721
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in widescreen maximize browser window and is ok in ie7 firefox google-chrome and safari in maximize and reduced window size

you didn t mention whether your input is null terminated - if not then extra care is needed and strcmp strcpy won t be suitable

91801
ubuntu	debian
xmltk doesn t seem to have package in debian ubuntu fedora or macports hasn t had a release since 2007 and uses non-portable build automation

the only difference in c is that it s common to add and subtract from pointers - and if you get the logic wrong you can end up messing with data you shouldn t be touching

92247
metaphone	soundex
metaphone and double metaphone are similar to soundex except they may be tuned more toward your goal than soundex

92324
boost	stl
c++ is more standard you will find more code libraries examples etc. and you may freely use the stl and boost while object pascal is more of an exotic language

also if your perlcritic is old you may want to upgrade it as some old versioning gave some incorrect errors in moose classes

92566
struts	stripes
if you are familiar with struts then stripes will make sense to you but it s so much better

92566
struts	stripes
they have a stripes vs struts section on their website

92566
struts	stripes
it allows you to work with any ajax framework you want and i don t think it would take long to migrate from struts to stripes

92588
webclient	httpwebrequest
a second option is to use the webclient class this provides an easier to use interface for downloading web resources but is not as flexible as httpwebrequest

92633
subtraction	addition
when you only need to update simple variables 32 or 64 bit int or pointers perform simply addition or subtraction operations on them or just swap the values of two variables most platforms offer atomic operations for that further gcc offers these as well

92639
rss	feed
for rss feed check out feeds.adobe.com

92664
inline	inlining

93236
executable	upx
upx can encrypt compress mac osx executable

93252
tunnel	vpn	rsa	aes

93313
websphere	ibm
the application is a client of ibm websphere mq

93334

do you use separate files ant maven resource filtering or other approaches

93947
ant	maven
you will need to generate a war file or the folder of files that would comprise the war file a project would typically include an ant or maven build script to do this or if the project used eclipse s dynamic web project type there might be a generate war option somewhere

94070
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

94099
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord is very heavy datamapper and domain object are separating those concerns out so you have a more defined set of code doing various aspects for you domain or entity objects

94113
ssl	https
https ssl tls options for wget

94119
easymock	unitils
it is a bit more advanced than the code samples in fowler s article especially when you use the unitils library to wrap easymock so the syntax will be much simpler than that in the article

94141
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will display before during and after while internet explorer first shows during and only then does it show before and after

94172
width	height
i m not sure if there s a way to compute the max height width of a frame in the current windowing environment

94184
mouse	keyboard
my biggest increase in typing when coding was to really learn my ide s keyboard shortcuts since that eliminated the relatively slow process of using the mouse

94195
easymock	jmock
easymock or jmock are definitely the winners

94195
easymock	jmock
i haven t used jmock but i know with easymock you can setup the mock object according to a testing script and it will return certain values in certain situations or points during your test

94216
firefox	safari
if your problem happens in internet explorer but it renders the way you d expect in firefox or safari this link was extraordinarily helpful for me with a similar problem

94224
width	height
just has the added condition where the height is the same as the width

94242
sharepoint	splist
you should be getting the splist object of that particular list using sharepoint object model

94261
children	parent
i think if you set a default size to a element like a container or the body then any relative font-sizes in the children are based on the parent elements

94280
ant	maven
you can specify your environment either by using a user.name variable or by specifying the profile in a -d argument for ant or maven

94280
ant	maven
both ant and maven support these capabilities

94419
superclass	subclassing
a method in a subclassing that used to override the superclass method will no longer do so due the changed method signature

94458
prng	random
sometimes the openssl command line utility does not abort with a prng not seeded error message but complains that it is unable to write random state

94511
getter	setter
if you used a default constructor and exposed the two custom members with getter setter properties you could get away with just setting the attribute

94610
put	get
i can t put the try catch in my callback functions because the exception occurs before they would get called

94627
wxpython	pythoncard
pythoncard uses wxpython

94634
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the user are to respond using free form text boxes checkbox or pre-defined dropdownlistfor

94641
notepad++	scite
using scite notepad++ or other powerful text editor which have file processing routines so you can create a script that colorizes parts of the log or just delete some non-important lines from it

94706
post	get
additionally you may get security warnings from some email clients when trying to do the actual post from your email message over to the web site i m not sure about that as i ve never tried

94706
gmail	hotmail
and be sure to test this using a wide variety of email clients eg thunderbird outlook outlook express gmail yahoo msn hotmail .

94724
cldc	midp
midp 2.1 cldc 1.1 and jsr-75 fileconnection are available

94744
google-chrome	firefox
if you attach scripts dynamically ie firefox and google-chrome will all download the scripts in an asynchronous manner

94744
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will wait till all of the async requests return and then will execute the scripts in the order that they are attached in the dom but ie executes the scripts in the order that they are returned over the wire

94792
vim	emacs
please don t say use emacs as i ve already ramped up on vim and i m really enjoying it as an editor

94850
folder	directory
so make the sub folder a virtual directory on your site and then in the properties of the virtual directory choose the option for a redirection to a url .

94862
vim	emacs
you can give emacs with vim emulation a try is not perfect but it may be somewhat familiar

94894
toolbar	tabs
local bookmarks - i store bookmarks on the browser toolbar in folders so i can middle-click and open all in tabs

94901
opera	firefox
firefox 3 and opera 9.5 do

94974
opera	safari
but it tries as best it can to put a firebug console in ie safari and opera

94975
a-star	dijkstra
i ve read in one of my ai books that popular algorithms a-star dijkstra for path-finding in simulation or games is also used to solve the well-known 15-puzzle

95001
int	double
since an int uses 31 bits + 1 bit for the sign just double 2 30 to get approximately 2 billion

95001
int	double
for an unsigned int using 32 bits double again for 4 billion

95033
hide	show
my understanding is that this simple jquery plugin just show and hide content

95033
hide	show
i can understand some of the mvc+jquery+json articles but i don t understand why the hide show doesn t work

95083
glibc	newlib
pspsdk uses newlib which lacks some of glibc s features and headers

95106
put	get
it would be great if i could just hit a for example and instantly get put into insert mode at the end beginning of the argument list

95121
x86	64bit
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

95168
range	minimum
note that in python 3.0 there is only range and it behaves like the 2.x xrange but without the limitations on minimum and maximum end points

95200
telerik	componentart
my only note is that currently 3rd party control vendors like telerik componentart etc don t really work well with mvc

95208
instances	transient
that being said if you have instances variables that are themselves not serializeable the only way i know of to get around it is to declare those fields transient

95208
serializable	deserialization
when you declare a field transient it will be ignored during the serializable and deserialization process

95210
udp	tcp
udp and tcp ip

95213
post	get
to save which items a user clicks on with no server-side post backs i was thinking a cookie would be a simple way to get this done

95224
serializable	deserialization
you will need to implement writeobject and readobject and do manual serializable deserialization of those fields

95242
persistent	transient
you can start by looking into the transient keyword which marks fields as not part of the persistent state of an object

95317
put	get
you ll have to put up with remembering to get it right

95346
rss	feed
i want to track how much traffic i m getting on an rss feed that is set up using .net 2.0 sql server

95374
rss	feed
even if you don t want to use a 3rd party service it will give you an idea of what other people track for rss feed

95586
serializable	deserialization
i can t think of any use-case for an exception with non-serializable members but if you avoid attempting to serializable deserialize them in getobjectdata and the deserialization constructor you should be ok

95655
post	get
form methods get and post

95715
post	get
the get method is sent to the same url as the post method but without the request parameters

95789
rational-numbers	fractions
a rational-numbers is one that can be represented as a fractions

95821
eruby	erb
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.

95896
inline	constexpr
under c++0x this problem go away if one replaces the keyword inline by constexpr constexpr is inline implicitly

95956
folder	dir
if i use them to iterate through the folder c windows system32 drivers they only find a handful of files although there are 185 when i issue a dir command in a command prompt

96018
webkit	gecko
so in gecko and webkit you d call div.setattribute class foo but in ie you have to use the javascript property name instead so div.setattribute classname foo

96041
swt	swing
some ui frameworks are layers over swing or swt for example a framework could read a description of a screen in xml and instantiate the corresponding swing components

96066
junit	jsunit
currently jsunit works well with junit but it seems to be abandonware and lacks good support for ajax debugging and timeouts

96109
superclass	subclassing
for a method name you get the hierarchy showing superclass and subclassing with implementations of that method distinguished from abstract mentions or classes that don t mention the method

96133
solaris	aix
i have uncovered another problem in the effort that we are making to port several hundreds of ksh scripts from aix solaris and hpux to linux

96150
folder	directory
i believe that there is some kind of permissions issue but can t seem to find any difference between the permissions on the noted folder and the folder directory where the excel file is uploaded

96213
wordpress	joomla
moving to a content manager like drupal joomla wordpress or the like will be much easier if you re already organized with semantic markup too

96313
folder	directory
i ve got a couple large checkouts where the .svn folder has become damaged so i m getting and error cleanup failed to process the following path.. and i can no longer commit or update files in that directory

96372
folder	directory
if you know which folder has the damaged .svn directory you can just delete that one directory and run an svn update again

96372
folder	directory
of course if the folder with the damaged .svn directory is the one containing a gigabyte then you re back where you started

96401
persistent	transient
you can tie the cart to some form of credentials rather than a transient session and persistent the cart long after the user has cleared their cookies

96419
getter	setter
other times you need to generate code using the # and ## concatenation operators like generating getter and setter for a property this is for quite a limited cases through

96486
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
ie firefox opera safari compatible

96490
vbscript	jscript
any comparison to jscript vbscript or dynamic typing is total bunk

96528
svg	vml
raphael is pretty cool for that and works across browsers since it uses vml for msie and svg for everything else

96569
vmware	esx
we use vmware esx 3.5.x exclusively

96574
svg	vml
however native vml can do text on a path and such things much like svg

96574
svg	vml
i think theoretically if you want complex text handling you d want svg and vml like the raphael library that dan mentioned

96641
width	height
so the basic technique is to update the top and left values as the user drags use these together with the defined width and height of the view onto the image to create the appropriate rect string and update the top left and clip properties of the img element s style property

96690
xpand	xtend
but despise those limitations the generation itself is quite easy with oaw you can navigate your models like a charm in xtend and xpand and by combining several workflows into bigger workflows you can also do very complex things

96711
post	get
encapsulate the session array in a session object that allows you to get variables from session get and post with a similar yet dissociable way including automatic security filters flash variables var that are used once then distroyed and default value setters

96765
maven	pom.xml
one of the goals for maven t project object model pom.xml is to capture all information needed to reliably reproduce an artifact thus passing settings impacting the artifact creation is strongly discouraged

96835
opera	safari
then move on to the other standards-based browsers namely safari and opera

96837
pop-up	dialog
it uses a custom control that simply adds code before and after the content to format it as a pop-up dialog

96837
hide	show
the yes button is a hyperlink because it executes javascript to hide the dialog and show a different one

96873
put	get
9 25 08 edit -- i just put up a blog posting on how to patch monodevelop 1.0 and get it working with astyle

96877
punctuation	words
or you can add various punctuation so that you no longer have a simple words in front of the

96982
freebsd	centos	freebsd	debian	debian	centos
runs on centos although debian fedora core freebsd are options if necessary

97027
post	get
i ve developed an open source oauth library for .net and posted an article on beginning to use oauth that might help to get you started - i tried to find a developers page api specification to brightkite - but because it s a beta service i don t have access - so perhaps post me a invite to this service via my blog and i can have a go at developing an example brightkite client at which point this answer can be revisited with some concrete example code useful to others

97096
sorting	grouping
without experiencing any speed penalties as the sorting will be performed on the grouping field anyway

97142
ubuntu	debian
others on debian or ubuntu seem to be able to get rid of this by installing libopenssl-ruby which is not available for redhat

97211
feedback	review
this provides you with even more immediate feedback you review code as you write it

97220
post	put	disk	ram
the proxy starts buffering in ram or in disk the request including headers and post put bodies

97259
vmware	esx
vmware s esx has a similar tool i believe its called esxtop

97373
getter	setter
both languages provide it but c# properties provides a better design for it in regards to setter and getter

97431
google-chrome	safari
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control

97440
getter	setter
instead consider creating an class that has public setter and getter that populate a hash visible only to the object

97528
httphandler	httpmodule
i do not have access to iis 6.0 so i cannot map requests to asp.net and handle with a httphandler httpmodule

97613
single-quotes	backslash
if it s going into an html attribute you ll need to both html-encode as a minimum to to and to it and escape single-quotes with a backslash so they don t interfere with your javascript quoting

97630
getter	setter
assuming you want to serialize the state of the non-serializable field in myclass2 that field must be accessible to myclass either directly or through getter and setter

97630
implements	extends
per item 74 of effective java myclass2 must have a no-arg constructor accessible to myclass otherwise it is impossible for myclass to extends myclass2 and implements serializable

97761
width	margin
then the negative margin is used to move the left hand edge to the left a distance equal to half the element s width thus centering it

97811
many-to-one	one-to-many
if working with byte values you can have many-to-one and one-to-many mappings between the spaces

97850
put	get
i have a 2gb drive to put this on but i can get a bigger one if necessary

97885
bazaar	git
the best answer for you is some sort of dvcs popular ones being git mercurial darcs bazaar ...

97922
pull	push
once you set this up you can use git pull to fetch the changes only you don t need to clone anymore just the first time and git push to push the changes the other way

97937
subtract	add
convert your system.drawing.color to an hslcolor add subtract values against the luminosity and convert back to system.drawing.color for use in your app

97979
disk	ram
if you re doing the work in memory on one machine then ehcache will work perfectly assuming you have enough ram or a fast enough hard disk so that the overflow doesn t cause disk paging thrashing

97994
vim	emacs
an editor like emacs or vim can really focus on being a good editor first and foremost

98030
min	max
i prefer if statements over case statements because they are more readable and more flexible -- you can add other conditions not based on numeric equality like || max min

98048
put	get
obfuscate the password even rot13 will do it won t put up much defense if some does get access to the file but at least it will prevent casual viewing of it

98109
wxpython	pythoncard
later if you wish to make the transition to an event-driven gui paradigm you can do so with a more powerful gui package such as anygui pythoncard tkinter wxpython etc

98127
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
on every browser firefox opera camino safari etc... except for internet explorer i can access my own cookie

98143
cvs	rcs
inside the rcs directory are a bunch of v files which are compatible with cvs should you wish to upgrade to that one day and from there to any of the other vcs systems other posters mentioned

98151
getter	setter
there s also a nice bag of tricks directly available in the menus like generating getter setter extracting interfaces and the like

98225
vim	emacs
addendum the main reason i don t just use vim is that i love how emacs lets you open a file in two different frames added sorry this was confusing i mean separate windows which emacs calls frames

98230
extjs	mootools
jquery prototype extjs dojo mootools yui mochikit the list goes on

98244
getter	setter
i m fairly surprised at how unanimous the sentiment is that getter and setter are fine and good

98244
getter	setter
i suggest the incendiary article by allen holub getter and setter are evil

98244
getter	setter
essentially if you have getter and setter for each and every private field you are making those fields as good as public

98244
getter	setter
the vast majority of getter and setter don t make sense for their constituent objects

98244
getter	setter
getter and setter also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data perform a calculation and then set some other value in the object better known as procedural programming

98244
getter	setter
getter and setter however are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- ui persistence and so forth

98244
getter	setter
restricted access to a class s internals such as c++ s friend keyword java s package protected access .net s internal access and the friend class pattern can help you reduce the visibility of getter and setter to only those who need them

98270
gif	bmp
it is in c++ not c but you should be able to easily extract the bmp and gif load code

98288
jquery	scriptaculous	extjs	mootools	extjs	qooxdoo
a good place to start is with wikipedia s comparison of javascript frameworks which covers dojo extjs jquery midori mochikit mootools prototype scriptaculous qooxdoo yui and sweetdev ria

98427
avr	microcontroller
the arduino is also great because once you get familiar with it you can expand to writing raw c on any of the avr line of microcontroller with ease

98476
cldc	midp
i ve made sure to build it using the correct cldc and midp versions

98480
jobs	cron
this allowed them to notice and fix bugs in cron jobs that had problems

98489
cvs	svn
i m pretty used to how to do cvs merges in eclipse and i m otherwise happy with the way that both subclipse and subversive work with the svn repository but i m not quite sure how to do merges properly

98547
mouse	keyboard
it s great for allowing you to keep your hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

98586
perl	tcl
our current best is derived from the best of perl + tcl s atof implementation and outperforms msvcrt.dll s atof by an order of magnitude

98586
perl	tcl
the bcd related x86 instructions seemed promising but i couldn t get it to outperform the perl tcl c code

98606
mouse	keyboard
i m always up for leaving my hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

98653
tetris	pong
i ve been quite used to working on small projects which i coded with 1 000 lines or less pong tetris simple 3d games etc

98657
concave	convex
it depends whether you use sprites concave polygons convex polygons rectangles squares circles points.

98669
versioning	upgrade
however when i upgrade to prototype 1.6.0.2 the latest versioning from prototypejs.org everything breaks

98710
ocp	principles
ocp the open closed principles you

98751
lisp	scheme
i would never want to program in scheme or lisp again if i didn t have to but i am glad that i at least did a little in them just to learn the different way to program

98869
uniq	csplit
commands like head tail split csplit cat shuf shred uniq really help a lot in text manipulation

98869
put	get
for example if you need to put some chars in a 2gb file you can use split -b bytecount put the ouptut in to a file append the new text to it and get the rest of the content and add to it

98872
multiplying	add
the simplest is to loop for each digit character in the string keep a running total multiplying the total by 10 then add the value of the next digit

98872
multiplying	add
multiplier 0.1 multiplying by 4 get 0.4 add to running total makes 123.4

98872
multiplying	add
multiplier 0.1 10 0.01 multiplying by 5 get 0.05 add to running total makes 123.45

98872
multiplying	add
multipiler 0.01 10 0.001 multiplying by 6 get 0.006 add to running total makes 123.456

98918
lsp	principles	ocp	lsp	ocp	principles
as mentioned above some of the fundamental object oriented design principles are ocp lsp dip and isp

98934
integer	unsigned
for standard notation convert the aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd netmask into an unsigned 4 byte integer many networking libraries have this function and subtract that from 2 32 - 2

98938
getter	setter
it seems that many people understand information hiding in principle but then also think that getter and setter for everything properties for everything is an example of it

98938
getter	setter
the incendiary article by allen holub called why getter and setter are evil can be an eye-opener on the topic

98938
getter	setter
in short private members with direct getter and setter are little more than dressed-up public members

98938
getter	setter
it is true that getter and setter are needed at layer boundaries ui persistence etc but their visibility should be restricted to those classes that have a legitimate need to call them

98939
accessor	properties
you may ask why are you making accessor that just provided the exact same access that making the original properties public

98952
put	get
i haven t used this code for a put so i m not exactly sure if it s right for you but it might get you close

98977
integer	fractions
you will do better accuracy-wise to compute the integer and fractions parts separately and compute the fractions at the end for 12345.6789 compute it as 12345 + 6789 10000.0 rather than 6 .1 + 7 .01 + 8 .001 + 9 0.0001 since 0.1 is an irrational binary fractions and error will accumulate rapidly as you compute 0.1 n

99014
getter	setter
if everything is done with getter and setter and no other behavior you re writing procedural code

99014
getter	setter
there are plenty of patterns to deal with this problem and they don t involve reducing everything to bags of getter and setter

99086
getter	setter
this is why getter and setter are common .

99086
getter	setter
i think you re usually better off maintaining state in private variables and providing getter and setter as a public interface to them when outside objects need to access them mostly because you ll always have the option to provide some kind of validation or transformation if it becomes necessary down the line without breaking your interface

99121
lisp	scheme
languages like lisp and the very closely related scheme are to programming what latin is to english

99127
google-chrome	firefox
other than that i would suggest running your tests in firefox using google-chrome as it produces much more reliable results but sometimes it is simply not possible due to business requirements

99166
post	put
yes i am repeating some but i think the idea was to put one in each post and let the good ones float up

99228
for-loop	loops
i agree that the for-loop should be used whenever possible but sometimes there s more complex logic that controls the iterator in the body of loops

99239
lisp	scheme
though it s not blazingly fast like a compiled language nor is it particularly useful at serving websites or parsing text i ve found that scheme and other lisp by extension has no parallel when it comes to simplicity elegance and powerful functional manipulation of complex data structures

99260
tax	shipping
it may require things like sales tax shipping costs customer discounts

99337
accessor	properties	getter	setter
this is somewhat more nuanced than simply not exposing internal data - merely placing accessor methods or properties getter setter between internal data and the cold outside world is no more information hiding than launching into a conversation about this friend of mine and his herpes problem.

99386
pull	push
if you have control over the content or can gain control through mirroring or scraping you should consider using ajax or server-side includes to pull external data onto and push it off of the page - it ll end up being more flexible more robust and easier to manage in the end

99485
strtok	malloc	printf	strtok
this library contains your printf your malloc your strtok etcetera

99508
bazaar	git
it integrate with your source countrol system including git subversion mercurial bazaar tla and monotone so all your docs track with your project

99520
put	get
so although i can put together a test project that exercises the interop layer i can t get a sense for how many of those methods and properties i m actually calling

99565
stateless	stateful
connection pools are simply a bridge between the post-web era of stateless applications http protocol and the pre-web era of stateful long-lived batch processing applications

99568
put	get
now for a rectangle vertex put the x value in the line equation get the y value and see if the y value lies in the rectangle bounds shown below

99616
folder	directory
with weborb you can simply deploy your dlls into the bin folder of the virtual directory and it will take care of enabling your classes as flex remoting services

99659
mouseup	mousedown
the action of clicking is broken into its two parts mousedown and mouseup

99702
int	double
say you want two hashtables one that maps objects of type string to type int and one that maps objects of type string to type double

99724
put	get
if you are developing a site that accepts passwords don t put a silly password limit unless you want to get tarred with the same brush

99729
getter	setter
i could have getter and setter for the x and y coordinates or i could just make them both public and allow free read write access to the data

99745
getter	setter
working with dependency injection a lot you often have setter but no getter as clients should be able to configure the object but others not get to know what s acutally configured as this is an implementation detail

99751
getter	setter
public getter and setter is pretty much equivalent to public fields.

99756
internationalization	localization
use errorcodes when you need localization internationalization -- in .net you could use these errorcodes to reference a resource file which will then display the error in the appropriate language

99791
getter	setter
usable by anything outside of the current class accessed via getter setter

99796
octree	quadtree
i have also briefly perused material relating to quadtree and octree

99817
octree	quadtree
i don t have much experience with bsps but i can say that you should go with octree over quadtree when you the scene you re rendering is tall

99817
width	height
that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb

99817
octree	quadtree
generally octree won t bring a huge cost over quadtree and they have the potential to speed things up a decent bit

99848
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but it works in firefox safari and google-chrome

99926
octree	quadtree
two dimensions means a quadtree four an octree

99926
octree	quadtree
as stated as quadtree can work in three-space but if you want each dimension given a proper treatment an octree is the way to go

99954
yacc	bison
lex flex and yacc bison provide easy-to-use well-understood lexer- and parser-generators and i d really recommend doing something like that as opposed to doing it procedurally in perl

99954
verilog	vhdl
also if you re lazy check out the eclipse plugins that do syntax highlighting and basic refactoring for verilog and vhdl

99999
hex	binary
the methods you are allowed to use might be restricted by the author - no patching no disassembling - or involve anything you can do with a binary objdump and a hex editor

100020
awt	swing
java api including swing awt o

metaclass	subclassing
note that the magic behaviour that initalised gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclassing of initalised

100037
metaclass	subclassing
here is an even more concrete example showing how you can subclassing type to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created

100038

try-catch	exception-handling
and try-catch where you actually catch an exception-handling you re able to handle is good or if you do this

100315
getter	setter
from experience the only times you d want to make a member variable public and leave out getter and setter methods is if you want to make it absolutely clear that changing it will have no side effects

100315
getter	setter
also if you re writing a data structure as a way of finding out about how they store data rather than as release code then there s a good argument that getter and setter will not help and will get in the way of the learning experience

100334
rss	feed
allows you to consume and apply xslt transform to any rss feed and output the result on any sharepoint page

100350

the most important factor in choosing a secure payment clearance service the people who will connect to the banking networks and clear the money for you - will refer to them as spcs is how many widgets will you be selling at what cost

100758
put	get
simply put if you buy something on a credit card your card provider is liable for ensure you get what you paid for broadly speaking in most countries does not constitute legal advice etc. and if you have a problem with your purchase they will refund you very quickly and then will go and chase the person that you paid

100802
opera	firefox
opera and ie these days treat getyear as getyear was originally specified for dates before 2000 but will treat it as getfullyear for dates after 2000 while webkit and firefox stick with the old behavior

i managed to get a selection of rowkey objects but can t find out how to get the original objects i put in back

100838
vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6
i wrote basics for years ms-basic gw-basic quick-basic visual basic vbscript and it was very difficult to use vb.net because i always try to write things as i used to do with vb6 or vbscript

100928
httphandler	httpmodule
however creating your own http module to do something similar is of course trivial -- the onbeginrequest handler could look as follows in this case implementation for a httphandler shown but in a httpmodule the idea is exactly the same

100930
opera	firefox
code for mozilla firefox opera etc

100937
lisp	scheme

that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

101428
ubuntu	linux
kernal operating system virtual server instance linux windows server windows home ubuntu aix zseries os 390 et al

101507
ssl	https
i would first try to figure out why your application is crashing on https ssl connections

101561
mvp	presenter
in mvp the presenter contains the ui business logic for the view

101561
mvp	presenter
this differs from mvp where actions route through the view to the presenter

101561
mvp	presenter
this is contrary to mvp where it is absolutely necessary because if the view does not delegate to the presenter it will never get called

101656
n-gram	words
basically an n-gram is splitting a words into smaller chunks

101701
sniffing	wlan
you will not lose your password for site a if your password for site b gets in the wrong hands due to an evil admin wlan sniffing or site compromise for example yet you will only have to remember a single password

101879
post	get
it makes the environment get post cookie and server variables global php manual

101905
minimum	max
the obvious upper bound is max heap size divided by the minimum amount of memory required to service a request but even that is hard to measure in an environment with a garbage collector.

101927
postgresql	mysql
for small-medium look at mysql or postgresql

101966
post	put
you can check out this post to find out how to put together a basic modelbinder

101988
opera	safari
if every developer had written code for fx safari and opera i think ie had to start following the rules sooner than with version 8

101991
apache	nginx
my preferred server is nginx but the common pattern is to start with apache + mod_proxy_http

102018
bibtex	latex
if you re doing any serious work with latex you ll find make very handy because of the need to re-interpret .tex files several times when using bibtex or tables of contents

102055
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

102059
width	height
with previous versions of flash entering the full screen mode increased the height and width of the stage to the dimensions of the screen

102059
width	height
now that hardware scaling has arrived the height and width are set to the dimensions of the video plus borders if the aspect ratio is different

102094
macports	homebrew
there are different cases depending on whether you installed mysql with the official binary installer using macports or using homebrew

102261
firefox	safari
firebug works great in firefox which isn t having this problem nor is safari so i m hoping someone might spot something obviously wrong with the way my code will play with ie

102261
firefox	safari
single clicks collapse and expand tables in firefox safari but ie tables require multiple clicks a seemingly arbitrary number between 1 and 5 to expand

102599
cvs	svn
one of the essential differences between svn and cvs is that changes are committed atomically

102599
cvs	svn
in cvs each file has its own version but in svn the version is for the whole project and includes all the files checked in together

102643
rsa	aes
i would use aes for the bulk data encryption and rsa for encrypting the aes key

102657

edit - i added a scriptmanager control and wrapped the buttons in an updatepanel however now i m receiving the following error

102686
hide	show
ctrl + r â show hide results pane

102690
equals	gethashcode
then we can make two instances of some reference type which are actually equals because of the overloaded gethashcode and equals

102690
equals	gethashcode
for complicated dictionary keys you must override equals and gethashcode correctly

102716
put	get
you get a root page via a http get parse it to find urls and put them on a queue unless they ve been parsed already so you need a global record of pages you have already parsed

102717
extjs	gxt
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs

102717
extjs	gxt
anyways gxt is still somewhat immature and lacks a solid community that i feel gwt extjs has

102717
extjs	gxt
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs

102717
extjs	gxt
for more information on extjs gwt gxt

102747
ant	maven-jar-plugin
strong tool support exists for creating manifest files a core ant task for example or the maven-jar-plugin

102752
getter	setter
the sqldataadapter implements idbdataadapter which has getter setter for all the crud commands

102756
translation	localization
managing localization and translation using .rc files and visual studio is not a good idea

102788
crypt	md5
a hashing function md5 sha1 crypt etc is not suitable as i would like to be able to decrypt the information as well

102836
equals	gethashcode
don t override gethashcode and equals on mutable classes only override it on immutable classes or structures else if you modify a object used as key the hash table won t function properly anymore you won t be able to retrieve the value associated to the key after the key object was modified

102862
vim	emacs
on the mac or nix you can use command line or gui versions of emacs or vim

102914
post	get
you can use a phaselistener to convert post requests to get requests or just to interpret get requests so that they can be bookmarkable

102924
actionscript	mxml
that is also how it is done behind the scenes when the mxml in your example is transformed to actionscript before being compiled

102924
actionscript	mxml
...except that the code generated by the mxml to actionscript conversion is longer as it has to be more general

102977
google-chrome	safari
because google-chrome uses the webkit to render html you can be assured if it works in safari it ll work under google-chrome however it s rendering engine isn t up to scratch quite yet

102995
google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox mostly and have google-chrome for the other websites at work

102997
ncover	fxcop
cruise control will be automatically pulling the source from visual source safe ok it isn t subversion but we can deal compiling it and then running it through fxcop nunit ncover and last but not lease simian

103010
google-chrome	firefox
i switched to google-chrome and haven t looked back except for the occasional site which doesn t work properly forcing me to load it in firefox

103053
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but i definately now make sure sites i work on render well in google-chrome as well as firefox latest versions of ie safari konquerer and opera

103117
rsa	aes
assuming that you have a safe way of sharing a key whether rsa encryption of it retrieval over an ssh or https link or callling the other developer on a secured phone line any of the major modern encryptions like aes as mentioned by ed haber would be suitable

103130
cvs	svn
they have versions for svn and cvs

103143
post	get
just a guess the handler specified in iis7 s windir system32 inetsrv config applicationhost.config which is handling your request is not allowing the post verb to get through at all and it is evaluating that rule before determining whether the url doesn t exist

103184
hash	salt
i assume we are vulnerable in this case so we should probably store a salt along with the hash

103226
hash	salt
a salt hash should work just fine

103233
hash	salt
if indeed you choose good random salt you ll have to do the hash for every other card in your system

103233
hash	salt
you see in the password world a salt adds no cost because we just want to know if the clear text + salt hash to what we have stored for this particular user

103285
int	double
any other cast will not work trying to unbox an int to a double and will result in a compile time runtime error depending on the situation and what can be detected by static type checking

103326
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a relational database management system while postgresql is an object -relational database management system

103384
reentrantreadwritelock	futuretask
in any case as you probably know terracotta gives you the ability to express concurrency across the cluster the same way you do in a single jvm by using pojo synchronized wait notify or by using any of the java.util.concurrent primitives such as reentrantreadwritelock cyclicbarrier atomiclong futuretask and so on

103391
filesystems	ntfs
it helps a bit to deactivate the ntfs filesystems feature to keep track of the last file-access

103431
math.h	sqrt
including math.h will tell the compiler that the math functions like sqrt exist but they are defined in a separate library which the linker needs to pack with your executable

103474
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i d like to use the ide to add the service not muck with wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe

103554
post	get
first you get or post your request

103554
post	get
to accomplish steps 1 and 2 below is a simple php class which uses curl to fetch webpages using either get or post

103579
hash	salt
even if they had the salt hash and the method you used

103598
opera	safari
others safari opera have adopted support for it but support on older browsers is unreliable

103648
ssl	https
i m unclear why transmitting the passwords over ssl -- via https -- is being considered insecure by your audit team

103653
hash	salt
use a salt highly secure computationally expensive hash like sha-256 with a per-record unique salt

103653
hash	salt
if the simple check hits use the salt get the hash value do the in depth check

103669
profiler	gprof
mastery of a profiler gprof ...

103711
integer	unsigned
given an unsigned int 0 is 0 or 360 degrees and the max 32 bit unsigned integer 0xffffffff is the biggest value just below 360 degrees

103737
post	get
on my own site i assign each entry a unique integer from a monotonically increasing series newer post get higher numbers

103813
post	get
if you want to maintain the value of the label between calls you need to use one of the state mechanisms session preferences or communication systems request get post

103818
cassini	iis	kerberos	ntlm
you will run into so issues on the cassini vs iis when you are debugging certain permission based scenarios like kerberos and ntlm authentication as well as issues like server compression etc

103818
cassini	iis
all in all the cassini is still okay to dev with but make sure you do extensive testing when publishing to iis

103869
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
after getting comfortable with the way svn works then you can get into distributed version control systems like git bazaar or mercurial but i ve seen enough professional developers have problems wrapping their heads around the basics of version control branching merging etc that i d get comfortable with that first before moving to distributed systems

103871
int	double
both of these cast the int value to a double

104018
inherited	properties
if the js implementation you re using supports the hasownproperty method for objects you can use it to test whether a properties has explicitly been set for an object or the properties is inherited from its prototype

104087
rpm	yum
i don t think you can list the contents of a package using yum but if you have the .rpm file on your local system as will most likely be the case for all installed packages you can use the rpm command to list the contents of that package like so

104093
rpm	yum
so you can use yum to list the available rpms and then run the rpm -qlp command to see the contents of that package

104126
width	height
if you set the width or height of the decoratorpanel you need to set the height and width of the middlecenter cell to 100 so that the middlecenter cell takes up all of the available space

104126
width	height
if you do not set the width and height of the decoratorpanel it will wrap its contents tightly

104207
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable t you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable t equals method

104264
cassini	iis
all the previous responses are great answers - here s one gottcha with cassini that might require iis on the destkop

104264
cassini	iis
cassini runs in the context of the developer not as the iis user iusr_ iwam or in winxp x64 the w3wp process

104264
cassini	iis
when you move to the server iis something that you would have had access to in cassini doesn t work the same

104292
folder	directory
my project builds fine on my development machine as the source is only two folder deep but tf build seems to use a really deep directory that is causing it to break

104292
folder	directory
currently my working directory is temp builddefinitionpath but now i don t know what wildcards are available to specify a different folder

104313
post	get
i need to handle form data most likely using post but i want to handle the get case as well

104313
post	get
it provides code examples for post and get which return an apr_hash_t of the key+value pairs in the form

104339
int	chars
looking at the switch statement i see that i can only handle int chars etc and not objects.

104360
folder	directory
once done flex will create a generated directory in your source folder and inside you ll find all teh temporary as files that were used during compilation

104381
versioning	upgrade
that said almost every computer online has some form of the flash player though it might not be the needed versioning 9 for flex apps it can easily be upgrade through a simple click in the browser

104394
inherited	subclassing
having to subclassing a winproc when you re more familiar with object inherited is head-splitting and less than optimal

104451
hash	salt
storing credit cards using a simple single pass of a hash algorithm even when salt is fool-hardy

104451
hash	salt
when hashing credit card number the hashing must be carefully designed to protect against brute forcing by using strongest available cryptographic hash functions large salt values and multiple iterations

104473
system.in	system.out
and sadly since console is final you can t extend it to create a a wrapper around system.in and system.out that does it either

104510
free	malloc
the c and jni code can allocate memory as well malloc free new etc which is outside of the vm s 256m

104530
allocator	stl
stl containers with default allocator don t do anything fancy they all end up allocator via standard new delete operators somehow

104531
cairngorm	puremvc
i found cairngorm and puremvc to have a pretty steep learning curve and they both feel a bit too bulky for me

104617
udp	tcp
i m using udp not tcp at this time

104618
put	get
i ve been trying to get into f# on and off for a while but i keep getting put off

104622
arp	snmp
if you haven t already try hp openview trial version and apart of using snmp it also uses arp tables to figure out your topology

104632
hash	salt
from there you can change passwords or whatever you need to do never send the password though - you should always store it as a salt hash anyway always change it

104693
int	chars
grab a chars if it s a number chars keep grabbing then reassemble to chars into a single number string and convert it into an int

104727
rsa	dsa
scp will do the job but there is one wrinkle the connection to the second remote destination will use the configuration on the first remote destination so if you use .ssh config on the local environment and you expect rsa and dsa keys to work you have to forward your agent to the first remote host

104763
cvs	svn
i don t know about cvs but if going to svn is an option there s always ankh

104770
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you can make more than one movieclip dragging at once using events mousedown mousemove and mouseup

104770
move	drag
in mousemove if the flag is set calculate move offset and just change .x and .y of all movieclips you want to drag

104804
rss	feed
you could also have an rss feed tying into the application that would publish an update as soon as something occurred

104855
move	drag
here s an example that implements drag functionality for an object that will also move a bunch of sibling objects along with it

104877
postgresql	mysql
just for completeness since mysql and postgresql have already been mentioned with sqlite use pragma table_info

104890
csla	.net
i read an article by rocky lhotka .net legend inventor of csla etc where he mentioned almost in passing that last year he felt very terribly overwheled by the rate of change

104939
getter	setter
deletepersoncommand will have the execute and in the execute can check attribute that will be passed by getter setter previously the call of the execute

104960
postgresql	mysql
edit i d like to be free to choose from postgresql mysql and sqlite as far as the actual databases go

104966
apache	nginx
choose a server architecture nginx mongrel fastcgi cgi apache passenger there is a lot to choose from

104966
put	get
make sure all of your passwords are out of source control if you have database.yml mail.yml if you use yaml_mail_config or other sensitive files in source control get them out of there replace them with database.yml.example and put them in the shared folder on your server

104966
apache	nginx
if you want a be right back page to be present when you deploy make sure that you have a capistrano maintenance file specified and nginx or apache knows how and when to redirect to it

105013
int	chars
such as int string returns float chars

105024
spaces	delimiter
i ve tried comma delimiting semi-colon delimiting and even spaces delimiter

105035
children	parent
by default the container is the browser window but if a parent element either has position relative or position absolute set on it then it will act as the parent for positioning coordinates for its children

105047
spaces	delimiter
semi-colon delimiter with no spaces

105118
next	except
a block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no html elements next to it except when ordered otherwise by adding a float declaration to another element for instance

105246
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
it s important to note that inline elements cannot be assigned their own width height or vertical whitespace margin padding top bottom

105266
mouse	keyboard
javascript looking for mouse movement keyboard activity and scrolling

105287
nunit	mstest
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105287
nunit	mstest
in my current project we use both and the only big diffrence we found is that mstest always runs as a 32bit while nunit runs as either 32bit or 64bit test which only matters if your code uses native code that is 32 64 dependant

105303
iprincipal	iidentity
another disadvantage i ve run into is on a forms authenticated website using custom iprincipal iidentity

105303
cassini	iis
check this blog post for more.the headache on this made me drop cassini and stick with iis

105327
client-side	server-side
this hash could perhaps be inserted into the html document server-side for use by the client-side javascript

105339
int	double
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

105352
ant	maven
it s flexable like ant while leveraging maven s dependency system

105368
width	height
an inline element does not define a box that s why you cannot set its width and height it will be appended to other inline elements in the current block

105391
maven	pom.xml
you can declaratively define your project s dependencies in maven s config file called the project object model pom.xml and maven does the work of storing all the jars in a local directory structure that it maintains

105391
jar	war
that means that if your project depends on jar a and a depends on jar b jar b will automatically be bundled with your war even though you don t explicitly list it as a dependency in your build config

105391
ant	maven
also i ll say from a professional development standpoint it makes sense to learn maven since in my experience maven has overtaken ant as the de jure build tool of choice both in open source and proprietary java projects

105543
silverstripe	modx
well silverstripe is thought to be a good option for people who care about web standards as is modx

105545
expression-blend	silverlight
get them a copy of expression-blend the gui development tool for silverlight wpf

105570
maven	cargo
maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin

105737
free	calloc
the concept you are missing here is that for every calloc there must be a free

105737
free	calloc
and that free must be applied to the pointer passed back from calloc

105817
terminate	timeout
if you have solid proof using the query plan that the query can t be executed any faster than that then you should increase the timeout there s no other way to keep the connection that s the purpose of the timeout to terminate the connection if the query doesn t complete in that time frame

106018
put	get
put your value into a byte array then getstring to get the c# native string for the character

106168
mbunit	nunit	testdriven.net	xunit.net
also if you lack a plugin such as testdriven.net you cannot debug your nunit or mbunit xunit.net etc. unit tests within the visual studio environment as you can with the microsoft vs testing framework which is built in

106176
lisp	scheme
the law says to me that scheme or any other lisp

106252
stdout	stderr
if by logging you mean system.out.println or system.err.println and if you re sure that your test really doesn t need the logs then you can redirect stdout and stderr programmatically

106336
int	double
i have a arraylist made up of different elements imported from a db made up of strings numbers double and int

106365
ncover	testdriven.net
i also like testdriven.net because it integrates nunit for unit testing ncover for code coverage and reflector for disassembling the .net framework

106469
public	protected
in c++ you simply specify a modifier before the base class of private public or protected

106485
mouse	keyboard
increases the productivity a lot and i am keyboard freak who hates using mouse

106509
submit	submission
i have a button that i would like to disable when the form submit to prevent the user submission multiple times

106553
queue	fifo
when creating a mutex semaphore in vxwroks you have two options to deal with multiple tasks queue waiting for the semaphore fifo or highest priority task first

106553
queue	fifo
if you were to use a fifo queue for the semaphore the kernel would have to traverse the queue of tasks waiting for the mutex to find the one with the highest priority

106771
int	boolean
and not just in java but also in c#. there are times when you need to get or set a value that is guaranteed to be an atomic operation on your given platform an int or boolean for example but do not require the overhead of thread locking

106837
ant	maven
it also has good integration with project sprouts which is a build tool for flex and flash similar to ant however it uses ruby rake tasks and includes excellent dependency management along the lines of maven

106842
width	height
when i say adjust the image size i don t mean set the height and width in the html image tag

106843
width	height
simply create a class that has the appropriate width and height values set and make all tags use this class

106861
firefox	safari	width	height
it s worth noting that in firefox 3 and safari resizing an image by just changing the height and width doesn t look too bad

106915
width	height
pre-load them into javascript image objects then just reference the height and width

106925
width	height
you can get the height width of an image after the page loads via javascript info then you could resize the height of the div after loading

106942
munin	cacti
munin and cacti provide very nice interfaces and pre-built scripts for rrdtool

106969
public	protected
private protected internal public give classes variables properties and functions the least amount of visibility they need for everything to still work

106990
public	protected
as some other answers have said in general go for the highest level of encapsulation as possible ie private unless you actually need internal protected public

107053
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
in functional programming languages erlang haskell ml ocaml f# etc. it s very common to have any list processing use recursion

107066
post	get
i decided to post it here to get feedback on the idea

107096
put	get
when i put the ccommandbar.insertmenubar before i create child dialogs i do not get my ok or cancel soft keys when i put that line after the creation of child dialogs the softkeys show as expected and work great

107131
svg	vml
there are two very nice browser-based vector javascript-manipulable graphics packages which together are virtually universal svg and vml

107131
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
svg is supported by firefox opera safari and google-chrome - technically only part of the specification is supported but for practical purposes you should be able to do what you need

107131
svg	vml
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not

107131
svg	vml
by the way you say that you re asking for an algorithm and i m offering technologies if that s the right term for svg vml

107133
inherited	properties
i can t specifically answer the question except that the issynchronized and syncroot properties but not synchronise explicitly are inherited from the icollection interface

107149
width	margin
this will position the first letter on the right edge of the paragraph then shove it left it by more or less the width of the paragraph then move both the letter and all the padding into the float s large negative margin so the paragraph fits in the margin and doesn t try to wrap around

107209
int	boolean
you could represent these connections as an array of eight boolean values or much more compactly as an eight bit int

107209
int	boolean
its then easy to use the eight boolean values or the eight bit int to form the filename of the bitmap to load for that grid square

107209
int	boolean
for example your center tile using this scheme could be called bitmap01000011.png just using the boolean values or alternatively bitmap43.png using the hexidecimal value of the eight bit int representing that binary pattern for a shorter filename

107234
put	get
in my head it s as simple as replacing a select stuff where tag buffer-overflow with select stuff where tag not in php offtopic funny-hat-friday but i ve not put together any db backed sites that get absolutely pounded on by thousands people

107301
subtraction	addition
each addition or subtraction mean the subsequent prior element in the array

107349
quicksort	mergesort
if you look at the quicksort or mergesort algorithms you will see that they both take the approach of dividing the list to be sorted in half sorting each half using the same algorithm recursively and then recombining the two halves

107358
unix	sunos
i don t know if this advice applies to sunos or any unix

107364
width	height
pass in a size with the desired width and a maximum height and then you can look at the height returned to fit the text

107426
post	put
a put is used to update existing data at a given url or to create something new when you know what the uri is going to be and it doesn t already exist as opposed to a post which will create something and return a url to it if necessary

107431
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
instead of doing malloc followed by memset you should be using calloc which will clear the newly allocated memory for you

107450
post	put
difference between post and put

107450
post	put
post and put requests is reflected in

107466
mouseup	mousedown
you can always use the mousedown or mouseup event and check to see if it the selected node

107480
inherited	properties
it can support oop because supports inherited through prototyping also properties and methods

107490
jboss	glassfish
if you are developing an application that would be deployed to application server tomcat jboss glassfish etc you don t have to handle concurrency control yourself as it already addressed by the application server

107510
addition	multiplication
you can then take the quaternion product which uses only simple multiplication and addition of the current rotation quaternion and incremental rotation quaternion to get a new quaternion which represents performing both rotations

107510
addition	multiplication
converting the quaternion to a rotation matrix is very straightforward uses only multiplication and addition when you want to display the model in its rotated state using traditional graphics api s

107520
rpm	yum
on at least one rh system with rpm v4.8.0 yum v3.2.29 and repoquery v0.0.11 repoquery -l rpm prints nothing

107542
post	put
one other difference is that put should be idempotent - multiple puts of the same data to the same url should be fine wheras multiple post might create multiple objects or whatever it is your post action does

107552
vmware	virtualbox
we have played a bit with vmware virtualpc virtualbox etc creating a virtual build server but we came across a lot of issues when we tried to copy it for others to use having to reconfigure every new copy of the vm

107557
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
one of its functions is to generate a changelog entry from your local diff currently supporting bazaar cvs svn git and darcs

107599
post	put
others have already posted excellent answers i just wanted to add that with most languages frameworks and use cases you ll be dealing with post much much more often than put

107619
ubuntu	debian
the following command is probably the only one for which i ve used awk in the last two years it purges half-removed packages from my debian ubuntu systems

107650
bmp	png	png	ico
i ve used it a lot in my projects since a winform needs an ico file for it s icon while i usually have png or bmp files

107657
multiplying	add
he investigated a number of string hashing functions on a variety of datasets and found that a simple multiplying by 101 and add loop worked surprisingly well

107668
udp	tcp
i m interested in the various options here of which tcp is at one end of the scale and udp is at the other

107668
udp	tcp
various reliable udp options are available and each brings some elements of tcp to udp

107679
jsf	seam
template-based frameworks are very good for this but we ve had some good experiences with jsf + facelets + seam too

107688
post	get
when you re not certain where the values are populated or when you use them both and want to loop over all values by both post and get methods

107727
post	get
is only a shortcut to prevent you from testing post get and cooking if the data can come from any of these

107727
post	get
data are taken from get post and finally cookie

107727
post	get
rest architectures require to separate the post and get semantics you can t rely on in that case

107783
sctp	tcp
update a comparison between tcp and sctp shows that the performances are comparable unless two interfaces can be used

107874
rss	feed
you can point an rss viewer web part at the laconi.ca public stream rss feed and use this xslt to ensure attractive output

107878
versioning	upgrade
i m re-writing it in .net so i don t want to pay 600+ for an upgrade to the latest versioning of coldfusion nor do i want to go through the very large site fixing versioning incompatibilities

107883
quicksort	heapsort
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

107883
quicksort	heapsort
this is because heapsort does a few more comparisons per element than quicksort

108027
put	get
i have no idea what can cause this but i would try to find out by subclassing qdrag overwrite deletelater well reimplement it but as it s a slot it will get called anyway use this instead of a qdrag and put a breakpoint in deletelater

108030
udp	tcp
if you want to get reliability out of udp then you re basically going to be re-implementing some of tcp s features on top of udp which will probably make things slower than just using tcp in the first place

108047
toolbar	docking
we currently use a very old version of stingray objective toolkit to provide our mfc extensions like customizable toolbar and docking windows etc

108102
lisp	smalltalk
the thing that i like most about lisp and smalltalk systems is that they feel alive

108218
onfocus	onblur
you can add and remove a special css class and modify the input value onfocus onblur with javascript

108250
post	get
drag it on the stage - select a control panel - double click controls to edit with the flash drawing tools - post to the website.you might have to use a flashvar to get the url into the url but that s fairly trivial.

108292
reverse-dns	spf
configuring and using sender-id domain-keys spf reverse-dns etc to make sure your emails are properly identified

108388
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
run parallels vmware or bootcamp

108451
udp	tcp
if you need the reliable in-order delivery of tcp and also the fast response of udp and don t need to worry about congestion from sending large streams of data you can disable nagle s algorithm

108467
hide	show
it depends on how much encapsulated you want your class to be and what you want to hide or show

108507
xslt	xquery
personally i found xslt easier to learn than xquery

108507
xslt	xquery
xquery is a fantastic tool for selecting pieces of xml from a large repository but we still use xslt to transform our documents

108511
spaces	delimiter
note that overwrites the default spaces and tab delimiter so that the output of the date command gets gobbled all at once

108511
linefeed	delimiter
to capture multi-line output it can still essentially be a one-liner using the variable linefeed as the delimiter in the resulting variable

108545
post	get
i use post when i don t want people to have easy access to what is being passed and i use get when i don t mind them seeing the value in the url

108577
feedback	review
constant communication with chances for review and feedback will give users a better understanding of what you are delivering

108579
free	malloc
operator new and operator delete are c++ s closest equivalent to malloc and free and as these in the absence of class overrides are called as appropriate by new and delete expressions they can with care

108585
asterisk	pbx
here s one i did for the asterisk pbx a long time ago as an example

108649
hash	md5
i think jeremy has hit the nail on the head - if you just want to detect if files are different a hash algorithm like md5 or sha1 is a good way to go

108650
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
edit in response to chris i have set the partialchars parameter to 1 and the control works in all the other browsers i ve tried which are the latest versions of firefox safari opera and google-chrome

108692
getter	setter
there is a well-known debate in java and other communities i m sure whether or not trivial getter setter methods should be tested

108692
getter	setter
an annotation that says this test t should auto-test all the getter setter on class c because i assert that they are standard

108711
getter	setter
i doubt that autotesting getter and setter benefit your code quality or your coverage either these methods are used from other code and tested there 100 covered or not used at all and could be removed

108711
getter	setter
in the end you ll leave getter and setter in because they are used from the test but nowhere else in the application

108758
getter	setter
so i would try to see if those getter and setter can be removed as suggested before

108758
getter	setter
getter and setter are breaking encapsulation

108820
cvs	svn
it lets you build applications with a svn cvs git like user interface easily your-command -o --long-opt some-action-to-execute some parameters

108862
profiling	benchmarking
programming languages have profiling like pear benchmarking

108884
memcpy	memset
the compiler will replace small memcpy s and memset s with more suitable code so it is not as horrible is it looks

108910
outputstream	inputstream	system.in	system.out
your command line interface class should accept an inputstream as it s input and provide an outputstream it can t hardcode output to system.out and input to system.in that it s output will be written to

108910
outputstream	inputstream
when a connection is made the server would take the inputstream from the connection and give it to the command line class which would provide the outputstream that data written to will be passed to the client that made the connection

108925
jar	war
if the former then the war is just a normal jar file and you can execute classes in that just like any other other jar file

108949
ssl	https
and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server

108959
multiplication	exponent
it is probably the best you can do as a general method that works for all exponent values but for a specific exponent value there might be a better sequence that needs fewer multiplication

108980
getter	setter
in the most cases setter and getter do more as only setting and getting an internal field

108980
getter	setter
if you have no logic on the setter and getter then it must be used anywhere in your application

108980
getter	setter
test your business logic and not the getter and setter

108980
getter	setter
the result should also a coverage of the getter and setter

108980
getter	setter
if the getter and setter have no code coverage then removed it

108984
postgresql	mysql
the underlying database oracle microsoft mysql postgresql others custom.

108995
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
sometimes even in c++ you have to make profit of the malloc realloc free utils

108995
realloc	malloc
and in c you could override malloc and realloc etc. through templates to achieve type-safety

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
the question has already been asked however since you ask specifically for the benefits of cairngorm and puremvc specifically these are my thoughts

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
both puremvc and cairngorm make it hard to write testable code

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
this is more true of cairngorm than puremvc but both are pretty bad

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself

109038
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex

109038
cairngorm	flex
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits

109038
cairngorm	mate
if you for some reason don t like mate try swiz which is a great improvement over cairngorm but still has some weird preference for using global variables for central event dispatching which is completely bizarre considering that one of the points of the framework is to avoid the evil global variables of cairngorm

109061
anjuta	kdevelop
these would be lightweight ides as opposed to heavyweights like anjuta kdevelop eclipse or netbeans

109069
clang	icc
to make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on use with gcc clang or icc

109069
clang	icc
see asm from gcc clang icc and msvc on the godbolt compiler explorer

109069
clang	icc
this source isn t x86-specific or gnu-specific at all but only compiles well for x86 with gcc clang icc

109081
jsf	seam
we re working with ejb here and it works quite well with seam and jsf faclets and myfaces trinidad

109091
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns an interval id which you can pass to clearinterval

109091
setinterval	clearinterval
see the docs for setinterval and clearinterval

109098
setinterval	clearinterval
if you set the return value of setinterval to a variable you can use clearinterval to stop it

109150
stdout	stderr
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the script s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

109150
stdout	stderr
you could also call something like the following with open to redirect both stdout and stderr

109234
svg	vml
raphael is a plugin that uses svg for firefox and other browsers that support svg and vml for the ie products

109259
memcpy	memset
probably because it s not needed very often - i memset and memcpy reasonably often but i don t know that i d ever have used memswap if it was available

109476
cout	cin	stdout	stderr
however i think that the mechanisms the standard requires for synching stdin cin stdout cout and stderr cerr don t have to be visible to you

109480
memcached	apc
i ve created a forum and we re implementing an apc and memcached caching solution to save the database some work

109534
getter	setter
so to answer your question do net unit-test things that are better implemented as an integration test and also don t test getter setter - it is a waste of time

109605
postgresql	mysql
sql is used for relational databases ms sql server oracle sybase mysql postgresql sqlite etc... and xquery is used for xml databases marklogic sedena qexo qizx db etc...

109672
stdout	stderr
it also means you only need to remember one single approach to capturing stdout and stderr or merging them instead of using ipc open3 for external programs and other modules for capturing perl output

109735
min	max
if you really need very quick estimation you can do work breakdown structure with every task for 1-2 days or smaller and after this estimate every task by providing min and max estimated values

109735
min	max
sum of min and max values specify interval for the whole task

109768
client-side	server-side
personally i would avoid server-side frameworks that try to embed or hide the client-side framework

109853
memcpy	memset
memcpy memset can get massive performance increases from per-platform optimisation

109861
postgresql	mysql
i ve seen questions for doing the reverse but i have an 800mb postgresql database that needs to be converted to mysql

109877
debian	linux
debian gnu linux testing lenny

109879
ienumerable	icollection
will only serialize ienumerable or icollection collections conforming to specific rules

109879
ienumerable	icollection
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection

109879
ienumerable	icollection
a class that implements icollection such as collectionbase in addition to ienumerable must have a public item indexed property indexer in c# that takes an integer and it must have a public count property of type integer

109926
opera	safari
i remember it being wait and pay and nowadays the mobile phones usually have a real browser like opera mini or safari

109958
treemap	linkedhashmap
first the ordering functionality from the treemap is used to sort upon the values next the sorted map is used to create a result as a linkedhashmap that retains has the same order of values

109979
vmware	esx
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal

109989
cvs	svn
so if you want to contribute to a lot of open source projects apache svn cvs etc knowing c would be a requirement

110012
verilog	vhdl
an example way it can work well is this find a fairly simple but necessary component of your software and implement it in verilog vhdl

110030
vmware	bootcamp
i plan on doing some .net development on it using a bootcamp vmware combo since vmware grants access to the bootcamp partition

110037
jxtable	jtable
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide

110060
post	get
the default is usually gpc which means get is loaded first then post is loaded overwriting get if there is a collision then cookies are loaded overwriting get post if there is a collision

110060
post	get
for example changing it to cpg makes cookies load first then post then get

110154
postgresql	mysql
sqlite is nice and they have really nice documentation however you should be aware that it is not a full featured sql database like mysql postgresql or the commercial variants

110158
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
when you re done it all compiles down into html and javascript and has very good modern browser support ie6+ firefox opera safari

110189
getter	setter
beans with just getter and setter

110326
vmware	esx
from my experience moving up the vmware application stack has never been problematic server to workstation to esx

110326
vmware	esx
however i would verify this by exporting all of your vms from the workstation install to an esx install to make sure you re not seeing any weird issues related to running the high-end tool from vmware

110365
multiplying	multiplication
start with your largest prime divisor and multiplying it by itself until a further multiplication would exceed the number n

110418
mouse	keyboard
enable system preference â keyboard mouse â keyboard â use all f1 f2 etc

110491
vsts	tfs
vsts 2008 tfs power toys if you re using tfs

110526
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
even if you use htmlspecialchars string outside of html tags you are still vulnerable to multibyte charset attack vectors

110591
sorting	filtering
i know how to do it in c# sql with a key value table but i don t know how to do it with nhibrenate including filtering and sorting by the user defined fields

110612
getter	setter
using your domain objects in jsps can make your domain harder to refactor and promotes the indiscriminate use of getter and setter hence breaking encapsulation

110617
x86	64bit
it is already installed when you installed 64bit version and all you need to do is run the 32-bit dtexec.exe - the one installed program files x86 microsoft sql server 90 dts binn replace 90 with 100 if you are using ssis 2008

110619
cvs	svn
once you ve set up a central repository you can use a cvs svn style workflow to check in and update

110629
umbraco	dotnetnuke
basically joomla drupal phpnuke dotnetnuke umbraco are all examples of what we don t want

110720
ant	maven
since i ve switched from ant to maven as my build system continuum is the obvious choice

110729
opera	firefox
code for mozilla firefox opera etc

110737
boost	stl
so my guess is to use it for external libraries you won t even touch like the stl c api headers boost whatever

110738
cobertura	checkstyle
the checkstyle and cobertura code coverage plugins are two that we use

110772
int	double
if you want double create getdouble method for int - getinteger

110804
accelerometer	gyroscope
combine gyroscope and accelerometer data

110819
int	double
shorts and int double and floats then the compiler is adding implicit type conversions for each mismatch

110843
lisp	scheme
if you usually program in one language and switch to the other only occasionally then unfortunately you are doomed to write common lisp in scheme or vice versa

110843
lisp	scheme
then at least you will always know whether you are in common lisp or scheme mode

110866
profiler	vtune
this utility is the direct descendant of vtune and provide the best available sampling profiler available

110871
children	parent
the best of these commandlines are then allowed to mate and breed new children which hopefully inherit the best genes from their parent

110902
valgrind	callgrind
valgrind has already been mentioned but it s especially useful with the callgrind tool

110911
lisp	scheme
i do most of my development in common lisp but there are some moments when i want to switch to scheme while reading lisp in small pieces when i want to play with continuations or when i want to do some scripting in gauche for example

110913
quicksort	radix-sort
know the limitations of the algorithm you choose a radix-sort quicksort for 10 elements to be sorted might not be the best choice

110941
post	get
hence the names post and get

110954
post	get
so my alltime suggestion would be to use post instead of get

110956
post	get
get passes data in the url post passes the same data in the http content both are exactly the same from a security standpoint that is completely insecure unless you do something about it yourself like using https

110956
post	get
from an http standard viewpoint get requests should not change the site and browsers spiders are much more likely to make get requests on their own without the user actually clicking something then post requests

110960
post	get
generally best to use post because it s a bit better hidden for snooping better handling of spaces encoding in the fields with some browsers and especially because of limitations in the overall length of get fields

110961
nant	cruisecontrol
as are cruisecontrol and nant

111014
post	get
both get and post have their place

111014
post	get
use post and then always redirect to a page that is suitable to get via http get

111074
ant	maven
at the command line it s tools such as maven ant and subversion that are used the most

111079
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest which is very similar to phpunit but a lot simpler has a good introductory tutorial

111104
post	get
we have a third party search engine on our site and they use the get method to post the search query to their code

111104
post	get
believe me i m not bragging about my code just saying that choosing between get and post has semi-far reaching implications other than do i want my passwords showing up in the querystring

111123
post	get
but apart from that there is no real security in either get and post so use ssl if that is a concern

111151
boost	stl
i hope boost format will soon be included in the stl

111165
post	get
the links used get and should have used post as spiders don t follow post links

111174
post	get
as said previously use post for deleting or updating data but i d like to add that you should immediately redirect your user to a get page

gif	png
virtually all browsers support single-bit transparency in png files the type of transparency offered by the gif format

116461
gif	png
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116461
gif	png
gif files are indexed to a maximum palette of 256 colors while png files in most graphics programs are saved by default in a 24-bit lossless format

116461
gif	png
if file size is more important than accurate colors save the file as an 8-bit indexed png and it should be equivalent to gif or better

116461
gif	png
it is possible to hack a gif file to have more than 256 colors using a combination of animation frames with do-not-replace flags and multiple palettes but this approach has been virtually forgotten about since the advent of png

116469
punctuation	words
for each words in the file we are to clear any punctuation in the words ex can t would end up as can and that--to would end up as that obviously with out the quotes quotes were used just to specify what the example was

116528
client-side	server-side
if your dataset contains more than a few hundred kb you are likely to end-up with client-side or server-side http timeouts considering default settings

116578
scons	autotools
scons has a configuring mechanism that will do a lot of what autotools do without as much complexity and is pretty darn portable although not as portable as autotools

116627
notepad++	jedit
for others ides i have used jedit for little java notepad++ still for some scripting and short test code runs

116632
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i used to use opera and firefox as my standards compliant browsers but i ve recently become much enamored with safari

116632
google-chrome	safari
edited to add google-chrome is coming close to taking safari s place but that print screen thing is still the deciding factor

116663
nemerle	boo
nemerle and boo are my personal favorites for such things

116664
scons	autotools
the autotools uses a multi-stage process that s relatively easy to break and scons just feels weird to me

116695
hash	md5
md5 sha1 hash are both good choices

116705
salt	md5
md5 or sha in combination with a randomly generated salt value for every entry

116707
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
use a strong crytographic hash function like md5 or sha1 but make sure you use a good salt otherwise you ll be susceptible to rainbow table attacks

116715
postgresql	mysql
that said i use temporary tables in postgresql for a number of purposes and most will translate to mysql

116730
opera	safari
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser

116739
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
sha all variants is now trivially breakable and best practice is now as of jan 2013 to use a key-stretching hash like pbkdf2 or ideally a ram intensive one like bcrypt and to add a per-user salt too

116739
hash	md5
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

116739
hash	salt
you often use the hash of username password salt or similar rather than just the password but if you play with this then you make it even harder to run a dictionary attack

116753
hash	salt
add a unique salt to the hash password value store the salt value in the db

116753
salt	md5
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement

116767
hash	md5
the ready availability of cloud computing and powerful parallel-processor graphics cards means that passwords up to 8 or 9 characters hash as md5 or sha1 are now trivially breakable

116767
pbkdf2	hash
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

116860
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
pbkdf2 for example uses salt large number of iterations and a good hash function

116873
pop-up	dialog
by noninasive i mean don t pop-up an alert or modal dialog box thereby forcing the user to click something

117010
scons	automake
automake or scons are quite complex and are worth your time only if you intend to release your code to a wide audience

117097
haskell	ocaml
you can look at haskell ml ocaml etc

117146
int	chars
you can call int fstream get which will read a single chars from the stream

117159
post	get
if you want to post some cleansed ddl and data and an example of what you are trying to get out of the db we may be able to give you a less subjective answer

117176
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
i d recomment taking a look at ll-xist this library contains large amount of life-saving code like cron jobs helper daemon framework and what is not interesting to you but is really great object-oriented xsl ll-xist itself

117274
kde	gnome
customizing the root menu is also easy much easier than doing so in kde or gnome which i never did figure out adequately

117332
int	boolean
c++ is pass-by-value by default so the function gets copies of those int and boolean

117349
try-catch	exception-handling
either you expect exception-handling in certain situations in which case you write a try-catch block around that code and handle them or there is an unexpected error in which case you should prefer your application to abort or retry or fail

117407
serializable	deserialization
you can use xml serializable deserialization by yourself

117451
folder	directory
i believe that to do it the way you are hoping to you d have to have each version of the file in a separate directory in the repository and check it out into your source folder

117475
getter	setter
the properties to read write have public getter and setter

117477
restructuredtext	textile
a while ago i came across a python library that formats regular text to html similar to markdown restructuredtext and textile just that it had no syntax at all

117481
versioning	upgrade
so i d like to upgrade to a more recent versioning but the new one must not break any existing scripts

117547
draggable	droppable
called whenever a draggable is released over the droppable and the droppable is accepts it

117547
draggable	droppable
the callback gets three parameters the draggable element the droppable element and the event

117556
folder	directory
that will make a copy of your repository on another directory without the .svn folder

117564
cpu	processors
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processors was booted

117568
post	get
if possible it s best to attempt sql injection via http get and post requests

117674
vim	emacs
use the ide you like best emacs vim vc++ express code blocks bloodshed - again whatever

117678
ubuntu	linux
this is with ubuntu linux 1gb ram

117707
width	height
the key thing here is to turn the anchor tag into a block element so height and width work

117741
boost	stl
become familiar with the stl and boost and use their facilities whenever possible rolling your own

117774
entity-relationship	diagram
there was also some configuration to get used to since i don t work with java much but the end result was what i was looking for on open-source replacement for visio s entity-relationship diagram

117811
min	max
if the array is sorted as in your example i would define buckets containing a min and a max

117811
min	max
initialize create a bucket with a min and a max equal to the first value

117811
min	max
at the end you will have a set of buckets with a min and a max in each

117811
min	max
if the min is the same as the max print a single number ie in your example the first bucket would have a min and a max of 1

117834
opera	safari
safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree

117849
dictionary	map
you would also be surprised how many people struggle to implement a map dictionary type data-structure

117900
post	get
i assume i will get one wrong incomplete answer here and than my post will sink into nothingness as usual but either way thanks in advance

117920
pop-up	dialog
after i dismiss the the dialog by canceling i get another pop-up like the one below

118016
min	max
in addition the second syntax is more flexible if there are further aggregates which may be added in the future in addition to count like min some_scalar max avg etc

118109
int	chars
a struct that starts with 4 chars and then has a 4 byte int would be useless if read on another system where gcc decided that it should re-arrange the struct members

118137
hide	show
then to show the whole multi-part query you can either show five circles with some combination of union and intersection or else combine each parenthesis and then hide the detail making the results into a new circle to combine with other elements

118235
wordpress	phpbb
anyway iâ m sure other people have tackled this and the solution is probably applicable to many apps similar to wordpress drupal phpbb phpmyadmin etc.

118251
width	height
in your javascript set the font size and attributes that you are trying to measure put your string in the div then read the current width and height of the div

118265
converter	multibinding
multibinding converter staticresource converter

118265
converter	multibinding
in xaml create instance of your converter and add it to your multibinding s converter property

118265
converter	multibinding
in general whenever you have to map multiple property values to one other property you ll have to use multibinding and converter

118325
google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox with ie tab and google-chrome

118325
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and google-chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari

118340
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i find that if you stick to standards compliant markup and don t use anything too unusual it will render fine in firefox 2 3 and safari google-chrome and usually fine in ie7 8

118342
cvs	rcs
rcs file data cvs dps build.xml v

118373
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
depending on what other attributes you put on a checkboxlist or radiobuttonlist or whatever asp.net will render the output using different structures

118377
getter	setter
from my understanding you should use synchronized on both the getter and the setter methods and that is sufficient

118388
getter	setter
if you have 20 getter and setter and they re all synchronized you may be creating a synchronization bottleneck

118436
versioning	upgrade
it ended up that we had so many workarounds while using the development versioning of modules that it was a pain every time we upgrade modules or core itself

118487
rss	feed
1 rss feed and 2 manual entries

118503
des	aes
yes purely asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric cyphers like des or aes which is why real applications use hybrid cryptography the expensive public-key operations are performed only to encrypt and exchange an encryption key for the symmetric algorithm that is going to be used for encrypting the real message

118507
ubuntu	debian
if you install in debian ubuntu package name python-zsi the documentation is in usr share doc python-zsi in a pair of pdfs you can find in there

118610
firefox	safari
there s support for firefox safari firewatir project

118615

ps this post is the #1 google result for castle fluent interface documentation sad guys you need to get on that

118655
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m far from being a css expert but this works for me in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

118680
cpython	ironpython
if beautifulsoup doesn t work on ironpython it s because ironpython doesn t implement the whole python language the same way cpython does

118680
cpython	ironpython
beautifulsoup is pure-python no c-extensions so the only problem is the compatibility of ironpython with cpython in terms of python source code.there shouldn t be one but if there is the error will be obvious no module named ... no method named ... etc.

118697
rss	feed
i found this blog post that describes how to add style to your rss feed

118726
debian	linux
it shows virt res and shr by default on debian linux

118740
komodo	notepad++
edit as you ve noted in your reply the issue is with trailing whitespace - i don t know notepad++ too well but most modern editors designed for coding have a strip trailing whitespace on save option i know komodo does

118793
post	get
i would suggest you spend time reading jeremy millers build your own cab series of post to get a feel for what you might like need to implement as your application becomes more complex

118884
opera	firefox
i have noticed that some browsers in particular firefox and opera are very zealous in using cached copies of .css and .js files even between browser sessions

119031
kde	gnome
is there a standard format for kde gnome etc

119040
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
going by the asp.net-mvc preview 4 code i have in front of me the overload for html.actionlink you are using is this one

119062
kde	gnome
for gnome and kde you would probably want to include a desktop file with your app that defines how it will be launched

119128
x86	64bit
here s an example using typical settings for an x86 processor all used 32 and 64bit modes

119132
x86	64bit
also a library may be compiled under x86 with 32-bit ints and you may be comparing its components on a 64bit process would would give you a different result if you were doing this by hand

119190
ant	maven
i recommend using something like maven or ant as a standardized build system

119209
tunnel	vpn
the clincher for us was the speed the lack thereof of vss over vpn and low bandwidth hotel networks on the road and the problems of trying to tunnel through firewalls so that two teams at two different sites could quickly securely and reliably work from the same code repository

119283
firefox	safari
interesting feature it can emulate safari ie or firefox browsers when rendering

119295
single-sign-on	shibboleth
clarification we don t have a single-sign-on server shibboleth setup yet

119326
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
according to though ie and firefox ignore this opera and safari don t

119414
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
however how would you unit-test for example a memory allocator think malloc realloc free

119461
cunit	cppunit
my unit tests usually don t use tools like cunit cppunit and similar software

119465
vsto	add-in
in my case i did this because my excel add-in used vsto and visual studio doesn t support xla files directly

119478
inherited	subclassing
we ve inherited a wcf web service that has a custom messageformatter that constructs a custom message subclassing in the serializereply method

119478
put	get
every way we tried we managed to get the ws-addressing headers into the actual response but could never get the ws-security header in actually we were just trying to put in a security header with timestampid and created expires elements

119508
mouse	keyboard
i want to create a keyboard and mouse hook which will be started as a windows service

119534
getter	setter
to me that excludes auto-generated getter and setter but includes hand-written ones that contain some logic

119538
int	double
the lua version posted above is faster but relies on the truncation of double to a 32-bit result therefore it requires the x87 unit to be set to double precision and cannot be adapted for double to 64-bit int conversion

119545
post	get
for example a get request to products edit 45 would display the product editor whereas a post to the same url would update the product

119595
cvs	svn
beware clearcase is file-centric not repository centric like svn or cvs

119680
ironruby	ironpython
look into ironpython and ironruby -- these will allow you to easily interoperate with c#

119721
ironruby	ironpython
i think this is possible with ironpython and ironruby as well

119728
cvs	svn
we used viewvc for browsing both cvs and svn repositories but since we switched to fisheye we finally have a really good solution for code browsing and examination

119733
postgresql	mysql
this does not happen with mysql or postgresql

119738
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven to build you can define your dependencies in the pom.xml file

119744
ironruby	ironpython
the function would check whether the user has associated any scripts with given points and if so runs the script by invoking ironpython ironruby with optionally given parameters

119873
rss	feed
but seriously sign up to relevant mailing lists and rss feed so that you can be updated as things happen

119918
rss	feed
2 get some rss feed news letters to c# sites such as c# corner or channel 9

119995
maven	pom.xml
i really don t see what is the big deal with getting maven + eclipse to work as long as you don t have to change the pom.xml too much

120046
websphere	ibm
i recommend a combination of the sap business connector which provides an easy interface for receiving sending rfc calls from to the sap side and the ibm websphere java library which allows easy interaction with websphere

120052
cvs	svn
that said it s possible that starting from a blank slate with git might actually be easier - my vcs experience is all with centralised version control cvs svn perforce... and part of my ongoing

120073
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint

120084
int	double
where type is int double long long or whatever describes the alignment requirements

120091
post	get
i have then implemented a new project from scratch based on this blog post and get stuck with the same performance issues

120140
ant	maven
on one hand i think that everyone should be free to use the set of developemnt tools they are most productive with as long as all source artifacts are stored in version control and the build script say ant or maven ensures standards compliance by specifying exactly which jdk to use which versions of which third party libraries to depend upon running style checks checkstyle and running unit tests etc

120140
ant	maven
on the other hand i think so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have some things standardised at design time instead of build time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins

120156
width	height
i also ommitted most of error checking whether given width height is out of bounds

120158
post	get
the client post a new document to the collection gets back the uri of the new document then can get that docuri to get the document back or get to see the general metadata for named entities etc

120212
virtualbox	parallels
i have heard of parallels and virtualbox but i did not have the time to try them out

120216
dns	spf
things that are known to help include properly set up spf records domainkeys dkim correct dns settings reverse dns especially - best to just use an online service to check your dns settings

after many painful experiences with struts tapestry 3 4 jsf seam gwt i will stick with wicket for now

120284
lisp	scheme
let me list a few important details about how metaprogramming works in lisp or scheme or slate or pick your favorite dynamic language

120284
lisp	prolog
add prolog like backtracking to the language that very seamlessly integrates with normal lisp code see screamer

120317
setinterval	settimeout
and use javascript s settimeout or setinterval to do the periodic polling

120345
kerberos	ntlm
ie7 only sends windows credentials ntlm kerberos if it identifies the server as being on the intranet

120345
button	checkbox
you can then manually add servers that should be treated as intranet by clicking the sites button then advanced or tell ie not to automatically detect your intranet and selecting the other checkbox as appropriate

120506
mouse	keyboard
the physical console is the monitor keyboard and mouse

120508
maven	cobertura
i use maven with the surefire and cobertura plugins for all my builds

120508
junit	easymock
the actual test cases are created with junit dbunit and easymock

120614
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
window.onerror catches all errrors in ie and most errors in firefox but does nothing in safari and opera

120657
stdout	stderr
in case it matters i m grabbing a pipe to stderr for processing it but ignoring stdout and stdin

120666
getter	setter
as a result you will get a bunch of unit tests which are worth nothing there will be unit test for every single class available and they will test setter and getter

120716
put	get
i put it there and didn t get errors in opera 9.5 ff3 and ie7

120802
jboss	weblogic
when using containers such as jboss or weblogic my solution is to edit the start-up scripts supplied by the vendor

120820
srp	principles
first of all this code violates srp principles

120820
equals	gethashcode
equals uses hash code of pair class but take a look at the definition of gethashcode it just a combination of pair members hash codes - it s has nothing to do with equality of items

120829
freebsd	linux
once upon a time i did this - installing a freebsd on x86- although i had some linux knowledge already at that time and it took me 3 hours mainly that much time because i was working on another machine in parallel

120832
jruby	mri
it probably should complain that this does not make sense but when n.times is called in mri it returns an enumerator whereas jruby complains that it needs a block

120838
postgresql	mysql
it supports oracle postgresql and mysql

120888
freebsd	linux
as for the original topic i ve used linux and unix extensively but have yet to get freebsd working after several tries over many years

120901
post	get
method should be get or post

120913
bluetooth	usb
it has support for logging to console file recordstore canvas form bluetooth a serial port bluetooth ir usb socket incl ssl udp syslog mms sms e-mail or to amazon s3

120916
superclass	subclassing
if you want to call a superclass constructor with an argument you must use the subclassing s constructor initialization list

120925
vsto	add-in
this was with a vsto workbook saved as an xla file which in some ways is more flexible than a pure vsto add-in

120925
post	get
there are a few more issues to consider to get this working robustly - if you re interested in following this up let me know and i ll post more details

120933
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
terrence barr talks about running netbeans in virtualization like via virtualbox vmware fusion or parallels

120938
maven	pom.xml
i was able to get my maven build working correctly by adding the following plugin to the ws-war pom.xml file

120960
hash	md5
instead of changing the version manually i would recommend you use an md5 hash of the actual css file

121059
int	chars
what is the best way to divide a 32 bit int into four unsigned chars in c#

121100
hash	salt
you can store a password salt and hash although the value of doing so can be disputed but that doesn t work for phone numbers

121107
int	chars
converting the int to bytes reversing the byte-array for the correct order and then getting the ascii chars representation from it

121119
mouse	keyboard
on my current keyboard which is not a split this means the wide enter key the arrow keys and the number pad all jut out to the right before i have space for my mouse

121154
mouse	keyboard
i don t know of any keyboards like that but what might help is a keyboard with a built-in touchpad like for a laptop that you can use instead of your other mouse for some of your mousing small adjustments quick taps to click etc to avoid having to go out to the mouse

121177
min	max
we essentially created a full product product attribute definition system data types min max occurrences default values required flags usage scenarios etc. the system worked ultimately but came with a significant cost in overhead and performance materialized views to visualize products custom smart components to represent and validate data entry ui for product definition another smart component to represent the product instance s customizable attributes on the order line blahblahblah

121178
mouse	keyboard
i m left handed so my mouse is quite close to the keyboard

121178
mouse	keyboard
if you re having trouble with your mouse being too far out to the right you could try a small footprint keyboard such as a happy hacking keyboard and a separate numeric pad on the left or somewhere else to get a more clement key layout

121191
mouse	keyboard
my mouse usage is minimal though because i focus on using the keyboard for everything

121216
int	chars
the chars x will be implicitly converted to int and then will call the string int constructor

121227
client-side	server-side
if javascript is disabled your client-side code won t run anyway so i assume you mean you want that info available server-side

121233
post	get
you cant do this for a normal post get however you can get to this info if you use an xmlhttp call and use the getresponseheader

121246
mouse	keyboard
i move my keyboard and mouse around i change my position and the position of those two

121246
mouse	keyboard
additionally i use keyboard shortcuts a lot to not overuse the mouse

121246
mouse	keyboard
this way i got rid of my wrist problems without replacing keyboard or mouse

121287
postgresql	mysql
i haven t tried sphinx because it only works with mysql and postgresql

121289
hash	md5
hashbytes to return the md2 md4 md5 sha or sha1 hash of its input

121300
postgresql	mysql
i haven t tried sphinx because it only works with mysql and postgresql

121309
rss	feed
the string source comes from an html encoded node in a wordpress rss feed

121323
subtraction	addition
armv6 even has saturated addition subtraction and all the other stuff for 32 bits and packed numbers

121336
perl	tcl
finally especially if you are going to validate the date you might want to use perl for the whole job or python or ruby or tcl or any scripting language of your choice

121474
rss	feed
personally i create a private rss feed with the stacktraces urls etc

121525
pecl	pear
when building some of my php apps a lot of the functionality could be coded using pear pecl modules however the fact that some people using it may not have the access to install things it poses a puzzler for me

121525
pecl	pear
should i forsake some users to use pear pecl for functionality where these will allow me to have a system coded up quicker than if i wrote my own functionality but eans that it will exclude certain people from using it

121545
pecl	pear
my suggestion is to start with assuming pear pecl modules and get the rest of the code done

121547
pecl	pear
code it initially using pear pecl and if you get people asking for a non pear pecl version start coding your own alternatives then for such a version

121580
np-hard	np-complete
prime factorization and discrete log are not np-complete or np-hard for that matter

121598
content-disposition	content-type
your browser is probably not properly handling the content-type and or content-disposition headers properly

121598
firefox	safari
i ve seen it happen in firefox safari and ie for various files presented in various ways

121605
richfaces	tomahawk
my environment jsf 1.2 myfaces tomcat tomahawk richfaces

121611
pecl	pear
if you re just trying to make something that works go with pear pecl

121611
pecl	pear
once you understand the innards of whatever you re trying to replace you may want to switch to the pear pecl version so that you re not wasting time reimplementing what has already been implemented.

121619
folder	directory
unc shared folder and no replication has many downsides especially if iis is going to use unc paths as home directory for sites

121620
int	chars	int	double
primitive data byte chars int double and arrays of them byte ... are erasable by writing new random content into them

hash	md5
if we talk about passwords it s better to use crypto-strong hash functions md5 sha1 ... and never ever work with passwords in clear text

121627
int	chars
edit to comment on some of the previous answers the jvm could relocate your objects in memory without erasing their previous locations so even chars bytes int and other erasable data types aren t an answer if you really want to make sure that no sensitive information is stored in the memory managed by the jvm or swapped on to the hard drive

put	get
i suspect that you can get rid of the outer query and put distinct on the inner but i m not sure

121882
cassini	iis
the first one works because cassini is handling all requests the second one doesn t work because iis is looking for that directory and it doesn t exist instead of the .net framework running the code you have

121886

if you can t get answers from those users on that or there s nothing suspect it might be worth creating a special little test script to write a cookie and post the result back to you on the next page-load

122344
mouse	keyboard
another thing that helped me much more than replacing the keyboard is replacing the mouse

122357

122390
rss	feed
the purpose of an rss feed is to allow the easy transmission of content to places outside your site

122390
rss	feed
for example if you had a website that read rss you would want to parse the feed into html and style it that way

122671
int	chars
this is java and int rather than chars but you can easily adapt it.

122674
int	chars
chars in c have numeric values that happen to be in order so you just treat your chars like int

122687
int	chars
my first idea was to set the httpresponse.status property but it requires the chars before the first space to be an int

122687
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the browser response of both internet explorer firefox and google-chrome i use google-chrome as my primary browser and firefox as secondary

122723
httprequest	httpresponse

hash	salt
ideally include a different salt each time with the previous hash

123037
hide	show
i ve had to work with divs and iframes when creating a javascript menu that should show overtop dropdown boxes and listboxes -- other menu implementations just hide these items whose default behavior in ie6 is to show on top of any div no matter the z-index

123041
comparator	comparable
for example the integer class in java implements the comparable interface so if you only saw the method header public class string implements comparable you would know that it contains a comparator method

123043
width	height
however you can get away with just taking the max width and max height of your skewed rectangle

123053
subclass	abstract-class
using an abstract-class as an interface is possible because every base class by definition defines an interface that all of its subclasses should honor it should be possible to use a subclass instead of a base class

delphi 7 onwards technically object pascal or delphi language i guess

123244
implements	extends	subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class in java is that a subclass cannot extends multiple base classes but it can implements multiple interfaces

123268
vsto	add-in
you can also take a look at add-in express but i didn t have much luck with their controls and the vsto for 2008 is extremely easy to use

123307
lxml	elementtree
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml

123401
hide	show
using jquery how do you bind a click event to a table cell below class expand that will change the image src which is in the clicked cell - original will be plus.gif alternating with minus.gif and hide show the row immediately below it based on whether that row has a class of hide

123401
hide	show
show it if it has a class of hide and hide if it does not have a class of hide

123451
min	max
if the spread between the min and max occurrences is small then your distribution is good

123518
hide	show
you don t need the show and hide tags

123645

123666
spaces	delimiter
here s a regex for a 7 or 10 digit number with extensions allowed delimiter are spaces dashes or periods

123670
getter	setter
first of all setter and getter are an indication of bad oo

123670
getter	setter
secondly each object you have should be a world in itself--generally if you are going to use setter and getter they should return fairly safe independent objects

123670
getter	setter
so saying should setter and getter return something immutable doesn t make too much sense

123724
strncpy	malloc
strndup requires _gnu_source so maybe you need to make your own strndup with malloc and strncpy

123773
inherited	properties
what bugs me about this is that implementation inherited means code reuse one of the most important properties of oo languages

123835
getter	setter
setter and getter are bad in principle they are a bad oo smell--i ll stop short of saying they are an anti-pattern because they really are necessary sometimes

123835
getter	setter
the way setter and getter were sold is that you might need to know that someone is getting a value or changing one--which only makes sense with primitives

123855
redmine	trac
i started with trac but i found the mercurial support and the administrative interface for everything to be much better in redmine

123909
mouse	keyboard
try the keyboard shortcut to get to the window s main menu then hit m for move and hit an arrow key to attach the window to the mouse - then at the next move of the mouse it should jump to it

123912
getter	setter
typically the member functions for which you need const and non-const versions are getter and setter

this will give you the document height and width in inches which you could then compare to the min size needed

124065
int	double
3 could be an int a double or a string

124177
ssl	https
the only way to do this is to use ssl tls https

124187
ssl	https
for example if you want to protect the parameters sent by your java app to your server from an attacker who has access to the communication channel you should consider communicating with the server via tls ssl https in your case and the likes

124190
int	boolean
create a boolean that indicates whether or not your int is valid or create a new type that wraps the boolean and int together

124226
udp	tcp
modbus rtu over tcp udp and com-port

124237
disk	ram
another note i m not thrilled about the idea of simply throwing hardware at the problem adding ram cpu power disk speed

124248
rsa	aes
so for instance you d use a secure random number generator to generate a 128 bit random key for aes and encrypt those 16 bytes with rsa

124248
rsa	aes
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248
rsa	aes
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

124248
rsa	aes
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

124262
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
fetching an arrays with mysql_fetch_array lets you loops through the result set via either a foreach loops or a for-loop

124452
mvp	presenter
i used a home-grown mvp model-view-presenter pattern and the absolute most important thing to allow the presenter controller in your case to be used in a winforms app was to not reference anything to do with system.web

124585
post	get
the purpose of this post isn t necessarily to refactor the code this isn t even the code i am using but instead to get input on whether or not this is a good idea

124591
inherited	subclassing
the way to prevent implementation inherited is in the programming language since the beginning you should use the final keyword on the class declaration and this way you are prohibiting subclassing

124615
getter	setter
lets say i have a class that stores user information complete with getter and setter and it is populated with data from an xml file

124638
udp	tcp
i found an article on getting active tcp udp connections on a machine

124641
icmp	udp
if a udp packet is sent to a port that is not open the system will respond with an icmp port unreachable message

124711
folder	directory
the recommended directory structure for a subversion repo contains three folder branches tags and trunk

124714
serializable	deserialization
when you re transferring stuff over the network it s unlikely that serializable deserialization to xml will be the limiting factor in performance

124771
int	double
according to the xmlrpc spec the only real limits are on the size of int and double

124778
mousemove	keydown
i couldn t get it to work with a mousemove event on the usercontrol but putting a keydown event to set the focus works although the template doesn t update to the focused template

124807
nant	cruisecontrol
i m a .net guy so for us it is cruisecontrol + nant

124818
bazaar	git
it is also do able in git but it s more intuitive in bazaar imho

124835
cvs	svn
you can do this with most systems cvs svn git and so on

124844
integer	unsigned
usually i do c and c++ work so my gut reaction is to use an unsigned integer field as a set of bits which can be flipped.

124861
hex	binary
using this you can create an arbitrary number of bit fields that mysql is happy to treat as binary hex or decimal values however you need

124896
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest requires you to define resources named via uri s and transactions based on the canonical crud rules get post put and delete

124944
apache	lighttpd
if iis doesn t fit your requirements you should choose another web server such as apache with mod_mono or lighttpd

124951
webclient	webrequest
you can use webrequest or webclient class to load data via proxy and pass obtained response stream to xmldocument

124956
versioning	upgrade
the deploy phase would check versioning on each server and determine which servers needed upgrade

124956
ubuntu	debian
if i had a choice i d go with a system like debian or ubuntu and set up a repository that the systems could all pull from

125030
subtraction	addition
a logarithmic function is simply the inverse of an exponential function in the same sense that subtraction is the inverse of addition

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the properties are gecko-only firefox mozilla camino the properties are webkit-only google-chrome safari epiphany

125130
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the -moz ones are firefox specific the -webkit ones are for safari google-chrome and a few other browsers that use that rendering engine

125131
firefox	safari
those are for firefox the ones labeled -moz-border and for safari -webkit-border

125133
google-chrome	safari
the -webkit ones will only work in webkit-based browsers like safari google-chrome or webkit

125179
thin	webrick
you might look at the internals of webrick to see a simple server daemon coded in ruby -- or if you want something more performant look at mongrel or thin

125209
cos	sin
now draw a triangle with this distance and the wheelbase pencilled in plus some sin and cos equations approximations and you might get an approximate equation like

125229
for-loop	arrays
the arrays would be especially useful inside a for-loop which renders the contents and draws border lines

125233
post	get
if you re still having problems or need to emulate some form post or ajax get firefox and install the livehttpheaders plugin

125269
pop-up	dialog
some of the dialog boxes displayed were real and some of them were fake like those pop-up displayed by webpages posing as an antivirus warning

125314
firefox	safari
afaik this method works in all cases in firefox and safari

125379
int	boolean
adding an int to a boolean

125398
pop-up	dialog
don t pop-up a dialog box announcing an error - do whatever recovery you re going to do anyway or whatever is possible

125491
put	get
it doesn t get around the one-use typedef unless you put that in a header which is always an option but it makes the resulting code shorter by one iterator

125535
cpu	processors
the interrupt is a physical signal in the processors that tells the cpu to store its current state and jump to interrupt or exception handler code

125586
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
one of the most impressive is a javascript implementation using the canvas component implemented in firefox safari opera etc

125609
versioning	upgrade
we then use home-grown tools to generate the schema upgrade and reference data upgrade scripts that are required to go from versioning x of the database to versioning x + 1

125615
ubuntu	debian
both mandriva red hat based and ubuntu debian based have packages for the boost libriaries

125617
folder	directory
you could of course copy somefolder and place it under your web directory then it would be accesible or if you are sure it is safe change the configuraton of your web server to allow access to that folder

125639
jobs	cron
the other nice thing is that your service infrastructure is static like your rc scripts cron jobs etc. since they point to the application directory and it doesn t change

125640
versioning	upgrade
however at times system upgrade often breaks other programs when there is a versioning mismatch between the shared dll files and the program that requires them

125655
versioning	upgrade
it is a good approach to save database scripts into versioning control with change scripts so that you can upgrade any one database you have

125708
rss	feed
since only my team is using the installation of laconica that we have i take the rss for the public feed and i integrated that into sharepoint

125763
int	boolean
now if this is a comparegenerator it really should either return a boolean true or false or a int 0 or 1 lets use the former

125804
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
every programmer should have some experience with a modern jit d oo language c# java a lower-level simpler language c fortran etc a very high level interpreted language python ruby etc and a functional language scheme lisp haskell etc

125806
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
i have actually a fairly similar problem in that i need to be able to capture input for mouse keyboard joystick and i d also like to avoid sdl if at all possible

125806
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
the point is to capture mouse motion keyboard press release mouse clicks and potentially joystick handling for a game

125852
unification	inference
it s inference which is undecidable as it requires higher order unification

125862
put	get	post	put	post	get
restful basically uses the 5 standard http methods get put post delete head for controlling accessing content

125957
nginx	lighttpd
when i use lighttpd it easily serves over 80 mb sec but when i test with nginx it drops down to less than 20 mb sec

125984
vsto	add-in
unfortunately you can t define a udf in a managed vsto excel add-in

126027
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in a real case i wouldnt use timer i would have an arrays or xml object to iterate through with a for-loop regardless it works great and basically once you hit the end of your loops if i length - 1 have it call the functionality that starts the actual pre-loading now that we have our total

126027
for-loop	arrays
now we iterate through the arrays or xml object again but this time we do it only once each asset has loaded not in a for-loop

126056
public	protected
some methods will be left private and tested implicitly as part of unit tests for the public protected methods

126062
udp	tcp
gives you the active tcp udp ports

126062
udp	tcp
then you can use the ports with fuser -n tcp or fuser -n udp as root and supposing that fuser is gnu fuser or has similar options

126067
opera	google-chrome
if you want to update the page in the already opened browser or use a browser of your choice always ie6 instead of opera or google-chrome then you ll have to do some homework but it s still quite easy

126125
printf	strlen
use only printf printf and str functions strcat strlen and of course their wide char corespondents wcslen...

126138
outputstream	inputstream
it doesn t appear to be possible to get a channel from an inputstream or outputstream filestream has a getchannel method but that doesn t help here

126149
puts	gets
so you send it autorelease instead which puts it in the autorelease pool which is emptied once control gets back to the program s event loop

126254
width	height
set the s width and height to those px values so they re no longer relative

126254
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in your css make sure the input has no padding margin border and set width 100 line-height 1em and height 1em

126254
width	height
when you switch back make sure you un-set the width and height so they return to automatic values

126311
width	height
with your preferred cell width height

126311
width	height
assign the class to both your label and textbox and you should not get width height changes when switching control thanks to the display block property

126311
width	height
in that case i would suggest ignoring height problems just set the width to be consistent and always show a 3-4 lines textbox for editing

126340
codeigniter	cakephp
zend framework uses it for example but also cakephp codeigniter .

126366
stdout	stderr
as you said the solution outlined in this answer is the traditional way of reading both stdout and stderr from a process

126378
opennlp	lingpipe
opennlp has some tools to aid sentiment analysis but if you want something more serious you should look into the lingpipe toolkit

126388
hash	md5
one technique is to use a well-known hash algorithm say md5 or sha-1 and use only the first 32 bits of the result

126392
put	get
in addition this is the most general solution it scales best in the future as you add more keys it is easy to code the sql to get the data out and the database will be able to optimise the query better than you would imagine i wouldn t put effort into prematurely optimising this case unless it was proven to be a bottleneck in testing later on in which case you could consider the next two options below

126417
dictionary	map
using a dictionary you can map almost any input to some other value object function

126423
stdout	stderr
if your use case allows for combining both stdout and stderr of the process in question you need only one thread otherwise two are needed

126445
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this looks just right in firefox safari and opera

126473
addition	multiplication
just as addition of the float type is inaccurate multiplication of the decimal types can be inaccurate or cause inaccuracy if you exceed the precision

126481
postgresql	mysql
although trac can be configured to use mysql or postgresql too

126526
nunit	mstest
i m using nunit but i had the same issues with mstest

126711
post	put
status in response to an http 1.1 put or post request that does

126722
super	abstract	super	implements
behaviour at these switch points is then either inherited from the superclass overridden to provide new behaviour or implements to avoid a compiler error when the super method is abstract

126759
qtableview	qabstractlistmodel
i ve created an implementation of the qabstractlistmodel class in qt jambi 4.4 and am finding that using the model with a qlistview results in nothing being displayed however using the model with a qtableview displays the data correctly

126771
lisp	scheme
most probable source of the myth is that many people get only to know lisp from a cs course about scheme where they write themselves an interpreter

126772
firefox	safari
if the administrator hits the reload button in firefox explorer safari everything gets refreshed fine and the new image just appears

126773
lisp	scheme
there are a couple of more or less well-known and widespread members of this family scheme common lisp emacs-lisp and autolisp are the traditional ones

128221
g++	gcc
i have had this happen with gcc and g++

128221

hash the salt plaintext

128481
hash	salt
then this is the important step append the salt again to the hash

uses that salt to compute a hash for the plaintext

128481
hash	salt
compares the new hash with the hashedtext minus salt

128481
hash	salt

you may also need to watch out for file system resources - sqlite is great awesome fast etc - but you do get some caching and writing benefits when using a standard database mysql postgresql etc because of how they re designed

128962
dbal	mdb2
i use a dbal like mdb2 zend_db or doctrine for similar reason

128966

129335
post	get
i want the somevalue and anothervalue values to be sent using an http post instead of a get

129361
post	get
you ll probably have to just write the code for your page to accept get requests as well as post requests

129385
folder	directory
if you do a directory listing and pipe it to copy-item it will not preserve the folder structure

129458
folder	directory
moving the project to a directory closer to the root drive c helpsystem and renaming folder inside the project to smaller name reduced the path name size enough so that the project would compile

declarative programming is the picture where imperative programming is instructions for painting that picture

129689
imperative	declarative
some examples of where declarative and imperative programming get combined for greater effect

129751
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you would write them out using an objectoutputstream and read em back in using an objectinputstream

129773
getter	setter
usually i map to properties but mapping to fields can enable to put some logic in the getter setter of the properties

129806
dictionary	map
perl also has a map called a hashmap which is the equivalent to a dictionary in python - allowing you to have an association between a single key and a single value

129945
int	boolean
as far as i understand it equals zero in an int comparison but evaluates to true when used as a boolean

129973
lisp	scheme
which would be fine except when they say lisp they mean scheme by which they really mean a subset of scheme by which they really mean a half remembered subset of scheme from that ai or languages course 5 years ago that they didn t like

the most common way would be to package it in a .rpm file for redhat -based distros like fedora or a .deb file for debian -based distros like ubuntu

130270
ubuntu	debian
find someone skilled with debian and get their help to set up a build process to build .deb packages for debian and ubuntu

130795
ubuntu	debian
the way i do it on debian ubuntu boxes

130798
mp3	wav
if your stream is some format other than wav file data like mp3 or wma you will have to perform the additional step of decoding the data into wav and playing it with the waveoutxxxx api

130826
vb.net	vb6
you could use it as a text editor only though it will offer you the vb.net intellisense not vb6

130894
ubuntu	debian	cvs	svn
i have the source of a program taken from cvs svn git ... and i d like to build a debian ubuntu package for it

keydown	keyup
i am trying to trap and record keydown and keyup times in milliseconds and need it in the + - 10 ms range or less

131183
min	max
if you expect multiple rows from a sub-select you can add rownum 1 to each where clause or use an aggregate such as max or min

131251
g++	gcc
i believe gcc g++ have equivalent flags

131262
google-chrome	firefox
unless firefox and google-chrome have their own high-resolution timer implemented i believe that the best resolution you ll be able to get from a browser on the windows platform is going to be around 10 ms

131263
post	put
as much as i generally don t like the discussion subjective post on so i have really come to appreciate the hidden secrets set of post that people have put together

131325
implements	extends
you can extends this technique to be as complicated as you want although as it gets more complicated it makes more sense to implements it by tweaking either your routes or the rails default routing logic rather than by essentially reimplementing all the routing logic yourself

131333
cvs	svn
we used to do this with cvs and mantis and svn and mantis

131346

konquorer or safari or maybe now google-chrome

131577
mp3	wav
pcm mp3 and ima adpcm compressed wav

131602
int	chars
a suboptimal although simpler solution could be to find a feasible number of chars to fit into a big int

131602
int	chars
for instance if you form a 32-bit int out of every 6 chars chunk which is possible as 26 6 2 32 you use 5.33 bits chars

131602
int	chars
you can actually even fit 13 letters into a 64 bit int 4.92 bits chars

131622
perforce	svn
whatever you do don t learn git - after you learn it you realize how every other scm is trash and you ll hate every minute you have to use perforce svn or god help you vss tfs

131636
cvs	svn
use any of the standard version control tools like svn or cvs

131654
cvs	svn
it should work with most vcs depending on other criteria you might choose svn cvs darcs tfs etc however it will actually the complete file because it is a binary format meaning that the what changed question is not so easy to answer

131660
google-chrome	firefox
and it doesn t work in ie7 ie8 beta 2 firefox or google-chrome

131705
kerberos	ldap
at the company where i work we run apple s open directory for our ldap directory and kerberos kdc

131705
kerberos	ldap
while ldap and kerberos can be daunting at first and a bit challenging to get working i think the effort is quite worthwhile

131766
getter	setter
with dependency injection instead of instantiating the groupmembershipservice within your personservice you d either pass it in to the personservice constructor or else add a property getter and setter to set a local instance of it

131833
integer	unsigned
the size_t type is the unsigned integer type that is the result of the sizeof operator and the offsetof operator so it is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object your system can handle a static array of 8gb

131954
integer	unsigned
it is an unsigned integer capable of expressing the size in bytes of any memory range supported on the host machine

131954
int	chars
in particular the c standard specifies the following invariants sizeof chars sizeof short sizeof int sizeof long placing no other limitations on the actual representation of the precision available to the programmer for each of these primitive types

132383
apache	nginx
my asp code has to handle client ssl certificate and it means i can t use simple forward load balancers because i will never get such certificate from nginx or apache load balancer

132394
stringstream	ifstream
you might want to check his answer where he uses the ifstream s read method as you used to do and then set the stringstream buffer to point to the previously allocated memory

132424
free	malloc
the problem with a crt that does not leak is that the executable might reasonable expect to use the memory as malloc ed memory should remain usable until free is called

132509
qsort	bsearch
then there are hidden gems in the standard library such as qsort bsearch strpbrk strcspn the latter two being useful for implementing a strtok replacement

132542

there is a java implementation of quadtree and r-tree

132569
xtragrid	radgridview
i have used the .net s griddataview without any problems using the virtual mode while trying to show over 10000 rows but there are good products out there that are also very good in loading tons of data like developer express xtragrid and telerik s radgridview

maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml file for a web service

132692
width	height

132734
perl	tcl
a few years ago i ve convinced my co-workers to use perl for scripting instead of a weird mixture of batch files excel matlab and tcl

132756
getter	setter
and perhaps they can automatically inline some trivial functions like simple getter setter

132776
inline	inlining
however there is no guarantee that your all candidates for inlining will actually be inline by the compiler

132776
inline	inlining
some compilers vc2005 have an option for aggressive inlining and you wouldn t need to specify the inline keyword when using that option

132780
post	get
if they are created and they re not all getting copied you can get around this by creating a post build event that manually copies the pdb files to the desired locations

132787
tapestry	wicket
tapestry and wicket are two more modern ones haven t used them though

132790

132841
solaris	bsd
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

132854
disk	ram
the library was developed with the express purpose of being able to limit the size of the data pushed to the server to avoid exactly the type of situation you describe - effectively a dos attack by filling up ram or disk

132854
post	put
with the rmiio library the server side gets to decide how much data it is willing to pull where with http put and post the client gets to make that decision including the rate at which it pushes

132935
disk	ram
one possible problem is that having one database for each user will use disk space and ram very inefficiently and as the user base grows the benefit of using a light and fast database engine will be lost completely

132963
erd	diagram
this really throws dbas off until you point out that you can derive an erd from a class diagram by sliding all the arrows the to the other end of the lines.

formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview	listview	gridview
if the server-side control is within a databound control listview gridview formview detailsview then the syntax is

133271
inline	inlining
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

133348
findwindow	showwindow
i m not a delphi expert but if you can invoke win32 apis you can use findwindow and showwindow to minimize a window even if it does not belong to your app

133412
post	get
i will play some more with the designer support to ensure i fully understand it all then get a blog post up

133426
inline	inlining
as has been suggested in previous answers use of the inline keyword can make code faster by inlining function calls often at the expense of increased executables

133427
ssl	https
use ssl otherwise known as https

133446
filtering	grouping
ensure the user and workspace filtering are cleared and you ll get a list of all files grouping by changelist and client spec

133468
cstring	bstr
cstring bstr and ccombstr are not standard and not portable

133530
findwindow	showwindow
you can use findwindow to find the application handle and showwindow to minimize it

133613
hash	md5
if that s your case then you can just store a hash signature md5 instead and compare it with the signature of the entered password

133671
post	put
the problem is when i put 01 01 2009 into the textbox and the post does not validate due to other data being input incorrectly

133677
post	get
i don t think it s good to post complete codes for node balancing algorithms here since they get quite big

133691
width	height
i am looking for an elegent way to set the chart control s along with other control s width height based on the screen browser size

133801
client-side	server-side
sounds like you want to resize a server-side dynamic image based on a client-side value

133801
post	get
you can get the full cross browser technical list of which javascript elements to use at quirksmode.org but you ll still need to figure out how to write the script yourself. then post that size back to the server set the control with this new size then render it to the client as usual

133851
gmail	hotmail
i found a very nice one for yahoo gmail and hotmail

the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection

133890
ienumerable	icollection
a class that implements icollection such as collectionbase in addition to ienumerable must have a public item indexed property indexer in c# that takes an integer and it must have a public count property of type integer

133903
width	height
once the release the control i then reposition the table cell height or width according to where they moved the new control

133951
post	get
ajax can handle both get and post options

133964
int	boolean
i have a database column wantsreply that logically holds a boolean bit but is unfortunately implemented as an int

133979
post	get
make the xmlhttprequest request yourself passing post into the open method instead of get

134125
width	height
the width of every div is fixed but the height isn t

134138
prepare	execute
if there are no other restrictions on the username a prepare statement would still make sure that the above embedded query doesn t execute at the time of insert and store the value correctly in the database

134305
post	get
just enable it as an extension for some reason it wouldn t work with ze_extension on my windows machine setup your php.ini with xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger on and call your normal urls with xdebug_profile 1 as either a get or a post variable to profile that very request

134318
getter	setter
when a getter or setter is called the interceptor would check to see if the property exists in either collection and then take appropriate action

134346
hash	md5
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

134359
pop-up	dialog
if the program loses focus for any reason call comes in user switches programs user hits the windows button then i want a pop-up dialog box to cover the puzzle and the timer to stop

134359
pop-up	dialog
when the user closes the pop-up dialog the timer can start up again

134368
int	chars
to fit as much number as possible into as little of space as possible using the types int short and chars in c++

134368
int	chars
you would want to specify where the chars section starts and ends where the short section starts and ends and where the int section starts and ends

134424
submit	submission
perhaps i want to allow users to be able to submit as many line items as they want when submission an invoice form

134436
packets	multicast
if the interface can receive unicast traffic properly and a network analyzer wireshark for instance shows that the multicast joins are being sent and the inbound multicast packets are correctly formed i would suspect a driver issue

134477
perl	tcl
just be careful so you don t ultimately drive the move from a weird mixture of batch files excel matlab and tcl to a weird mixture of perl python and whatever other language catches your interest next

134551
rss	feed
i don t know about eclipse but for visual studio if someone really wanted this they could easily add the so rss feed for the start page news channel so the so question list appeared in the start page or even better narrow it down with a tag like for c#

134555
hide	show
you can then show or hide your puzzle in each timer tick

134582
rss	feed
you have the rss plugin for eclipse to read the stackoverflow feed

134597
versioning	upgrade
you may also tie the versioning numbers to an update policy...changes to a require the user to purchase an upgrade license whereas other changes do not

134653
ubuntu	linux
i was unable to reproduce the problem on linux ubuntu mono despite using the same code on the same conditions multiple same executable running simultaneously release mode etc.

134669
equals	gethashcode
you probably want to use c5.hashset and implement equals and gethashcode for foo

134677
put	get
this tryparse method was introduced in .net 2.0 to get over the fact that xxx.parse will through an exception if conversion fails and you have to put in try catch around the statement

134726
avr	microcontroller
another very clean and even simpler architecture is avr which is an 8-bit architecture used in microcontroller from atmel

134744
ant	maven
if you move to an ant or maven for you maven fans then you can automate the jar building very nicely and also use it outside of eclipse in an automated build environment

134814
hide	show
this means you can hide content in the print version which is show in the screen version or hide content in the screen version which you want to show up when printing.all you do is apply display none to the appropriate sections in the appropriate stylesheet

134972
versioning	upgrade
there was a huge explosion when we tried to label our next release a major versioning above the previous one because marketing sales thought our current customers would be upset that we have a new major versioning so soon and they need to upgrade

134999
bazaar	git
bazaar and other distributed tools such as git mercurial darcs and the like are ideal because you can have your repository stored in multiple places ie

135009
division	modulo
the divmod function is a convenient way to perform both division and modulo

135118
inherited	properties
try using firebug or chrome s inspect element feature right click on the select control click inspect element to see exactly what style properties are being inherited rendered for that specific object

135169
jobs	cron
gae s load balanced and scalable hosting sounds like a good fit for a system that could eventually be moving around a lot of data but it s lack of cron jobs is a nuisance

135226
getter	setter
opera supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc

135226
getter	setter
safari supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc

135231
httpwebresponse	system.net.httpwebrequest
what i do is build a custom class the wraps system.net.httpwebrequest httpwebresponse so retrieving pages is as simple as using system.net.webclient

135276
int	chars
you can determine the size of time_t at compiletime in terms of fundamental types so an int or a long or an ssize_t and then use the right format chars to py_buildvalue -- i for an int l for a long n for an ssize_t

135367
boost	stl
remaining within the boundaries of the c++ language and libraries i would suggest first getting used to programming using stl algorithm function templates as one the most common use you will have for boost lambda is to replace functor classes with inlined expressions inlined

135367
boost	stl
when you over- use the stl you find yourself gravitating towards boost bind and boost lambda

135367
boost	stl
so use stl algorithms write your own functors and then translate them into inline expressions using boost lambda

135441
migrate	upgrade
i have factored this code out into a third repository and then i periodically migrate that code into my dependent project repositories as internal release and upgrade steps

135441
versioning	upgrade
my individual projects then have a revision that looks like upgrade to v4.3.345 of shared.app.dll which includes all changes needed to work against that versioning

135460
post	get
of course this code will return an error since google uses get not post for search queries

135514
inherited	properties
ok it looks like i had the right answer unless if you don t want inherited properties

135514
inherited	properties
here are some other options to include inherited properties

135543
versioning	upgrade
the subversion versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

135589
put	get
make sure you use a masterpage so that all of your sub pages will have a common base and give all of your elements good ids because you will still need to get your hands dirty with css to put it all together

135599
erd	diagram
not sure if its a part of uml but i find entity relation diagram erd very useful when modeling your database.

135654
cvs	svn
the next one is probably useless for you but many people used to use cvs don t realize that svn has feature like that so i write it down

135656
post	get	postgresql	mysql
decide at runtime whether you want mysql postgresql memcached or http post get requests to a sketchy server in indonesia

135711
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	netbsd
if you want to get your hands dirty with kernel programming go with freebsd netbsd or opensolaris for example

135711
opensolaris	netbsd
these os-es even have a list of projects on their respective web-sites and i personally have extremely good experience with people on opensolaris forums and netbsd mailing lists

135739
imperative	declarative
the for-loop is imperative the algorithms are declarative

135795
client-side	server-side
it is a good approach is to use javascript to do client-side validation and give the user quick feedback and catch 99 + of the cases then do a server-side validation of the submitted parameters to catch the minority that don t have js enabled or who manipulate the html to submit non-expected values

135795
client-side	server-side
just remember that the client-side validation is optional and is good for those common mistakes input validation but the server-side validation is mandatory for all input whether or not any client-side checks have been done on the given input

135815
getter	setter
or course this is a simple example but there is a lot of stuff the operator module provides including the items setter getter for list and dict

135832
put	get
i want to get your opinion on whether this is a good idea or should i put my application metadata in the soap header itself

135836
freebsd	solaris
freebsd has specific concepts of jails and solaris has containers

135852
inherited	properties
it can t be inherited and all members properties and methods are static shared

135876
int	boolean
i think you almost answered this yourself i think the end aim is to make the code more readable and in this case the enum did that imo its always best to look at the end aim rather than blanket rules maybe think of it more as a guideline enums are often more readable in code than generic boolean int etc but there will always be exceptions to the rule

135929
put	get
i d like to just put in a comment in the block of my if-statement but i get an error when i try

135946
boost	stl
either standard c++ stl or boost ok mfc or atl win32 api or a small single-purpose and free library that i can download from somewhere

135971
uniq	grep
with some clever sort uniq diff grep awk later on has potential but i was wondering if anyone knows of any existing solutions

136051
ienumerable	ienumerator
take the following class it doesn t implement ienumerable or ienumerator

136154
profiling	benchmarking
if you re doing database stuff the dbi profiling can benchmarking your queries which is work happening in another program

136177
ndepend	fxcop
â just because code passes fxcop stylecop looks good in ndepend and passes automated tests doesnâ t mean it provides the best business value

136232
pyopengl	pyglet
if you are going to go with ctypes definitely check out the pyglet and pyopengl projects that have massive examples of ctype bindings

136233
put	get
but when i put this in my .aliases file i get an alias loop

136397
maven	pom.xml
try running first mvn install in project bar in order to put bar in your maven repository and then add the dependency to foo s pom.xml

136403
maven	pom.xml
bar s pom.xml needs to include foo in order to use maven to compile it

136422
rss	feed
many rss feed only keep the latest 10 or so posts so there would be no way to provide the older data from the feed since the blog started

136424
rss	feed
as other said depending on the rss feed you may only get a finite amount of items

136476
arp	icmp
not receiving any responses to icmp pings or arp requests is not a 100 guarantee that there s no network connection

136489
folder	directory
it is perfectly feasible to deploy user controls directly to sharepoint sites either through the controltemplates folder in the 12 hive or to a location in the web app virtual directory which you can then reference from web pages using sharepoint designer

136502
jquery	scriptaculous
there are two possible solutions there was a conflict with an older version of scriptaculous and jquery scriptaculous was attempting to extend the native array prototype incorrectly - first try upgrading your copy of scriptaculous

136536
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
i am trying to retrieve the value of an identity column into my dataset after performing an update using a sqldataadapter and sqlcommandbuilder

136563

136604
children	parent
i m having troubles and asking for your kind help in finding a way to keep track of parent id s and inserting the children without using cursors or nasty things like that.

136675
richtextbox	textblock
i m not sure if you can make a textblock selectable but another option would be to use a richtextbox - it is like a textbox as you suggested but supports the formatting you want

136714
disk	ram
depending on the size of the data and the amount of ram available one of the best performance gains will occur by setting sqlite to use an all-in-memory database rather than writing to disk

136733
codeigniter	cakephp
for php there is codeigniter kohanaphp and cakephp

136786
mouse	keyboard
for linux i unfortunately have not been able to find a good way to easily create keyboard mouse macros

136804
django	web.py
you might consider using something like web.py which would be easy to distribute since it s small and it would also be easy to adapt your other tools to it since it doesn t require you to submit to the framework so much like django does

136839
cvs	svn
version control a certain tagged version from svn cvs

136839
cvs	svn
version control a certain tagged version from svn cvs

136870

balsamiq mockups looks pretty nice

136988
erd	diagram
design document including an erd diagram of the database

137029
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome so far if it clears safari 3.0 on win it seems to clear google-chrome too

137035
fadein	fadeout
so if you really really want this effect then you will need to do the image fadeout spinner fadein and once that is complete triggering the upload

137069
folder	directory
svn creates .svn directory in every single folder git only creates one .git directory

137074
g++	gcc
use the -s option to gcc or g++

137173
ubuntu	debian
so far i ve tested it on ubuntu debian and red hat as

137203
cifs	smb
smb cifs supports file block reading so you should be streaming the file at that point of course you didn t actually say how you were accessing the file - i m just assuming smb

137279
post	get
i am not sure if i am following you with what you want but i have a custom get post module that i use to do some non standard stuff

137444
prng	random
you still have to estimate entropy if you want to know how random your seed value was - you can use the best prng in the world but its entropy is still limited by the entropy of the seed.

137525
children	parent
you might want to try an alternative approach where you have a parent maven project and two children project

137525
children	parent
parent pom.xml has references to both children projects modules

137552
int	boolean
well i can t remember enough from my php days to answer the part but for most c-style languages null should be used in the context of pointer values false as a boolean and zero as a numeric value such as an int

137577
int	boolean
0 is the int value of zero and false is the boolean value of well false

137586
post	get
also post any recommendations to books post that help you understand and get to running speed asap

137626
prng	random
my experience has been only with slow initialization of the prng not with generation of random data after that

137654
put	get
technically you can get around it anyways but you have to put in extra work to shoot yourself

137660
stdout	stderr
the iis process must have a stdin stdout and stderr

137705
websphere	ibm
i m looking for people who have had experience scaling ibm s websphere to high traffic volumes

137715
int	boolean
false is a valid boolean value 0 is a valid int value and php has some fairly ugly conversion between 0 0 and false

137723
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
in order of number of platforms under each os linux solaris windows hpux aix zlinux bsd osx os 360 i don t care about this one

137723
x86	64bit
solaris x86 64bit

137729
winpcap	wireshark
wireshark is handy as a stand alone utility you can use manually but it s also possible to do packet sniffing programmatically using winpcap the library on which wireshark is based

137731
public	protected
the ide is hiding the protected functions from the list because they are not available to the public just as the designer of the class intended

137738
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
redhat based systems fedora mandriva or debian based systems ubuntu

137773
versioning	upgrade
update the customer upgrade to the latest versioning of debian testing and the same error occurred

137788
getter	setter
properties are just getter setter methods with differant syntax

137815
ubuntu	debian
i ve generally been fine with plain old debian ubuntu has its caveats that sometimes hit you at wrong times

137850
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
if the argument to the free function does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or

137850
free	realloc
realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc

137869
super	self
therefore while i do think tdd would be super helpful i don t think it can be something that s learned successfully by one s self

137876
firefox	safari	safariwatir	firewatir
be aware that each browser has their own version of watir watir ie firewatir firefox and safariwatir safari

137917
postgresql	mysql
it works with both postgresql and mysql to perform non-blocking queries

137949
versioning	upgrade
firebug is stable on firefox 3 but you have to upgrade to versioning 1.2.1 since previous versioning no longer work

137954
opensuse	centos	redhat	fedora
with those things considered you would be best off with redhat fedora centos and suse opensuse

137954
redhat	fedora
i ve used redhat fedora and opensuse to run banking production apps and they are pretty good

137962
getter	setter
if my memory serves correctly the private keyword is the only way to create a privately scoped property getter or setter when its opposite has greater than private accessibility

138146
websphere	ibm
websphere 6.1 ships with an ibm jdk 1.5 or is it 5

138154
firefox	safari
browser support currently is ie safari firefox 3.1 alpha

138157
system.in	system.out
i m just using basic system.out and system.in functionality but i m happy to rebuild my i o wrappers

138242
rss	feed
then you could search for pages that offer their full article text in rss feed

138259
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if retrieval by index doesn t happen too often a sortedlist or sorteddictionary will have much better performance characteristics access by index can be achieved through the elementat extension method

138282
cvs	svn
there are even svn tools guides and git tools guides out there that will do this cvs conversion for you

138310
rss	feed
you can always get your own but be warned html pages often need heavy cleanup so restrict yourself to rss feed

138322
jena	rdflib
in the end i rely mostly on 3rd-party storage backends like jena rdflib et al

138350
int	chars
the first obvious one that comes to my mind is that your array of int is 2 to 4 times larger than an array of chars and hence if the array is big enough you ll get fewer data cache hits which will definitely slow down the performance

138362
sorting	filtering
you can also filtering the list before sorting by inserting a grep if you want to filtering on the same cached value

138398
post	get
once you get this working you might want to post your findings to pinvoke.net for others to make use of

138412
gridview	sqldatasource
i can t get my gridview to enable a user to sort a column of data when i m using a custom sqldatasource

138414
udp	tcp
udp tcp messages

138463
hash	md5
if you use cryptographic hash md5 sha1 ripemd160 the hash will be unique modulo collisions which are very improbable -- sha1 is used for digital signatures and md5 is also collision-resistant on random inputs

138472
put	get
you put in and get out data by specifying the key you are operating on

138472
put	get
this implies that put key value get key contains key and remove key are all really fast

138532
filenotfoundexception	eofexception
an example from the java-api is ioexception that has subclasses like filenotfoundexception or eofexception and much more

138547
daemons	launchd
i d installed full-text searching during installation the sql full-text filter daemons launchd is running thorough an admin user account

138592
post	get
you can see the files its loading including the paths to each and you can even sniff post and get variables

138746
hash	md5
you can install an alternative hash generation function if you want to customise the way the id is generated it s a 128bit number generated via md5 by default

138779
organization	naming
there s a reason classes are broken into namespaces -- primarily for organization and to reduce naming conflicts

138851
postgresql	mysql
the one that s in mysql postgresql and not the one that s in myapp models.py

138888
django	web.py
if you think django is too much you can try a lighter one like the very small but still handy web.py

138898
pull	push
you don t need a server for it as it s a distributed version control system - you can hold a whole repository copy on a flash drive and push pull changes from it

138898
cvs	svn
as opposed to svn and cvs it doesn t spread its metadata directories all over the repository

138948
opera	google-chrome
users mainly use firefox2 but also opera 9.x ff3 ie7 and google-chrome are used to access the site

139035
width	height

139070
decoder	encoder
pypng - lightweight png decoder encoder

139073
hash	salt
this means that you generate a random string for each new user and use that string to salt the hash

139089
serializable	deserialization
i have not tried this either but google s protocol buffers look really good simple format creates automatic bindings to c++ java and python and implements serializable and deserialization of the created objects

139120
codeigniter	cakephp
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

139155
google-chrome	firefox
i have it on good authority that this won t work in google-chrome and firefox although it works perfectly in ie which is where i tested it

139212
post	put
i need functionality beyond that of soappy so i was planning on moving to zsi but i can t figure out how to put the cookies on the zsi post made to the service

139213
system.in	system.out
system.out and system.in are statics and therefore evil

139308
gridview	datalist
datalist - more customisable version of the gridview

139308
gridview	datalist
almost a hybrid of the datalist and gridview where you can use paging and build in gridview like functionality but have the freedom of design

139478
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

139506
clang	llvm
clang llvm s c fronted supports most features except floating-point pragmas

139546
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net language is related but not compatible with vb6

139546
vb.net	vb6
conversion between vb6 and vb.net is problematic

139555
mockups	prototyping
free form drawing tools are also part of this category i m a happy heavy weight inkscape user but prototyping and mockups are obviously not their main purpose

139582
mvp	presenter
my main issue is that almost every single mvp implementation has the view holding onto the presenter and telling the presenter to do things

139582
children	parent
then the view holding onto the controller looks kinda silly the parent is the controller and the children are the views

139582
mvp	presenter
a traditional form holds presenter mvp implementation has other consequences

139582
mvp	presenter
the way to fix this is to pass in an interface again most mvp implementation i see have the form creating the presenter but hey

139602
ftp	telnet
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc

139605
ubuntu	debian
for debian and ubuntu there s packages.debian.org and packages.ubuntu.com

139645
jar	war
for example if you package log4j v1 in the war file log4j v2 at ear level and you put log4j v3 in your app-server s class path the module will use the jar in its own module

139723
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve been using various javascript frameworks including mootools jquery prototype and scriptaculous and have found them all good but difficult to extend to more complex ideas

139814
sorting	filtering
the filtering and sorting features of excel lend themselves well to logfile analysis

139866
junit	jmock
write clones of junit and jmock checks refelction metaprogramming

139884
postgresql	mysql
mysql and mssql both provide this functionality iirc so i would be surprised if postgresql didn t

139894
nlb	iis
windows nlb is definitely your solution - it sits in the network stack on each of your iis servers and distributes tcp requests among the member servers

139921
put	get
when i try this the page reloads the action is # but any new text typed in the fields is not passed in the request so i don t get to put it in the db

139964
ant	cruisecontrol
i m trying to get the build automated using cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net isn t an option so i m trying to tie it into normal ant scripts and i keep on running into problems with the length of the paths

140024
width	height
i believe you need to write your own serializer for it to basically save out the width height and pixel values.

140076
cstring	bstr
copy the bstr into a cstring do all the modifications there and then copy it back into the bstr ccombstr

140107
union	distinct
edit actually i believe the union process will only bring back distinct rows anyway as opposed to union all but i could be wrong - i haven t actually tried this..

140108
put	get
it may be acceptable to put the apache server on the dev server and host the files remotely on a stable backed-up file server though there are a number of pitfalls with this approach if you are unable to get additional server resources

140138
width	height
however you can cheat and look at its readobject and writeobject code - find width and height grab the pixels with pixelgrabber

140166
spaces	delimiter
this method splits on spaces delimiter hex values but it wouldn t be hard to make it split the string on any other criteria such as into groupings of two characters

140228
lisp	scheme
you may have a parser generator tool like antlr or yacc you can use to help you generate the parser or use a language like lisp scheme and marry the two up

140287
rss	feed
checks for all the latest entries in a number of rss podcast feed

140320
trac	mantis
having tried trac and mantis its my personal fav

140335
installation	upgrade
you may have trouble with this if you upgrade your installation to 3.5sp1 even in the core functionalities

140359
mantis	bugzilla
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

140406
width	height
i have a bunch of items in our inventory database with length width and height dimesions defined

140428
range	max	range	min	min	max
if the min max solutions are not good enough if the dates are not contiguous and you want to group separate date range separately i wonder if something using oracle s start with and connect by clauses would work

140448
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu you can install the -dbg packages to get symbols

145474
hash	salt
what you should do is store the hash of a pre-chosen and secret salt value + the password

145474
hash	salt
i.e. concatenate the salt and the password hash the result and store this hash

145474
hash	salt
when authenticating do the same - concatenate your salt value and the user-supplied password hash then check for equality

145474
hash	salt
of course if the user send passwords across the network for example if you re working on a web or client-server application then you should not send the password in clear text across so instead of storing hash salt + password you should store and check against hash salt + hash password and have your client pre-hash the user-supplied password and send that one across the network

children	parent
it comes up with the correct query to add the parent and assigns a new guid for id however it doesn t associate that parent id to the children objects in the sql it tries to execute

146942
children	parent
doing it that way is the only way i can seem to get nhibernate to see that these children really belong to this parent

disk	ram
this seems to give the best of both worlds if another application needs that memory it can immediately claim the physical ram and start writing to it since another copy of it is on disk and can be swapped back in when the inactive application is woken up

147125
disk	ram
and when the original app wakes up any of its pages that are still in ram can be used as-is without having to pull them off the disk

147161

put	get	post	put	post	get
why not focus on their behavioral benefits safety and idempotency forgetting their names and use get put or post depending on which behavior we want

147195
put	get	post	put	post	get
the rest 1 approach uses post get put and delete to implement the crud rules for a web resource

147195
post	put
further post uri s have no key where put must have a key

147195
post	put
i suppose you could insist on some ambiguity where post does either post or put

147195
post	get
if you re not building a restful interface then it s typical to only use get and post for retrieve and create update

147195
post	put
it s common to have uri differences or message content differences to distinguish between post and put when a person is clicking submit on a form

when all the pieces are in place then you can post put the transaction wrapper with all the component pieces

147305
sorting	grouping
if the data is both directly related to the additive fact and is not something you want to be grouping sorting search on then putting it in the fact table is okay

147326
put	get	post	put	post	get
you could use only get and post but then you are losing out on some of the precision and clarity that put and delete bring

147326
put	get
if you think of a resource management api then get put and delete probably cover 80 -90 of the required functionality

147326
post	get
if you limit yourself to get and post then 40 -60 of your api is accessed using the poorly specified post

147340
post	get
in http 1.0 written in 1996 there were only get head and post

vim	emacs
i know vim and emacs and vim fits my brain and my habits better

147712
ant	maven
or use ant or maven

147726
wan	lan
the idea was that instead of having our program beat against the wan when it s down they d send a configuration file containing the closely-guarded admin credentials run it in each lan and zip up the results and e-mail it back

147763
width	height
it s a bit of a hack but you could add an empty div with a width of 1px and height of 1000px inside your #content div

147886
width	height
it s been a while since i ve done so but i think the closest html dom equivalent is setting a width on a div and requesting the height cut and paste reuse so apologies if this contains errors

147928
width	height
although it may appear like a double in xaml the actual value for a definition s height or width is a gridlength struct

147928
width	height
unlike every other property in wpf width and height don t default their databinding mode to twoway you have to manually set this

superclass	subclassing
the crtp gets a lot less curious if you consider that the subclassing type that is passed to the superclass is only needed at time of method expansion

149978
superclass	subclassing
you just need the pattern to import the symbolic subclassing type into the superclass but it is just a forward declaration - as all formal template param types are by definition - as far as the superclass is concerned

149978
superclass	subclassing
we use in a somewhat modified form passing the subclassing in a traits type structure to the superclass to make it possible for the superclass to return objects of the derived type

149978
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the application is a library for geometric calculus points vectors lines boxes where all the generic functionality is implemented in the superclass and the subclassing just defines a specific type cfltpoint inherited from tgenpoint

149995
unsigned	short
if i change the type of the field wwindow to unsigned int wwindow 16 which has the same number of bits as an unsigned short the program tells me the size of the struct is now 20 bytes the correct size

150010
pop-up	dialog
ideally the user is going to click on an icon next to a text box that will pop-up the form they will select the department they need and when they click ok the dialog will close and i will have the value selected for me to update the textbox with

150012
unsigned	short
interesting - i would think that word would evaluate to unsigned short so you d have that problem in more than one place

150023
folder	directory
remove all directory in build folder

150026
for-loop	loops
for example setting documenttext in a for-loop will only set properly on the first iteration of loops

150064
subtract	add
for each row in the datatable add subtract the credit debits to the previous row s balance and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datatable

150064
subtract	add
for each item or altitem add subtract the credit debits to the global variable and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datagrid

150123
try-catch	exception-handling
using a try-catch block to save on performance because your invalid data rate is low is an abuse of exception-handling handling at the expense of maintainability and good coding practices

150141
lisp	scheme
in languages like lisp scheme they re often passed around quite liberally as function parameters but the idiom in c# typically finds lambdas used only for lazy evaluation of functions as in linq or for making event-handling code a bit terser

150203
inherited	properties
i would make a custom control that inherited from contextmenu that has a sharedmenuitems dependancy properties and a menuitems dependancy properties

150224
unsigned	short
this is followed by the unsigned short which is on an int boundary and then a word which is along aligned on an int boundary which means that there 2 bytes of padding between them

150224
unsigned	short
when you switch to unsigned int wwindow 16 instead of being a separate short the compiler uses the unused parts of the previous bitfield so no waste no short and no padding after the short hence you save four bytes

150278
cpu	processors
it was a bit hard on the processors we were running on a pentium-iii equivalent machine and it was pushing 50 -75 peak cpu

150283
lisp	scheme
so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start

150302
terminate	timeout
a short timeout value will consume considerably more cpu than the infinite timeout but there are good reasons for using a short timeout for example if you want to terminate the process thread the runloop is running in

150359
put	get
but when i try to just put something in there i get an errorinvalidchangekey

150361
cpu	processors
doing it that way however should improve performance because it would come down to doing only about 20-30k vector transformations which doesn t take much processors power on most modern cpu s

150381
pop-up	dialog
make sure that excel is set to not pop-up dialog

150393
cpu	hyperthreading
in either case hardware_concurrency returns the number of threads that the hardware is capable of executing concurrently based on the number of cpu cores and hyperthreading units

150411
verilog	vhdl
if you re going to do a lot of bit manipulation and you care much more about readability rather than performance for your application then you may want to create an integer wrapper to enable slicing like in verilog or vhdl

150443
postgresql	mysql
let you access sqlplus and other command line sql environments for postgresql mysql

150480
implements	sealed
when coming to mock classes that are not test friendly sealed not implements any interface methods are not virtual you would probably want to use the adapter design pattern

150489
getter	setter
-automated code generation eclipse s generate getter setter aren t likely to understand this so you ll have to fix it by hand or muck with eclipse enough to get it to recognize

150491
public	protected
i tend to group things by visibility public then protected then private and use #regions to group related things functionally regardless of whether it is a property method or whatever

150862
yacc	jflex
since i usually work with java my preferred method is jflex but there is also lex yacc and several others

i have a folder var unity conf with some properties files in it and i d like the caucho s resin jvm to have that directory on the classpath

151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
suppressfinalize should only be called by a class that has a finalizer

151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
suppressfinalize tells the gc that the object was cleaned up properly and doesn t need to go onto the finalizer queue

151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
the suppressfinalize optimization is not trivial as your objects can live a long time waiting on the finalizer queue

151278
int	boolean

note that you can also use attr_reader or attr_writer to define just getter or setter or you can define them manually as such

151385
cairngorm	flex
i was new to flex when i learned cairngorm but found it useful and easy to learn with the above

152132
versioning	upgrade
you still have the job with adding dll s when deciding to upgrade to a other versioning of the dll though

152133
gendarme	fxcop
just stick to the mono make sure that you have gendarme code inspector fxcop for mono checking your code for portability issues and you should be fine

152141
equals	toarray
i d be much more concerned about the toarray call on the populated list which will result in a memory allocation equals to its internal size and a memory copy of the contents of the list into it

152157
allegro	sdl
since you mention gdi+ i suppose you want it for windows but there are good portable solutions like sdl allegro cairo etc

152234
versioning	upgrade
from this point on you ve given the customer a reason why not to upgrade to your new versioning and to stay with the old versioning

152365
mouse	keyboard
each structure represents an event to be inserted into the keyboard or mouse input stream

152443
profiling	instrumentation
it uses sampled profiling has some useful ui does not require instrumentation

152464
inherited	properties
javascript uses prototypes to define object properties including methods and inherited

152510
udp	tcp
you create a socket by either defining a local address in case of tcp ip an address is an ip address and usually in case it s a tcp or udp socket a port number both can be any and then binding the socket to it and just use it a server socket or you can create a socket by defining a remote address and then connecting the socket to it additionally you can bind it to a local address in advance if you want to keep control of the local address and port as well and use it as a client socket

152514
cvs	svn
bonus points for ignoring cvs and svn control files folders

152514
cvs	svn
the script would be needed to run a build on a linux system so i think changes to cvs or svn control files should be omitted

152516
mbunit	mstest
mstest is slow mbunit

152521
udp	tcp
a port denotes a communication endpoint in the tcp and udp transports for the ip network protocol

152575

152607
swt	swing	awt	swing
i you are not using a gui for instance awt swing or swt you could try starting you application in headless mode

152614
imperative	declarative
i prefer to write in functional or declarative style over imperative whenever i can

152619
min	max
that would make the calculation of min and max fairly trivial

152625
min	max
all of these suggestions involve walking the list twice if you need to get both the max and min

152629
post	get
support of post and get methods

152630
hash	salt
i store my passwords hash in the usertable with a unique salt per user

152633
children	parent
if it does i start selectively adding it to elements starting with the element the element s parent children etc

152679
hash	salt
if you salt the password before storage you must compare the hash salt password to the db

152754
post	get
worse you could get publicly bashed on blogs like youthoughtwewouldntnotice.com making such blog post about you high-ranked google results for your name thus tarnishing your reputation irreversibly

152773
versioning	upgrade
my eclipse is a highly recommended versioning that i ve seen all over the net that is really very affordable last i heard 50 for the distro plus a year of free upgrade

152789
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
after testing with a serialized object written to a file using the objectoutputstream in a java 1.5 program then running a read with a objectinputstream in a java 1.6 program i can say this worked without any issue

152808
children	parent
the children send notifications to their parent

152823
.htaccess	httpd.conf
update renamed htacces.txt to .htaccess and ammended the appropriate directives in the httpd.conf file and all seems to work

152829
min	max
when signal is poor noisy data values spread max to min is low and there s proportionally higher noise in many more buckets

152873
put	get
if you edit the test run configuration by double clicking the .testrunconfig file that gets put into the solution items solution folder when you add a new unit test you get a test run configuration dialog

152881
addition	multiplication
the double name n m format is very fast when you are accessing data by rows both because has almost no overhead besides a multiplication and addition and because your rows are packed data that will be coherent in cache

152922
put	get	post	put	post	get
the mapping between get and post and put and delete and controller actions is set up in config routes.rb in most modern rails code

152929
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest only cares about 4 events in the life on an object create post retrieve get update put and delete

152994
boost	stl
boost especially will cause this but even the regular stl code can do this

153015
udp	tcp
sockets are protocol specific - so the implementation of uniqueness that both tcp ip and udp ip uses ipaddress port is different than eg. ipx network node and...ahem socket - but a different socket than is meant by the general socket term

153015
udp	tcp
since ip has become the dominant protocol a port in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp port number - which is a portion of the socket address

153015
udp	tcp
the api functions make it clear that both are just different type of sockets - sock_dgram is udp just sending a message and sock_stream is tcp creating a virtual circuit

153015
udp	tcp
technically the ip header holds the ip address and the protocol on top of ip udp or tcp holds the port number

153066
boost	stl
one big advantage of boost is that many of its features will show up in the stl extensions for the upcoming c++0x standard see for example

153071
.htaccess	httpd.conf
my guess is that within xampp you need to enable allowoverride through an .htaccess in httpd.conf

153082
ubuntu	linux
the only software that i see providing torrent links are linux distros and not all of them for example the ubuntu website does not provide torrents to download ubuntu

153154
children	parent
copy data over starting with the lowest level grandchildren children parent

153158
versioning	upgrade
typically the rule of thumb with dnn is to upgrade to the most current versioning and keep an eye on the security items posted on the site also keeping an eye on cathal s blog is a good idea as he is the head security person

153200
put	get
rest has guarantees of safety a get message won t change state and idempotence a put request sent multiple times has same effect as just one time

153214
hide	show
active is somewhat like an onclick event so if you nest a hidden input in the li this css hide the span and show the input when the li is clicked on

153221
put	get
which seems to get called when i do python myservice stop from the command line i can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file but doesn t actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to python myservice start gives me an error

153222
ienumerable	idictionary
i feel it very comfortable to work with when the view interface exposes only basic clr types such as string mapped to textboxes idictionary mapped to dropdownlists ienumerable mapped to some grids repeaters

153261
getter	setter
i interpret that as meaning that testing setter and getter that don t do anything except set or get is probably too much testing no need to take the time

153297
getter	setter
getter ans setter too because they could accept negative value or null value that you might do not want to accept

153317
getter	setter
i don t unit tests simple setter getter methods that have no side effects

153317
junit	easymock	maven	cobertura

degrafa	flex
if you re interested in leveraging the graphics potential of flex why not go check out degrafa which is an open source graphing and general graphics api

153399
degrafa	flex
it s pretty cool very well documented and quote - adobe has asked if the degrafa team would consider helping directly contribute to the flex graphics open source effort. - which they are

153409
post	get
edit this may not be relevant if the source is not post or get but i read in the php manual that it could cause odd behaviour anyway

153419
flexunit	cairngorm
asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint

153436
vbscript	jscript
assuming this is for an intranet where you can set permissions and mandate ie you can generate the workbook client side with jscript vbscript driving excel

only get and post methods are supported out of the box unless you

153509
ant	maven
if you re using ant or maven you can control which tests are run by filtering the tests by name

153527
opera	firefox
setting accept-charset attribute to form element like this works for firefox opera etc

153588
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
from the user perspective a form that just does the right thing by figuring out what i want makes me much happier than having to understand a stack of text boxes checkbox and dropdownlistfor

153607
profiling	instrumentation
best yet it can instrumentation a running process and lets you turn data collection on and off at runtime both manually and based on the callstack - great for profiling a small section of a larger program

153780
multiplying	subtract
solving this system by multiplying the first equation by v2.v2 and the second by v1.v1 and subtract or otherwise gives the equations for a and b

in the good old days of 8-bit chars we could use the upper 8-bits of an int to store any formatting flags and the lower 8-bits to store the chars itself

154356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested the above in the following browsers ie6 7 8b2 firefox 2.0.0.17 3.0.3 opera 9.52 safari for windows 3.1.2 and google-chrome whatever the latest version was at the time of this post and it works across all browsers

this is especially important for servicing purposes - making sure that when a service pack for vsts is applied to the client machine then the tfs api s get upgraded as well

154849
x86	64bit
the tfs api assemblies are all marked x86 but if you app is marked any cpu then on a x64 machine it will get loaded by the 64bit clr but when it comes time to dynamically load the tfs assemblies it will fail

154854
division	multiplication
1 multiplication and division come

154854

paredit	ido-mode
i use paredit for easy e lisp handling and ido-mode minibuffer completions

155033
spaces	delimiter
import the file as spaces delimiter delete the header rows and the #fields label and then use the autofilter functions to slice and dice the data as you need it.

155059
min	max
single enumeration yielding both min and max and any other aggregate you want to throw in there

155077
cifs	smb
after studying the capture what i found was that the server message block or smb aka cifs aka samba connection between our server and the file server was actually timing out at the tcp level due to extreme loading on the server

155129
switching	screens
i typically have things set up so i can pass a switching like -unattended that suppresses the console screens

155210
http.sys	httplistener
the .net class httplistener exposes the underlying http.sys upon which iis is built

155214
width	height
there is an io error event where you could set the width and height of the image

155234
sudo	passwd
executing sudo -p sudo passwd

155243
client-side	server-side
the server-side the one that initiates the shutdown ends up in state fin_wait2 whereas the client-side the one that does not explicitly respond to the shutdown ends up in state close_wait

155283
profiler	vtune
for windows i ve tried amd codeanalyst intel vtune and the profiler in visual studio team edition

155371
post	get
i want to use xmlhttprequest in javascript to post a form that includes a file type input element so that i can avoid page refresh and get useful xml back

155403
stdout	stderr
this will give you access to stdin stdout and stderr

155441
post	get
you will need to post to an iframe to get this to work simply add a target attribute to your form where you specify the iframe id

155510
bash	zsh
it assumes that emacs s inferior shell is bash zsh or other compatible shell

155542
pdcurses	ncurses
you could write your program to uses ncurses and then use pdcurses to convert it to an x11 application - as the readme advertise

155552
modifiers	sealed
the sealed modifiers will do what final does in java

155612
disk	ram
not to mention things like ssd or even ram disk for your templates will make it a non-issue

155615
client-side	server-side
i understand that server-side validation is an absolute must to prevent malicious users or simply users who choose to disable javascript from bypassing client-side validation

155662
cos	sin
you need to use a partial function to input the radians into cos and sin

155662
cos	sin
that said javascript s sin and cos aren t quite as picky so you must have halved your radian or something

155664
firefox	safari
when performing an xmlhttprequest and executing a function onreadystatechange the xmlhttprequest.responsetext property contains the data loaded at that point in firefox but not in ie and maybe safari

155669
hide	show
i might show or hide certain features or change certain text

155682
rdf	owl
semantic web for the working ontologist book contains a good number of practical examples and motivates the need for rdf rdfs and owl and is in my opinion very readable

155696
hash	salt
the salt and the password are hash together not once but 1000 times

155706
internationalization	localization
i have been looking at a few options for enabling localization and internationalization of a dynamic php application

155713
dictionary	map
attributes are usable in domains where they map onto data structures that follow those rules the names and values of properties on an object of columns in a row of a table of entries in a dictionary

155723
postgresql	mysql
this method is undocumented in the mysql adapter but is documented in the postgresql adapter

155730
firefox	safari
as of 2008 javascript 1.7 is supported in firefox 2.0+ and safari 3.x

155761
firefox	safari
generators and iterators works only in firefox 2+ and safari

155767
cos	sin
as it happens sin and cos are also functions

155852
inherited	properties
i have a class which inherited from component it has one properties which is a collection of rules

155891
coldfusion	verity
can t seem to rename an existing verity collection in coldfusion without deleting recreating and rebuilding the collection

155950
spaces	delimiter
this command parses each line in myfile.txt ignoring lines that begin with a semicolon and passing the second and third token from each line to the for body tokens are delimiter by commas or spaces

155956
openbsd	netbsd
the netbsd and openbsd versions support only -r

155963
getter	setter
the reason for using a di container are that you don t have to have a billion properties pre-configured in your code that are simply getter and setter

155963
getter	setter
these methods will allow you to ensure that any interface specified as a field in your class instance is configured correctly upon startup and then you no longer have to null-check your getter and setter assuming you do allow your singletons to remain thread-safe

156009
spaces	delimiter
these are obviously spaces delimiter but for the sake of generality it might as well be anything

156024
folder	directory
note 2 i recommend you create a temporary folder for the tests and run command line or powershell whose current working directory is set to this location

156088
rss	feed
this is done when a website does not offer an rss feed or a rest api for accessing the data in a programmatic way

156099
post	get
but a comment on this blog post seems to indicate that they won t get you what you are looking for runtimethreadsuspended is issued when a thread is being suspended by the runtime typically in preparation for doing a gc.

156116
firefox	safari
an answer that would work cross browser safari webkit firefox etc. would be preferred

156136
direct3d	directx
i looked around and found the directx direct3d stuff which has all the underlying pieces but there doesn t appear to be any high level api to work with unless you re willing to use .net and use wpf neither of which really interest me

156136
direct3d	directx
directx direct3d has these pieces but you have to jump through a lot of hoops or so it appears to use it

156172
x86	mips
the world would be better if we all ran mips i think or even arm or powerpc - or rather if intel amd took their semiconductor expertise and used it to make multi-core ultra-fast ultra-cheap mips processors instead of x86 processors with all of those redeeming qualities

156249
mouse	keyboard
by this i mean if you take something that relied on both the mouse and keyboard and changed it to rely only on the mouse or only on the keyboard then you have improved useability

156261
stdout	stderr
the tool calls out to the shell and i wanted to capture exactly what was displayed during test runs no matter what git was displaying and no matter if it was being spit out in stdout or stderr

156270
for-loop	if-statement
thus the more appropriate place for the lock would be inside portions of code such as inside a for-loop or if-statement so you can free up the individual elements right away even before other ones are processed

156280
put	get	pull	push
i know i can do an hg incoming -p to see the patch sets of changes coming in but it d be nice to just directly see the actual changes for a particular file that i d get if i do a pull of the latest stuff or what i might be about put push out

156328
keydown	keyup
for keypress you can also use sendmessage sending both keydown and keyup

156365
inherited	properties
linq-to-sql has some support for inherited via a discriminator here here but you can only query on classes that are defined in the linq model - data classes themselves and more perhaps importantly for this example the query itself must be phrased in terms of data classes although tentity is a data class it knows that the properties here is declared on the entity base

156369
lisp	scheme
and there are equivalents in lisp and scheme

156374
lisp	scheme
well apart from common lisp labels and scheme letrec which you ve already mentioned javascript also allows you to name an anonymous function

156523
int	chars
if i was going to do a rewrite i just used delphi ansistrings for each text buffer in the current version with newline chars embedded i d use int or int64s for each chars and encode block start stop cursor position and line markers in the high bits that way you don t have to adjust pointers when you insert or delete things

156604
memcached	apc
depending on what you really need you might be looking for apc memcached various template caching libs.

156640
gif	png	gif	ico	exif	xmp	exif	webp	png	ico
it fully supports exif as well as iptc xmp and many other types of metadata from file types including jpeg png gif png ico webp psd .

156721
ioexception	fileinputstream
fileinputstream has a finalizer method which will close the stream for you in the unlikely event that you actually receive an ioexception in your processing

156772
dependencyobject	uielement
if the object is intended to sit in the xaml tree its best to use dependencyproperties and thus inherit dependencyobject - which all uielement do to allow all the benefits that dependencyproperties provide being animatable binding optional automatic child inheritance etc

156795
put	get
it s not the most elegant solution but you could use openrowset to put the stored proc results into a table then use sp_help to get a description of it

156800
width	height
ps since i have a 2.0 app i m using the object tag approach to silverlight and it s contained in a div with height and width set in style

156912
mouse	keyboard
when a mouse down is detected on the button i want to send a specific keyboard code to the application currently on focus

156916
bash	zsh
i am using zsh but a bash solution is also welcome

156954
spaces	delimiter
important spaces are by far not the only delimiter

156963
terminate	timeout
since by default there is a timeout that kills the service after 30 seconds when it was not able to go beyond the start methods this was the reason why it simply terminate

156990
rss	feed
this is done when a website does not offer an rss feed or a rest api for accessing the data in a programmatic way

157025
inline	inlining
and when you are at a point of code you are sure about the type of the object being called you may make an inline call that will avoid the polymorphic system and enable inlining by the compiler

157028
hide	show
show the window programatically hide it immediately programatically and click cancel on it well you guessed programmatically

157037
spaces	delimiter
your word delimiter are going to be many spaces tab beginning of line parentheses periods commas exclamation question marks etc

157134
factors	mean
physical distance whilst a factors does not always mean that latency automatically goes up

157151
png	ico
furthermore setting the icon of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place

157180
folder	directory
first create a directory inside your eclipse installation folder for example opt eclipse called links

157186
bazaar	git
maybe you could look at something other than subversion if you dont want a server like a distributed vcs bazaar git and mercurial are popular these days or you should look at subversion hosting services

157200
ant	maven
there should be an ant or maven or similar build script that will allow a developer to build and deploy from their working copy onto the development web server so they can see how it is

157215
vim	emacs
so instead of using an ide which you ll probably do all your professional life get a taste of using old school editors like vim emacs

157238
lwjgl	jogl
consider using opengl use jogl of lwjgl

157238
lwjgl	jogl
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

157244
folder	directory
one solution would be to use iis manager to configure the website created for your asp.net app by visual studio and add a virtual directory for each of the common folder so that by the virtual nature of the virtual directory they will appear to be in the same root folder as your asp.net app

157295
post	get
as a side note you ll find the request method in this case get and for submitted forms usually post in request.method

157401
division	multiplication
in about 99.8 of all cases it s just plus minus division and multiplication in some intelligent combinations - in most cases it s about algorithms not math

157446
x86	64bit
as for the size of the .net 3.5 deployable file is that it s .net 2.0 3.0 and 3.5 for x86 x64 and the other 64bit architecture in one big file

157451
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
it seems to combine all the best of nunit mbunit and mstest

157456
perforce	svn
i would pick it over either svn or perforce any day

157493
perforce	svn
i believe svn is very good system as svn is free i would think you d have to have a compelling reason to switch especially as perforce does take a while to learn

157519
min	max
you get a coercion mechanism with allows you to define rules for max min and present value of the property

157532
post	get
when it comes to support for other methods than get and post the problem mostly lies in that some browsers for example safari don t support these and flash player relies on the browser for all it s networking

157649
perforce	svn
disclaimer my info on perforce is old used it for a while in 2005-06 before fully switching to svn

157696
folder	directory
change directory to mysql installation folder

157718
stdout	stderr
in that case my advice would be to use stderr rather than stdout

157721
post	get
good luck and please post more details about your scenario if you want to get more accurate hints.

157771
put	get
assuming you use lazy matches you can get a set of matches on a string which you can put into your array

157781
capitalization	uppercase
however there seems to be a bug in this method it returns all node names in uppercase and all attribute names in lowercase regardless of the capitalization i used to create the node

157785
vbscript	vba
the on error goto label syntax is supported by visual basic and visual basic for applications vba but vbscript doesn t support this language feature so you have to use on error resume next as described above

157984
textwrangler	textedit
you can then open .bashrc in textedit or in textwrangler and add the previous commands

158057
lisp	scheme
so you see the following when editing lisp scheme

158066
perforce	svn
i use perforce at work svn at home

158120
addition	modulo
the .net framework includes math.ieeeremainder x y in addition to the standard modulo

158125
children	parent
are you only concerned with elements that are children of the same parent or all elements at the same level cousins if you like or elements anywhere in the document.

158144
put	get
i bet if you put your send code in a for 1 100000 loop you would eventually get a write that succeeds with a value smaller than requested

158151
photoshop	paint.net
do i really have to open an image program like paint.net or photoshop simply to paste an image then save it

158175
children	parent
forcing everything into layout managers the different wpf panels does not make much sense for certain scenarios where you don t care that elements are maintained by some parent container and you do not want the other children to be affected by a change in the layout appearance of each other

158200
put	get
sets recognized properties for an ftp server to put and get xml input and a jms queue server that keeps track of jobs

158200
post	put
the junit test i am working on simply needs to emulate this environment by starting a local ftp and mock queue server for the filter to connect to then waiting for the filter to connect to the queue and put the new xml input file on a local directory via a local ftp server wait for the queue message and then modify the xml input slightly put the modified xml in a new directory and post another message to the queue signifying the job has completed

158253
folder	directory
as a user navigates between folder it s changing your application directory to the one currently being looked at

158292
folder	directory
the current working directory of the applicaiton will be c folder 1

158319
opera	safari
iâ m familiar with firefoxâ s pageshow event but unfortunately neither opera nor safari implement this

158435
post	put
i ll put together a short sample and post it here

158457
daemons	systemd
so i have a daemons running on a linux systemd and i want to have a record of its activities a log

158489
ubuntu	debian
if your code is c++ then you might consider log4cxx in the apache project apt-get install liblog4cxx9-dev on ubuntu debian but it looks like you are using c

158539
google-chrome	firefox
break line tag is not working in firefox neither in google-chrome

158548
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
ok i tried this and it works in firefox 3 safari 3.1.1 and ie7 but not in opera 9.52

158550
submit	submission
that way your function will be called whether the link is clicked or the submit button is pushed or the enter key is pressed and you can cancel the submission by returning false

158550
submit	submission
edit i would recommend always hooking form submission this way rather than calling submit on the form object

158587
int	boolean
true boolean are coerced to unit int and false boolean to zero int

158603
cpu	processors
thus the bigger problem might be that you rely on a certain speed you assume the processors can perform that many operations a second however when the core frequency is lowered it will behave like a slower cpu less operations per second and the core frequency doesn t jump to max just because the cpu is not 100 idle

158652
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
don t forget that nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller will release the top-level objects of the nib files they govern

158704
ftp	telnet
for a telnet style protocol like ftp smtp pop or imap something like sending return newline and getting back a command prompt

158711
pcm	music
by the solution you propose setting the digital output as default my pc would output pcm in games music etc

158731
gif	bmp
when you press a hotkey it captures and saves a snapshot of your screen to a jpg gif or bmp file

158737
unix	solaris
platforms in use include windows linux unix and solaris

158755
implements	extends
in java an interface is not technically a class it is a type but not a class hence the keyword implements and interfaces do not extends object

158758
disk	ram
6 - ram disk

158761
updatepanel	onclientclick
style a button to look like a tab then set it s onclientclick event to switch the active view in an updatepanel

158806
width	height
i want the input-box to inherit the height width from the parent table-cell but when i look at the input-box in firebug it has an inline css height width already set causing the table-cell to scale when the td text is pressed

158824
pdfbox	itext	pdfbox	itextsharp
if you re looking for something a little more diy there s the itextsharp library - a port of java s itext - and pdfbox yes it says java - but they have a .net version by way of ikvm.net

158824
pdfbox	itextsharp
here s some codeproject articles on using itextsharp and pdfbox from c#

158854
cvs	svn
cvs2svn does a lot of magic between cvs and svn

158941
rss	feed
i d like an rss feed that would supply the same or similar information -- or even a way to wring some text out of tfs that i can reconstitute into rss

158941
rss	feed
this is similar to the question sending svn commits to an rss feed but i do have control over the private tfs repository

158943
rss	feed
i know that services like my.yahoo.com allow you to add content from rss feed to your personal page but in general they are links which draw the user to the site which provided the feed

158943
rss	feed
what are the legalities and implications of using rss feed as a data source for a site which repackages the data so as to be unrecognizable that it came from said source

158959
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
i have to guess here since i could not find a public list of all ports available for openbsd but since there is a port for freebsd netbsd etc

158997
actionscript	mxml
that is rather than dealing with time and frames in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript

158997
actionscript	mxml
actionscript is used to program behaviors components and other things outside or what mxml does

159002
actionscript	mxml
so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around

159028

159034
min	max
and by extension is it safe to validate an input by checking that it is your max value and leave out your min value assuming you started at 0 and incremented by 1

159052
int	double
as long as you make sure not to do that and you are not building a laser that requires 30 significant digits of precision just pick your favorite flavor between int double or whatever float s your boat

159067
for-loop	loops
you might also check out this page on my site where i compare the speed of an incrementing for-loop a reverse do while loops and duff s device

159073
unsigned	short
in short you cannot rely on an enum being either signed or unsigned

159081
min	max
usually when i need this kind of information i include in the enum a max and min value something like this

159134
next	except
i was doing everything right except that when i replaced the radio button with the combo box there was still one element previous button which had the radio button group as its next element sort of like a tab stop

159194
temp	tmp
turns out that even with iis using impersonation and the tmp temp environment variables being set to c windows temp the asp.net process is still running under the aspnet account and each individual user needed permissions to the documents and settings aspnet local settings temp folder

159263
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
however if the distro is more than a few years old it may not exist and alternative mechanisms include browser older attempted standard gnome-open gnome kfmclient exec kde exo-open xfce or parsing mailcap yourself the text html handler will be likely be a browser

159312
children	parent
position each div as you like and then adjust the positioning of their children which most browsers will treat as position relative to my parent unless it s absolute iirc

159319
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript msi customactions suck

159319
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript msi custom actions don t have to suck

159368
int	chars
i ve seen this done with chars arrays to emphasize that one chars is reserved for a string terminator but never for an int array

159410
actionscript	mxml
in the end everything is compiled down to actionscript check the -keep compiler option but mxml just saves you so much time

159452
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can set this in httpd.conf or in an .htaccess if you have access to one using the php_flag notation

159454
width	height
you need to listen for width changes on the content composite mparent compute the minimum height again given the new content width and call setminheight on the scrolled composite with new height

159454
width	height
this is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the minimum height of the content as long as the width is the same

159489
ssl	https
a clientssl virtual server is typically configured to accept https connections from a client decrypt the ssl session and send the unencrypted http request to the web server

159489
ssl	https
the redirect will be returned to the client in http mode rather than https causing the ssl session to fail

159501
spaces	delimiter
also assuming that the line you gave above is partial as it has only 13ish fields by default fields are white spaces delimiter

159507
swt	swing	awt	swing
to design guis in java you can use swt awt or swing widget toolkits

159511
put	get
but to be on the safe side your unhandled exception filter might get inadvertently overwritten you could put your code inside #95

159555
expression-blend	silverlight
wpf silverlight expression-blend

159574
implements	modifiers
it s not as simple as implements var in a method since you also have to take into acccount different modifiers and attributes like so

159579
charindex	substr
raw t-sql is limited to charindex patindex replace and substr for string manipulation

159601
sorting	grouping
these functions include sorting paging grouping etc

159666
daemons	launchd
launchd the daemons

159678
int	chars
they are often surrogate keys as int create faster joins than chars fileds and especially than multiple field chars joins

159679
folder	directory
if you are running under vista then the system just redirects writes to the program files folder this is done so old program that keep their configuration in the program directory will continue to work when the user is not an admin or uac is enabled

159704
serializable	deserialization
so serializable works but when you try to pass these objects the other way as a parameter for a web service call the deserialization breaks because they can t be the input is treated as a list of string object dictionaries which can t be converted to a list of whatever custom class the collection contains

159749
children	parent
a better solution might be - assuming you need to expose all of the parent properties up the tree at the child level - to go ahead and implement direct properties on the children

159760
put	get
with this example if you have a name with more than three parts then all the extra stuff will get put in the last_name field

159795
client-side	server-side
jquery is for client-side stuff whilst server-side javascript exists its not a common use-case

159804
django	web2py
what does web2py do that you can t do with django in a few lines of code with a better performance code that s easier to read and on an established platform where tons of developers will jump in and fix problems in no time if they appear

159808
organization	naming
our strategy is to have systematic code reviews and to reject code that s not properly documented through comments proper function naming and organization etc...

159819
nginx	lighttpd
at least lighttpd has horrible fastcgi bugs i wouldn t wonder if nginx has some too

159926
cvs	svn
i know there s tools to migrate history and changes from cvs to svn and there s no equivalent to do the reverse

159960
curry	first-class
having a functional language is not only about what you can do such as higher-order functions first-class functions and curry

159971
cvs	svn
svn is better than cvs

159971
bazaar	git
if you want to change checkout mercurial git bazaar

159982
cvs	svn
if you really must do it it shouldn t be very hard to write a script that walks through the history of the svn repo getting each revision and committing it to cvs

159984
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works on firefox ie safari opera google-chrome

159999
cvs	svn
and since one of the main goals of svn was to be a better cvs those developers will probably not have expected anyone to move backwards either

160021
cvs	svn
the designers of svn went out of their way to make the svn experience fairly similar to cvs

160021
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
svn gives you atomic commits which while not quite up to the standard of perforce is miles in front of cvs

160021
cvs	svn
i upgraded our development team it team from cvs to svn

160021
versioning	upgrade
i got all the right python scripts to upgrade all the versioning history and we have been using svn happily for nearly 4 years

160037
cvs	svn
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

160067
cvs	svn
it s not rocket science to write a script that takes the list of commits from your svn repository and iterates through them one at a time merging them into a newly-created cvs repository

160162
collabnet	svn
i have installed svn 1.5.2 with binaries downloaded from collabnet here

160169
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

160169
getter	setter
i have never been able to write anything remotely complicated without getter and setter but it is a nice guideline

160169
getter	setter
if you have a lot of getter and setter it probably means you are doing it wrong

160260
solaris	bsd
my two reasons are i already know how to do this and i need my scripts to be portable across linux bsd solaris

160267
folder	directory
i ve tried all the tricks i can find on google and the obvious of removing the directory and folder manually

160284
sysv	systemd
python can t help you with that and though i ve seen occasional mention of third-party libraries that try to do this they usually only work on a few systemd like strictly sysv style strictly bsd style or just systemd with proc.

160306
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you can only call free 3 on pointers allocated on the heap with malloc 3 calloc 3 or realloc 3

160315
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to write a resolution selection dialog that pop-up when a program first starts up

160330
actionscript	mxml
putting actionscript in mxml is the same as putting css or javascript in html really bad

160353
windows	wow64
windows has wow64 windows on windows 64 bit and linux can have the 32 bit libraries available alongside the 64 bit

160404
daemons	systemd
our embedded systemd doesn t have syslog so the daemons i write do debugging to a file using the a open mode similar to how you ve described it

160404
disk	ram
it s pretty rough and maybe should be called log frontal truncations but it stops our small ram disk based filesystem from filling up with log file

160441
ssdp	upnp
i ve looked at both ssdp and upnp for this type of functionality but i d recommend going with a custom udp multicast solution

160441
ssdp	upnp
imho ssdp and upnp and bloated and overly complicated for resource discovery.

160449
hash	salt
btw i don t know enough cryptography to say whether it s safe enough to add secret salt + hash although seems fine

160520
post	get
it s all based on hits to pages and or get post parameters

160616
many-to-many	one-to-many
if so this identifies your relation as many-to-many rather one-to-many

160659
vim	emacs
most of the file-based tools that we have vim emacs eclipse vs.net unix tools will have to be abandoned in favor of smalltalk s own tools

160679
width	height
if you have a wide picture you want to set width to 100 and leave height

160679
width	height
if you have a long picture you want to set height to 100 and leave width

160690
mvp	presenter
i use mvp so it is split into handler and presenter

160717
width	height
here s a quick function that will adjust the height or width to 100 depending on which is bigger

160729
width	height
what you want to do is on page load walk through the dom and for every image or alterantively pass a function an image id if it s just a single image check if which attribute of the image is greater it s height or width

160729
width	height
once you got that then set the corresponding height width on the tag to 100 and the other to auto

160770
width	height
you need to calculate the ratio between the window width and height and the image width and height

160782
integer	unsigned
depends what language you re using but an ip address is usually stored as a 32-bit unsigned integer at least at the network layer making comparisons quite fast

160792
rss	feed
that has classes related to rss and atom feed

160852
profiling	instrumentation
you can instrumentation profiling and explore the behavior or code in both user space and kernel space

160876
ubuntu	linux
i have a from what i can tell perfectly working linux setup ubuntu 8.04 where all tools nslookup curl wget firefox etc are able to resolve addresses

160899
rss	feed
you could use the fetch page module trim it to just the items inside the news feed loop though each list item and use an item builder module to mangle the relevant bits as a proper rss feed

160913
width	height
it seems i can only adjust the height of the header cell but not the width

160942
division	modulo
this is faster than using division or modulo

161024
boost	stl
using good libraries like boost stl

161038
opensuse	linux
take a look at the opensuse build service it includes a fairly wide variety of linux distros not just suse opensuse

161077
disk	ram
in a rare situation and you could construct such an example enough space just happens to be available in part of the heap which is already in ram but allocating a new page for the stack has to wait for some other page to get written out to disk

161105
min	max
if you want the first with after the first without change the subquery to use min instead of max

161115
ubuntu	debian
quick start guide - slightly ubuntu debian specific

161120
jobs	cron
hudson monitors executions of repeated jobs such as building a software project or jobs run by cron

161121
put	get
once you get the 3 line segments converted into series of points you can put all points into a bucket and group all points by y

161127
mouse	keyboard
we can fudge it by deliberately swallowing mouse and keyboard events but am i missing some fundamental property like setting isenabled to false without affecting its visual style that gives us what we want

161132
cpu	processors
processors do 1b things a second one if a frame is irrelevant pretty much the only relevant cpu operations are n 2 where n 100 and blowing your l2 cache and of course busy waiting for disk access

161136
multiplying	add
what you have to do is choose two vectors sides of your triangle multiplying each with a random number in 0 1 and add them up

161149
onclick	onfocus
i can see that it would be good to have expansion contraction onclick in which case textmate - again mac - though css suport isn t as good as cssedit but onfocus

161159
solaris	aix
be aware that most of the options discussed in other answers are not standard on platforms that do not use the gnu utilities solaris aix hp-ux for instance

161182
firefox	safari
tested the font-size with absolute measurements in firefox safari and ie6 so it should be pretty portable

161182
width	font-size	letter-spacing	font-size
edit note that you may also need to play around with settings such as the letter-spacing property as well and experiment with what font you use since the font-size setting isn t really the width of the letters which will be different based on letter-spacing and font proportional to length

161202
cvs	svn
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

161216
cvs	svn
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

161216
cvs	svn
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

161222
ant	maven
i m considering switching back to a pure eclipse project with no ant and no maven involved

161279
verilog	vhdl
and if we look at the experience of people like the fpga designers we see that programming exclusively graphically just doesn t work - hence languages like verilog and vhdl

161292
cvs	svn
one aspect of git has not been discussed when it has been brought to your attention in all these other answers git provides a cvs server emulation so that you might migrate to git svn to git is easy and well supported and later use a cvs server interface for accessing the repository in a centralized manner

161358
persistent	transient
the important thing here is the difference between transient detached and persistent entities

161381
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind that you don t need to upgrade the .net versioning

161399
put	get
this works fine locally and on some developmentservers however when i put it live it stopped working because i don t get asp.foo_bar_aspx but _asp.foo_bar_aspx

161430
ant	maven
so i am wondering if maven 2 does the same thing if you are running ant task

161433
google-chrome	safari
i just tested with ff3 ff2 safari ie7 and google-chrome

161443
codeigniter	kohana
in kohana codeigniter i can have a url in this form

161445
equals	gethashcode
in addition to jon skeet s comment make your account struct a class and override the equals and gethashcode method to get nice equality checking

161455
instances	transient	persistent	transient
save persistent both work on transient instances ie instances which have no identifier assigned yet and as such are not saved in the db

161459
ant	maven
maven has the ability to run all your tests for you during the testing cycle of compilation this should stop the need for any ant tasks to run the tests

161459
jar	war
however if you still need to have scripts for other tasks generation of code etc then be weary of maven s ability to generate code and not include it in the compiled binaries jar war though this may well be fixed for newer versions of maven

161464
maven	pom.xml
this has two benefits a you keep track of how the build procedure changes between versions and b other developers don t need to manually find and install all the jar files that your project depends on they simple fetch the pom.xml file and maven takes care of the rest

161528
puts	gets
it gets x out of the condition clause scope of the while and puts it in a reference y which is available in the higher scope

161559
cvs	svn
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

161561
wtl	atl
for a real-world library use of crtp look at atl and wtl wtl.sf.net

161568
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
although i tested not thouroughly on windows as i no longer use this system i m quite confident that all the major vcs svn git mercurial bazaar have proper windows-implementation now

161572
bazaar	svn
if you re looking on getting out of svn you might want to evaluate bazaar for a bit

161591
button	checkbox
for example in the wizard you may have multiple controls button checkbox multiple line controls and they all have a different behavior on actions from the enter key

161675
subtract	add
rather than lots of tests i simply add the squares of all three then subtract the square of the smallest one

161717
width	height
if i create a function with jquery that adds an empty div performs some animation inside the blank space created by the div then removes the div the browser never makes room for the empty div height and width are set

161731
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried with google-chrome and firefox 3 and although the navigation is not as smooth as i like the problem seems fixed

161733
mouse	keyboard
they are as plug and play as a mouse keyboard or flash drive

161746
sorting	filtering
here is a table supporting sorting and filtering

161746
sorting	filtering
look at this example in the incubator which supports multi-column sorting and fixed header but unfortunately no filtering

161778
interbase	ingres	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql
sql mysql mssql 2000 mssql 7 ingres interbase 6 oracle sybase

161821
cvs	svn
if your team is already familiar with version and source control softwares like cvs or svn then for a simple and small project such as you claim it is i would recommend you stick to svn

161821
pull	push
i am really comfortable with svn but for the current e-commerce project i am doing on django i decided to work on git i am using git in svn-mode that is with a centralised repo that i push to and pull from in order to collaborate with at least one other developer

161860
gif	png
another way around this is to use 2 separate images e.g a gif and a transparent png and target your css accordingly

161947
margin	height
this will recursively add up the rendered height not just the styled height for each child element and any associated margin and padding and return an accurate figure for element height

161953
bazaar	git
i d recommend trying or reading the documentation of at least mercurial git and bazaar

161983
struts	stripes
i think you ll find that gwt complements something like stripes much more than it does struts

161983
struts	stripes
i don t want to start some kind of flame development platform war but in my opinion stripes is a far superior and easier to use framework than struts we migrated from struts a year ago and have never looked back

162011
nant	cruisecontrol
i am executing the nant build file with a task in cruisecontrol

162011
nant	cruisecontrol
so nant is running the tests not cruisecontrol

162047
int	chars
what i think you need is a strlen-ish function go ahead and write it int stringlength const chars s

162047
int	chars
then you need a function called int scanback const chars s const chars matches int start which starts at start goes down to z as long as the chars being scanned at s id contained in matches return the last index where a match is found

162047
int	chars
then you need a function called int scanfront const chars s const chars matches which starts at 0 and scans forward as long as the chars being scanned at s is contained in matches returning the last index where a match is found

162047
int	chars
then you need a function called int charinstring chars c const chars s which returns non-zero if c is contained in s 0 otherwise

162154
textarea	textbox
example if i am here typing in this textarea i would like to be able to get the text same way if i were in the subject textbox in my outlook

162159
range	max
for example i use the the keypress event to prevent letters in a text box set a max number of characters and that a number is with in a range

162182
pull	push
maybe it would be a good idea to look at pull media instead of push media for your application

162182
rss	feed
you could put the content of the mass mailings up on a website and notify interested readers with an rss feed for example

162182
rss	feed
you might as well provide an rss feed to those pages as an alternative for the users who do want to use it

162184
client-side	server-side
in short - always always validate server-side and then consider client-side validation as an added extra to enhance the end user experience

162290
struts	stripes	struts	wicket	wicket	stripes	jsf	stripes	jsf	wicket
investigate jsf wicket struts 2 stripes - whichever one you use depends on your specific needs as they all have different strengths

162309
pop-up	dialog
to pop-up the uac dialog in vista when writing to the hklm registry hive we opt to not use the win32 registry api as when vista permissions are lacking we d need to relaunch our entire application with administrator rights

162319
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket
for some of the java-only technologies investigate jsp servlets struts struts2 which is the updated version of webwork spring mvc tapestry web4j wicket

162358
mouse	keyboard
i use a single mouse and keyboard through synergy

162366
uninstall	upgrade
i have a situation in which it is undesirable to perform a complete uninstall reinstall of a web site but in which periodic bug fixes and minor upgrade are made

162412
mp3	wav
i d go with converting the audio to wav or mp3 on the server

162579
client-side	server-side
there are some validations that can t even be properly done in server-side application code and are utterly impossible in client-side code because they depend on the current state of the database

162606
sequence	permutation
this routine parameterized by an index into the set of all permutation would return the next number in the sequence

162664
struts	stripes
struts 2 and stripes are more modern and very similar to each other

162664
jsf	wicket
on java the popular component frameworks are jsf a standard and wicket

162667
iprincipal	iidentity
just substitute the correct types iprincipal iidentity if needed

162718
webkit	gecko
i m wondering how does one integrate a gecko or webkit one

162785
post	put
you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

162797
firefox	safari
it must work in ie6 ie7 firefox for windows macosx linux and safari

162799
opml	xml
it s xml so if you needed to store more data then the opml specification supplies you can always add your own namespace

162799
opml	rss
additionally importing and exporting from other rss readers is all done via opml

162864
rss	feed
the other caveat is that i m sure you re going to want the end user to be able to categorize their rss feed and be able to potentially search sort them and having that kind of datatable style will help with this

162874
jar	war
the problem is that my custom jar is being excluded from the war file

162900
width	height
you can t have one property like that but you could create two properties which both manipulated the same underlying field - just like height width size in windows forms

162904
public	protected
it processes an entire project or a specific file and shows various unused dead code methods as well as suggesting visibility changes a public method that could be protected or private

162907
mouse	keyboard
enter the keyboard mouse preference pane

162945
cvs	svn
you could very easy implement a local version of svn cvs and interface in it through your applications add new files remove old ones

162991
swt	swing
once created those widgets will be integrated with swt swing or qtjambi framework

162991
swt	swing
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

163029
pdfbox	itext
check out pdfbox or itext

163034
nexus	artifactory
i would suggest using a maven proxy like archiva artifactory or nexus and defining your repo list on the server side

163072
swt	swing
you can use an swt canvas or swing canvas or opengl canvas via jogl ... and set it up as an observer of your simulation and whenever the simulation state changes you can redraw the new state

163084
intersect	contains
relationships such as contains within or intersect are using the mbr not the exact geometry shape an ellipse is treated like a rectangle

163188
integer	fractions
the key here is in the third line of code the division operator performs an integer division so that result are missing the fractions part of the result

163188
division	subtract	division	multiplication
first do the division and the multiplication then subtract the result from the original number

163188
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code

163228
post	put
but the flex code has to use post but sets the http header x-method-override to delete you can do the same for put i presume

163232
short	base
especial since these comments relevancy is very short lived and they tend to build up littering the code base

163235
int	chars
it s so tightly coupled to a standard von neumann cpu architecture that no standard library or runtime is required to implement most of its features pointers chars strings automatic variables on the stack int arithmetic etc

163248
ienumerable	iqueryable
to understand this a bit better you really need to understand the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable and at which point a linq to sql query stops being iqueryable and becomes ienumerable

163302
folder	directory
the folder are within a wordpress directory

163321
coalesce	isnull
coalesce function same isnull function

163327
cvs	svn
also situations arise when there is a good reason to move code from one class to another or to rename files which would make it even harder to find the root of the reason behind a certain section of code renaming not so much of an issue with svn but a pain with cvs

163341
profiler	vtune
you can find out which one you are using a profiler that will measure both cpu and l2 misses like intel s vtune

163359
rss	feed
most rss feed are only written to deliver a relatively short period of time - all items in a feed generally need you to have created your own archive over time

163365
post	get
note i am submitting my own answer as part of the accepted way of sharing a tip but if anyone has a better solution feel free to post it here it may get more votes than my method

163395
google-chrome	firefox
i no longer have a windows pc available to me so i can only test on google-chrome firefox on ubuntu

163395
google-chrome	firefox
my results work 100 consistently on google-chrome and let s say somewhere around 70 - 80 on firefox but i don t imagine it would be incredibly difficult to find the inconsistencies

163395
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it s not perfect and it s most definitely a hack but i got it to work pretty well on winxp ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera

163395
opera	safari
when you don t set a font mozilla uses monospace by default ie uses courier new opera courier new with quotes safari lucida grand with single quotes

163395
opera	safari
when you do set the font to monospace mozilla and ie take what you give them safari comes out as -webkit-monospace and opera stays with courier new

163395
punctuation	words
punctuation counts as a part of the words

163417
inline-functions	inlining
any compiler worth its salt should be capable of inlining a small function as if it were a macro and an inline-functions will respect namespaces and other scopes as well as evaluating all the arguments once

163492
children	parent
think of it like a tree where the nodes with no children are final outcomes and every branch between a node and it s parent or children is a state each one keyed differently

163544
int	chars
- if we talk about simple data types such as int and chars there is little difference between an array and a pointer

163544
calloc	malloc
using malloc calloc or similar

163551
put	get
now when i try to refer to an image from the list directly before i get the name of the image put inside imagelocation

163620
strcpy	strncpy
so i changed strcpy to strncpy and it got rid of the garbage

163661
inherited	properties
then i learned about the linq to sql isdiscriminator properties and that linq to sql only supports single table inherited

163707
cvs	svn
in cvs i would just go to the attic to find it how do i find a file in svn without having to go back to a revision where it existed especially annoying since i have no idea really when i deleted -- one week ago two weeks ago...

163722
yourkit	jprofiler
as of writing this question 2008-10-02 jprofiler was at 5.1.4 and yourkit was 7.5

163727
jar	war
i use the maven-buildnumber-plugin to generate my version number for jar war ear packages

163730
hash	md5
you could write a script that checks the crc or md5 hash of each file from the source and target folders and only perform the overwrite if the file has changed

163754
ubuntu	debian
it is included in the standard emacs distribution and in emacs21-common or emacs22-common on ubuntu and debian at least

163850
width	height
you may also want to debug the x y width height values of each of your components to make sure they re what you expect - something i find helpful with doing layout is to draw the layout on paper and start writing sizes and coordinates so that i can see that my calculations are right

164002
fseek	fread
i use fseek to determine the length of the file and then use fread to read in the file

164004
perforce	svn
i would say svn on price free perforce on ease of integration

164023
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

164073
innodb	myisam
i know with myisam tables you can get the table def update time but thats not so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of when the definition might have been modified..

164124
rss	feed
i m working on an rss feed for a custom tasking system we use and i m still wrapping my head around how things should work

164126
for-loop	loops
syntax to cover assignment operation if then else for-loop while loops select input output

164182
integer	unsigned
i use unsigned long int for my timer counters 32-bit since that is the native sized integer on my hardware platform and that gives me elapsed times from 1 ms to about 49.7 days

164224
put	get
and i put 7 rows with score 23 to get a large number of decimal places and then changed one row with score 43 to generate a second number with a large number of decimal places

164242
int	chars
to serialise to a chars array invest a byte at the beginning to indicate the size of int and the byte order - you will need this later

164297
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade the code to the recent versioning of powerbuilder but there are some intermediate versioning of powerbuilder that have binary dependencies to an old microsoft java dll that microsoft no longer can distribute due to some court case

164329
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
group by lets you use aggregate-functions like avg max min sum and count

164368
profiler	yourkit
i ve used yourkit and it is a very nice profiler the best i ve ever used in java i ve used a variety of others over the years

164378
getter	setter
basically i need to take a .class file or a collection of them parse the bytecode to determine all of the data members and perhaps getter setter and then write something that can output code in a different language to create a class with the same structure

164407
yourkit	jprofiler
intellij seems to switch their recommendation back and forth between yourkit and jprofiler so i would guess their feature sets are similar

164416
public	protected
you can add public members are run time with no additional code and can affect protected private members using the magical overloading methods __get __set

164417
csc	vbc
you can actually go into the microsoft.csharp.targets or microsoft.visualbasic.targets file located in the framework directory usually c windows microsoft.net framework v3.5 and modify the csc or vbc task parameters to include additional reference dependencies

164437
yourkit	jprofiler
i ve used both jprofiler 4 and yourkit 7.5 and yourkit wins hands down

164437
yourkit	jprofiler
it s so much less invasive than jprofile in that i ll happy run production servers with the yourkit agent installed which i would never do with jprofiler

164500
int	double
use const when you have a variable of a type you can know at runtime string literal int double enums ... that you want all instances or consumers of a class to have access to where the value should not change

164503
move	drag
if you want to move past the error to see what would have happened had the error not occurred you can drag the yellow-highlighted line the line that will execute next down to the next line of code after the offending one

164542
opera	safari
if you are using firebug and need to support ie safari or opera as well firebug lite adds console.log support to these browsers

164548
avr	microcontroller
today avr and pic are probably the most common microcontroller among hobbyists

164553
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

164566
bash	zsh
i could see these being potential enhancements to the extension but for now i can work around them with a bash zsh shell function in my starup file

164595
rss	feed
of course if you re writing both the producer and consumer of the rss and your goal is that the feed always contains the full set of assigned tasks just updating the pubdate will work just fine

164597
chown	sudo
i recursively set permissions on the server directory to richard developers using sudo chown -r richard developers server

164672
int	double
they have strictly defined lengths for byte short int long and single double precision floats equal on every system

164691
getter	setter
the endless getter and setter that java requires aren t as often used in python

164691
getattr	setattr
python introspection is more flexible you have access to an object s internal dictionary of attribute values and you have first class functions like getattr and setattr

164691
getter	setter
further you have the property function which is often used to bind getter and setter to a single name that behaves like a simple attribute but is actually well-defined method function calls

164748
post	get
if i get a request or two i ll post it and then come back and edit this response to point others to the source as well

164752
hide	show
the two functional states of show and hide along with the meta data of publish draft and archive are intermixed in the same column of status

164798
centos	linux	centos	solaris
sun studio includes a full ide plus a very high performance compiler and is available for red hat or centos and suse linux platforms as well as solaris

164819
hide	show
at the point that you decide your business logic needs additional data to make the decision whether to show or hide an article perhaps an isapproved flag then you can store that data

164830
minimum	max	min	max
average minimum and maximum can be calculated with the avg min and max functions

164854
put	get
in my experience you need to put your link inside a onrelease handler or mouseevent.click in as3 for it to not get blocked

165019
int	chars
i would work hard to not use chars or varchar as a pk but use an int with an auto_increment instead

165022
versioning	upgrade
the reason is your core framework assemblies in .net 2 are upgrade and have new versioning numbers which the app wasn t compiled against

165093
simulink	labview
labview and simulink are two graphical programming environments

165110
client-side	server-side
client-side javascript or server-side insert language of choice is the way to go

165121
int	chars
i would work hard to not use chars or varchar as a pk but use an int with an auto_increment instead.

165167
ubuntu	linux
if you can t get away from windows use vmware and run some form of linux ubuntu is popular

165172
int	boolean	int	double
normal value types boolean int longs float double enum and structs are not nullable

165174
kate	kde
i really enjoy kate part of kde

165209
swt	swing
i get the impression swing swt seem to more like winforms

165238
octal	decimal	octal	hex
o u x x are for unsigned integral types as octal decimal hex and hex

165291
hide	show
and hide show it using the steps above

165310
firefox	safari
that actually sounds like a bug in the browser -- you could file at if it s in safari or for firefox

165575
getter	setter
another example which may be more meaningful is that i need to call some method when a setter or getter is used

165581
getter	setter
if you add your own getter setter logic the compiler will use your code instead of its auto-generated code but as far as the users of that property are concerned nothing has changed

165588
getter	setter
when using automatic properties you don t get direct access to the underlying backing variable and you don t get access to the actual logic that gets implemented in the property getter and setter

165588
getter	setter
you would then implement the appropriate logic in the getter setter

165592
getter	setter
and later on if you want to implement getter and setter for the property only then you create a explicit private member for it and add the logic

165641
cpu	affinity
if you could call a function that returns a number indicating what cpu the thread is running on without using affinity the answer would often be wrong as soon as the function returned

165700
apache	nginx
until the release of phusion passenger aka mod_rails the standard for deployment was not fastcgi but using a cluster of mongrel servers fronted by apache and mod_proxy or nginx etc

165720
post	put
unfortunately that same browser won t allow me to test http put delete and to a certain degree even http post

165748
hide	show
which will show mybox hide the specified children and then blink the box

165779
post	put
unfortunately that same browser won t allow me to test http put delete and to a certain degree even http post

165779
post	get
i ve also heard that browsers support only get and post from some other sources like

165786
bazaar	trac
i m also dubious of the benefits of including wikis and bug trackers directly in the vcs -- either they re under-featured compared to full software like trac or the vcs is massively bloated compared to subversion or bazaar

165817
vim	emacs
question and i m not interested in text editors no matter how awesome they may be and i don t consider either vim or emacs to be an ide so.

165846
nexus	artifactory
some of the other questions and answers here on so extol the virtues of using an enterprise repository tool like archiva artifactory or nexus

165853
folder	directory
the source code directory is unfortunately hard coded into the pdb s however if you know the folder required you can use windows concept of symbolic links junctions

165886
rss	feed
all of the tags based on keywords have rss feed attached to them so i d start by subscribing to relevant keywords and searching the data

165896
accessor	properties
python does not need to define accessor right from the beginning since converting attributes into properties is quick and painless

165901
getter	setter
some people use getter and setter

165911
getter	setter
if you do find yourself needing to be able to write getter and setter then what you want to look for is python class properties and ryan tomayko s article on

165911
getter	setter
getter setter fuxors is a great place to start albeit a little long

165925
getter	setter
there is no real point of doing getter setter in python you can t protect stuff anyway and if you need to execute some extra code when getting setting the property look at the property builtin python -c help property

165943
put	get
also if you put a date t and time t in the beginning and in the end of that batch file you will get the times it was at that point and you can map your script running time and order

165951
stdout	stderr
i was kind of sure that there was an easy way to do this - a generic service wrapper that can be configured with a log file for stdout and stderr

165958
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
it combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

165958
serializable	deserialization
it can work over tcp sockets and the serializable deserialization is already built-in

165972
stdout	stderr
when you got that running you can use the process class to start the application and configure it so that you can handle stdout stderr yourself processstartinfo is your friend

166048
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
however java knows only a few primitive types among them int double boolean and chars along with enums which behave in this manner

166127
pop-up	dialog
i tried the example above with ctrl+s but firefox s save dialog still pop-up

166130
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this is a trivial case for nrvo â names return-value-optimization a misnomer in this case since there s no name

166138
vb.net	vb6
the app is currently written in vb6 and while its going to go to vb.net c# in the future i need to find a way to pick up vb6 now

166140
filesystems	fat
i ve learned a lot by looking at a specific subject like the fat driver implementation and filesystems abstraction

166158
opera	safari
according to wikipedia xmlhttprequest first appeared in internet explorer 5 as an activex object but has since been made into a standard and has been included for use in javascript in the mozilla family since 1.0 apple safari 1.2 opera 8.0 and ie 7.0

166158
put	get	post	put	post	get
the open method on the object takes the http method as an argument - and is specified as taking any valid http method see the item number 5 of the link - including get post head put and delete as specified by rfc 2616

166158
put	get	post	put	post	get
as a side note ie 7â 8 only permit the following http methods get post head put delete move propfind proppatch mkcol copy lock unlock and options

166190
put	get
using datatable.clear will fail if there are any constraints applied that would be violated but using datatable.reset will get rid of anything and everything that has been put in place since the datatable was created

166194
min	max
folk should be aware that the set function max min count etc can be omitted so that they can understand the coder s intent when it is

166196
des	aes
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

166218
public	protected
in progamming there s something to be said for case sensitivity for instance having a public property foo and a corresponding private protected field foo

166245
disk	ram
if this is something you re going to be fetching on a regular basis it might be worthwhile to prefetch the data from disk or the database doesn t matter and have your script pull it from a ram cache like memcached

166267
post	get
or the excellent jquery form plugin that post your files through an iframe to get the effect

166299
google-chrome	firefox
occurs on ie7 8 firefox google-chrome

166307
solaris	sunos
look at the three different numbering schemes for sunos solaris or the two numbering schemes for java

166309
vsto	add-in
i am currently building an excel 2007 add-in using vsto latest version + sp1 and .net 3.5

166336
lisp	scheme
apart from the multiple- single-namespace issue and guaranteed tail-call elimination which some cl implementations support as well depending on the compiler settings there isn t much that makes scheme as a language more suited to functional programming than common lisp and still most lispers wouldn t call cl a functional language

166336
haskell	scheme
likewise scheme is very much an imperative language as compared to haskell

166337
public	protected
public surface visible from an external assembly public protected and internal protected

166360
int	double
and here i noticed that just int matrix is not good if i occasionally want to use it with decimal or double

166360
multiplying	add
so just after considering it would be a matrix class now i faced that generic t could not be used i need it to support some interface which could add and multiplying

166485
instances	transient
alternatively another approach is to have a decorator for your service registered in the container with a singleton lifestyle but your actual underlying service registered in the container with a transient lifestyle - then when you need to refresh the component just dispose of the transient underlying component held by the decorator and replace it with a freshly resolved instances resolve it using the components key rather then the service to avoid getting the decorator - this avoids issues with other singleton services which aren t being refreshed from holding onto stale services which have been disposed of making them unusable but does require a bit of casting etc

166501
post	get
html forms up to html version 4 and xhtml 1 only support get and post as http request methods

166501
firefox	safari	put	get	post	put	post	get	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
however get post put and delete are supported by the implementations of xmlhttprequest ajax calls in all the major web browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome opera

166512
ubuntu	linux
actually there is also a linux version of wtk from sun and i am using it every day on ubuntu

166534
ceil	floor
you may wish to use ceil or round instead of floor

166536
for-loop	arrays
clarification if you are doing a readall followed by a string.split r to get an arrays of all the lines in the file and the using a for-loop to process each line that s code which will generally result in worse performance than reading the file line by line and performing your process on each line

166572
glulookat	glrotate
going this way you ll find that glrotate gltranslate glulookat and friends are quite useless

166572
children	parent
scene nodes might need to be organized in a hierarchy this one can be easy - just add parent children pointers to the node

166608
entity-relationship	diagram
personally i always liked dia it s ubiquitous portable easy to use and supports a whole bunch of other diagram other than just entity-relationship uml so i can use it to make diagram for non-techies

166673
inline	inlining
the size method from std vector should be inline by the compiler meaning that every call to size is replaced by its actual body see the question why should i ever use inline code for more information about inlining

166693
dia	visio
then you can translate it into visio or dia or a uml tool that generates both the sql schema and your object model.

166754
ubuntu	linux
if you are a linux beginner i would start with ubuntu linux server

166754
gentoo	linux
i installed mono on a gentoo server a couple of weeks ago just to find out that it can t run precompiled asp.net sites you be warned linux ain t made for .net

166760
ubuntu	linux
but also works great on ubuntu and ubuntu seems to appeal more to linux newcomers

166805
dedicated	server-communication
with no control over the distance between both servers they might be in two different datacenters and no dedicated inter-server-communication line i d rather run them via round-robin dns or a loadbalancer that redirects clients to either www1.yourdomain.xxx or www2.yourdomain.xxx and handle server-communication carefully

166842
post	put
for put and post we ll usually have files containing the representations to send alongside the curl script

166843
vb.net	vb6
this is a vb6 access app that i inherited and am currently re-writing in vb.net and sql server

166860
int	chars
a comparing two 4-byte chars fields will take exactly as long as comparing two 4-byte int fields

166918
profiling	debugging
it can also interface with the zend platform if you have that for online profiling and debugging

166985
inline	inlining
inlining is about as hidden as these things get and 3rd party containers may have virtual function tables - which means you may not get inline

167002
perforce	svn
i used to work with subversion and a system tray tool svn notifier to monitor the repository so i would immediately see when my local copy was not up-to-date anymore and i am wondering if some equivalent was available for perforce on windows

167004
mockups	balsamiq
i am attempting to set up an nmake makefile to export our balsamiq mockups files to png files automatically but i m afraid i can t make heads nor tails of how to make a generic rule for doing so without explicitly listing all the files i want exported

167018
cpu	processors
i like that it tends to use my cpu to its fullest 2 cores and would theoretically scale to any number of processors available

167042
nunit	mstest
i tend to use it with team coverage which lets me see the coverage directly in the editor even though the tests are nunit not mstest based

167043
firefox	safari
this will allow entry to be right-justified and at least in firefox 3 ie 7 and safari will even appear to flow from the right

167050
children	parent
instead of insert 1000 rows into a parent table then inserting 5000 rows into a child table you now have to insert the parent rows one at a time in a cursor or some other loop just to get the generated ids so that you can assign them to the related children

167189
printf	strcpy
so thing like strcpy printf etc

167205
post	get
be sure to sanitize your get post input in this case so as to not allow attackers to run arbitrary commands on your machine

167222
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you have a one-to-many or a many-to-one relationship you will not

167278
bash	tcsh
slightly longer answer the usual shells sh ksh csh tcsh bash do not have any hooks for you to hang actions on ok so bash2 has context sensitive tab-completion

167284
profiling	debugging
just put the dependency for the release profiling inside the profiling declaration itself and do the same for debugging

167341
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out

167413
cvs	svn
we are migrationg from cvs to svn and embracing some kind of revision management in order to enforce order to development testing release cycle

167423
pull	push
databases are typically pull sources and not push so you ll still need to programmatically probe for changes no matter what

167426
post	get
when i post from chrome or ie the data i get in python is empty

167434
boost	stl
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost

167435
cpu	processors
as kaboing mentioned maxdop n actually controls the number of cpu cores that are being used in the query processors

167475
filesystems	fat
you still have the rename call on windows though i imagine the guarantees you want cannot be made without knowing the filesystems you re using - no guarantees if you re using fat for instance

167490
boost	allocator
even if you can get a current version of boost to work according to your requirements with custom allocator it may break with a new version of boost

167539
subtract	add
value is the integere value you want to add or subtract if you provide a negative number

167539
getdate	dateadd
select dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167628
trac	bugzilla
for both the wiki and bugzilla we would need to either migrate the existing data into trac or a way to integrate with trac

167681
trac	bugzilla
for bugzilla trac has a script bugzilla2trac.py that will automate the process of importing bugzilla bugs to trac tickets for you

167697
post	get
i ll continue to research this and post here if i find something but i m hoping to get some other good ideas

167729
put	get
if i put in the mapped by i get unknown column s_s_id in field list

167730
toolbar	docking
i have no good reason other then imoho are difficult to get to do what you want - if what you want if something other than a docking toolbar

167791
mouse	keyboard
as a programmer i found it very hard to use my laptop and workstation with two different input devices can anyone suggest a good solution to use single mouse and keyboard to control my two machines

167793
mouse	keyboard
synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between

167793
mouse	keyboard
redirecting the mouse and keyboard is

167811
mouse	keyboard
synergy is great but also give something like vnc a try it consolidates not only the keyboard and mouse but also the screen

167813
mouse	keyboard
what you want is a small gadget called a kvm switch keyboard video and mouse switch

167841
post	get
you could try using the post redirect get pattern

167841
post	get
that way if a user refreshes s he is refreshing the get command rather than the post

167878
rss	feed
all you have to do is type the url of the rss feed with the georss data within into the box on google maps

167878
rss	feed
search for merge feed or merge rss on there and you can find many examples that you can copy and modify

167909
kinematics	particle
i m interested in command-line applications even those that i can just execute and have spit out an answer without needing inputs for things like kinematics planar motion newton s laws gravitation work energy momentum and impulse systems of particle rotational kinematics and dynamics angular momentum static equilibrium oscillatory motion wave motion sound physical optics electrostatics gauss law electric field and potential capacitance resistance dc circuits magnetic field ampere s law and inductance

167922
put	get
usb interfaces will also get put to sleep randomly

167922
mouse	keyboard
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

167922
mouse	keyboard
these have two dvi inputs and i used one of my older belkin ps 2 switches to switch the keyboard and mouse

167922
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse are switched off the kvm switch

168023
hide	show
quick experiment with visual studio 2005 show that you can enclose those headers in your own named namespace and then use what you need from this namespace but don t use the whole namespace as it will introduces the namespace you want to hide

168056
bcel	cglib
many libraries use cglib bcel javasist or janino to generate bytecode for new classes at runtime and then load them from controlled classloader

168056
profiler	yourkit
you can catch these with a decent profiler i use yourkit - search for multiple classloader instances with the same retained size

168060
range	max	range	min	min	max
7.2 6 for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values of the underlying type in the range b min to b max where b min and b max are respectively the smallest and largest values of the smallest bitfield that can store e min and e max

168060
min	max
defines an enumerated type where e min is 1 and e max is 4

168129
scheme	racket
update plt scheme is now called racket

168221
accessor	properties
if you expose it as a properties from the very beginning you can make whatever changes to the properties accessor functions that you need and the class s interface remains unchanged

168283
vim	emacs
i know that some people swear against using a language-specific ide ever vim emacs or die

168366
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have a form that submits just fine in firefox safari google-chrome - but does absolutely nothing in ie or opera

168366
onclick	onsubmit
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing

168366
submit	submission
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working

168366
opera	firefox
so ie and opera were ignoring the nested form correctly i assume but firefox et al were being more forgiving and allowing the form to submit

168371
vim	notepad++
i use notepad++ or vim for anything in the lamp stack - i ve never found anything particularly useful in the ides for those technologies unless you could the mysql client tools as an ide which i use when i am able to

168413
gtk	motif
you still have to use a windowing framework specific to the os you run on mfc win32 motif gtk qt etc.

168431
mouse	keyboard
but if you keep in mind that you probably had a reason for wanting to go to the definition the ctrl -click workflow saves you an instance of moving between the keyboard and mouse

168441
switching	screens
it takes 20 seconds to start up you have to wait a second or so for it to switching between screens

168463
boost	stl
what about the stl or boost data structures specifically pointer containter doesn t work for you

168477
range	max	range	min	min	max
max and min inclusive exclusive limit the range of the numbers

168485
notepad++	scite
php perl javascript bash or most other languages notepad++ on windows scite on linux

168524
int	double
you cannot add a new interface for int or double

168524
multiplying	add
but you can declare an interface for an object that can multiplying and add values of some generic type

168525
accessor	properties
to retain a high degree of extensibility without the pain of re-compiling all your assemblies you want to use public properties as accessor

168525
getter	setter
this contract is enforced with an interface and fulfilled by the getter and setter of your class that inherits this interface

168525
getter	setter
later on should you create additional classes from that interface you have flexibility of adhering to the contract with the use of the properties but since you are providing the data via the getter and setter the implementation or process of assembling data can anything you want as along as it returns the type that the contract expects

168531
backtracking	greedy
now + is greedy which forces backtracking but the negated char class require a char-by-char comparison

168539
vb6	vba
vba which is really a dialect of vb6 is slow for these kind of applications

168539
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
this has an example of how to do what you want zipping using windows built-in zip capabilities from vb.net it shouldn t be much different from vba or vb6

168542
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
one thing i would like to see is the ability to create named types with simple declarations which would generate the properties and constructor in the same way as for anonymous types as well as overriding equals gethashcode tostring in the same useful way

168649
kde	gnome
on linux you have several choices gtk-based gnome company qt-based kde company if you re a sucker for punishment you can go for pure x and then you are more-or-less in for an interesting time both gnome and kde have ide s you can use

168676
swt	swing
update arguabley it shouldn t matter much but i m using swt not swing

168720
mbunit	mstest
our team is looking to switch from using mbunit to mstest but there appears to be some disconnect between the two

168783
rss	feed
it contains source code for aspx file that generates an rss feed of tfs checkins which returns information about the most recent n checkins

168845
getter	setter
btw change all getter and setter methods into properties...no need to have the c# library function just the same as the java library unless you are going for perfect interface compatibility

168860
post	get
do a cross page post - from your first page post back to the second page and get the details from httpcontext.current.request.form collection

168878
put	get
if you get a string from the client you should look it up in the business layer using the service layer and put the id of the found object in the vo

168886
post	put
update never fails you try to put all the information in the post and you forget something important

168896
des	aes
if you have an encryption key you could also consider running the text through des or aes or similar

168914
treemap	treeset	arraylist	treeset
that s why java has treemap in addition to treeset treelist arraylist and linkedlist implementations of a list.

168914
arraylist	treeset
however for some reason the java implementation of treeset is quite a bit slower than using an arraylist and a sort

169007
width	height
the select shows a 2px border 0 padding and a width of 996px and height of 18px

169007
width	height
the input shows a 2px border 1px 0 padding and a width of 1000px and height of 16px

169044
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
my development environment is running in jdk1.6 and i need to compile some classes so they are compatible with a client running jdk1.5

169054
margin	height
if you need to create line height you can add a bottom margin

169059
min	max
i first created a simple solution one that tracks the min max for the previous n entries using a circular buffer and a test harness to measure the speed

169059
min	max
in the simple solution each data value is compared against the set of min max values so that s about window_size count tests where window size in the original question is 1000 and count is 3600000

169059
queue	fifo
first off i created a solution that used a fifo queue to store window_size values and a linked list to store the values in ascending order where each node in the linked list was also a node in the queue

169059
queue	fifo
to process a data value the item at the end of the fifo was removed from the linked list and the queue

169059
min	max
the min and max values could then be read from the start and end of the linked list

169083
width	height
instead of testing the width see if the height of the element is more than one line measured in ems since you ll be changing the font size around

169113
free	malloc
to obtain this sort of information we override new delete and malloc free providing our own heap implementations that store stacktraces on allocation and produce a report when the heap is destroyed as well as adding sentinels to detect buffer overruns

169131
min	max
making daily scrums too large of a process -- not sticking to a certain time limit we prefer 15 min max

169170
udp	tcp
the scenario is for both udp and tcp

169208
agile	sprint
being able to track the work that s done every day and make decisions on how to modify by cutting or rebalancing work the rest of the sprint is quite useful on it s own and sound agile to me

169208
agile	sprint
of course if you don t have the other components of the agile process you will have harder time to measure the success of your work so you might think you are on track with the sprint but in fact be nowhere near the point you should be at to deliver quality product on schedule

169234
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems

169288
getter	setter
for example value objects that have getter setter constructors and supporting fields

169329
jar	war
all modules need to be separate unit of deployments ideally a war or jar file

169351
maven	pom.xml
you specify your dependencies in the maven pom.xml project object model - its basically an xml description of your project and maven automatically downloads compiles against them and packages them with your app

169353
hide	show
probably somewhere in your render method you show or hide dropdown control based on the property value

169366
imperative	declarative
rather than directly placing graphic elements using imperative semantics you define a grammar that declarative defines the relationship of graphic elements

169397
ant	maven
i converted from ant to maven 2 and have not looked back since

169397
ant	maven
ant and maven 2 different ways of building.with ant you are giving instructions on how to build things

169397
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
if you have an existing ant build xml you can take a first step in refactoring you build by wrapping that in an maven 2 pom.xml

169401
nhibernate	llblgenpro
you are writing sql instead of using a mapping technology nhibernate linq to sql ef subsonic llblgenpro etc.

169405
ant	maven
ant and maven are definitely the two standards

169405
ant	maven
if you re already familiar with ant and want the dependency management that comes with maven you might take a look at ivy

169405
ant	maven
one thing both ant and maven lack is true control structures in your build scripts

169420
getter	setter
or by putting matching code in the setter getter and use a custom list implementation

169472
getter	setter
plus when using eclipse you can have it automatically generate your getter setter this way

169495
postgresql	mysql
long answer to my knowledge unlike postgresql mysql ms-sql there is no native driver to connect php to sql server compact edition

169536
temp	tmp
ways to keep the space build up from happening too fast is change the location of your my documents folder change environment variables for items such as temp and tmp

169556
hide	show
so add all your items the first time around and then later on you just hide the ones no longer needed and show the ones that are

169582
ant	maven
you don t have to move from ant to maven just for the dependency goodies

169590
mousedown	mouseenter
the mousedown and mouseenter event handlers do not work together very well

169590
mousedown	mouseenter
for instance once a mouse button is clicked and held down c# will fire the mousedown event handler but when the cursor moves over the picturebox the mouseenter event does not fire until the mouse button is realeased

169604
mouseleave	mousedown
use the mousedown event to just detect a down press of a mouse button and set this.capture to true so that you then get other mouse events even when the mouseleave the control you won t get a mouseleave event because you captured the mouse

169605
firefox	safari
wasn t there a qa test website service which would let you specify a web page that you wanted to be rendered in a certain browser ie firefox safari version x y z and they would mail the snapshot back to you

169646
memset	calloc
be sure to initialize pathdeppcopy using memset of calloc

169661
jboss	weblogic
the big gun java ee web servers jboss websphere weblogic etc and windows server iis asp.net are truly in a different league in scalability and performance than your typical lamp stack

169690
jobs	cron
for an excellent description including how to handle non-dotfile configuration like cron jobs via the svnfix script on multiple machines

169716
width	height
top left height and width can differ between

169755
boost	allocator
there are parts of boost that have no allocator and you might find them useful

169758
getter	setter
there are some decent implementations for binding at the field level stuff like getter and setter see jgoodies binding and jsr 295 for examples

169783
clang	llvm
use the llvm clang static analyzer

169825
wxpython	pyglet
it should play well with wxpython or at least i seem to recall posts to the mailing list about wxpython and pyglet being used together

169919
serializable	deserialization
i bet more mature libraries such as whatever google uses include that kind of serializable and deserialization baked in

169920
antivirus	mcafee
after examining the version information in the file i figured out it was part of the mcafee antivirus suite installed on the computer

169994
ienumerable	icollection
on the api level usage both of them are pretty much the same since both implement same set of interfaces such as icollection ienumerable etc

170008
put	get
here s an example of how you can get that information using python and here s an example of it being put to use as a django form field which allows you to easily validate an image s existence filesize dimensions and format given its url

170019
memcached	apc
as an easy first version of the code i am simply using php session s to store the state information instead of something more advanced apc memcached db

170033
plural	inflection
i m looking for a good inflection or well a library that can turn plural into singular and vice verse - which a kind of inflection library for php it could be a part of some current framework or a stand alone library the only requirement i have is that it s compatible with the mit license

170036
profiler	shark
preferably something akin to shark on macos although i am willing to accept that i am going to have to pay for such a profiler on windows

170054
sorting	filtering
just look at the sorting filtering functionality in the new swing jtable

170060
ant	maven
after getting sick of looking at completely useless and unhelpful errors when attempting to do the simplest things like ftp a war file to a server maven was thrown away and ant dusted off

170121
profiling	instrumentation
it uses sampled profiling has some useful ui does not require instrumentation

170134
awt	swing
swing awt components generally have to have a layout before you add things to them - otherwise the ui won t know where to place the subcomponents

170134
width	height
a bit like those html tables we used to see with bizarre combinations of rowspan colspan width and height attributes - which never seemed to look quite how you wanted them

170158
gmail	hotmail
some sites take this a step further and don t allow addresses from domains such as yahoo gmail hotmail etc .

170177
profiling	instrumentation
it was an instrumenting profiling then and it took so long to instrumentation the dll that i was attempting to profiling that i eventually lost patience after an hour

170192
put	get
what do i need to put in a build.xml file to get ant to build it and make a war file

170327
vcproj	csproj
not all of the information is contained in the build file itself as some sub-projects are referenced by their vcproj or csproj files

170354
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are working perfectly well

170355
mouse	keyboard
including mouse clicks selecting copying navigating with the keyboard changing worksheets .

170355
keyup	mouseup
i had kind of hoped there would be keyup and mouseup events these two would probably have been enough

170415
firefox	safari
i am interested in browsers ie 7 firefox 3 safari 3

170419
put	get
so you get a requirement change request bugfix etc you put it in there

170419
put	get
you get used to this very quickly and it isn t that onerous - you ll need to say i changed this config value and you need to put this file in this directory or add this config file to the system

170478
opera	safari
i tested this in opera 9.5 ie7 ff3 and safari and it works in all of them

170521
urllib	httplib
the idea behind python 3 is to clean up the language syntax itself - remove ambigious stuff like except exception1 exception2 cleanup the standard modules no urllib urllib2 httplib etc

170624
width	height
i have tried to modify the dom adding attributes height width on the fly but seems did not work on ie6

170632
width	height
instead of modifying the height and width attributes of the image try modifying the css height and width

170632
width	height
one common gotcha is that the height and width styles are strings that include a unit like px in the example above

170632
width	height
edit - i think that setting the height and width directly instead of using style.height and style.width should work

170636
width	height
to modify an image proportionally simply only alter one of the width height css properties leave the other set to auto

170651
mouse	keyboard
to be more robust you could then add timing data from keyboard and mouse usage hard disk response times motherboard sensor data eg temperature etc

170688
postgresql	informix
perhaps the biggest reason that oodb have not taken hold dramatically is because of the success of the hybrid object-relational systems that take most of the potential marketshare from oodb postgresql and informix

170709
tinyxml	xerces
tinyxml can be best for simple xml work but if you need more features then try xerces from the apache project

170720
innodb	myisam
tested both myisam and innodb

170734
merb	ruby-on-rails
what was downside for you when you switched to merb from ruby-on-rails

170757
cvs	svn
i ran my own svn server for 2+ years and cvs 2+ years before that

170764
memcached	apc
apc memcached db etc

170816
merb	ruby-on-rails
the biggest downside was figuring out what s different between merb and ruby-on-rails

170816
merb	ruby-on-rails
the biggest upside is that when i ask for help on the merb irc or mailing lists i get help not insulted -- unlike ruby-on-rails

170948
lisp	scheme
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

170950
rss	feed
let s say i have a database and an rss feed

170950
rss	feed
i have to find out what is the new data from an rss feed that isn t already in the database

170954
rss	feed
pull from a unique field of a particular item in the rss feed

170957
rss	feed
most rss feed will have a date with each story - so make a query to pull the latest story s date from the database pull all of the latest stories from the rss feed and compare dates

170974
rss	feed
this approach will handle most cases though as with everything related to rss it breaks down if the feed provider isn t behaving properly

171013
edifact	x12
even huge standards like ansi x12 and edifact were problematic because even when two partners exchanged documents using an agreed standard there were usually enough differences in the way the documents were utilized that it required custom coding to process them

171028
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

171033
gtk	motif
wxwidgets lets developers create applications for win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince and more using one codebase

171099
post	get
as these are post requests they should complete quickly - there s no data to be retrieved and returned as with a get request

171121
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve been writing php web applications for some time and have come across very nice javascript frameworks such as jquery extjs scriptaculous etc

171157
prepare	execute
but we have also copied features such as prepare execute from pear db

171185
put	get	post	put	post	get
by this i mean you would have to rewrite all urls not only in http headers but in your html content as well do a regex search replace on the html and decode rewrite and resend all get post put data too

171198
maven	pom.xml
i personaly use maven 2 and here is a pom.xml i would use that do just that

171230
rss	feed
i need to get access to the itunes tags in an rss feed using php

171309
division	subtract
i don t know if it s faster but if you want to use a bitwise operator to perform binary division you can use the shift and subtract method described at this page

171321
client-side	server-side
sajax is one of a number of libraries that provide an easy way to link callbacks from client-side js to server-side php

171336
hash	hmac	hash	salt
you should have a keyed hash hmac together with salt or a keyed salt hash

171416
serializable	deserialization
if matching the exact serializable format of firefox is not your aim you could use one of the javascript json serializable deserialization libraries listed at

171435
g++	gcc
i know that the #warning directive is not standard c c++ but several compilers support it including gcc g++

171478
disk	ram
i had 2gb of ram had been trying to allocate more ram for disk cache but still haven t achieve anything

171495
prepare	execute
all of the above implement prepare and execute

171512
int	boolean
provide an api to access the bits in this 2d map as boolean or even int values

171518
width	height
i think you can do this by calculating the height and width you want with javascript via document.body.clientwidth etc. and then injecting the iframe into your html like this

171518
width	height
element.innerhtml + iframe src height 200 width + document.body.clientwidth 0.8 +

171542
width	height
i m trying to set the width and height of an element with javascript to cover the entire browser viewport and i m successful using document.body.clientheight but in ie6 it seems that i always get horizontal and vertical scrollbars because the element must be slightly too big

171548
client-side	server-side
logic data presentation - you name it - are split and mixed between server-side and client-side code

171631
min	max
now this is working great however the min max and close buttons still are xp default theme

171642
firefox	safari
however the vast majority will be using vanilla ie firefox safari

171664
subtraction	addition
i am building a simple expression parser that then needs to evaluate the simple binary operations such as addition subtraction etc

171665
post	get
to do a real post or pre increment the counter would need to be locked from before the get to after the set

171688
versioning	upgrade
when you reopen a net 1.1 form in .net 2.0 the resx file gets upgrade to a new versioning

171706
floating-point	fixed-point
use fixed-point when the hardware doesn t support floating-point or the hardware implementation sucks

171752
bash	zsh
rush is a replacement for the unix shell bash zsh etc which uses pure ruby syntax

171764
ubuntu	linux
if you can bypass that iirc i booted from the cd and downloaded the normal server kernel and it all worked fine then you end up with an absolutely minimal linux system but backed by the full ubuntu repositories so it s an excellent base for a server

171827
pascal	delphi
i need a complete object pascal syntax preferably delphi 2009

171828
jar	war
i the case of releasing java jar ear jar rar war files i would like to be able to look in at the jar and switch to the same branch version or tag that was the source of the released jar

171876
ready	each
it is my understanding that in the last part of the phase the transaction coordinator asks each node whether it is ready to commit

171899
filtering	grouping
strategy filtering and pipes grouping

171934
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memset
memset memcpy and memcmp

171942
jdom	xerces
though not related to programming exactly the use of xml parsers that come from multiple sources like xerces jdom

171953
pop-up	dialog
and if i misunderstood and you re talking about a dialog box made via css rather than a pop-up browser window then all the ways of closing that window are elements you could register click handers for.

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails plugins merb uses gems and not all have been ported the most used ones have

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
doing a straight port of a ruby-on-rails app will not utilize some of the cool features in merb plus syntax differs in places

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
overall if you re comfortable with ruby-on-rails switching to merb isn t hard at all

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

171966
memcpy	memset
if you have a very specific case you can often vastly outperform the system libc and or compiler inlining of memset and memcpy

171966
memcpy	memset
for example for the program i work on i wrote a 16-byte-aligned memcpy and memset designed for small data sizes

171966
memcpy	memset
the memcpy was made for multiple-of-16 sizes greater than or equal to 64 only with data aligned to 16 and memset was made for multiple-of-128 sizes only

171966
memcpy	memset
drop down to around line 600 for the memcpy and memset

171994
post	get
html forms support get and post

172016
memcpy	memset
memset memcpy are mostly written with a basic instruction set in mind and so can be outperformed by specialized sse routines which on the other hand enforce certain alignment constraints

172016
memcpy	memset
for data-sets several hundred kilobytes memcpy memset perform faster than anything you could mock up

172016
memcpy	memset
for data-sets megabytes use a combination of memcpy memset to get the alignment and then use your own sse optimized routines fallback to optimized routines from intel etc

172075
pull	push
default pull push repository origin

172075
pull	push
default pull push options

172078
cvs	svn
in our shop we re in the process of moving from cvs to svn and have been quite pleased with the result

172164
apache	lighttpd
the linux.com article talks about using lighttpd with apache

172177
apache	lighttpd
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

172218
post	get
to get a small string say up to 2000 characters from the database is very quick and probably faster than having the user post it all the time especially if there is more than 1 on a page

172243
clang	llvm
use the llvm clang static analyzer

172258
ready	each
after i m finished with it each week i d like to click one link to uncheck reset all of the items on it so it s ready for the next use

172269
pull	push
as a distributed version control system through its push pull system it helps developers to create a source code eco-system which helps to manage a large pool of developers working on a single project

172270
accessor	properties
declare accessor using properties

172270
accessor	properties
when declaring accessor you should always use the objective-c 2 properties feature

172270
accessor	properties
the properties declarations make the memory management semantics of the accessor explicit

172272
rss	feed
all web clients that i know of are read only meaning that you can only browse the files make diffs set up rss feed but you can not modify the repository in any way

172374
mouseover	mouseout
insert a mouseover and mouseout event

172376
hide	show
in this css file just hide the elements you don t want to show while printing display none

172392
pycrypto	keyczar
i couldn t figure out how to do it with ezpycrypto pycrypto seems to be hung on a moderator swap and googles keyczar does not explain how to set this up - i fear if i don t just get it then i run a risk of introducing insecurity

172449
restrict	shared
then you don t have to bother coding up your own security solution and you re not restrict to a static shared key which if compromised will allow all captured traffic to be decrypted after the fact

172453
filesystems	fat
there is a number of embedded filesystems not fat compatible that designed exactly for this purpose

172472
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

172472
subtract	add
incmonth - add a or subtract a number of months

172472
subtract	add
incweek - add a or subtract a number of weeks

172472
subtract	add
incyear - add a or subtract a number of years

172538
folder	directory
i have a master directory of client folder each of which has projects and each project has sales and delivery

172552
temp	tmp
in my first pass i just created the temp dir at tmp . script but then i tested the script on a computer where i didn t have write access to tmp and i d like to take that case into account

172585
subtraction	addition
no multiplies or divides only addition subtraction and shifts

172592
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ are compiler-drivers of the gnu compiler collection which was once upon a time just the gnu c compiler

172592
g++	gcc
according to 1 and 2 g++ is equivalent to gcc -xc++ -lstdc++ -shared-libgcc the 1st is a compiler option the 2nd two are linker options

172597
g++	gcc
gcc or g++ just choose a different front-end with different default options

172613
g++	gcc
the only notable difference is that i you pass a .c to gcc it will compile as c whereas g++ will always treat it as c++

172639
int	double
that said as per my comment on collin s post the ability to perform things like basic arithmetic increment int32 division etc on for example a matrix t for t in decimal float int double etc is often highly valuable

172663
rss	feed
i need to create a news ticker that is updated via an rss feed

172718
postgresql	mysql
i still use mysql for web sites but for in-house projects i rather choose firebird or postgresql

172728
postgresql	mysql
people using linux are used to install mysql sqlite or postgresql in a second and maybe that s beacuse they don t need windows to run a dbms

172756
width	height
use screen.availwidth and screen.availheight to calculate a suitable size for the height and width parameters in window.open

172787
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql go toe to toe all the time and the choice is not as clear as you made it seem

172793
ironruby	ironpython
1- the homepage points to another page at codeplex the homepage should be clean and just point the advantages of ironpython take the ironruby page as an example its that hides language-developent stuff from the user even though the user has to access ironruby s svn prior using it

172798
lisp	scheme
i have experimented with lisp actually scheme and found it to be a very beautiful language that i am interested in learning more about

172833
sorting	filtering
this has scaling problems selecting from really large datasets but so do all the less-normalized schemas sorting and filtering by a text field will probably always be slower than using an integer for example

172843
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc

172843
memcpy	malloc
while this will involve the overhead for zeroing memory most compilers are likely to have this routine highly-optimized -- more optimized that malloc new with a call to memcpy

172871
folder	directory
i ve tried various folder organizations a top level project directory then broken down by department or person or application but no matter what i try it s still too time consuming to find what i m looking for

172918
width	height
both should take 100 width and 100 height within the container

172928
allegro	sdl
i m toying with sdl or allegro but i have no experience in either so i m open to the best and ideally easiest toolkit out there

172929
g++	gcc
although the gcc and g++ commands do very similar things g++ is designed to be the command you d invoke to compile a c++ program

172943
strcpy	memmove
go ahead and figure out how to write the assembly to replace a few simple stdlib routines like strcpy memmove etc

172959
hash	salt
as jplemme has pointed out you are actually working with a completely separate parrallel system into which live data has been copied and anonymized and the secure login process that uses hash and salt

172968
many-to-many	many-to-one
you won t have the tag entity but the many-to-many lookup table will have to be created as a many-to-one relationship which makes it an entity itself

172992
disk	ram
but it basically matches ram blocks to disk blocks

173007
g++	gcc
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

173007
g++	gcc
gcc compiling .cpp and g++ compiling .c .cpp files has a few extra macros

173070
google-chrome	firefox
after some fiddling i found out that the highest possible value of two which when right-shifted by .5 would yield 2 is 2.9999999999999997779553950749686919152736663818359374999999â with the 9 repeating in google-chrome and firefox

173162
button	checkbox
when i did this for a project i found that setting the value of select fields radio button and checkbox necessitated more complex code something along the lines of

173162
button	checkbox
as noted in the comment the jquery .val val method handles setting radio button checkbox and selects

173163
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
also if you aren t using firefox you can use firebug lite in ie safari or opera

173168
codeigniter	cakephp
with mature frameworks like zend framework codeigniter and cakephp creating just about anything in php is possible

173214
joomla	phpbb
in a few of the open source applications i ve poked around in including joomla and phpbb they declare a constant in the main includes file and then verify that constant exists in each of the includes

173229
daemons	launchd
you might also want to take a look at any startup scripts that might launchd the fastcgi daemons

173241
bitblt	gdi
other gdi functions such as bitblt link as expected and the compilers compiles with out error or warning

173246
apache	nginx
we use apache 2.2 but will be switching over to nginx once it goes live

173352
gcov	gprof
3. cygwin shell installable complete with perl gcc gprof gcov gdb and related tools bash vim development debugging tools

173490
profiler	gprof
either use a profiler man gprof as another poster suggested or - quick dirty - put a loop around the offending section of code to execute it many times and use clock

173523
django	turbogears
it s python web framework similar to django or turbogears but it doesn t have the overhead of those frameworks

173548
accurev	svn
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev

173586
int	double
that works note the addition of case double in the switch but there may be a better way to do the int float check as they would only work with standard uk us numbers

173602
mouse	keyboard
maybe you just need an keyboard mouse hook

173634
decoder	encoder
if it supports parameters change inside the stream then if you can tell the encoder to put the corresponding header when changing resolution your decoder should automatically switch

173638
rss	feed
properly on different rss feed and

173654
keydown	keyup
intercepting the ctrl+v in keydown or keyup of your form

173701
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
the other thing you need is some kind of revision control - cvs rcs svn git clearcase.

173703
portrait	landscape
the device allows users to switch from the standard widescreen landscape display format to a portrait one

173715
virtualenv	setuptools
my site-packages directory contains setuptools and virtualenv only

173718
profiling	instrumentation
however even with rdtsc you will be including the time your code was switched out of execution while a better solution than using time clock if you need an exact measurement you will have to turn to a profiling that will instrumentation your code and take into account when your code is not actually executing due to context switches or whatever

173770
lwjgl	jogl
i know how to draw basic objects using jogl or lwjgl to connect to opengl

173796
implements	extends
i also tried an oo approach defining objects for trunk branches leaves all extends an abstract class and implements a genotype interface to vary the kind of trees

173799
width	height
you might have to set a width and height on your as well

173807
disk	ram
now point 2 is the easier to tackle and explain lots of things go faster if you have more ram or a faster machine or faster disk or move over to gig ethernet or such

173829
width	height
in css file set the width of .ui-datepicker-cover to 220px height to 200px

173886
inherited	subclassing
also i would like this behaviour to be inherited by subclassing and not code a custom serializer for every one

174107
for-loop	loops
as a preparation create a serial for-loop template and change your code to use functors to implement loops bodies

174107
atomic	interlocked
what worked great for me was a combination of manual reset event + atomic interlocked counter as a much faster alternative

174119
automake	autotools
i see this often in the build scripts of projects that use autotools autoconf automake

174153
operands	decrement
compiler error the operands of an increment or decrement operator must be a variable property or indexer.

174175
operands	decrement
you are running one of the operands on the result of the other the result of a increment decrement is a value - and you can not use increment decrement on a value it has to be a variable that can be set

174208
width	height
i don t think ie supports the use of auto for setting height width so you could try giving this a numeric value like jarett suggests

174267
post	get
next question is what method do you use post or get

174267
post	get
as a general rule of thumb you can take the following use post when the request will cause action that changes state on the server and use get when you only retreive data from the server

174365
vsts	tfs
my visual studio team system vsts integration with team foundation server tfs doesn t seem to pick it up

174396
rdf	owl
in addition there are some general-purpose rdf rdfs owl search engines you may find helpful

174430
put	get
and put everything dealing with log4net in that file but i still get the same messages

174454
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
aptana studio is the best in my opinion it s based on eclipse and subsequently java so it will run on pretty much anything and has design views supporting firefox opera and safari on os x and windows i assume it does other browsers as well if they are installed

174465
allocator	stl
usually i find that the best bet is to use the stl with custom allocator instead of replacing stl containers with hand rolled ones

174467
boost	stl
however i think that in this case i would almost always buy and use stl - or a better solution something from boost perhaps before rolling my own

174510
google-chrome	firefox
source google-chrome ie firefox

174521
allocator	stl
even if you do not share stl objects across threads many implementations use non-thread safe constructs like ++ for reference counting instead of an interlocked increment style or having non-thread-safe allocator

174535
gif	png
ideally this server side script would take the kml the map s lat lon center and the map zoom level and appropriately merge all of the visible place markers into a single gif or png overlay

174546
folder	directory
either way since deploy seems to be the last step previous steps probably clear the directory and deploy is failing to run leaving your folder empty at the end of the steps

174552
fseek	ftell	fseek	fread	ftell	fread
you may also want to check the error-codes for fseek ftell and fread

174559
vmware	virtualbox
if you are completely new to kernel development i would suggest not starting with hardware development and going to some software-only kernel modules like proc file sysfs or for more complex examples filesystem network development developing on a uml vmware virtualbox .

174653
wiimote	infrared
i d like to use the wiimote accelerometers gyroscopes infrared camera etc etc etc on various applications

174727
temporary	tablespace
temporary tablespace are used to

174728
allocator	stl
as evan mentioned writing proper allocator can help with this but if you re counting every byte used or concerned with memory fragmentation it may be wiser to hand-roll a solution that s tailored for your specific problem as the stl has been optimized for the most general usage

174728
boost	stl
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standard such as boost array or boost unordered_map

174761
gif	png
not sure why you want to go to a gif png overlay you can do this directly in kml

174828
libjpeg	libpng
my common library has grown to include code by others mostly things like libjpeg libpng ffmpeg mysql and a few others and i would rather keep the amount of external code in it to a minimum

174841
put	get
even when i put a break point in the converter code the debugger just doesn t get there when an update is done to the underlying data -

174882
daemons	systemd
also depending on how often changes are made to either systemd from bookmarks to downloaded isos you may need to run rsync in daemons mode and have it update nearly constantly

174922
implements	extends
i find that it varies a lot depending on the code you are working with - when writing something from scratch test driven it probably takes about the same amount of time to implements the feature as without tests but you save longer term on the quantity of bugs that will be found and how easily you can maintain and extends that code base

174937
maven	m2e
it tells maven a bit more explicitly what you are doing and i ve found that m2e and q4e both like it better

174958
jar	war
however only the application components within that war or ear will use the new jar which may be a problem or an advantage depending on how you ve set up your deployments

174959
eruby	erb
you do need a ruby enabled server such as apache running eruby erb

175008
codeigniter	cakephp
i don t know too much about rails or perl frameworks but php frameworks such as zend symfony codeigniter cakephp etc are used widely

175025
outputstream	inputstream
if you want to use inputstream and outputstream concurrently with socketchannel from looking at the source it appears that you need to call socketchannel.socket and use the streams from that which behave slightly differently

175115
hide	show
i got the tips to show when you stop and hide if you move

175129
put	get
i want to put that sql command dump text into this email when i get a sqlexception which will save me the time of digging through trace logs when a page blows up because of a query

175205
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox this will make anchors unclickable but in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari this does nothing

175206
getter	setter
if i have 7-10 parameters in one routine i look at bundling them into a new class but not if that class would be nothing but a bunch of fields with getter and setter - the new class has to do something other than shuffle values in and out

175233
hide	show
in the example you gave show and hide make a lot of sense at least to me

175239
hide	show
implicitly the show and hide functions you list are both setters

175266
getter	setter
in general i think setter getter should only set the values of properties

175266
getter	setter
in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and update the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the property

175267
hide	show
i prefer the show and hide methods because they explicitly tell what you are going

175267
hide	show
plus show and hide are better-named method for an interface imho

175280
hide	show
if switching misvisible really turns visibility of the object on and off immediately than use the show hide scenario

175301
bazaar	svn
you could consider using bazaar as a local repository then committing back to the central svn server

175307
cvs	svn
svn cvs git mecruial anything that doesn t lock files and doesn t leave your source in a proprietary file sytem

175325
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	irix	solaris	aix	solaris	minix	minix	aix	qnx	minix	vxworks	qnx	vxworks	minix
probably the one that will get you farthest is posix after all every unix like system tries to support at least some posix the more the better very little can call themselves really being 100 posix-compliant platforms a ux aix hp-ux irix mac os x 10.5 minix qnx solaris unixware vxworks .

175325
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
however there are quite a couple of platforms that offer at least some posix support some more some less and some are almost posix-compliant freebsd linux netbsd beos openbsd .

175337
hide	show
i would go with the isvisible show hide set

175337
hide	show
show and hide make the side effects clear

175372
kate	kde
i use kate kde advanced text editor for most of my development including django

175393
hide	show
otoh operations like show and hide can be easily overridden with different implementations without revealing anything about the internal state

175394
google-chrome	firefox
css seems to be easier to standardize across browsers than javascript though that may be changing with the advent of google-chrome s v8 and firefox s upcoming new rendering tool

175449
children	parent
this way you can reference your tasks by its parent or by its children

175449
children	parent
even though it may have a parent or children

175449
children	parent
just make sure that you don t have a task that has its parent the same as its child or else you ll go into an infinite loop when you do your recursion to find all the children

175511
put	get
that said sometimes it s difficult to get around--i have had to go back and edit in the null when it made sense as a default but i never put it in on the first pass any more

175528
gif	png
the site will support several file formarts from plain text to office documents doc xls ppt ... videos mpeg avi ... images jpg gif png ... pdf s open office etc

175612
put	get
or is it run in a more batch manner - you put in requests then get told later if you can have your slot

175878
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome looks like a major contender but it s still less than 5 as is opera

175887
versioning	upgrade
in one of database tables i store the versioning number of the database structure so i can upgrade any database easily

175892
width	height
make its width height 50 the width of the browser window or something

175893
google-chrome	safari
well since google-chrome is based off of webkit if you test for safari chances are google-chrome will work as well

175905
opera	safari
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c

175924
google-chrome	safari
testing google-chrome and the windows version of safari will give you a very good handle on your site s user experience on the mac platform at least if you don t have a mac available for testing

175955
postgresql	mysql
i am currently trying to import a semi-colon delimited text file into a database in c# using oledb where i don t know the type sql server access oracle mysql postgresql etc. currently i m reading in the file as a database using the jet text reader then creating a prepared insert statement populating the fields then commiting at the end

176043
unsigned	short
the arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over c arrays which give you kind of strongly typed containers see docs with access to more c-like types such as signed unsigned short or double which are not part of the built-in types

176053
ready	each
are very easy because you have a ready to use package for each version you deployed

176064
google-chrome	firefox
i know with my website targeting technology people i see about a 30 firefox 55 ie 12 google-chrome and the rest are others for my visitors

176071
opera	safari
highly recommended to fully support opera and safari no missing functionality slightly degraded interfaces are acceptable but only if absolutely necessary

176071
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
interface degradation is acceptable with ie6 and firefox 2 as long as it is still usable i consider these as end of life browsers and frankly rarely worth the effort also here are older versions of opera and safari but i rarely see significant problems with these

176110
min	max
for a more complicated answer there is such a thing as sample counting clipping detectors that require x consecutive samples to be at the max min value for them to be considered clipping where x may be as high as 7

176115
richfaces	icefaces
i ll second richfaces but also point out icefaces which isn t free but is also very nice

176116
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
others firefox opera safari google-chrome if you strive to write standards-compliant html css and javascript what works in either of these browsers will most probably work with the rest

176143
short	base
long story short is that it is not a completely managed code base but simply a .net wrapper around their com version

176144
opera	safari
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons

176144
firefox	safari
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176144
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go

176155
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
freedesktop.org standards are followed by gnome kde and xfce so it should work on any distribution

176192
getter	setter
my thought was that i could use setter and getter for each common variable

176220
put	get
these users most likely will not be trying to put in text that would get sanitized but by protecting against it you are protecting their users

176258
hide	show
if all you want to do is conditionally show or hide a div then you could declare it as an asp panel renders to html as a div tag and set it s .visible property

176271
client-side	server-side
you can use client-side validation to save some load on your server or make your app seem more responsive by showing the error sooner when validation fails but you should always validate using server-side code

176271
client-side	server-side
personally i like the asp.net validation controls because it gives you the benefit of client-side validation with security of server-side without having to write your logic twice

176301
mouse	keyboard
i think it s funny when you hear people typing away on the keyboard in crime dramas doing photoshop-type stuff that really requires a mouse

176308
maven	cargo
have a look at cargo and its maven plugin

176342
folder	directory
the registry change would cause the search order to start with the current working directory which you could set to the desired folder in a shortcut

176345
maven	cargo
the cargo maven plugin is a good way to go if you re doing servlet development and want to deploy the resulting war for integration testing

176376
put	get
i want to put 3 into a function and get the first value greater than or equal to 3 in this case i would want to get 6

176459
int	double
the int and double work fine and get stored in the table...but i can t figure out how to get the strings to store.

176467
installation	upgrade
i was able to upgrade the tfs installation at my company by using these resources

176479
gif	png
i have a image upload form that should take image types png jpeg gif resize it and then save it to a path

176479
gif	png
for some reason i can t get the png file types to work it works fine with jpeg gif and the file is copied so it looks like it s something to do with how i m creating the png

176481
vertica	greenplum	vertica	teradata	teradata	greenplum
you may want to look at what companies like teradata netezza greenplum vertica asterdata etc are doing

176516
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
do the standards-compliant engines first webkit safari google-chrome and gecko firefox

176542
datamapper	activerecord
these basic patterns will give you an idea of how to structure your objects and the more advanced patterns like activerecord datamapper you ll see how those relate to problem domains beyond where your needs are at the moment

176548
imperative	declarative
in general mixing workflows imperative programming with rest declarative programming is very problematic

176555
bazaar	git
examples darcs git mercurial bazaar

176555
cvs	svn
examples cvs svn visual sourcesafe

176566
post	get
the link points to the corresponding blog which lists post screencasts in descending order so you ll need to go back to this page to get started

176644
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it in google-chrome and firefox as those are the browsers in which i have a javascript console so i can t guarantee it works in internet explorer as i ve never personally used it

176644
google-chrome	firefox
my understanding is that this was an ie-only property that the other browsers picked up and isn t currently in any standards so i d be surprised if firefox and google-chrome support it but ie stopped

176669
put	get	post	put	post	get
resource-orientation is about explicitly modeling state data limiting function to predefined verbs with universal semantics in the case of http get put post delete and leaving the rest of the processing to the client

176682
dateadd	datepart
well you could use a lot of dateadd datepart etc but it will be slow if you have a lot of data as it can t really use an index here

176697
gif	png	gif	ico	gif	bmp	bmp	png	png	ico
icons in other image formats ico bmp png gif photoshop psd jpg and more

176700
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the contenteditable property is what you want -- it s supported by ie safari and by google-chrome as a byproduct and i think firefox 3 alas not ffx2

176700
firefox	safari
edit olliej so yes the contenteditable attribute in the linked demo works fine in ie firefox and safari

176703
perforce	accurev
i ve been a long time accurev user and have recently moved to a job where i m using perforce

176747
jsf	seam
the problem might be that seam covers a lot of the details you d usually have to do in a traditional ejb3 jsf application

176824
button	checkbox
solution select the project.vbp and from the tool sourcesafe menu choose check out you get a dialog which lets you choose all files you get a checkbox for each and a button for select all

176895
implements	extends
hethmon from manning is a very good book to learn http protocol and will be very useful to someone implements it extends it

176916
webkit	gecko
there may be more my google strategy was to try webkit command-line pdf and gecko command-line pdf basically looking for commandline programs that embed the two popular open-source rendering engines in command-line renderers

176954
int	chars
bitsets have the advantage that they do exactly what they say on the tin - none of this declare an array of chars int but the only legal values are 0 and 1 nonsense

177013
int	boolean
additionally i don t rely on the automatic conversion of int to boolean values but explicitly compare them

177126
min	max
if you want an example that has the proper min and max values too try this one of length 8

177216
udp	tcp
difference between udp and tcp

177234
free	malloc
the routines were used as wrappers around malloc and free

177234
free	malloc
when a buffer of a specific type was allocated we d malloc the memory in blocks if a list of free buffers was empty

177234
free	malloc
we also maintained a list of the blocks of buffers so that we could do a simple cleanup by calling free on each of the actual malloc d buffers

177234
put	get	free	malloc
we had replacement routines for malloc and free that did pointer arithmetic to get the buffer size and then to put the buffer into the free list

177236
stdout	stderr
linux variant when writing a daemon what are the basic building blocks forking a child and killing the parent closing stdin stdout stderr etc.

177264
bitarray	bitset
after that they swept through the bitarray once spitting out the phone numbers for entries that had the bitset high

177337
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i don t know what your whole environment is but you might consider wrapping the calls to malloc realloc free on just the vm so that you can pass it off to a handler designed for small pools

177346
hide	show
however slapping labels on methods is faster than building logic to show hide buttons or do security validation in code

177348
google-chrome	safari
works with google-chrome safari like a charm

177363
hash	md5
i ve chosen to go with an md5 hash and it fits fine for my purpose

177369
hash	md5
you could use an elf hash - c code included or some other simple hash function like that instead of md5 or sha-x

177376
hash	md5
personally i d use md5 if you need to store in text or a 256b 32b hash such as sha256 if you can store in binary in this situation

177386
hash	md5
now whether you d be better off truncating the sha-1 hash or using a shorter hash such as md5 i don t know

177386
hash	md5
i think i d be more generally confident when keeping the whole of a hash but md5 has known vulnerabilities which may or may not be a problem for your particular application

177393
versioning	upgrade
this used to work great and then we upgrade versioning of gcc and suddenly started seeing stack overflows

177401
memcpy	memset
if you don t want to use memset you could always declare a static copy of your struct and use memcpy which will give similar performance

177450
queue	fifo
it is easiest to implement a queue fifo rather than a deque or linked list

177468
qpushbutton	qobject
i have other classes that subclass qpushbutton and qobject respectively but they compile ok

177485
listview	gridview
i want to display some information in a listview using the gridview

177534
unbind	hoverintent
hoverintent only binds mousemove when the cursor enters the active element and unbind it afterwards

177565
altera	xilinx
buy a cheap starter kit from xilinx or altera the two big fpga players

177565
verilog	vhdl
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

177624
ant	maven
ant and maven are both build tools which will run on any platform which has java available for it

177646
int	chars
int chmod const chars path mode_t mode

177649
mouse	keyboard
take regular breaks from using the mouse and learn keyboard shortcuts

177689
gridview	rowdatabound
if this is a pure coding exercise then bind to the rowdatabound event of the gridview

177702
notepad++	scite
for starters give her a text editor with regex search and replace like notepad++ or scite

177737
button	checkbox	optgroup	checkbox
they can handle going one level deep if the top level is not selectable see the optgroup element 1 but beyond that i suggest taking a regular list ordered or unordered with as much nesting as you need remember sublists go inside list items in their parent list and including a checkbox or radio button with each selectable list item

177758
linefeed	delimiter
the official end-of-line delimiter in whois as with most ietf protocols is crlf not just linefeed

177798
keydown	mousedown
otherwise you could also add event listeners for appropriate ui events keydown mousedown and prevent their default behavior return false or event.returnvalue false

177804
antivirus	mcafee
i am specifically interested in software like mcafee entercept or certain antivirus scanners that patch the kernel

177815
post	get
i am changing a get to a post

177844
verilog	vhdl
also check out opencores.org - there are some articles and a lot of open source code in both verilog and vhdl you can learn from

177844
verilog	vhdl
as far as i can tell vhdl vs verilog gets just as religious as ruby vs python or java vs c#

177863
google-chrome	firefox
that it is to say file with spaces.pdf gets downloaded in firefox as file while in google-chrome ie7 ie6 is downloaded as file with spaces.pdf

177874
websphere	ibm
i have an ibm websphere mq queue running on windows containing many items of varying priority

177875
int	chars
use a blank in those columns any int will have a chars or even a null chars

177887
public	protected
it s unlikely to do so however and making the inheritance protected or public would avoid this possible trap

177922
ironruby	ironpython
i don t know why anyone would want to call it wisc as these people are essentially saying we will never ever use vb.net ironpython ironruby f# or any other .net language

177927
put	get
i am currently thinking of doing some base methods with generics and reflection to get some generic query methods to reduce the duplication issue 2 i will put a prototype up for review later

177932
jsf	seam
you don t have to use jsf for seam to be useful

177956
int	boolean
what is the best way to convert an int or null to boolean value in an sql query such that

177968
datalist	repeater
the repeater and datalist controls don t offer paging and the datagrid with paging is restricted to one item per row

178003
ssl	https
use ssl https

178023
sproutcore	cappuccino
you could also try sproutcore or cappuccino js frameworks

178038
folder	directory
then just have the www working-copy auto-updated or exported if you don t want the .svn directory in the www folder for the www-user by some script perhaps as a post-commit hook which then setups permissions accordingly

178197
int	boolean
it uses boolean values to represent the bits in terms of the api but under the hood i believe it uses an int

178235
cvs	svn
svn was born out of limitations that the creators saw with cvs

178241
int	double
in situations where you are dealing with very large amounts of data fixed point can be twice as memory efficient a four byte long int as opposed to an eight byte double

178322
post	get
however input must always be validated on the server side since the user can just change the input data manually in the get url or send crafted post data

178341
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
and the base functionality between svn git mercurial bazaar all use essentially identical commands to commit view diffs and so on

178341
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
the small difference in the way git requires changes to be explicitly added before they re committed as opposed to svn s commit everything policy is conceptually simple and unless i m mistaken not even an issue when using mercurial or bazaar

178395
pull	push
edit note mercurials biggest difference i ve noted vs git that makes mercurial harder to use for newbies is mercurials default behavior for push pull is like doing git push --all git pull --all which can propagate private branches and add lots of confusion especially as when a new branch turns up mercurial freezes in fear and asks you how to handle it instead of just keeping on trucking as well as the default merge conflict resolution tool on mac just clobbering one set of changes blindly

178414
put	get
and those will get put into ppt s for presentation internally and externally

178415
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
i think the toolset for svn is much broader so you could sit down and teach people tortoisesvn rapidsvn etc even if they did not have much conceptual idea of how the repository worked

178424
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
if cross-platform testing is central to your company s business a full size intel-based mac running both os x and windows with parallels bootcamp or vmware for testing may be a better option

178432
folder	directory
make sure your virtual directory or sub folder are set up correctly in iis and didn t change in the deployment

178434
dlsym	dlopen
in c you can work around these by not linking directly to the library instead you load the library at runtime using dlopen then find the symbol you are looking for using dlsym and assign it to a global symbol that you can name any way you like and then access it through this global symbol

178442
cvs	svn
stuff like this is hard to do properly with cvs or svn

178490
pop-up	dialog
our program has this and for debug builds we pop-up a dialog detailing the problem if it is a warning or fatal message

178503
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
other than that start your worker thread and make it wait on some manualresetevent or autoresetevent

178508
hash	md5
for a more robust check you could calculate md5 or sha-1 hash with hashbytes on the row contents to give you a difference with a very low probability of collision see this wikipedia article on birthday attacks for a discussion of this problem

178532
typedef	struct
for legacy code reasons the msdn suggestion of replacing typedef with struct is not practical

178534
folder	directory
i usually put separate folder at the root level so i end up with a directory structure like this

178535
versioning	upgrade
to build business objects there is a lot of leg work that needs to be done and this should be tackled by a code generator. i m not using one though as i still want to get a grip of the framework the latest versioning of csla 3.5 cuts down the amount of code in properties and we have upgrade because of this

178551
ceil	floor
what about ceil and floor

178551
ceil	floor
ceil floor and a number of other mathematical and trigonometric

178555
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

178555
verilog	vhdl
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

178576
ceil	floor
implements ceil floor and a number of other mathematical

178580
debian	linux
we are trying to bind a linux machine debian 4.0 to w2k3 ad

178581
postgresql	mysql
however i only have that experience with mysql and postgresql - not with sql server

178620
integer	unsigned
if the creation of orders customers will always be centralized an unsigned integer would be fine

178655
inherited	properties
i would bind the background of the textbox instead so that whatever background brush the user set on the user control would flow properties value inherited to the button

178665
pop-up	dialog
if you are running as a service without a logged in user some print drivers like to pop-up dialog from time to time

178778
vb.net	vb6
indeed chr 0 is used to terminate a string if you want a newline character you can use environment.newline in vb.net or vbnewline in vb6

178835
accessor	properties
i did not test your code but you should never need to force the initialization of proxies the properties accessor do that for you

178860
codeigniter	cakephp
i m trying to use a microsoft access database for a demo project that i m thinking of doing in either codeigniter or cakephp

178913
put	get
note the stickeyness - the set 6 12 13 doesn t have a shared element with 1 2 3 but they get put in the same group because of 5 2 6

178921
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but whenever i do the search in ie i get redirected back to index.php

178981
opera	firefox
this test script ran fine for me in ie firefox and opera

178998
decoder	encoder
for what you are doing you need an encoder decoder for the format

179021
onchange	onkeydown
you can do this in onkeydown and onchange

179037
post	get
in other words have a cycle of remove code get it to build run it and see if the console still pops up. eventually you should end up either spotting the issue or being able to post a short but complete program so that we can reproduce it and help fix it

179084
nant	cruisecontrol
cruisecontrol calls a series of nant scripts

179107
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s the absolute worst of the mainstream browsers i try to use firefox with firebug or google-chrome safari to handle most issues

179116
ready	each
advance each tag to later versions when ready

179174
bazaar	git
since you can still push to another machine also running git mercurial bazaar etc you still have the multi-computer backup safety which you d hopefully have either way

179186
gtk	cairo
-i c gtk include cairo

179294
post	get
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

179298
listview	gridview
i just learned this today the bind method as used with gridview and listview doesn t exist

179299
vim	emacs
i m fairly new at programming but i ve wondered how shell text editors such as vim emacs nano etc are able to control the command-line window

179338
boost	log4cpp
external dependencies boost log4cpp etc are not stored in svn

179390
vbscript	vb6

179401
hide	show
put .parent before hide or .show to show or hide the parent div

179403
client-side	server-side
the other way to do this is server-side instead of client-side

179415
awt	swing
i haven t seen it cause any problems yet and to my understanding the graphics class is legacy code but the java designers didn t want to change the interfaces for swing and awt classes in order to preserver backwards compatibility

179435
integer	fractions
you get 16-bits of signed integer plus 16 bits of fractions precision

179485
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
i am also not comfortable with my domain objects implementing ieditableobject and idataerrorinfo inotifypropertychanged etc

179515
put	get
for example i remember reading that apple put a lot of work in safari to get apple-style font rendering there and i doubt google duplicated that effort

179520
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

179524
children	parent
you should be able to just update your collection to make it accurate and then save the parent but as you ve found out hibernate tries to detach the children from the parent before deleting them and if the foreign key is not-null it will fail

179527
google-chrome	safari
this is probably a good place to note that google-chrome has been added to browsershots so you don t even need to have it installed to test on it and safari

179590
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 525.13 khtml like gecko google-chrome 0.2.149.30 safari 525.1

179614
boost	stl
if an idiomatic answer is important they can always specify c c++ c++ with stl c++ with boost etc

179626
vb.net	vb6
visualstudio offers or at least offered a wizard to do a conversion from vb6 to vb.net which could then be converted to c# with a bit of work possibly helped by #develop s vb.net - c# converter but when last i used it for anything non-trivial there was a lot of manual work needing to be done so i suspect you re probably better rewriting or porting by hand if this is a large and or important application

179644
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is currently using a slightly older version of webkit than safari

179653
int	chars
i want to take the value stored in a 32 bit unsigned int put it into four chars and then store the int value of each of these chars in a string

179662
octree	quadtree
then you create a quadtree or octree to hierarchically divide the mesh data

179687
rss	feed
i ve wondered the same thing for a while and am very hesitant to republish rss feed feedforall says there is no inherent right to reproduce content

179691
integer	unsigned
consider that an unsigned 32-bit integer stores over 4 billion values

179699
google-chrome	safari
this would be a similar question to does google-chrome render the same as konqueror and altho the webkit html renderer versions may be different the java script engines are very different between google-chrome safari and konqueror

179738
min	max
just find the max and min datetimes take the difference and divide by the number of datetimes you looked at

179749
ironruby	ironpython
i admit i haven t learned ironruby ironpython f# or any other .net language yet but i m seriously considering it just to increase my programming arsenal

179776
client-side	server-side
ajax calls are from the client-side to the server-side

179782
awt	swing
if it s a gui app switch from swing to awt or maybe eclipse s toolkit it s supposed to be pretty quick

179804
client-side	server-side
any time you transition between server-side and client-side it s like the user clicked the refresh button on their browser in terms of performance

179813
altera	xilinx
altera and xilinx have simulators build into their free tool sets

179813
ada	vhdl	verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
for hdl choice verilog is to c as vhdl is to ada

filesystems	xfs
extended attributes are supported some filesystems particularly xfs and i think jfs

179849
unix	solaris
the tools need to be accessed from windows linux various unix s vms and solaris

179946
vb.net	vb6
however if i m not mistake the wizard only migrates vb6 to vb.net

180097
int	double
those calls will include methods that have arguments that are primitive types int double etc.

180218
folder	directory
you can t checkout a single directory of a repository because the entire repository is handled by the single .git folder in the root of the project instead of subversion s myriad of .svn directory

180330
pop-up	dialog
i ve got a save dialog box which pop-up when i press a button

180363
picturebox	linklabel
in this control there are several child controls like a label a picturebox and a linklabel

180363
mouseleave	mouseenter
this is because there is no mouseenter and mouseleave events on the child control

180384
google-chrome	firefox
ps you can enable firefox to auto log on via ntlm and it is one of the most requested features for google-chrome too so don t let browser issues put you off

180399
min	max
any aggregation function used during a join to retrieve the max or min or avg value from a joined table will cause the error

180440
put	get
while you can put any sql you like in the conditions of a named scope if you then call find_by_sql then the scopes get thrown away

180441
accessor	properties
for example if you have an object that just has properties and accessor you re probably fine

180543
visualvm	jprofiler	profiler	visualvm
use a profiler jprofiler netbeans profiler visualvm eclipse profiler etc

180601
super	implements
the fact is that super is implements in java as well as in c# where it is called base unless i m wrong

180630
unix	bsd
it isn t quite irrelevant - some version 6 unix stuff escaped into bsd but these days you d be extremely hard pressed to find anything that ancient in current use

180634
inherited	subclassing
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it

180636
junit	testng
there are 2 main unit test frameworks -- junit and testng

180660
width	margin
other than width i d be setting border and margin too these may or may not influence your controls

180674
clang	llvm
in particular i don t know if it works with the clang frontend from the llvm project though it should work with llvm-gcc llvm using the gcc frontend

180704
rss	feed
this appears to be analogous to a unix pipe or perhaps an rss feed

180711
rss	feed
i read the c tag rss feed and i see tons of c++ questions come through that really don t have anything to do with c

180749
spaces	delimiter
update if the directory contains files with spaces in the names you need to change the delimiter the for f command is using

180814

i replaced it with a tiny ultra compact base64 encoder written entirely as one c function i copied the function body into the method body method took nsdata as input and returned nsstring as output however inside the function everything was c

180833
vbscript	jscript
you can use your choice of languages to write scripts jscript vbscript even python

180839
tax	shipping
your parameters or commands would be base price local tax city tax state tax ground shipping and coupon discount

180878
getter	setter
the biggest pointers that you are doing oo wrong is lots of setter and getter the desire to use a switch statement and a large inheritance tree but there are many others your question wasn t oo but close enough

180885
versioning	upgrade
the main issue with it is that when new versioning are released the api can change drastically making it very difficult to manage upgrade

180906
dictionary	map
it s not identical but vbscript has a dictionary object which behaves like java s map or hashtable

180994
jboss	weblogic
those jobs are most likely asking that you have experience with one or more of the major app server vendors weblogic websphere or jboss

181021
vbscript	jscript
how to debug windows script host vbscript and jscript files

181056
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari

181081

i m not sure what the support is for google-chrome but i ve had good luck with it for ie and firefox and allegedly it works with safari

181153
firefox	safari
edit olliej sigh nevermind this only works in safari and ie and i can t be bothered downloading a firefox nightly to see if it exists in trunk -

181170
hash	md5
will cause its md5 hash to also

181170
hash	md5
change the md5 hash is commonly used

181191
spaces	delimiter
note that the other fields will never have a spaces following the comma only the delimiter number list

181215
width	height
i had to set the height and width to percentages just shy of the full amount 99.99 59.99 39.99 to keep the floats from wrapping probably due to the borders on the divs

181252
bash	zsh
if you wish to get around that message have at run a script that calls a specified environment be it ksh bash csh zsh perl etc

181293
sctp	tcp
sctp is an alternative to tcp which attempts to address these shortcomings among others

181341
ssl	https
dag tunnelling ssh over http s has been pointed out to me but it doesn t help at the end of the article they mention bug 29744 - connect does not work over existing ssl connection preventing tunnelling over https exactly the problem i was running into

181387
inherited	properties
you can double buffer almost every windows forms control although most of the time it requires that you inherited from the desired control and override a protected properties

181450
coalesce	isnull
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls

181477
datamapper	activerecord
i initially used activerecord but i needed non-blocking thread-safe access to the database so i switched to using datamapper

181523
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this out in internet explorer 7 firefox 3 and safari google-chrome

181523
google-chrome	safari
the only one that differs is safari google-chrome and it appears to be 1 or 2 pixels wider than all the other browsers

181636
put	get
to get help on commands this .bat file will put all commands help into a nice html page

181718
pop-up	dialog
when i add a breakpoint and hit f5 to run in the debugger i am using my debug build a dialog pop-up telling my my web.config file does not have debug true in it which is does and i get 2 choices a run without the debugger or b let visual studio update my web.config file

181769
profiler	yourkit
use yourkit or any other good profiler to find out the hotspots in your application

181780
portrait	landscape
i have an app where i would like to support device rotation in certain views but other don t particularly make sense in landscape mode so as i swapping the views out i would like to force the rotation to be set to portrait

181780
portrait	landscape
i want my app to support landscape and portrait in view 1 but only portrait in view 2

181780
portrait	landscape
i have already implemented shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation for all views but if the user is in landscape mode in view 1 and then switches to view 2 i want to force the phone to rotate back to portrait

181784
serializable	deserialization
how would you design the remote database access and data serializable deserialization

181801
innodb	myisam
with regards to mysql in particular there are even slight indexing differences between innodb and myisam tables which are the two most commonly used table types

181814
google-chrome	safari
safari uses its own rendering engine for everything including the window google-chrome which is why it doesn t look like a normal windows app and why your localized titles are working

181818
rss	feed
according to the feedparser documentation i can turn an rss feed into a parsed object like this

181898
apache	lighttpd
in order to lighten apache s load people often suggest using lighttpd to serve up static content

181898
apache	lighttpd
in this setup apache passes requests for static content back to lighttpd via mod_proxy while serving dynamic requests itself

181919
apache	lighttpd
you don t have an apache process spawned for each request - static files images and the like are fetched directly by lighttpd

181931
rss	feed
if you re looking to read in an xml feed modify it and then output it again there s a page on the main python wiki indicating that the rss.py library might support what you re after it reads most rss and is able to output rss 1.0

181939
getter	setter
getter and setter

181955
apache	lighttpd
maybe it does reduce the load of apache because it doesn t have to do io to the disk but it will increase the load of lighttpd on the same machine and thus reducing the available load to apache .

181966
freemarker	velocity
i want to use a template engine in a struts application and would like to know if using tiles can be recommended instead of freemarker or velocity

181983
freemarker	velocity
it was good for templating however it can t really be compared to velocity or freemarker with tiles you use normal jsps and are limited to the jsp tags youv e got

181983
freemarker	velocity
velocity and probably freemarker although i haven t used it before provide their own tags or expression language so you can do thinks like

181983
freemarker	velocity
however i think velocity or freemarker are more powerful in terms of what you can do with it.

181983
freemarker	velocity
but if you need something more advanced than plain jsps velocity or freemarker might be the way to go

182002
inherited	properties
inherited from propertiesdependenciesmodelinspector overriding the inspectproperties method to apply some additional logic to identifying which properties should be added as dependencies to the components model inspecting the model.configuration for the wire false attribute value pair

182002
inherited	properties
inherited from defaultcomponentmodelbuilder and override the initializecontributors to include your replacement propertiesdependenciesmodelinspector - or just remove the existing properties contributor and add your own at run time via the addcontributor removecontributor methods

182008
apache	lighttpd
yes lighttpd can also be used as frontend to apache and or fastcgi

182057
django	turbogears
most web development frameworks django turbogears etc come with a built-in webserver command that runs on the local computer without apache

182104
ucfirst	capitalize
ucfirst lc capitalize text to text

182184
webclient	webrequest
one other option might be to get the data yourself webclient webrequest etc and simply push that html into the webbrowser - but this will mess up external links etc

182185
nginx	lighttpd
personally while lighttpd is ok i would go with nginx + fastcgi if you end up going with a lightweight webserver + fastcgi solution

182185
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
fastcgi the issue here and it doesn t matter if your webserver is apache lighttpd or nginx is figuring out how many fcgi child processes you let each user leave running because each process eats memory equal to the size of the php interpreter in linux not all of it is wired of course but i digress

182185
apache	lighttpd
i do sympathize with the desire to do something interesting like lighttpd + fcgi instead of the standard apache + cgi + suexec but i deep down i really can t recommend it

182199
postgresql	mysql
native drivers for most proprietary and open-source databases such as mysql and postgresql also exist

182234
hash	md5
you could try getting the md5 hash of the file every second minute hour depends on how fast you need it and compare it to the last hash

182253
ubuntu	linux
i have always been using happily the os.path module to deal with file path but recently i ended up with unexpected results on python 2.5 under ubuntu linux while dealing with string that represent windows file paths

182274
rss	feed
rss atom feed for all messages we

182318
docx	xlsx
the new office formats docx xlsx etc are zip files that contain a collection of xml files

182324
public	protected
if you want to access protected methods you could create a subclass of the class you want to use that exposes the methods you want to use as public or internal to the namespace to be safer and have an instance of that class in your class use it as a proxy

182400
playstation	wii
used by many game companies in aaa titles on playstation 3 xbox 360 nintendo wii and pc

182510
rss	feed
i have to produce an rss atom feed in various applications and i want to know a good library or class which is able to produce both and which already handles all common problems

182525
stdout	stderr
now if you want to just not see it you can use at time 2 dev null to send it off to oblivion but unfortunately the at prompts are printed to stderr for some reason a bug imo - they really should go to stdout so they re also hidden by this

182527
treemap	treeset
the easiest way is to chunk the data in a sorted collection treeset treemap using a comparator to sort on the column you need

182531
rss	feed
for the rss feed of a website that i administrate i simply wrote a small smarty template and it works pretty smoothly

how to switch a large app from vb6 to vb.net

182544
filtering	grouping

182597
rss	feed
generates rss 1.0 rss 2.0 and atom 1.0 feed

182615
rss	feed
when reading my rss feed with thunderbird feed reader some entries are duplicated

182678
ubuntu	linux
it s well supported in linux especially ubuntu

182724
ssl	https
not even ssl https

182763
vmware	virtualbox
i ve tried both vmware and virtualbox both free and i like virtualbox a little better because you can use it with the .iso straight

182893
django	turbogears
it s really a nice python web framework if you don t require everything django and turbogears offers

182897
width	height
i would recommend you not bind the width height property of each individual image but rather you bind a layouttransform on the listbox s itemspanel

182983
feedback	review
the design review gives early feedback and changes at the design stage are fairly easy

182999
vb.net	vb6
you can use the vb6 to vb.net tool as stated in this answer and then use either reflector or sharpdevelop to convert to c#

183035
user-controls	elementhost
within that taskpane i m using elementhost to host a wpf user-controls

183047
vmware	virtualbox
if you d rather go the vm route vmware works well and i ve heard good things about virtualbox

183091
ant	maven
i ve looked at ant and maven and they don t seem to be well geared towards remote administration the way capistrano is - they seem much more focused on simply building and packaging applications

183126
inherited	properties
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

183156
folder	directory
another way to do it is to remove all the .svn directory in all the folder

183185
int	chars
in table a it is represented as an int and in table b it is represented as a chars

183197
goto	break
unlike c these labels can only be used for continue and break as javascript does not have goto without hacks like this

183245
hide	show
warning double-click here to show hide compiler links

183262
inherited	properties
and here s a way to get rid of the reflection first create a new class to expose the viewstate properties with a usable protection level then change your code-behind .aspx.vb classes to inherited that instead of web.ui.page

183263
button	checkbox
most of the time any asp control will cause a post back button link click but some don t unless you tell them to checkbox combobox

183272
post	get
an html form has 2 methods get and post

183279
pop-up	dialog
what i want to do is pop-up a please wait dialog

183280
multiplying	subtract
but when the loop variable equals the limit rather than multiplying by the fraction i subtract the subtotal variable from the total cost and put that in the last department

183290
ant	maven
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

183290
put	get
but if you require additional steps fabric has worked very well for me so far and i assume that capistrano also offers generic shell-command put and get operations

for example i usually list margins padding height width border fonts display float other in that order allowing for easier readability in my next tip

183514
pop-up	dialog
if you just want to check in the file you are editing you don t have to click anywhere just hit the key combination and the commit dialog pop-up to commit the current file

183524
children	parent
1 i could keep a deleted children collection in the parent entity and pull the change tracking out of nhibernate and handle it myself

183575
try-catch	exception-handling
only one try-catch is needed and all exception-handling can be safely handled

183612
cvs	svn
you might also choose to migrate only the latest code from cvs into svn and freeze your current cvs repo

183621
hide	show
it is generally ok to read the session from your views to hide and show data links

183629
getter	setter
yet it is possible to call getter setter on those objects in the context of building up a transaction

183644
fadein	hide
you ll have to hide it before you can use fadein

183651
rss	feed
rss feed and an api from google

183660
mouse	keyboard
the only reliable devices are the video the mouse and keyboard

183709
factors	mean
for example identical transfer speeds don t necessarily mean the same technology is being used by two devices although other factors such as seek times would improve the accuracy if such information is available to your application

183715
set	bag
apart from set and orderedset it has a few other usefull collection types such as deque multidictionary bag orderedbag ordereddictionary and orderedmultidictionary

183779
filewriter	bufferedwriter
the finally tries to close from the outside of any decorated stream first so if you had a bufferedwriter wrapping a filewriter we try to close the buffereredwriter first and if that fails still try to close the filewriter itself

183786
linefeed	delimiter
a commercial tool would be nice but given the variety of problems that i ve encountered in csv files missing delimiter bad separator values embedded cr linefeed in the middle of fields etc. it was worth writing my own

183851
gif	png
the file types you listed jpg gif and png seem to be the main formats supported by nearly every browser albeit with certain caveats

183901
folder	directory
it s really annoying to have to change directory to my project folder the first time i run msbuild every day

183957
innodb	myisam
while testing mysql try both myisam and innodb

183983
x86	mips

184020
mouse	keyboard
allow users to use either the keyboard or mouse flexible

184036
yacc	bison
about midway through the semester we flipped to parser scanner generators like lex yacc or flex bison

184041
spaces	delimiter
i use json as my log format instead of the typical white spaces delimiter log files

184056
ant	maven
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.

184142
interbase	firebird
by the way dialect in firebird and interbase refers to a compatibility mode that was introduced so that applications developed for interbase 5.x can work with later versions of interbase and firebird

184192
hash	salt
currently accepted standards for hashing passwords create a new 16 character long salt for every password and store the salt with the password hash

184216
awt	swing
although we ve done some console stuff this is the first time we ve worked with a gui and swing or awt

184240
return-value-optimization	nrvo
add a named return-value-optimization nrvo to the python or ruby vm s

184251
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode in your type or

184265
daemons	systemd
this systemd works as a service daemons in the background and shovels documents to and fro

184285
put	get
but that s not how object destruction works in .net when an object goes out of scope it gets put in the finalizer s queue and its destructor doesn t get called until the finalizer gets around to it

184317
versioning	upgrade
if you re running versioning n of your application and want to upgrade to versioning n+1 you can do so using object serialization

184373
webkit	gecko
we re looking at webkit and gecko but i d love to get some feedback before i make a decision

184373
webkit	gecko
has anyone worked with webkit or gecko before

184376
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby - i ve never used merb so i ll address ruby-on-rails

184377
google-chrome	safari
i think i would suggest safari google-chrome s webkit engine which was derived from khtml the konqueror rendering engine

184381
webkit	gecko
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

184403
hash	md5
examples would be base 64 encoding being a hash algorithm where md5 being an encryption algorithm

184413
webkit	gecko
when apple was considering which engine to use in making safari they looked at gecko but decided to go with khtml fork it and called it webkit

184413
google-chrome	firefox
it apparently wasn t enough for google when they made google-chrome and they have a significant stake in firefox

184424
pascal	delphi
delphi 7 s grammar is in the back of the object pascal book

184438
webkit	gecko
it is possible to integrate it but it s much harder to do than khtml webkit - simply because gecko was not built with embedding in mind

184512
put	get	post	put	post	get
it uses http get post put delete messages to communicate arbitrary documents

184514
bluetooth	usb
there are a lot of weird serial ports these days usb serial cables bluetooth cell phone modems with gps .

184537
free	malloc
i see in c++ there are multiple ways to allocate and free data and i understand that when you call malloc you should call free and when you use the new operator you should pair with delete and it is a mistake to mix the two calling free on something that was created with the new operator but i m not clear on when i should use malloc free and when i should use new delete in my real world programs

184540
free	malloc
it is worth mentioning that you cannot mix new free and malloc delete

184548
free	malloc
use malloc and free only for allocating memory that is going to be managed by c-centric libraries and apis

184554
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
under both the listbox s selectedindexchanged and the textbox s textchanged events i updated the label with the listbox s selectedindex

184569
innodb	myisam
note your mysql tables assuming mysql must be of a type that supports transactions innodb does myisam does not

184695
put	get
then we take long running tests and put them in a nightlycategory so that they only get run during nightly builds and not in the continuous builds that we want to run fast

184698
ant	cruisecontrol
i ve had fair success using eclipse + ant with cruisecontrol

184700
des	rsa	des	aes	rsa	aes
typical standards are des tdes aes rsa etc

184756
versioning	upgrade
then subsequent upgrade installers will use the same product code and upgrade code but change the versioning

184771
mp3	ogg
if the program in question actually decodes mp3 ogg upon loading and encodes in back when saving this could be detected by noticeable time it takes to save a file then yes - you could experience degradation in quality

184797
mp3	ogg
if you re using a lossy codec ogg mp3 and jpeg among others are all lossy and you re recoding the data when saving then yes there will over time or rather with repeated recoding be a loss in quality

184798
free	malloc
the new and delete operators can operate on classes and structures whereas malloc and free only work with blocks of memory that need to be cast

184905
stdout	stderr
tee for recording a stdout stderr of a single command

185052
expression-blend	silverlight
i want to set ie as my default browser for running silverlight applications from expression-blend but i don t want to change my windows default from mozilla

185076
outputstream	inputstream
randomaccessfile despite its name is more like an inputstream and outputstream and less like a file

185082
stdout	stderr
i would like to be able to spawn a linux process that would only have access to stdin stdout and stderr nothing more and nothing less

185180
post	get
i also have a navigation rule in foo.page.xml that redirects back to a nice bookmark-friendly get after a successful post

185180
post	get
the problem is when a validation error occurs at which point the navigation rules get skipped and i end up at foo after the post

185365
ssl	https
to determine whether it s an https request or an ssh request you need to try to read some data with a small timeout this is because tls ssl handshakes start with the client sending some data whereas the ssh handshake starts with the server sending some data

185377
accessor	properties
next thing is to move all your mapping logic inside the class ideally inside the properties accessor

185415
width	height
the only way to do it as one of the poster already mentioned is to set width and height when you open new popup by window.open - window.open test width 800 height 800

185463
portrait	landscape
i have a view that supports landscape and portrait viewing with the controls all moving around when you switch from one to the other

185463
portrait	landscape
edit just to clarify my landscape and portrait views look different i don t want a straight transform i actually display the data differently in landscape mode

185518
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

185518
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a number of weeks

185518
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

185518
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a number of weeks

185518
subtract	add
incmonth - add a or subtract a number of months

185518
subtract	add
incyear - add a or subtract a number of years

185536
post	get
this post had some discussion on it and described this order as the painter s algorithm but ultimately the example they gave simply rendered the objects in reverse order to get the desired effect

185573
getter	setter
i couldn t really find this in rails documentation but it seems like mattr_accessor is the module corollary for attr_accessor getter setter in a normal ruby class

185624
inline	inlining
i fixed that by making the function inline but i m afraid that this is a fragile solution because as far as i know the compiler doesn t guarantee inlining even when you specify the inline keyword

185631
apache	lighttpd
running lighttpd behind apache to serve static files certainly seems braindead to me

185631
apache	lighttpd
apache still has to unpack the http packets and parse the request through its parse tree send proxy requests and then lighttpd has to re-unpack hit the filesystem and send the files back through apache

185631
apache	nginx
what you will see is people using a lightweight webserver like nginx as a frontend server to serve static files and proxy dynamic urls to apache

185631
apache	lighttpd
i probably could come up with a nightmare configuration for apache that would make it actually slower serving static files than proxying those requests to a backend lighttpd but it would involve enabling expensive features like .htaccess in apache that are disabled in lighttpd so it wouldn t really be fair

185632
getter	setter
as ruby s attr_accessor generates getter setter methods for instances cattr mattr_accessor provide getter setter methods at the class or module level

185640
inline	inlining
inlining means that executable code instructions is inline into the calling function s code

185642
public	protected
thus you can call any public protected instance method on templatecontrol

185652
width	height
i have a uiimageview and the objective is to scale it down proportionally by giving it either a height or width

185662
haskell	scheme
i ve also read that scheme or haskell could be better languages to achieve this task

185673
put	get
i could use webdav or http to get put data to a server but it makes the application more complicated

185693
rapidsvn	smartsvn	rapidsvn	tortoisesvn	smartsvn	tortoisesvn
i just verified that both smartsvn and rapidsvn mentioned previously require administrator access to insatll on windows just like tortoisesvn

185702
swt	swing
this is true for windows swing swt gtk and probably others

185740
put	get
i can see how one could argue that the robot is in the abstract just a data repository -- put left turn put travel 100 meters get outside temperature

185770
spaces	linefeed	getter	setter
using indexof to support getelementsbyclassname in ie can really make a difference because there are no faster alternatives and the classname property s underlying getter setter conveniently replace tabs and linefeed with spaces

185825
public	protected
in flex and many other languages a function method of a class can be declared private or protected or public

185829
public	protected
thus visibility increases as you go from private to protected to public

185829
public	protected
in c++ you can control how the visibility of members should be inherited to the descendants by prepending the base class name with the private protected or public keywords meaning you want the visibility of the base class members to be at most at that level

185829
public	protected
in each of the cases above the descendant classes are of course able to introduce their own private protected and public members

185848
int	chars
note matt curtis points out that c++ allows the simplification of the above if the static member variable is of const int type int bool chars

185862
mp3	wav
read and play wav s and or mp3 s

185864
put	get
you have to have a line int foo i some where in your code to tell the compiler where to put it otherwise you get a link error

185926
oql	jhat
jhat can execute oql these days as well bottom link execute oql

185954
nsoperation	nsautoreleasepool
yes you need to create an nsautoreleasepool in your method unless you are creating a concurrent slightly unfortunate nomenclature nsoperation subclass and your overridden method creates the nsautoreleasepool before calling nsoperation main

185993
mvp	presenter
is there good example code or a test project for explaining the modelâ viewâ presenter mvp pattern

186008
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

186035
slideup	slidedown
when a h3 is clicked the div directly below after is revealed with jquery s slidedown function while all other divs are hidden with the slideup function

186098
filesystems	hfs+
on macos the default filesystems is hfs+ which does not support sparse files

186107
vb.net	vb6	vb6	powerbuilder
easily add email support to your visual basic 6 vb6 asp asp.net vb.net c++ c# foxpro access powerbuilder or delphi application

186109
vim	emacs
many decent text editors have the option as well vim emacs editplus and so on

186265
vmware	virtualbox
first both virtualbox and vmware server are great products and since both are free each is worth evaluating

186279
inherited	properties
adding a properties to the prototype of a function object will make it available to the constructed object as well as to all of the objects which inherited from it

186294
testlink	mantis	testlink	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
you could use combination of a bug tracker jira mantis bugzilla and test case management tool like testlink

186297
vmware	virtualbox
just like vmware gives support for vmware server sun gives support for virtualbox

186313
draggable	droppable
once it is put in there it gets replaced with a new div which is both draggable because you can junk it by moving it back to the palette and droppable because you can add ingredients to it

186376
for-loop	arrays
in some cases though the compiler will replace foreach with a for-loop i believe when iterating over arrays

186378
postgresql	mysql
is your application meant to be portable are you planning to migrate it to mysql postgresql whatever

186455
terminate	timeout
when the timeout event occurs you can terminate the thread that does the actual processing clean up and end the process

186473
put	get
assuming the request goes through jquery put a debug statement in the jquery source get function that kicks in if the url is

186478
post	get
below post was because i was an idiot who didn t read the question properly but will get the dates in a week starting from monday given the date not the week number

186521
public	protected
also keep in mind that what you need to test is the public api of an object not it s protected private methods

186521
public	protected
so as long as the public methods fulfill tests the protected methods will be covered too

186528
min	max
then just scan the array once putting each element in its calculated position updating the min and max and checking for clashes

186574
isapi	httpmodule
ii6 uses what iis7 calls the classic pipeline where a httpmodule can only get involved once the earlier isapi based pipeline determines that the script mapping requires the request to handed over to asp.net

186595
rpm	yum
the same goes for linux if you use the yum rpm installers

186599
post	get
also it usually helps get an idea of what is expected by visualising even if in block form or via post it notes what you want to see as to what it is you are indeed coding

186619
prng	random
i have a pseudo random number generator prng class that i want to unit test

186633
pop-up	dialog
i actually want the pageload to be triggered everytime the modal dialog pop-up

186641
vb6	vba
there s something about vb6 vba that makes them feel unnatural to me

186645
perforce	svn
obviously given the source you have to realise that it stresses the advantages of perforce over svn but it is still a useful read

186645
perforce	svn
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

186668
firefox	safari
no matter if you use safari or firefox or possibly another browser it is standard or mac that browsers search their plugins in that folder

186687
emacs	textmate
i ve found it extremely easy to use and there are tips for integrating it with vi m emacs and even textmate if you use that

186690
googletest	cppunit
then assuming you are using an xunit-style test library cppunit googletest unittest++ or whatever you can add various testxxx functions to a single class to test out associated groups of functionality

186788
put	get
if all you want to do is put a bullet point on your resume to get past the agents just add it that will get you past the agents and give you a chance to get your foot in the door

186819
versioning	upgrade
when you add references using visual studio you will get a assembly reference with both versioning number and public key and this can give you some trouble when you upgrade a vendor assembly to a newer version. br

186842
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are still addressed as they are under ipv4

186845
icmp	dhcp
the only thing that changed between the two versions is the addressing scheme dhcp dhcpv6 and icmp icmpv6

186845
udp	tcp
so basically anything tcp udp related including the port range 0-65535 remains unchanged

186846
udp	tcp
i m pretty certain that ports only have a part in tcp and udp

186850
udp	tcp
the tcp and udp layer is the same structure

186850
udp	tcp
ipv6 as the name implies is about the ip layer being enhanced not the tcp or udp layers

186868
awt	swing
as you already require java 1.4 you should consider some small changes to take into use swing gui instead it solved our applet refresh issues with awt

186871
content-disposition	content-type
use a content-disposition attachment header but stick with the correct content-type

186973
profiler	aqtime
also if you have access to a profiler such as aqtime or similar then running your code through it might give you some hints

186990
configobj	configparser
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

186990
config	ini
configobj is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer an ini file round tripper

187021
visualvm	jrockit	profiler	visualvm
i don t have experience with visualvm -- but jrockit s profiler does provide this information

187032
ssl	https
the only impact on your php would be in the self-facing links you re publishing which you d want to switch from to there s a _server https variable you could use to trigger this change if you ll be accepting both ssl and non-ssl connections

187052
range	max	range	min	min	max
the date data type is based on the double data type with range checking min max date values plus a considered epoch

187052
int	double
the precision for double precision floating point where one day 1 int is effectively nine decimal places

187061
super	extends
all the compiler knows about t is its bounds which it probably doesn t have other than explicitly extends object and a super of the null type

187169
installation	upgrade
usually in regards to installation customization upgrade paths etc

187178
rss	feed
i ll just add that if you re worried about any performance impact associated with fetching the rss feed you can enter a non-existent url such as that will fail quickly and reduce the amount of content needing to be rendered

187185
put	get
then you can just put and get whichever files you like betwen the current directory on the linux box and your windows server

187228
children	parent
whenever you try to set a children to different parent sl fails with an argument exception same when you reuse a resource that is not a style

187279
google-chrome	firefox
this renders fine in firefox and google-chrome

187305
sqldatasource	formview
the rows from the sqldatasource display fine in the formview and i can edit them

187391
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i have logged on to the build server with remote desktop using the same user account that cruisecontrol.net runs under and run mbunit manually and the tests pass

187594
wordpress	joomla
by the way the code i ve been looking at is from the joomla 1.5 core and several wordpress plugins so i assume they are people who know what they re doing

187628
config	ini
the standard python config files look like ini files with and key value or pairs

187655
post	get
including get post request urls cookies etc

187713
fixed-point	fractions	integer	fractions
edit for clarification fixed-point values have two parts to them an integer part and a fractions part

187713
integer	unsigned
the integer part can be represented by a signed or unsigned integer data type

187713
integer	fractions	integer	unsigned
the fractions part is represented by an unsigned data integer data type

187713
fixed-point	fractions	integer	fractions	integer	unsigned
if a 8-bit unsigned integer were to be used for fixed-point math then the fractions part would be split into 256 evenly divisible parts

187717
ssl	https
https http over ssl sends all http content over a ssl tunel so http content and headers are encrypted as well

187795
hide	show
my page actually looks like this where query advancedsearchfields is basically including a flex form into the page and i want it to show hide the custom view below after the search is complete

187823
integer	fractions
a cast from float to integer will throw away the fractions portion so if you want to keep that fractions around as fixed point then you just multiply the float before casting it

187917
put	get
if you have permission to read but not write a file the buffer you get when you visit the file c-x c-f or find-file will be put in read-only mode automatically

187946
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
you can see it in action at works in ie firefox safari opera

188046
min	max
getprefferedsize used to return the same object that you gave with setpreferredsize everything also goes for min max size so what we would do is call setprefferedsize on every scaling component with a particular subclass of java.awt.dimension then we would walk the component hierarchy and update each scaling component whenever the resolution changed

188086
width	height
if so i got this awhile ago just type resize and use the arrow keys to adjust width and height

188108
hmac	md5
hmac makes use of some sort of one-way hashing function like md5 or sha-1 to encrypt the secret along with a message

188108
hash	hmac
when the digest is sent along with the message the receiver our server can re-generate the hash with the same hmac calculation and compare the locally generated digest with the digest that came along with the message

188116
profiler	visualvm
you can also use heapwalker from the netbeans profiler or the visualvm stand-alone tool

188116
visualvm	jhat
visualvm is a good alternative to jhat as it is stand alone but is much easier to use than jhat

188208
stdout	stderr
there seem to be two bash idioms for redirecting stdout and stderr to a file

188227
vbscript	vb6
it was nice for vb6 vbscript which were loosely typed but .net is strongly typed making the warts well wart-ugly

188230
stdout	stderr
might be useful for cases where you aren t redirecting stdout to somewhere else but rather you just want stderr to be sent to the same place such as the console as stdout perhaps if the command you are running is already sending stderr somewhere else other than the console

188236
button	checkbox
click those 2 checkbox hit the get button on that dialog

188242
postgresql	mysql
i can understand why not all data types would be supported from mysql oracle postgresql and so forth

188278
stdout	stderr
where sends both stdout and stderr to wherever 2 1 sends stderr to where stdout is currently going at that point in the command line

188278
stdout	stderr
where the former is redirecting both stdout and stderr to file the latter redirects stderr to where stdout is going before it is redirected to the file in this case probably the terminal. this is useful if you wanted to do something like

188278
stdout	stderr
where you want to use less to page through the output of stderr and store the output of stdout to a file

188320
stdout	stderr
so with you can write something like and get stdout and stderr output appended to the log file

188405
wordpress	joomla
i think joomla and wordpress are not the greatest examples of good php code with no offense

188405
wordpress	joomla
so it s by no means good code but wordpress and joomla both excel on the frontend - pretty easy to use people get a website and can do stuff

188526
cpu	hyperthreading
be cautious that hyperthreading cpus appear identical to multicore d cpu s yet the performance characteristics are very different

188541
hash	salt
alternate step 3 is app submits info from step 2 and server sends back a hash signature of the info + salt

188553
processors	hyperthreading
environment.processorcount will also include any hyperthreading processors

188553
processors	hyperthreading
there is no way at least up through windows 2003 to distinguish a hyperthreading processors from one with two cores

188563
jlist	jtable
i believe you need to replace the jlist with a single column jtable

188588
profiler	visualvm
if you update to java 1.6u7 or better you ll get access to the visualvm tool that is essentially the same as the netbeans profiler

188595
unsigned	short	int	chars
assume you only want functions of the signature unsigned short id_for_allowed_functions int x chars y

188708
jquery	jqmodal	jquery	simplemodal	jqmodal	simplemodal
a couple i found for jquery are jqmodal and simplemodal

188712
implements	sealed
you are implements idisposable in a class which isn t sealed

188734
jquery	jqmodal
i ve had good results using jqmodal a plugin for the jquery framework that lets you define modal dialogs but it s by no means the only option

188770
translation	localization
rick strahl has a good explanation and example code for a database-driven localization provider here - there s a nice built in localization editor too with interface to google translation and babelfish

188831
direct3d	directx
this is because system.drawing.bitmap is a gdi+ bitmap while classes like bitmapimage in system.windows.media.imaging are direct3d directx

188843
put	get
so much can get done quickly when you put the right people in a room and hammer out things on a whiteboard

188845
ant	maven	awt	swing
this ability or the lack of it is built into the various testrunners console awt swing ant maven or the one built into eclipse etc

188882
boost	stl
thus you ll have to write this this way using stl or even boost

188896
put	get
this happened with the previous version of perl 5.8 and windows 2003 and iis 5. anyway basically i put in a carp or a warn and i get an error message and then some garbage text

188917
firefox	safari
now it s also supported in firefox 3 and safari i m not sure which version but at least 3.1 and highter but not the iphone

189003
websphere	ibm
we are using ibm websphere transformation extender which has lots of other problems too and the mapping tool of biztalk is a joke in comparison to wtx

189004
haskell	ocaml
as a trivial example compare quicksort implementations in java and ocaml or better still haskell on this page

189071
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
each comparer has a case-sensitive as well as a case-insensitive version

189154
getter	setter
he also advocates not using the else keyword nor any getter or setter but i think that s a bit overboard

189162
inline	inlining
declaring it inline makes it a candidate for inlining it does not mean a lot nowadays in c++ as the compiler will inline or not sometimes ignoring the fact the keyword inline is present or absent

189228
put	get
however it starts to get messy when you have two put methods because although the method returns void you seemingly have to cast it to a strongly typed delegate to end the invocation

189236
extjs	sproutcore
consider technologies like sproutcore gwt or extjs which put the layouting code fully on the client making the server responsible only for data marshalling and processing and easily replaced

189252
disk	ram
i ve got a dell xps m1330 with a 2.2ghz processor 4gig ram geforce 8400m and a 64gb ssd disk

189261
teamcity	ncover
i think the best we can hope for is to break open the nunit jar file that comes with teamcity and writing a custom task that integrates nunit2 and ncover

189294
disk	ram
skipped vista x64 and moved straight to win2k8 with 8gb ram and a handful of disk

189399
prepare	execute
prepare execute it for each value and union the results client-side

189399
prepare	execute
prepare and execute it

189410
width	height
imagecreatefromstring to read an image in from a stream but i m not sure whether you can get the size of the resulting object as required by s3- inputresource above - getimagesize returns the height width etc but not the size of the image resource

189457
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari if the browser is not able to connect to a local area network lan or a router it is offline

189486
hide	show
you may want to set up a global ajax event to show hide the loading icon

189509
filesystems	fat
on windows the .emacs file may be called _emacs for backward compatibility with dos and fat filesystems where filenames could not start with a dot

189578
firefox	safari
safari nightlies and is already supported in firefox 3

189584
gentoo	linux
well back in 2005 i used gentoo linux and i used a lot a small program called genlop to show me the history of what i ve emerged installed on my gentoo box

189634
inherited	properties
otherwise if the properties is inherited use the value of the parent

189661
opera	safari
gizmo s comment states that safari and opera support

189668
ubuntu	debian
i also suggest you reading the section emacs startup strategy in usr share doc emacsen-common debian-emacs-policy.gz for more ubuntu debian specific information

189679
trac	bugzilla
it has excellent support for both bugzilla and trac

189712
versioning	upgrade
my home basic laptop came with a cd that had all the necessary stuff for upgrading to a different versioning of windows i upgrade to linux

189713
getter	setter
upon being forced to write unit tests for anemic domain objects that are nothing but bags of getter and setter which i was forced to write as well

189778
inherited	properties
another properties that comes with a sense of ownership in a mutex is the ability to support priority inherited

189778
vxworks	rtos
if you refer to classic vxworks rtos kernel they define three mechanisms

189817
persistent	transient
specifically i m looking for a framework that support dynamic distribution across the grid cloud but replaces the transient agent with a more persistent service

189835
pull	push
in your example you could simply pull merge your change into the integration upstream repository and push it directly up to the remote server

189853
min	max
assume i need to do all sorts of funky queries min max group etc. with the datasets as describe from above would it be slow or not to the point that it makes better sense to have multiple database strategy eg

189854
hide	show
then you could use that code to show or hide a textbox to display a message

189888
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
setup up server combination of your choice apache lighttpd nginx thin etc.

189918
inherited	properties
also keep in mind that most components buttons labels etc will inherited many properties fonts colors etc from their parent

189993
ssl	https
when i use apachebench to test https the error is returned ssl handshake failed

190059
allocator	stl
my idea is to maybe use a different new operator say mynew and custom allocator for all my stl types

190059
allocator	stl
then when linking in from a parent project require them to thunk mynew to new and my stl allocator to the standard one or one of their choosing

190108
post	get
and when you process the form the action is the same w the table and id being passed thru the url so it get s the id and table that way and for lname fname and email it should grab it via post

190112
int	boolean
for primitive types arguments int boolean float ... or string every combinations of limit values for a string xxx null

190135
versioning	upgrade
but now with new upgrade versioning we need to support the import facility from the last versioning s db

190149
prng	random
on a computer your options are pretty limited to pseudo random number generators prngs and given your constraint that they never repeat then a prng is your best option - real random data will occasionally duplicate a number

190172
integer	fractions
define the complexity as the total number of symbols a unit to the power of 1 has complexity 1 any other integer power is 2 a fractions power is 3

190198
hash	md5
i am trying to generate equivalent md5 hash in both javascript and .net

190198
hash	salt
i will add in salt later but at the moment i can t get the .net version to match up with the web site s hash

190198
hash	md5
i m guessing it is an encoding problem but i ve tried about 8 different variations of methods for calculating an md5 hash in .net and none of them match what i have obtained in javascript or from the web site

190205
google-chrome	firefox
checked this in google-chrome ie7 and firefox 3.0.3

190245
inline	inlining
but mainly it is controlled by the inline keyword and compiler switches for example you can have it auto inline small functions even without the keyword. its important to note that debug compilations should never be inlining as the callstack will not be preserved to mirror the calls you created in code

190282
x86	64bit
websphere mq 7 for windows supports x86 and x64 but not itanium 64bit

190316
yacc	bison
you can apply compiler theory here and generate your scanner and parser using flex bison lex yacc or whatever tools

190434
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

190434
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a number of weeks

190434
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

190434
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a number of weeks

190434
subtract	add
incmonth - add a or subtract a number of months

190434
subtract	add
incyear - add a or subtract a number of years

190447
fast-forward	merge
git svn rebase this makes the next step a fast-forward merge see aaron s comments below

190470
hash	md5
jeffrey richter documents an almost identical case in clr via c#. when a hash does need to be stored i d prefer it to be calculated in a way which is always guaranteed to be stable - md5 or a custom interface implemented by your types with a guarantee of stability

190485
serializable	deserialization
so for instance deserialization of hash structures need to recalculate hash codes and these values should not be stored in the serializable form

190493
hide	show
also with my old 1.x firmware way it required me to capture touch events and hide show the control myself

190495
hash	salt
server then performs the same check your db should store hash passwords but this method prevents you from effectively using a salt for that hash since you d have to broadcast this

190504
post	get
i was able to get this working but came across the following issues and i m going to post the solutions to hopefully help others in the future

190506
inherited	properties
to revert a properties on a descendant form to the ancestor form s value right click on the properties in the object inspector and choose revert to inherited

190506
inherited	properties
to revert all properties values of a component to the ancestor s values right click the component and choose revert to inherited

190514
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
for growing arrays malloc realloc free is the way to go in c and std vector or any other generic stl container is the way to go in c++

190561
jobs	cron
php running scheduled jobs cron jobs

190592
int	chars
your code won t handle letters occuring 255 times or 127 if chars happens to be signed. making charcounts an array of int probably won t impact performance much at all

190593
put	get
i ve put the findcontrol instruction in the page load method after the code which creates them but get an error

190622
apache	nginx
actually there is a possible approach- if you just want to run asp.net programs with ssl you can use cassini + apache proxy nginx for windows

190686
bazaar	git
perhaps you d benefit from switching to a distributed version control system like git or bazaar

190694
bazaar	svn
commands in bazaar are very similar as in svn plus additional excellent functionalities eg

190694
bazaar	svn
bazaar has basic support for importing svn repo with full history supports pluggable modules and tortoisebzr is in the works

190701
put	get
update 2 i put the formula for two mutually exclusive events above instead of 2 independent ones as getting an a the first time doesn t mean you can t get an a the second time

190744
memcpy	strcpy
it somehow feels to me you should strcpy instead of memcpy

190750
strcpy	strncpy
the obvious fix is to use strcpy or strncpy

190831
post	get
so better use post and not get transfer mechanics

190835
post	get
you also get them into the viewstate object graph in their correct position which is invaluable for dealing with post backs and especially server-side validation

190843
post	get
it would take work to unpack this and turn the request in to a http get request using query strings rather than a post with the data in form parameters

190877
folder	directory
iis 5.1 does not run php properly under root directory but fine in all other folder

190912
gentoo	linux
i ve run into a problem where i m getting two printouts of my etc motd file on gentoo linux

190913
subclass	abstract-class
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

190966
put	get
if you have the resources as the question implies you do you get the users to supply copy and designs in what they do know powerpoint word fireworks etc and get the people who can do a correct implementation but who might not be able to write decent prose etc to put it into the html cms magicthing

191017
firefox	safari
i tested firefox 3.0.3 and safari 3.1.2.

191062
pylons	turbogears	pylons	cherrypy	turbogears	cherrypy
the three i ve heard of are cherrypy turbogears and pylons

191069
postgresql	mysql
engine works with mysql postgresql

191100
put	get
you could start your onchange method with you may have to modify this for your language of choice you ll probably get a flicker but it should put it back quickly enough

191109
ant	cruisecontrol
i m currently using cruisecontrol integrated with ant to control project builds

191209
copying	overwrite
by default copying from the command prompt will prompt you to overwrite files that already exist in the target location

191228
public	protected
although for some reason the setlineedit function is protected on qabstractspinbox but public on qlineedit

191242
ssms	sqlcmd
i ask because sometimes ssms is a little heavy weight when i just want to look through the database and find one record and sqlcmd doesn t really seem like a good choice when browsing through a lot of different records or a lot of large records

191417
vb.net	vb6
how to switch from vb6 to vb.net

191425
nant	cruisecontrol
as for tool recommendations i ve used finalbuilder visual build pro msbuild team build nant cruisecontrol and cifactory plus and good old fashioned batch files

191465
cpu	processors
on my dev machine i use a quad core cpu and although our project has more than 1200 files it is still easily processors limited during compile time although a faster hard drive would still help speed things up

191498
min	max
also try your method to get a random id between min id and max id and then

191536
rss	feed
this public weather.com rss feed is a good example of what we d be parsing our actual weather.com feed contains additional information because of a partnership w them

191601
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in opera the event target for window.onload and body onload and even window.addeventlistener load func false will be the window instead of the document like in safari and firefox

191616
cvs	svn
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq

191656
isnull	nvl
you can do the isnull or nvl stuff but it s just going to make the engine do more work

191763
post	get
nobody could ever prove so far that multiple inheritance has any advantage over other techniques you mentioned in your post using interfaces and delegates i can get exactly the same result without much code or overhead while it has a couple of well known disadvantages diamond problem being the most annoying ones

191777
client-side	server-side
html_quickform can be configured to have client-side or server-side validation or both

191824
versioning	upgrade
a lot of companies are ignoring windows vista and are planning to upgrade to the next windows versioning when it comes out in the hopes that it will suck less than windows vista

191838
rss	feed
some kind of small sensor maybe a temperature sensor for his dorm room that served up the results as an rss feed

191909
implements	extends
one thing that results from that is that i cannot ever add to an interface once i have released it because it would break compilation for anyone implements it -- the only option is to extends the interface

191929
public	protected
public private protected virtual abstract override new static internal sealed and any others i m forgetting

191935
accessor	properties
if you follow what is now considered to be best practice you should release outlet properties because you should have retained them in the set accessor

191942
modifiers	sealed
i usually start off with the access modifiers first then virtual abstract sealed then override new etc

192006
msisdn	sms
of course if you want to implement a protocol-specific extension for your required protocols you would have to develop the whole stack - request object response object a mechanism of identifying sessions for example using the msisdn in an sms instead of cookies a templating and rendering framework equivalent of jsp - and then build an mvc framework on top of it

192122
spweb	spsite
i am opening up a spsite and then trying to open up a spweb under that spsite

192156
coalesce	isnull
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

192170
keydown	keyup
if you need shortcuts that won t be available on the menus then you ll have to handle that your self via the keyup or keydown events either on the form or the control

192179
public	protected
the main difference between traits and default interface implementations which java now has is that traits can contain private or protected methods unlike traditional interface methods that must be public

192187
mp3	wav
this lets me pipe the output of the mp3 decoder directly into the video decoder instead of having to first decode the entire mp3 into a wav file on disk

192188
profiling	debugging
i ask only because using the zend debugger with zendstudio has proven to be much easier fewer steps to start stop debugging from the browser but i really like some of the profiling tools available that only work with xdebug

192220
children	parent
assume further you only have basic data structures arrays and hashmaps no fancy objects with parent children references no orm no framework just your two hands

192230
postgresql	mysql
most fortune 500 companies now use mysql or postgresql or another open source rdbms somewhere in their organization even if they also use one of the commercial closed-source rdbms brands

192230
postgresql	mysql
i realize that both mysql and postgresql were available as early as 1995 but i would argue that they weren t mainstream for several years after that

192396
public	protected
if you look at c++ for each class you specify after the colon in the class declaration the kind of inheritance you get is determined by the access modifier private protected or public

192416
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox also supports ntlm as does opera and google-chrome

192462
children	parent
re comment from e-satis about immediate children or immediate parent

192486
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
by implementing certain interfaces idataerrorinfo inotifypropertychanged ieditableobject etc. your presenter can make the ui that much simpler with less code

192489
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
nunit is supported by default in cruisecontrol.net and you have to do a little extra work to get mbunit to work in cruisecontrol.net

192489
mbunit	nunit
testdriven.net allows you to right click and run tests in the ide and it supports mbunit and nunit and others

192584
post	put
i am working within winforms and thanks to some helpful blog post put together a pretty nice solution which i wanted to share

192608
sorting	filtering
i m looking to utilize jquery to handle a few very common requests we get for data tables of varying sizes scrolling sorting and dynamic filtering

192621
war	manifest.mf	jar	manifest.mf	jar	war
finally in each of your projects there should be a meta-inf manifest.mf file that just has the name of the jars that jar war depends on

192633
rss	feed
but for parsing rss feed i d recommend universal feed parser which can also parse atom

192656
cpu	processors
it turns out that in most versions of the 386 and later there actually was a cpu id but it was only visible at one specific time right after the processors was reset in the edx register

192672
solaris	bsd
anecdotes i have heard say that the solaris and bsd virtual memory systems may show better performance improvements than the vm system of linux--but i have no empirical data to back this up

192677
inherited	properties
applicationsettingsbase inherited from settingsbase neither of which expose a default properties

192806
keydown	keyup
this will allow all keypress events to get filtered by the keypress keydown and keyup events at the form level which will allow a single keyboard shortcut to be handled in one location instead of duplicating the functionality in all user controls

192852
getter	setter
in this case there is the possibility that your setter getter may inadvertently make direct or indirect assumptions about the state of the object

192870
lisp	scheme
some other language interpreters do that too i m thinking of lisp and scheme implementations mostly

192870
serializable	deserialization
i think this would be very hard to do for a random program but if you wrote a framework where all objects supported serializable deserialization you can then serializable all objects used by your program and then ship that elsewhere and deserialise them at the other end

192872
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
also you may want to consider modifying an existing class that s already inside media print or building up the new css using something other than innerhtml which i ll admit smells awful to me but seems to work in opera 9.6 safari for windows 3.1.2 ie 6 and firefox 2.0.0.17 i didn t test any other browsers

192885
width	height
if i set the anchor property to opposing ends say left and right when the designer file gets compiled it sets the width height of the control to the width height of the container

192888
hide	show
i have some nested tables that i want to hide show upon a click on one of the top-level rows

192950
min	max
if you want distinct values from only two fields plus return other fields with them then the other fields must have some kind of aggregation on them sum min max etc. and the two columns you want distinct must appear in the group by clause

193015
filesystems	hfs+
there seems to be some confusion as to whether the default mac os x filesystems hfs+ supports holes in files

193025
nfa	dfa
the regular expressions are converted into a single non deterministic automata nfa and possibily transformed in a deterministic automata dfa

193063
for-loop	loops
there is the switch nested inside loops for-loop unwinding known as the duff device

193090
ienumerable	iqueryable
for the linq functionality that ships with the 3.5 framework those methods are implemented as extension methods on either ienumerable or iqueryable there s also a bunch of methods that work on data sets too

193101
ubuntu	debian
you ll effectively have to do rpm for fedora debs for ubuntu and debian etc

193124
rss	feed
i have an aspx page that creates an xmldocument object from sql data and then transforms it into another xml document rss feed using an xslt file with xpathnavigator and xslcompiledtransform

193173
next	except
this is all great except now i ve just discovered that if i hand a paragraph of text to abcpdf at the bottom of the column such that it needs to chain to the top of the next abcpdf thinks the top of the new column is the start of a new paragraph and applies the indent there as well

193194
put	get
seriously though you get back what you put in

193198
ostringstream	std
the std ostringstream is a good method but sometimes this additional trick might get handy transforming the formatting to a one-liner

193248
mvp	presenter
i m in agreement with chills42--the goal of mvp is not to make the presenter so generic that it could be used with any ui technology

193249
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
it could add subtract multiplying and divide

193271
cvs	svn
diff has the --ignore-space-change or -b option and i would like to have essentially the same feature available in cvs or svn

193282
put	get
note that this is all hidden away in a private framework so don t try to put this in code you submit to the app store and be prepared for some hackery to get it to work

193292
haskell	ocaml	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml
as i ve already got ruby lisp haskell and erlang under my belt i m interested specifically in what kiss-violating features i should look out for in ocaml

193293
exif	xmp
given a filename i need to be able to access certain metadata in an image for a closed source project i m currently developing without regard to how the metadata is stored that is exif iptc or xmp

193299
config	ini
another option is apache commons config also has a class for loading from ini files

193382
erlang	scheme
try it in scheme or ruby or erlang as well

193398
integer	unsigned
the language i am working with is limited to 64-bit unsigned integer length maximum integer size of 18446744073709551615

193416
multiplying	add
i ve edited my binary multiplying example to show a pattern for each 1-bit in the bottom number add the top number bit-shifted left the position of the 1-bit times to a variable

193420
bash	zsh
i ve been combining putty cygwin screen and zsh not bash lately

193432
decoder	encoder
for png you can use pypng module - lightweight pure-python png decoder encoder

193570
folder	directory
and you can ignore the argument about deleting a single directory to uninstall your program - windows vista won t let you modify files in the program files directory so your config will need to go in a different folder anyway

193626
octal	hex
once upon a long time ago 1987 or so i wrote a program odx octal dump in hex - weird that i continue to use - it gives me a hex dump 16 bytes per line plus an image of the printable characters

193633
maya	3dsmax
maya 3dsmax lightwave so you can export and import your models very easily

193713
getter	setter
idioms aren t just naming for example python has a good deal of magic you can use with getter and setter to make object properties act magical

193730
firefox	safari
it was behaving properly in firefox but not safari

193770
mouse	keyboard
...you could jump through these errors using usual keyboard shortcuts mouse clicks you use for compilation error analysis...

193806
nhibernate	llblgenpro
there are several other linq to x implementations around including linq to nhibernate and linq to llblgenpro that offer or mapping and supporting frameworks in a broadly similar fashion to the entity framework

193835
nemerle	boo
i m looking to move some of my lighter weight metaprogramming from nemerle to boo and i m trying to figure out how to define custom operators

193873
inject	interceptor
cache is inject to my interceptor via constructor injection

193880
accessor	properties
the same principles apply whether you use declared properties or write accessor yourself

193922
srp	principles
moreover each object is srp single responsibility principles

193937
lxml	elementtree
see lxml elementtree import example

193941
nemerle	boo
the primary two languages i ve been working with are boo and nemerle but i ve also played around with f#

194001
folder	directory
for asp.net apps i ve often seen them placed on a separate disk from the application under a folder structure that mimics the virtual directory structure

194068
lisp	smalltalk
and when were at the lisp land try to replace lisp with smalltalk

194083
jobs	cron
if you want to avoid setting up cron jobs and whatnot though i d suggest it s a better method the solution you ve provided is pretty good

194112
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button see whether and for html elements you ll need to loop over the select.options array and check for each option whether

194120
arp	dhcp
as for the dhcp problem if the other computer is on the same subnet you can look it up by mac address using net arp

194130
ant	maven
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

194130
m2e	pom.xml
it is also well integrated both with netbeans and eclipse m2e plugin so the ide honors whatever settings including dependencies you declare in the pom.xml file

194180
collabnet	svn
you can use the stock collabnet svn installer and configure apache to your liking that way

194184
boost	stl
using precompiled headers this is quite useful for stl and boost

194191
x86	64bit
note however that the programfiles x86 environment variable is only available if your application is running 64bit

194197
lxml	elementtree
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194206
hash	md5
one thing about distributing the filenames into different directories if you consider splitting your md5 filenames into different subdirectories which is generally a good idea i would suggest keeping the complete hash as filename and duplicate the first few chars as directory names

194262
hide	show
then capture each subclasses type and show or hide a different loader graphic

194305
int	chars
this version allows any non-digit chars to delimit int if you only want dots to be allowed you can modify the inner loop to skip only dots and then check for a digit

194347
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
supports ie 6+ firefox 2+ safari 3+ and presumably opera but i did not test

194351
daemons	launchd
you launchd a daemons monitoring on the remote machine see the security parapraph

194363
post	get
if thanks.jsp is requested via a post request - redirect so it you present the page as the response to a get request

194364
jython	pypy
unfortunately jython python in java and pypy do not support this very useful raii idiom and it breaks a lot of legacy python code

194402
ant	maven
given that maven s advantages are not too much compared to ant

194402
ant	maven
then again if you want some of maven s features ant folks have ivy for the dependencies feature

194432
free	malloc
assuming that you allocated the memory dynamically using malloc or another memory allocator you free it using free

194444
free	malloc
when it s about runtime memory allocation you can use your trusty malloc and free

194489
xstream	xom
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom

194490
innodb	myisam
the second argument against eav i have heard is that it requires table joins that get into low double digits but it was commented that using innodb over myisam improved the performance some or it could be vice-versa but i can t remember totally

194526
subnet	packets
i thought this might be a implementation detail for udp the packets are hopping over my computer in the subnet but wikipedia ing udp didn t enlighten me any more and i don t see why my computer should be forwarding these packets in the first place

194575
packets	multicast
the packets addressed to ips starting with 239 and 224 are multicast packets

194633
vmware	virtualbox
install something like virtualbox virtualpc or vmware to run linux in a virtual environment

194633
ubuntu	linux
virtualization or a live cd version of linux such as the ubuntu live cd is a fantastic way to get used to linux without having to throw out the safety blanket of windows right away

194636
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos	opensuse	centos
if you re not happy with say ubuntu you can just nuke it and install something else say opensuse centos or fedora

194636
ubuntu	linux
it s so popular that you often get better results in google by replacing linux with ubuntu

194646
hide	show
doing this makes it so your custom overlay will show and hide with the normal overlays as they are now one in the same

194656
getter	setter
i generally go with constructor destructor first then important methods followed by getter and setter and eventually misc

194681
opera	google-chrome
tested and working in ff3 opera 9 ie6 and google-chrome

194759
post	get
but there doesn t seem to be a way to get the raw form post ed data without using binaryread and if i do that then i screw myself out of using the request.form collection later on

194777
httphandler	httpmodule
i would recommend implementing and httphandler or an httpmodule for this type of scenario

194777
post	get
you can get to the post data from the page_load event but implementing this logging facility here is not as maintainable

194820
opera	safari
you can embed svg files with and in cutting-edge browsers opera safari also and css background-image

194844
gif	png
create a png pnm pseudo gif svg

194872
webkit	gecko
there is no cross-browser way to do this as you said especially with the red text outline but the webkit and gecko teams are implementing some cool css things like gradients embossing with experimental css properties

194880
opera	safari
you could also use svg + css background-image in opera 9.5 and safari

194889
int	double
for example adding two int is different than adding two double or even one int and one double

194889
equals	tostring
the truth is that like the tostring clone equals methods are for java quasi-standard-like c++ operator overloading is so much part of c++ that it becomes as natural as the original c operators or the before mentioned java methods

194889
subtract	add
do not subtract in a + operator as in do not subtract in a add function or return crap in a clone method

194889
fortran	ada	algol	smalltalk	eiffel	smalltalk	eiffel	algol	eiffel	ada	ada	algol
despite all the fud against used defined operator overloading the following languages support it scala dart python f# c# d algol 68 smalltalk groovy perl 6 c++ ruby haskell matlab eiffel lua clojure fortran 90 swift ada delphi 2005 .

194907
put	get
one caveat with this and i m sure there s an option somewhere to control it but it s been my experience that once you put an xml comment anywhere in a project you ll get a compile warning for every public item that isn t commented if you don t use them everywhere in the project

195002
accessor	properties
as a further it s only functions properties etc that actually throw exceptions so these things aren t covered in the general documentation only in the documentation for the functions or accessor that actually throw them as in the example given

195032
3des	aes
if the algorithms you re working on are standard encryption algorithms like 3des and aes there is definitely hardware available

195070
int	boolean
i would like the fastest and most accurate function boolean isreachable string host int port that passes the following junit tests under the conditions below

195073
onmousedown	onmouseup
then you can intercept the selectionchanged event in the onmousedown and do the selection in the onmouseup instead

195073
mouseup	mousedown
you will also have to maintain a list of the selected rows in the mousedown event and if it turns into a drag drop event you drag all these selected rows and select them on the mouseup

195127
nant	xmlpoke
we re using nant so it s the .build file that has xmlpoke to set debug false alter connection strings and whatever else needs to change in the canary copy and the packaging copy of the web.config

195128
mousehover	mouseenter
btw instead of setting enabled in mousehover you should do it in mouseenter

195128
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave is a pair which indicate whether is the mouse is within the button or not and it s fired once per entry exit

195131
sorting	grouping
for many queries it is much faster than mysql especially for grouping and sorting and can query remote systems in parallel and aggregate the results - which make it very useful in use with sharding

195195
gtk	motif
wxwindows a framework which supports windows 3.1 95 98 nt and unix with gtk motif lesstif and macos

195211
explode	implode
you can usually get by using implode explode or replace

195212
post	get
several of my ajax applications in the past have used get request but now i m starting to use post request instead

195215
post	get
this might help you to decide where to use get and where to use post

195215
post	get
uris addressability and the use of http get and post

195219
post	get
if it does it should be a post request if it doesn t it should be a get request

195220
post	get
the main difference is that post is used to modify the state of the server application while get only requests data from it

195250
hid	keyboard
that should work not just for keyboard but for all hid devices â mice game pads etc

195256
http.sys	httplistener
while you can write your own http server using normal tcp ip it s relatively simple it is easier to use httplistener which takes advantage of the http.sys functionality added in windows xp sp2

195324
rss	feed
you should try dotnetkicks.com which delivers nice rss feed of the most relevant .net blogs imho

195338
redmine	trac
the advantage of own project management software like trac or redmine is that you have the power of everything

195378
post	get
each data-entry form should point to a small php without any html that simply get s the post data enters into the db and forwards to the calling page

195382
textarea	pre
this causes incorrect display of whitespace in elements that ought to preserve formatting such as pre and textarea

195398
postgresql	mysql
the most mentioned difference between mysql and postgresql is about your reading writing ratios

195398
postgresql	mysql
but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise

195398
postgresql	mysql
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

195398
postgresql	mysql
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195415
postgresql	mysql
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

195417
calloc	malloc
a nice malloc calloc and reallloc replacement is rmdebug it s pretty simple to use

195451
int	boolean
i use public boolean mousedown event ev int x int y to detect a click of the mouse

195477
subtract	add
when you equip or unequip an item add or subtract from the effective stats where appropriate

195485
vim	emacs
using either vim or emacs you come to understand that the interface exposes the code s representation of the state of the file you are editing in the buffer the file is the on-disk storage you can fill a buffer from or write a buffer to

195485
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are our two oldest editors in common use today and they share this behavior

195528
children	parent
i have classes bidiparent and bidichildlist which link parent and children in a bidirectional parent-child relationship

195528
children	parent
if a child s parent is updated by the service layer the old and new parent children lists are automatically updated to reflect the change

195528
children	parent
likewise if a parent s children list is updated by adding a new child the child s parent is automatically changed as is the old parent s children list

195535
internationalization	localization
you ve been pointed to gnu gettext which allows you to replace literal strings with localized versions at run time - one aspect of localization which is what happens after you ve done the internationalization when someone actually uses your internationalized code in a specific locale

195537
rss	feed
i am working on an implementation for rss feed for a collaboration platform

195537
rss	feed
say there are several thousands of different collaboration rooms where users can share information and each needs to publish an rss feed with news changes etc.

195537
rss	feed
using a plain servlet is costly every time an rss client is calling the servlet and this will happen say every 10 minutes for each user registered to an rss feed on one of the thousand of rooms this will trigger the entire servlet lifecycle which is costly

195549
width	height
caveat the canvas height and width is set by the component that instantiates it this is all wrapped up in a custom component so i can t explicitly set the width or height of the text control.

195567
vim	emacs
hence emacs s basic unit of work is a buffer and not a file and the same logic holds for vim

195567
vim	emacs
more capable applications like emacs and vim are a lot more flexible in that respect

195618
profiler	shark
if you haven t yet and you care about performance you must run your code through a good profiler personally i like kcachegrind valgrind on linux or shark on mac os x

195668
vim	emacs
in other words much of the vim emacs model except tweaked to be more in-line with discoveries that browsers are making

195683
nhibernate	llblgenpro
nhibernate activerecord subsonic npersist linqtoef linqtosql llblgenpro db4o csla etc

195688
int	chars	int	double
i have a string chars and i need to find its underlying datatype such as int float double short long or just a chars array containing alphabets with or with out digits like varchar in sql

195696
free	malloc
to prevent confusion in the future i d like to point out that the answer suggesting that the problem lies with the use of malloc free to manage the buffers being played is simply wrong

195764
button	checkbox
the index.php page that shows the list of activities with checkbox a button to delete the checked activities and a field to add new activities

195795
int	double
now you can convert it to the largest possible type long long for int double for floating pointers and then use the values in limits.h to see if the value would fit in a smaller type

195795
unsigned	short
you might also have to take arbitrary decisions for example 54321 can only be an unsigned short but 12345 could be a signed short or an unsigned short

195814
inherited	subclassing
with inherited you can implement common code at the base class with some override at the subclassing form and implement flexible interplay

195837
int	double
my comparing dvalue double long dvalue i guess you should know if is an int again not taking into account the usual precision problems coming witb binary real numbers used by computers

195843
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception

195859
post	get
caveat i ve never done linq-to-xml before but looking through other post on the topic this snippet has some f# code that compiles and does something and thus it may help you get started

195916
next	except
this also means that if you hit one of the features that are simply unsupported in rails that you really need youâ ll have no next step except to write the feature yourself if youâ re lucky

195919
folder	directory
it seems like the uninstaller removes only the directory and files that were originally installed from the msi file and it leaves everything else that was added later in the application folder

195939
cpu	hyperthreading
nowadays you are frequently hard-pressed to find a machine without multiple cores or hyperthreading or equivalent but in the circumstances that you have just a single cpu you should use semaphores

195952
cvs	svn
initially i thought that svn followed in the wake of cvs and didn t store binary diffs which it turns out i was wrong about

195957
client-side	server-side
but it is possible to make a md5 or other type of encryption client-side that gives you a reasonably secure way of validation you could test server-side

195996
vb.net	vb6
he s also written what is i believe is considered one of best books on the .net visual basic and is probably the foremost expert on migrating from vb6 to vb.net and the pitfalls therein

195998
vmware	virtualbox
if you can t get pre-packaged binaries for solaris you ll need to get your own solaris machine using virtual pc vmware virtualbox etc use it to compile the gems then pull the binary files out

196027
hide	show
although this isn t a huge amount of time when using it to hide show ui elements the time can be visibly noticeable

196091
setinterval	settimeout
dan from my experience that includes implementation of smil2.1 language in javascript where time management is in subject i can assure you that you actually never need high precision of settimeout or setinterval

196091
setinterval	settimeout
what does however matter is the order in which settimeout setinterval gets executed when queued - and that always works perfectly

196092
swt	swing
there are more applications written using swing than swt over the years

196092
swt	swing
but the user-friendliness of swt on windows is superior compared to swing

196109
wav	ogg
i d like to be able to create apps that can play not only those formats that the flex framework provides support for but other formats as well like wav wma ogg and other...

196146
free	malloc
then it s up to malloc to dole out memory in a way that doesn t fragment the free memory too much

196154
free	malloc
most often c programs have their own malloc free functionality

196164
primes	modulus
where m the modulus would be the nearest primes bigger than 1000

196176
cl.exe	prefast
for static analysis consider compiling with prefast cl.exe analyze

196179
yacc	bison
please limit your solution to yacc bison parsers

196191
free	malloc
the job of malloc and free is to manage those pages of memory which are fixed in size typically 4 kb but sometimes bigger and to slice and dice them into pieces that applications can use

196233
gridview	detailsview
i only use it for bringing up smarttag on things like gridview detailsview and datasource rather than generating all the tedious boundfield and template controls by hand

196244
versioning	upgrade
for users it means they can have but one versioning installed and upgrade etc require parallel running

196252
swt	swing
several years ago swing was slow so swt was developed to make native api calls on systems

196252
swt	swing
swt is non-standard while swing is officially part of the java spec

196309
min	max
i ve been doing more reading including a micorosft research paper on functional programming with catamorphisms bananas and it seems that catamorphism just refers to any function that takes a list and typically breaks it down to a single value like max min and in the general case aggregate would all be a catamorphisms for lists

196349
hide	show
when the user presses the button hide the button and show the progress bar

196349
hide	show
then hide the progress bar and show the button again

196361
free	malloc
rather you d run into the difficulty that any good memalign implementation will be an integral part of the heap-manager codebase not simply layered on top of malloc free

196468
maven	cobertura
i am using the maven 2 cobertura plug-in to create reports on code coverage and i have the following stub i am using in a method

196499
range	max	range	min	min	max
the datediff on max min date values you suggested should work another option is to just count records for each submitted within each date range

196548
hash	md5
basically the idea is to take everything that you can find out about the computer person and then generate a md5 hash of this information

196551
implements	extends
the only thing i can think of you could do is write a proxy class where one of your private fields is the class you d want to extends and you implements all it s methods and proxy their calls

196592
modifiers	sealed
i believe you can use reflection to get around the access modifiers on a class so perhaps you can use reflection.emit to generate a type that inherits from an internal type but not the sealed modifiers though i can t find an example of this online

196616
nunit	mstest
run the test with a testrunner nunit mstest etc

196647
implements	extends
layne you described the problem as happening when your controller class implements an interface but in the code sample you provided the problem occurs when your controller class extends another class of yours validatingcontroller

196705
postgresql	mysql
in fact web2py is the only framework that allows you to write code once and the same code will run on gae sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql and firebird with the limitations imposed by gae

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not do migrations natively see south web2py does

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not allow partial sums count field and group by web2py does

196705
pylons	web2py	django	web2py
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and

196705
pylons	web2py	django	web2py
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

196707
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	bmp	pcx	bmp	tga	png	tga
just by calling snapurl and saveimage you can take a snapshot of a webpage into various images such as bmp jpg jpeg gif png tif tga and pcx

196707
vbscript	jscript
more than 30 samples written in vc c- delphi vb c++ builder java jscript perl vbscript asp asp.net and php are provided

196721
maven	pom.xml
here s the relevant snippet of my project s maven 2 pom.xml

196721
maven	cobertura
i m using maven 2.0.9 and cobertura 2.2

196737
public	protected
i ve been working with the joomla framework and i have noticed that they use a convention to designate private or protected methods they put an underscore _ in front of the method name but they do not explicitly declare any methods public private or protected

196739
public	protected
public private and protected are php5 keywords

196798
django	web2py
web2py is 265kbytes of source code and 1.2mb all inclusive compare with 4.6mb of django

196798
postgresql	mysql
yet web2py will do everything you need manage session cookies request response cache internationalization errors tickets database abstraction for gae sqlite mssql mysql postgresql oracle firebird etc. it does not need installation - just unzip and click on it - and you can do development in your browser

196838
mouseleave	mouseenter
it sounds like what you really want is mouseenter mouseleave ie proprietary events but easy to emulate

196838
mouseleave	mouseenter
alternatively patch prototype.js and use mouseenter and mouseleave with confidence

196933
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome

197035
stdout	stderr
also try to redirect the output but stdout and stderr to a file so that you can see the error messages that are generated

197067
factors	mean
edit clarified what quality factors are supposed to mean

197086
post	get
you can also use bayesian filtering to remove or otherwise deal with the spam post that do get through

197160
opera	safari
like internet explorer opera safari on windows

197188
getter	setter
again check the getter setter checkboxes

197210
mouse	keyboard
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

197247
dictionary	map
purpose of the class a dictionary where a key can map to multiple values

197267
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
if you want to avoid apache it is possible to deploy a mongrel cluster with an alternative web server such as nginx or lighttpd and a load balancer of some variety such as pound or a hardware-based solution

197270
disk	ram
at any given moment it would be best if all bytes are both on disk and in ram

197270
disk	ram
this holds true whether the bytes are logically file bytes ie the ram is cache or process bytes ie the disk bytes are paged

197270
disk	ram
obviously for engineering reasons you can t have all bytes both on disk and in ram

197270
disk	ram
but you certainly shouldn t be throwing bytes out of ram just because they are also on disk

197270
disk	ram
and if you have both a spinning disk and ram pages that haven t changed in a minute it makes sense to pre-emptively write out the bytes

197276
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be captured in

197282
calloc	malloc
the malloc calloc valloc

197316
width	height
at first i was going to propose to get rid of the divs and move the formatting width and height directly on the td but i tried that and doesn t seem to solve the problem

197317
width	height
other bits css width height values require units presumably px

197346
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
as eric said a lot of big websites don t validate however if you start with a validating website that works perfectly in for example firefox safari google-chrome or opera chances are it will be right or mostly right in the other 3 and will only require minor adjustments for them to be right

197346
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie6 and 7 have html hacks that don t require any extra work to load specific stylesheets for them but there isn t anything available for the gecko webkit or presto browsers firefox safari google-chrome or opera so an alternate method is needed for anything specific to these browsers

197372
testcase	fixture
i d like to parametrize the entire testcase including the fixture

197382
g++	gcc
if you want to be able to compile this code in gcc or g++ you will need to create an iterator and use a standard for-loop

197437
hash	salt
so what you could do is take all the pertinent information about what is in the coupon then hash it together with a secret salt to prevent tampering

197437
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8

197468
wtl	atl
back a few years when i started working with wtl it was required at least for atl 3.0 that you define a global variable such as

197486
post	get
forgive me for the self-advertising but i have posted a few on my blog because i m rubbish at sql and it s a good place to store things i know i ll need in the future - if anyone has anything more substantial then please post i m as keen as anyone to get hold of something like this

197502
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
the framework offers already a lot of valid exception classes like argumentexception argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception formatexception overflowexception etc.

197567
superclass	subclassing
you could subclassing or superclass one of these controls to implement infinite functionality

197567
mouse	keyboard
create a single child window draw it yourself handle all the mouse and keyboard input yourself and implement the scroll bar messages yourself

197604
boost	stl
use boost when standard c++ stl cannot solve the problem in an easy way

197649
svg	vml
while working on svg implementation for internet explorer to be based on its own vml format i came to a problem of translation of an svg elliptical arc to an vml elliptical arc

197706
free	malloc
in microsoft s runtime the new operator uses malloc and the delete operator uses free

197732
post	get
the post outlines the process to get a valid certificate installed

197745
post	get
it is also a bad idea to use get methods to change state - take a look at the guidelines on when to use get and when to use post

197799
width	height
you might also try wrapping the content of your row s cells in an href and using css to push the href height width to the internal bounds of each cell

197845
hide	show
i m trying to show hide a movieclip or graphic symbol that is on a layer of a button symbol using actionscript 2

197863
profiling	debugging
ie8 beta 2 has some nice debugging profiling features i would tend to look for the possible resource culprits e.g google maps ajax calls dom manipulation table appending etc and use the debugger to set breakpoints and monitor things this way

197900
cpu	processors
it may be possible to let c++ keep track of all the allocated arrays and their sizes if you are writing a word processors for a windows box running on the latest intel cpu but it may be completely infeasible when you are writing an embedded system running on a dsp

197940
put	get
i can t seem to find an easy to use .net native way to get comboboxes on .net winforms to display one value and return another based on the selection without creating my own helper class with the knowledge that winforms is going to display the tostring method on the object that you put in it

197958
onmousedown	onmouseup
onmouseup onmousedown

198044
onmousedown	onmouseup
onpress and onrelease are hold overs from as2 code they have been supplanted by onmousedown and onmouseup in as3 which you can read about in the as2 migration guide

198058
width	height
i d like to show a div that has a background-color with the height and width set to 100 but no content

198058
width	height
edit thanks to mark biek for pointing out that empty div with width and height styles shows how i d expect

198083
firefox	safari
this seems to work in firefox safari ie6 ie7

198084
webkit	gecko
i think it depends on the browser ie gecko engine webkit engine and on the mode standards mode quirks mode

198090
onmousedown	onmouseup
onmousedown and onmouseup are general events that anything can listen to via mouse.addlistener

198096
mouseup	mousedown
it looks like the mouseup mousedown events will trigger even when the mouse is outside the movie clip while onpress release will automatically check to see if the mouse is within the clip before being handled

198131
queue	fifo
queue and stacks are slightly specialised in that they are optimised for fifo and filo behaviour fifo and fifo respectively

198135
vb.net	vb6
this is vb6 not vb.net

198136
queue	fifo
queue fifo collection

198136
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary tkey tvalue like sortedlist but stored as a tree of key value pairs which gives better performance in many situations

198137
cos	sin
y2 - y1 2 b cos t1 + t2 2 sin t1 - t2 2

198137

gridview	objectdatasource
i have a form that contains a gridview control which is databound to an objectdatasource control

198290
titlebar	window
the drawback to this approach is that you lose the borders of your window as well as the titlebar

198290
mousemove	mousedown
you would need to deal with this by implementing your own form move resize logic in the form s mousedown and mousemove event handlers

198306
french	polish
multilanguage support currently croatian danish english french german italian japanese polish portuguese

198348
int	double
web2py has js to blocks the user from entering a non-integer in a int field or a non-double in a double field

198422
tiff	png
convert the smaller logo pdf to a tiff png whatever using for example imagemagick s convert or the gimp

198441
actionscript	mxml
the flex mxml is mainly another syntax which eventually gets compiled to something you could have also written in actionscript

198470
range	max
but if you don t use random.new then the class method rand only takes a max value not a range as banister energetically points out in the comment and as documented in the docs for random

198473
post	get
while it is true that post doesn t expose information via the url it exposes just as much information as a get in the actual network communication between the client and server

198473
post	get
get or query string post are really good for information required for either bookmarking a particular item or for assisting in search engine optimization and indexing items

198487
post	get
even if post gives no real security benefit versus get for login forms or any other form with relatively sensitive information make sure you are using post as

198487
ssl	https
for real sensitive info make sure to use ssl https

198488
move	drag
i guess there should be a drag initiated but when the mouse move outside the app window it needs to switch to the other functionality and should the mouse move back to the app window again back to the standard drag drop

198489
ssl	https	post	get
get is visible to anyone even the one on your shoulder now and is saved on cache so is less secure of using post btw post without some cryptographics routine is not sure for a bit of security you ve to use ssl https

198492
post	get
many people adopt a convention alluded to by ross that get requests only retrieve data and do not modify any data on the server and post requests are used for all data modification

198565
post	get
neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other

198565
post	get
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

198565
post	get
it s probably best if you read chapter 9 method definitions of the http 1.1 rfc to get an overall idea of what get and post were originally envisioned ot mean

198571
int	boolean
as others have pointed out any int value other than zero is considered true for the purposes of boolean expressions in c.

198592
perl	tcl
the .net framework regular expression engine is a backtracking regular expression matcher that incorporates a traditional nondeterministic finite automaton nfa engine such as that used by perl python emacs and tcl

198592
nfa	dfa
matching behavior first paragraph â â this article also offers a rationale for the employment of an nfa rather than the more efficient dfa

198606
cassini	iis
this works fine in cassini the built-in ad hoc web server for visual studio but gives me internet explorer cannot display the webpage when i try it on a live server running iis

198607
xna	slimdx
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

198624
nfa	dfa
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

198651
versioning	upgrade
the client vm compiler serves as an upgrade for both the classic vm and the just-in-time jit compilers used by previous versioning of the jdk

198679
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
given an inputstream called in which contains audio data in a compressed format such as mp3 or ogg i wish to create a byte array containing a wav conversion of the input data

198722
hash	md5
you could hash the 3 columns using md5 or sha1 and create a unqiue constraint on the hash value

198725
hash	md5
sql 2000 supports an extended stored procedure for md5 sums that you could call from a trigger to create the hash

198844
post	get
the difference between get and post should not be viewed in terms of security but rather in their intentions towards the server

198844
post	get
get should never change data on the server - at least other than in logs - but post can create new resources

198844
post	get
nice proxies won t cache post data but they may cache get data from the url so you could say that post is supposed to be more secure

198854
vb.net	vb6
i used to use it religiously back in the vb6 days but stopped when vb.net came out because that s what the new vb guidelines said

198866
post	get
both get and post send data in plaintext over the wire when used over http

198995
udp	tcp
in the example on cpan use sock_raw rather than sock_dgram udp or sock_stream tcp

199016
ati	nvidia
i ve tried it on vista 64-bit with ati graphic card and on windows xp 32-bit with nvidia with the same result in both cases

199038
gmail	hotmail
apparently email providers such as hotmail gmail yahoo drop all incoming email from widely used server providers such as amazon ec2

199045
post	get
basically it should allow me to submit http get and post requests with a simple syntax and then parse the resulting page and return in a simple format all forms and their fields along with all links on the page

199052
typedef	struct
it complained about a struct typedef in one of the openssl headers

199070
multi-query	mysql
this is called multi-query. the mysql extension in php does not have any means to enable multi-query

199127
telerik	radwindow
however when i launch the form as a child window using telerik s radwindow control the javascript can not access the hidden fields on the child form

199152
children	parent
i ve tried calling various combinations of paint repaint invalidate update on the parent containers and recursing on various children

199154
rss	feed
i get the following error when trying to load an rss feed

199159
post	get
edited to post the following example refactored code apologies for any errors as i typed it in notepad in a couple seconds rather than opening visual studio and i wouldn t get intellisense for your project anyway

199222
awt	swing
it does look like mixing lightweight usually swing and heavyweight awt components together

199222
awt	swing
moving to swing you need to replace every last awt component swing equivalents hint avoid import java.awt

199236
cpython	ironpython
for me ironpython has been the more robust choice and much of what i ve written in cpython ports without changes

199246
3des	aes	des	aes
when i add a new ipsec filter rule the only options for esp i get are des and 3des so the faq is correct - there is no support for aes prior to windows vista

199255
cpython	ironpython
once you have cpython understanding ironpython will be a lot easier to understand

199262
awt	swing
this happens all the time if you are not programming carefully in awt swing

199262
put	get
third and this is an extension of first if you get a callback that is not already on the awt worker thread be sure to put it on the awt thread before doing anything with the gui

199271
getter	setter
i did it also a bit more complicate with list instead of tuple but i had override the setter as well as the getter

199275
cpython	ironpython
i write code for cpython and ironpython but tip should work for jython as well

199289
public	protected
if you re using an oo language then i d suggest it s essential to validate the arguments to public methods but less important with private and protected methods

199290
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

199292
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
yes it s good practice to validate all arguments at the beginning of a method and throw appropriate exceptions like argumentexception argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception

199307
inherited	properties
the component i was implementing a custom collection inherited from collectionbase i changed this to a list and added the designerserializationvisibility designerserializationvisibility.content attribute to the list properties this list is also read-only

199344
stdout	fflush
you need the fflush stdout because normally stdout is buffered until you output a newline

199362
kate	kdevelop
if you look at kate the text editor and kdevelop the ide the main difference is that kdevelop supports project management cvs subversion and build scripts whereas kate does not

199368
awk	ksh
all i use bash ksh for is as a shell - the scripting side is not useful - simple stuff is done with awk and pipes and complex stuff requires c

199371
pdcurses	ncurses
curses# uses pdcurses on windows and ncurses on linux

199373
jobs	cron
but your sysadmin friends will look at you funny when you write perl wrappers for cron jobs

199387
post	get
i created a nice class that can get and post an array of data including files

199387
post	get
to a url by just calling curlhandler get url data || curlhandler post url data

199391
debian	linux	versioning	upgrade
since they all run debian linux i ve set up a debian package repository on my server and the all the customer has to do is type apt-get upgrade and they get the latest versioning

199403
imagemagick	magick++
i am aware of imagemagick and it s c++ binding magick++ but i think it s an overkill for this project since i am currently not interested in other file formats or platforms

199405
getter	setter
the generate getter setter and constructor from fields functions are all really nice but it would be useful to have that tied into a new class pojo dialog

199427
packets	pcap
if you re writing an unusual packets processor such as an active hostile attack tool a man-in-the-middle process or a traffic shaping device then would be more likely to be building packets and using pcap

199450
put	get
this is because you may need to control the ids which get put in this table because your application is going to have to look for specific ids

199472
int	double
given that not every value is an int though you should typically not expect the memory footprint of your application to double

199521
groupbox	panel
to make matters worse in order to recursively clear controls inside sub-containers a group box within the panel i have to repeat the whole monster with an overloaded groupbox version

199526
bitblt	gdi
using gdi calls rather than gdi+ for the bitblt this is often a good idea - graphics drawimage can be very slow

199526
bitblt	gdi
i ve even found the normal gdi bitblt call to be faster on some systems

199540
groupbox	panel
the only change i might suggest would be instead of overloading the method just make the passed in type a control and you can use the same version for groupbox panel or any other container control that provides a .controls property

199554
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
for example an exception filter that catches argumentexception will also catch exceptions derived from argumentexception such as argumentnullexception invalidenumargumentexception duplicatewaitobjectexception and argumentoutofrangeexception

199576
ubuntu	linux
i am planning to move my vmware s virtual machines from a windows host to a linux host ubuntu

199590
packets	pcap
i also liked the suggestions from denton andrew of replaying pcap format packets

199593
put	get
you ll only get an improvement in programming efficiency after you ve put in the effort to re-implement the web app -- which due to the time required for the reimplementation may or may not result in an improvement overall

199602
awt	swing
canvas is an awt component so you ll need to wrap it in a swing component to which you can set the border

199634
pygtk	gtk#
gtk+ you can use almost in all programming languages in c++ using gtkmm in c gtk+ in c# with gtk# in python pygtk

199637
goto	break
java does not implement goto though it does have jump statements like break and continue

199661
bash	tcsh
i ve used bash csh and tcsh

199668
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
note this catches integer addition subtraction overflows and i realized that your question involves multiplication

199672
slackware	suse	rhel	slackware	rhel	suse
i usually stick to bash because it s more friendly than straight-up sh and it s the default on every distro i ve used semi-regularly suse rhel ubuntu slackware

199680
next	except
on the next pull you want to do the same thing except now if the edge has already been selected discard and reselect

199692
inherited	properties
i have only a basic knowledge of css is it possible to inherited a properties from one style into another style

199695
ienumerable	ilist
apparently the winforms combo box wants an ilist not an ienumerable

199699
treeview	expander
dockpanel wrappanel viewbox label headeredcontentcontrol expander treeview numericupdown autocomplete accordion

199721
firefox	safari
and windows with safari firefox

199735
onclick	onmousedown
add an onclick or onmousedown handler to the anchor tag

199835
vim	emacs
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference

199835
subtract	add
if you decide that you want to use something other than c shell then you are basically in the bourne shell camp for which the posix standard more or less specifies the expected behaviour and then the different shells -- that is the bourne korn or born again shells -- add or in the case of the classic bourne shell subtract a few features

199835
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
if your code might ever need to move off linux to hp-ux solaris or aix the surviving trio of the classic at t-derived unix variants then you should consider ensuring you write your shell scripts in classic bourne shell though korn shell is also pretty safe

199867
bash	zsh
for a while i was the maintainer of the freebsd port of the bash tab-completion scripts but abandoned it as soon as i tried zsh for the first time

199867
bash	zsh
bash and zsh and other shells have nice extensions that you ll miss but those tie you to a specific setup

199870
ffmpeg	libavformat
i use ffmpeg also known as libavformat which is a cross-platform api

199879
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is that the mouseover and mouseout javascript events don t always trigger especially if the user moves the mouse over the flash element too quickly

199979
hide	show
one thing i ve done frequently is to create frames in the mc called show and hide followed by short animations and a stop command and then done something like this

200026
onmouseover	mouseleave
at the same time add an onmouseover function to the window - this should get triggered when the mouseleave the flash element

200031
erlang	lisp
my recommendation from personal experience is to learn about lisp erlang or such functional languages and the philosophy behind them

200138
serializable	deserialization
wcf also allows more fine-grained control over the json serializable and deserialization if you desire it

200142
public	protected
edit one variant on this would be to make bar a protected nested class within foo with a public constructor

200170
boost	stl
a good start is the boost library of course because it covers most of the templates you seem to look around for when the stl runs out of gas

200244
int	chars
you use inputstreamreader.read chars int int and when you ve read all you want to create a new string from a chars array

200341
jar	war
heck you can store content directly in a war file which is basically a jar file with a few extra bits

200417
getter	setter
autogeneration of code getter setter etc much like intellij idea for java has

200470
firefox	safari
we have found out that firefox at least v3 and safari don t properly cache images referenced from a css file

200488
folder	directory
where web would be a sub directory in my themes folder

200577
junit	cactus
as you are dealing with a web service you would not need to use jakarta cactus and could get away with writing plain old junit tests

200581
jar	war
in a jar or war file and pull them at runtime

200593
jvcl	turbopower
this wasn t just used for some in-house components alone the repo also included some of the big component packages raize components jcl jvcl using their installer instead of the tool though devexpress quantum grid 3 and 4 turbopower asyncpro

200597
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you can use iqueryable t instead of ienumerable t then the select method should do what you want

200641
hide	show
include the calculated data in your regular page but hide it style visibility hidden then make it visible with a print.css media print as described by guido so it only show up when you print

200651
boost	stl
you should know enough about the subject to be able to effectively use template libraries such as the stl or boost

200700
hex	binary
if you need to be absolutely sure what s going on create the files in binary either using a binary hex editor or writing it out from a program

200724
width	height
it works fine when i apply a scaletransform on the template but that results in a control that s too small when it s actually used the width height auto resizes the control to the proper size and then the scaletransform is applied

200734
lisp	prolog
prolog was better in my view but lisp was more popular

200738
hex	binary
using the php pack function i have converted a string into a binary hex representation

200755
ienumerable	iqueryable
i know that the reason this happens is the difference between iqueryable s and ienumerable s so why doesn t the matchplayers object in the first example implement the iqueryable interface to get the same benefits as the latter example

200798
strsplit	substr
re-reading your question again strsplit is not available in j2me but the same effect can be achieved with substr and indexof

200842
rss	feed
we ve created an rss feed for cooliris to open small example from it

200847
many-to-many	one-to-many
should handle one-to-many and many-to-many relations should handle inheritance support for lazy loading

200869
post	get
one great about this solution is that i maged to make it work with post and get requisitions

200909
width	height
you could try to bind the width and height of the control inside the template to the width and height respectively of the templated control at runtime

200909
width	height
these properties contain the width and height of a control after it has been rendered which can be different from what has been specified in the width and height properties

200935
csla	.net
if you are using .net you may want to take a look at csla .net by rockford lhotka

201026
nunit	nmock
there is a rather good book describing how to use nunit and nmock to do c# unit testing

201030
csla	.net
i would recommend csla .net by rockford lhotka

201044
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
change to sum average max or min anything that represents the actual data - it only applies to the one value so aggregate-functions are fine

201067
awt	swing
i was able to fix 99 of my awt applet redraw issues by switching to swing

201080
httphandler	httpmodule
generally this web-dependent assembly is also where my httpmodule and httphandler live too

201084
lisp	scheme
scheme immediately comes to mind a nicer lisp

201132
.nettiers	codesmith
most of the time i use types data sets and custom web services or i use .nettiers with codesmith

201171
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

201171
quicksort	mergesort
but you can implement quicksort more efficiently than mergesort for almost any application other than ones dealing with sorting millions of items

201175
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
my general rule of thumb is if it is a one-liner or a for-loop to catch a bunch of files and do just a few operations to them i use bash tcsh zsh else i use python

201245
button	checkbox
row three will always have two radio button and two checkbox and those are in the html side of the page

201245
button	checkbox
i can loop through each item in the datagrid and i can access the radio button and the checkbox but the textboxes arenâ t there

201294
vim	emacs
while it doesn t launch from vim the way emacs does it provides vim like keybindings and behavior

201298
configobj	configparser
configobj is essentially a replacement for configparser with support for nested sections and much more

201317
wan	lan	vpn	lan
the client and server exist in the same organisation typically a lan perhaps a wan vpn situation

201352
inherited	properties
the size of the stack is a properties inherited between processes

201352
zsh	tcsh
if you can read or modify it in the the shell using commands like ulimit -s in sh ksh zsh or limit stacksize tcsh zsh

201367
sorting	filtering
dataset automatic sorting filtering

201377
min	max
for example i am trying to get a min date a max date and a sum in different instances

201400
bash	zsh
the obvious candidates for an interactive shell are bash dash zsh and pd ksh

201400
bash	zsh
pick whichever you like for interactive use i d tend to go with bash just because it s the standard on linux but they all have their merits and zsh in particular seems popular

201406
opera	safari
but somehow this seems to trigger a reload in safari opera and mozilla -- no matter what the event handler contains

201435
factors	mean
although the question asks for the largest prime factors it doesn t necessarily mean you have to find that one first.

201457
post	get
where the query string can be a specified get post variable or a string passed to the interpreter

201485
primes	modulus
another approach is to get all primes up to n 2 first and then to check if the modulus is 0

201520
mouse	keyboard
i can figure out how to capture keyboard events and mouse events

201523
cakephp	kohana	symfony	kohana
check out projects such as -- in no particular order -- zend framework cakephp symfony code ignitor kohana solar and akelos

201560
int	chars
wp64.cpp 10 warning c4311 reinterpret_cast pointer truncation from const chars to unsigned int

201581
getter	setter
i agree with ya ll that they should be using getter setter and just set the _table to private

201585
inherited	properties
...is it possible to inherited a properties from one style into another style

201623
ant	maven
at any rate the maven conventions work just fine for ant so if you ve already got them in place just re-use the same structures

201683
ant	emma
the user guide has a good example of how to set up your build script so that you not only seperate the instrumented code from the execution but it s also all contained in the same so that you don t have to run a series of different targets but instead you can just do something like ant emma tests if ant tests was how you normally ran your unit tests for example

201696
getter	setter
i have a sessionhelper class that manages the session setter getter

201774
webclient	webrequest
shawn wildermuth gives a great overview of the two options you have webclient and webrequest

201798
firefox	safari
i had the same problem but only in internet explorer i tested version 7 - not in firefox 3 or safari 3

201803
ilist	icollection
ilist is good but sometimes you may need icollection functionality or want to specify values that are readonly

201820
post	get
http was designed to do queries or searches through the query string thus the name and to get a form to post to a query string instead of the body you need to use a get method

201835
ienumerable	ilist
by using ilist you make this a requirement so that nobody can inadvertently return an ienumerable

201922
yacc	bison
since the code is 20 years old scrap down the parser syntax analyzer and replace it with one of the newer lex yacc bison or anything similar etc based c++ code much more maintainable and easier to understand

201922
boost	stl
if you have some time left try replacing data structures one by one to use the more standardized stl or boost

201950
postgresql	mysql
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

201969
jar	manifest.mf
this is a jar containing only a manifest.mf file whose class-path specifies the disk paths of your long list of jars etc

201970
post	get
there are a few ways round this make the search a normal html form and make itperform a get not a post and mentioned by nick

201993
rss	feed
my computer at home is set up to automatically download some stuff from rss feed mostly torrents and podcasts

201993
rss	feed
magpie rss for php can do caching but that s only to avoid retrieving the feed too much not really storing more entries

201998
free	malloc
they can be allocated deallocated and reallocated dynamically using the new delete operators in c++ and malloc free in c

202008
rss	feed
sounds like you want some sort of service that checks the rss feed every x minutes so you can download every single article item published to the feed while you are watching it rather than only seeing the items displayed on the feed when you go to view it

202033
istream	getline
you can use the std istream getline or preferably the version that works on std string function to get an entire line

202044
rss	feed
i think what you mean to say is that if you have a doget dopost method which contains code to build the data needed for the rss feed from scratch then each request triggers this fetching of data over and over again

202050
ienumerable	ilist
i m not sure i d do so for a shared class library though in general i d avoid exposing a keyedcollection in a public api instead i would expose ilist t in a public api and consumers of the api who need keyed access can define their own internal keyedcollection with a constructor that takes an ienumerable titem and populates the collection with it

202050
serializable	deserialization
regarding serializable there is also a performance problem that i reported to microsoft connect the keyedcollection maintains an internal dictionary as well as a list and serializable both - it is sufficient to serializable the list as the dictionary can easily be recreated on deserialization

202068
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
seeing as the majority of traffic to the hosted sites would end up at their top level domain this would result in only static media hits the html page with the embedded flash movie i could set up lighttpd or nginx to handle those requests and pass the django stuff back to apache mod_whatever

202075
min	max
256 bytes assuming 2048 bit key - 42 bytes min oeap padding 214 bytes max plaintext size

202095
mvp	presenter
it s generally a good idea to minimize the amount of things you do in a code behind and instead push logic into a presenter class and follow the mvp pattern for asp.net web forms development

202122
lxml	elementtree
lxml has support for cdata and api like elementtree

202132
spweb	spsite
to be quick you should dispose all your spweb and spsite using either

202174
outputstream	inputstream
it is much like an inputstream and outputstream but it allows reading and writing wherever you like

202187
bazaar	git
this might not be a viable option but perhaps you could use a distributed system like bazaar git or mercurial

202187
folder	directory
i know with bazaar the repository is simply a hidden folder added to the directory

202188
opensuse	linux
i have tested all my systems developed in delphi in windows xp on wine opensuse linux and they work perfectly

202195
trie	tree
this is quite an achievement that can t possibly be beaten by a search tree trie

202224
httphandler	httpmodule
another possibility for your threadabortexception is any code that runs outside the page request lifecycle on the server side such as httpmodule and httphandler

202250
trie	tree
okay so the naiive trie encodes string keys by starting at the root of the tree and moving down branches that match each letter in the key starting at the first letter of the key

202273
superclass	subclassing
i would like to know what file the subclassing resides in from the superclass

202293
rss	feed
i then add the rss feed to itunes

202303
folder	directory
if you re running windows use the junction utility from ms and map your share directory to the webcontent folder

202308
inherited	subclassing
each subclassing would need to have an explicitly implemented method that returned __file__ which completely defeats the point of inherited in the first place

202323
rss	feed
a valid rss feed or your internet

202347
rss	feed
try the rss feed for the main page

202347
rss	feed
edit whoops as the comments rightly point out looks like it s an atom feed not an rss feed i should have double checked before posting

202347
rss	feed
i tried running the feed through feedburner to convert it to rss but vs still doesn t like it

202362
rss	feed
if you are hosting your own rss feed you can parse the iis or apache logs to find all requests for the feed and then do some processing to aggregate these per machine

202362
rss	feed
you can also use google s feedburner to generate an rss feed that basically redirects to your real feed

202366
ilist	ienumerator	ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerator	icollection
i have found many pieces of documentations and recommendations about ienumerator ienumerable icollection ilist and their generic counterparts

202371
put	get
plus you get these little widgets that you can put on the page the yellow box on perlbuzz that gives the count of current readers

202416
rss	feed
it appears that is actually an atom feed and not rss so that is probably where the vs issue is coming from

202465
post	get
this is the story behind don t change data on get but only on post

202465
post	get
crawlers will happily follow get never post

202467
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
ilist icollection ienumerable

202573
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
there are a couple of interfaces that you could implement that help with change tracking and undo inotifypropertychanged and ieditableobject

202654
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
idictionary ilist icollection ienumerable

202658
superclass	subclassing
you can start with the unit which acts as a superclass then you can have a team as a subclassing of unit

202706
ubuntu	linux
i ve never been entirely satisfied with linux whenever i decided to install a distro like ubuntu fedora etc

202709
gridview	formview	listview	gridview
formview gridview and listview

202713
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome firefox etc

202755
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a free database engine which is well scalable and widely used besides mysql

202762
vb.net	vb6
also they have something similar over at codeproject asynchronous processing - basics and a walkthrough with vb6 vb.net

202790
rss	feed
i have an ldquo rdquo and several other entities under my rss feed

202934
subnet	packets
if necessary you can even make this a broadcast packets if you don t know who the clients are and they are on the same subnet as the server so long as the server isn t too chatty

202939
django	web.py
i already found out about django and web.py

202948
kde	gnome
you should know that using any theme that is not officially supported by gnome kde can have bugs

203008
opera	firefox
this function is used by firefox and opera to get their proxy settings by default although you can override them per-browser

203012
kde	gnome
with linux there s not only different window managers gnome kde flux openbox enlightenment etc etc there s different ui toolkits qt gtk+ tk wx etc etc different versions in common use and countless different ways of using implementing them

203012
ubuntu	linux
as for a nice integrated linux desktop environment - i would say the default ubuntu installation is probably the closest to this

203023
google-chrome	firefox
there s the prism add-on for firefox and google-chrome has this functionality built-in

203033
textchanged	keyup	keydown	keyup
in the combobox i handle the keydown textchanged and keyup events which fire in that order

203033
textchanged	keyup	keydown	keyup
if i go from keydown to keyup with textchanged skipped i check whether the character was a keys.q or keys.oemperiod

203036
folder	directory
the files in the install directory are inheriting their security attributes from the parent folder

203066
temp	tmp
the temp directory is usually located under the user profile both tmp and temp usually point here so copying files here will have permissions for that user

203094
folder	directory
if you really want to move them to a different location creating a temp folder in the same place as the files to be patched would help the permissions stay the same assuming the directory is using inherited permissions

203171
post	put
and no i m not trying to put malicious bookmarklets in so or anything but i want to use markdown for my site and would like to post some bookmarklets i wrote

203226
post	get
you re requesting the url with a get while the jquery code uses a post

203247
post	get
part of the query string in the url for a get or the data for a post

203256
maven	pom.xml
it s simply a maven plugin that generates the .project and .classpath file based on the contents of the pom.xml you just run mvn eclipse eclipse and you re done

203266
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
i would recommend looking at the wikipedia articles for django turbogears pylons etc

203266
turbogears	cherrypy
personally i like turbogears a lot since it is based on well-known components cherrypy for web serving and url routing kid for templates and sqlobject for object-relational mapping

203302
subtract	add
it is not possible to simply add or subtract a value as the dates do not have a regular gap between them

203358
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want to set a style on the first and last tabitem in a tabcontrol and have them updated as the visibility of the tabitem is changed

203358
tabcontrol	tabitem
this also lets us address an issue with tabcontrol where it will display the content of a non-visible tabitem if none of the visible tabitem are selected.

203360
cobertura	checkstyle	checkstyle	cpd
this tool claims to support automatically integrating the output of pmd cpd findbugs checkstyle and cobertura into a single html report

203384
mouse	keyboard
is there some function in windows that tells you how long it has been inactive or do you have to use some kind of keyboard mouse hook to track activity yourself

203399
postgresql	mysql
i m running a mysql database locally for development but deploying to heroku which uses postgresql

203410
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse hooks are what i find to be most valuable

203420
mouse	keyboard
i implemented a global keyboard and mouse hook during anappaday

203426
doc	rtf
i think i can use the rtf generation to create a doc-readable file that can then be edited using doc and re-saved

203428
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure if there is an equivalent for mysql but you can always do this which is a bit ugly but should work in both mysql and postgresql

203561
nsstring	nsdata
if you want to use cocoa nsstring and nsdata have methods for reading writing to file and nsfilemanager gives you file operations

203566
wordpress	phpbb
on one blog forum combination we hacked together the signup procedure so that people filled in one form to sign up to both wordpress and phpbb at the same time

203577
width	height
the real goal is to find the average width and height of a font character

203580
inherited	properties
another thought is you could inherited textbox and add properties to your custom textbox so the textbox handles it s own state

203630
switching	screens
to some extent this became handled in screens readers by the reader switching between a table mode and a layout mode based on what it saw inside the table

203642
int	boolean
i like to prefix my variables with what they re going to be str string int int bool boolean etc

203739
opera	google-chrome
it s the same in ff3 ie7 opera and google-chrome

203782
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in your .htaccess files or httpd.conf you should block all access to .svn directories from anyone anywhere

203798
submit	submission
download site submission tools use this spec to make it easier for authors to submit their software

203810
accessor	properties
i know when a variable s the backing field of a properties accessor or temporary or an argument to the current method because my naming conventions tell me that

203883
mockups	prototyping
using photoshop to design your will also be wasted effort - far better to use evolutionary prototyping rad technique with css html - but still do pen paper mockups of your intentions

203913
internationalization	localization
it covers the application globalisation internationalization and localization options in detail with pros and cons and excellent examples and also topics i hadn t considered such as localising the deployment clickonce and setup projects

203933
strcpy	strncpy	fgets	strncpy	fgets	strcpy
functions such as gets and strcpy are replaced with their safer counterparts like fgets and strncpy which have a length argument to prevent buffer overruns

203966
directx	gdi
but you can do the trick by creating a converter class which will accept all output graphics from your gdi designed application classes and convert the format to fit the needs of directx or sdl classes depending what do you want to use

203966
directx	gdi
so i think you can do the same for converting gdi - directx or gdi - sdl

203971
inherited	properties
it also isn t possible to map l2s entities that leverage inherited which means that every entity must have properties for created-on created-by etc

204150
cpython	pypy
the global interpreter lock in the cpython and pypy runtimes preclude this option

204152
hash	md5
you can then use a javascript md5 library to generate a hash password by combining the random string and the password pwhash md5 randomstring+password

204180
versioning	upgrade
there s a general point here worth making i think that you can only automate db versioning and upgrade so far - the abstractions are very leaky

204186
interrupt	wakeup
however my code is not calling wakeup or interrupt to initiate these returns

204203
3des	sha	rsa	3des
rsa with 3des cbc sha

204279
vb6	vba
to make it even more confusing i do a lot of work with excel vba which is still vb6

204333
hex	binary
this project claims to have a reusable hex editor component be.hexeditor - that would probably be the best way to edit random binary data

204402
ioexception	objectoutputstream
private void writeobject objectoutputstream out throws ioexception

204402
ioexception	objectinputstream
private void readobject objectinputstream in throws ioexception classnotfoundexception

204412
post	get
by putting a breakpoint in the backend and holding a request there for 30 seconds i can see from trace.axd that the post is taking 3ms and the get is taking 4s

204442
sorting	filtering
the adjacency model also described on the page you link to provides for the most flexible sorting and filtering but with a significant performance impact

204447
concave	convex
have a search for no fit polygon on the web and see if you can find an algorithm for convex polygons it gets much more complex if you have concave polygons

204477
bazaar	trac	bazaar	git
slicehost + trac + subversion mercurial git bazaar

204537
put	get
or to really get some reuse going put the logic in a service

204606
128bit	64bit
however on 64bit systems there does not seem to be a standard 128bit integer

204747
listview	gridview
i m converting functionality from an asp.net gridview to a listview

204756
min	max
you might also want to take a look at changing the min max number of threads that tomcat will use to handle requests in conf server.xml

204757
svg	vml
its api will draw svg canvas vml depending on the capabilities of the browser

204776
put	get
you may be able to use usesubmitbehavior true and put a method get on the form

204778
django	web.py
also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django

204794
ant	maven
so the first thing i do with a project is establish how it will be built java ant or maven

204831
jquery	scriptaculous
but it turns out that it contains a few hidden gems in addition to their apps you can try out the many javascript libraries that they host including jquery jquery ui mootools dojo and prototype scriptaculous

204839
jquery	scriptaculous
js bin is a sandbox for javascript and css testing with built in support for many scripting libraries including jquery scriptaculous yui mootools and dojo

204839
haskell	scheme
codepad is a pastebin with a twist it has a interpreter compiler built in for 13 languages including c c++ haskell scheme python and php

204853
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak to the mysql postgresql question as i have limited experience with postgresql but my masters research project was about high-performance websites with cherrypy and i don t think you ll be disappointed if you use cherrypy for your site

204909
mbunit	nunit
testdriven.net - unit testing add on for vs that is fully integrated with all major unit testing frameworks including nunit mbunit etc.

204916
disk	ram
in short nginx is a fast and light webserver front-proxy with a unique module that let s it fetch data directly from memcached s ram store without hitting the disk or any dynamic webapp

204916
post	put
note that if your url scheme for the ajax traffic is well designed rest is best imho you can put most of the db right in memcached and any post which will pass to the app can preemptively update the cache

204965
hash	salt
in server s response displaying the form create a magic hash based on client ip + date time + random salt whatever

204982
rss	feed
the feed needs to be tranformed into rss from atom and there is a really good xsl stylesheet here that fits the bill specifically

204982
rss	feed
then you should be able to enjoy the rss feed from stackoverflow.com in you start page in visual studio that is of course if you are into that kind of thing

204988
post	put
still it s not ideal as it s custom and it s down to me to put it as near to the end of the post cycle as possible

205096
cpython	pypy
the same author that is working on jit in pypy wrote psyco previously which optimizes python in the cpython interpreter

205119
photoshop	paint.net
if this is something you will be doing on an occasional basis and doesn t need automating you can do it in an image editor that supports layers such as photoshop or paint shop pro probably gimp or paint.net too but i m not sure about those

205157
cvs	svn
the cvs and svn command sets are very similar and require minimal adjustment

205178
prng	random
dev urandom is like dev random but when the entopy is exhausted a cryptographic hash is employed which makes the entropy pool effectively a stateful prng

205235
jobs	cron
also you could use them on the gae if that is the route you decide to take although you should keep in mind that the gae does not support cron jobs which can limit your functionality

205244
google-chrome	firefox
both mozilla firefox and google-chrome load the web site perfectly with no hassles

205251
queue	fifo
work items are queue up centrally and need to be processed in an essentially fifo order

205295
pull	push
from there on out you can clone and pull from the central repository and push to the central repository

205332
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the web site now loads perfectly in microsoft internet explorer and apple safari as well as mozilla firefox and google-chrome

205356
getter	setter
if you want an easy way to copy from type a to type b then you could try beanutils.copyproperties as long as the setter and getter of type a and type b match

205364
postgresql	mysql
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

205425
postgresql	mysql
on the db question i d say postgresql scales better and has better data integrity than mysql

205483
filesystems	ntfs
i also find this one useful when copying between linux filesystems and ntfs

205486
put	get
i get a little fed up sometimes with co-workers who excessively put everything into its own method or class or file and this becomes a nightmare to navigate

205527
jobs	cron	rss	feed
because i run a blog aggregator website which checks a large list of rss feed for new posts every hour so i will be happy if its possible to use google feed api or google ajax feed api instead of making the cron jobs to read the whole feed to know if its updated or not

205569
width	height
then you call glteximage2d or whatever passing it a pointer to the first pixel of the subimage and the width and height of the subimage

205592
folder	directory
i m assuming you have frompath an absolute path for a folder and topath an absolute path for a folder file and your re looking for a path that with represent the file folder in topath as a relative path from frompath your current working directory is frompath then something like this should work

205610
getter	setter
what finally convinced me was the fairly obvious point in retrospect that properties in .net are just syntactic sugar for getter and setter methods and those methods have a different name from the property itself

205612
accessor	properties
putting light weight properties accessor in up front saves a phenomenal amount of heartache should a bug arise involving the field you wrapped

205626
accessor	properties
it s much easier to debug a problem involving a field if it is wrapped by a properties accessor

205628
post	get
i might as well post the basic code i used to get everything i needed using wmi as was suggested here

205648
width	height
4.make the height and width 100

205649
postgresql	mysql
i say database because it is column-oriented a very different model from row-oriented databases like mysql postgresql oracle etc

205726
vim	emacs
you can use pylint for such things and there seems to be a way to integrate it into emacs but i ve never done the latter b c i m a vim user

205774
vmware	virtualbox
i used to use virtualpc but i really hated not having any type of snapshot feature like vmware and virtualbox have

205800
mouse	keyboard
the functionality we need is to specify which application is shared and also to give the viewers permission to control the mouse and keyboard

205821
logmein	hamachi
i use logmein and hamachi for remote desktop and vpn solutions

205884
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome etc now appears to support onerror

205902
post	get
you shouldn t trust anything that comes in over http - it s trivial to manufacture a get or post request

205959
boost	stl
in general if there s a basic library functionality that you want that s not in the stl the fix is to look at boost

205982
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
window.onerror catches all errors in ie and most errors in firefox but does nothing in safari and opera

205997
for-loop	loops
if you need the index rather than using a for each loops i would just use a for-loop that went through the indices so you know what you have

206012
hash	md5
i want to generate unique filenames per image so i m using md5 to make filenames.since two of the same image could come from different locations i d like to actually base the hash on the image contents

206134
pop-up	dialog
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

206134
pop-up	dialog
i think that when used correctly they provide a decent experience - if something has to get my attention then i d rather it do so without redirecting me from the page showing an ugly operating system themed dialog or a pop-up which my browser will likely block anyway

206146
getter	setter
there is no need for getter setter and no-arg constructors just to satisfy the tools

206153
queue	fifo
queue are for fifo order not random access order

206159
mouse	keyboard
to achieve a multiple selection tree control you will need to draw the tree items yourself and override the keyboard and mouse handling

206159
children	parent
don t forget to consider selection rules are parent and children allowed for example and don t forget to implement the keyboard shortcuts including selection using ctrl shift and ctrl+shift as well as the spacebar for selecting deselecting

206165
hash	md5
if you re still concerned using a combination of sha-1 plus md5 as another answer suggested gets you to a total of 288 high-quality hash bits which means you ll have a 50 chance of a collision once there are 2 144 files

206169
ninject	spring.net
microsoft s unity ioc container vs castle windsor spring.net ninject etc

206198
accessor	properties
but actually my properties is of type iplugininfo and a plugininfo type implementing iplugininfo is instatiated and returned in the info properties get accessor like this

206275
hash	md5
there are pairs of different files with the same md5 hash not theoretical

206275
hash	md5
for your application this means someone could upload two different images which would have the same md5 hash or someone could generate such a pair of images and publish them somewhere in the internet such that two of your users will later try to upload them with confusing results

206289
free	calloc
you d have to keep track of how many void were originally calloc d and iterate over them free-ing each one then free the original values variable

206296
free	malloc
i would malloc the individual pieces of the array i need and then free them when i m done i suppose

206296
free	malloc
you can t free something you didn t first malloc

206299
free	malloc
edit you re also asking for trouble by alternating between c++-style new delete with c-style malloc free

206299
free	malloc
it is okay to use them both as long as you don t delete something you malloc ed or free something you new ed but you re going to mix them up in your head if you go like this

206309
put	get
monorail and the related castle projects always seem a bit disjointed which will put off the less than expert developer just looking to get started

206318
fiddler	charles
aside from fiddler charles and poster firefox plug in

206320
folder	directory
i m using grep to get a list of all files and folder in the given directory but i don t know which of the values returned is a folder name and which is a file with no file extention

206325
sorting	filtering
the data layer returns iqueryable which permits the consuming layer to apply filtering and sorting expression on top of that

206325
sorting	filtering
the bonus is being able to specify a single getproducts method for example and then decide appropriately in the consuming layer how you want that sorting filtering or even just a particular range of results

206365
put	get
you would have to get them to upload the image to your server then put the jpeg on a page with javascript to call window.print

206409
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
every browser that supports xhtml firefox opera safari ie9 supports self-closing syntax on every element

206443
installation	upgrade
snapshots and rollbacks are nice too but i use them only occasionally really useful during installation upgrade tests

206443
versioning	upgrade
suppose you re developing a new versioning of your software and checking that the upgrade from the previous versioning works correctly.

206456
solaris	aix
the oda products are compiled for a number of operating systems including windows 32-bit sgi solaris windows 64-bit macintosh hp windows ce linux ibm aix

206484
put	get
i know that i shouldn t have to put locationid at the end of each one but i can t get the syntax even close to being correct

206496
free	calloc
also note though it is not illegal to use both new delete and calloc free in the same piece of code it is frowned upon

206497
ant	maven
the normal apporoach works the other way around you create your build based upon maven or ant and then use integrations for your ide of choice so that you are independent from it which is esp

206510
swt	swing
you already have the choice of swing and swt can you really do better than these two teams

206515
width	height
tmonitor has properties indicating the left top width height etc. so all the information you need is there

206534
filesystems	fat
is to move them to a fat filesystems

206534
filesystems	ntfs
then move again to ntfs filesystems

206574
put	get
to get a very rough estimation i could just put nslog calls on either side of the code i wanted to profile but it seems like the processor being otherwise very busy could skew the results

206575
int	chars
the only way i can think that this would cause a performance loss is that the compiler has to compare the entire int to 0 and then assign the bool appropriately unlike a conversion such as a chars to bool where the result can be copied over because a bool is one byte and so they are effectively the same or an integral conversion which involves copying some or all of the source to the destination possibly after a zero of the destination if it s bigger than the source in terms of memory

206642
swt	swing
i d go look at the source for the swing and or swt as they are already implemented

206643
put	get
my understanding is that you can store it prior to authorization but i could never get anyone that would put that in writing

206658
width	height
you can get the width and height from there too to know the dimensions

206674
profiler	shark
xcode includes an excellent profiler tool called shark . for some versions it s found in developer applications

206695
profiling	debugging
in addition to having seriously powerful real-time debugging capabilities phped from nusphere www.nusphere.com has a built-in profiling that can be run with a single click from inside the ide

206722
post	put
a separate post detailing how to put everything together is probably in order

206939
hash	md5
next i need to update the md5 fields with the hash of the file contents

206941
google-chrome	firefox
now that firefox s awesome bar and google-chrome s omnibox address bars can be used to search the browsing history it makes it much easier for users to search their history for previously visited sites so having clean urls may help the user find sites in their history more easily

206941
google-chrome	firefox
since both firefox and google-chrome search for each space separated word typed into the address bar it could be argued that it isn t necessary for searching that the url be completely human readable but to allow the user to actually read the keywords they are interested in from the url the amount of noise should be kept to a minimum

206942
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are very fast to connect mysql especially and thus usually connect on each request

207014
folder	dir
i think enso does this because they have a dir in their folder called chrome.

207020
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome browser is based on webkit as used by safari

207059
vim	emacs
or from emacs or vim you could run python -c import x where x is the name of your file minus the .py extension

207062
google-chrome	firefox
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base

207112
wan	lan
for the lan wan you can use a combination of the following win32 api calls to tell you whether the remote connection exists without having to deal with a network time-out

207160
postgresql	mysql
bmdhacks is right that if you re using mysql or postgresql it doesn t matter as much since connections are pretty cheap

207350
accessor	properties
use the accessor to set up the private properties of the class in some known way instead of using the classes methods to do so

207424
maven	m2e
all my java projects are built with maven so i use maven to generate an eclipse project with classpaths etc already setup with a simple mvn eclipse m2e

207446
integer	fractions
the three subpatterns that are used more than once are the optional sign the digit sequence for an integer and the decimal fractions

207446
integer	fractions
notice that the decimal fractions pattern is the first place where we can reuse the integer pattern

preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
i don t see how my traversals could change at all since it is really only a matter of where i m proccessing the node that should effect the inorder preorder and postorder

207498
maven	m2e
i am running both maven inside the m2e plugin windows command line and my cygwin command line

207554
post	get
both post and get to a copy on local subdomain with json

invokelater	invokeandwait
invokelater and invokeandwait really must be used when you are doing any interaction with gui components from any thread that is not the edt

207568
swt	swing
that said though i find swing easier to work with at a code level than swt

207648
aptana	radrails
after that you can install radrails from aptana s start page

207648
aptana	radrails
please refer to aptana radrails an ide for rails development published by packt publishing when using radrails

207652
klocwork	coverity
what i d like to know is how the commercial products such as klocwork and coverity stack up against these

207669
versioning	upgrade
according to him it should be very simple to upgrade from fancyupload2 to the new versioning once it s released

207678
cvs	svn
svn cvs very convinient integration

207704
sorting	filtering
enhanced version of content query web part that has the same functionality like a regular list web part views filtering sorting easy to use interface

207720
width	height
in my applications i have a lot of dynamically generated iframe and i want them all do a sort of autoresize at the end of the load event to adjust their height and width

207720
firefox	safari
i ve studied and tested tons of properties regarding document height in firefox ie safari documentelement.clientheight documentelement.offsetheight documentelement.scrollheight body.offsetheight body.scrollheight .

207730
superclass	subclassing
the idea being i can easily create lots of similar subclassing from a number of superclass which have similar characteristics

207824
public	protected
looking at preferences- javascript- appearance- members sort order it seems able to indicate whether a method is public private or protected but all of my use the default marker a blue triangle

207829
comparator	comparable
-it must be an ordered list currently synchronizing on an arraylist although not a sorted list not sorted using comparable or comparator but according to insertion order

207858
installation	upgrade
my only experience with 4 was trying an upgrade on the heavily-customised installation

207871
ubuntu	debian
i use ubuntu debian

207906
ienumerable	icollection
for example the icollection interface implements ienumerable while adding additional methods

207911
free	malloc
each malloc you do has a size-tag in it so you do not need to state the size of the chunk you pointed for free -routine

207989
width	height
yes nilesh - the height and width methods

207996
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg s libavcodec and libavformat are your friend

208003
std	ostream
returning from operator allows the chaining of operator like on std ostream s

208008
versioning	upgrade
2 edit i have upgrade my f# versioning to 1.9.6.2 and still the same consequence

208011
sudo	passwd
the root passwd is disabled and people have to use sudo to get root access

208033
width	height
the loading works ok except that it remains 0 because the width height never change from 0

208033
width	height
i had to override the width height get properties to make it work

208033
width	height
especially since the swf has multiple frames and the frames are of different width height

208044
sudo	passwd
we use the sudo only policy where i work but root passwd are still kept

208233
vim	emacs
you can have all this and some more using separate tools or just a great programmable editor and extra tools like emacs vim as well but has a little less idebility imo

208234
hide	show
i also want to hide the form and show a thank you panel before the redirect takes place however it seems the asp.net engine just does the redirect without doing the 2 tasks before in the following code

208260
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you can do this with brace expansion

208262
hide	show
i d therefore want to be able to access all instances of the plugin within the page and access their show hide validate submit functions in unison

208282
ubuntu	debian
if you are running on a debian or ubuntu system i suggest installing the authbind package which will allow you to grant your program permission to open privileged ports without actually having to give your program any other special permissions

208282
ubuntu	debian
if you re running on any other system i suggest installing debian or ubuntu

208292
put	get
put the spreadsheet on a confluence wiki where we can edit it via webdav and get locking and versioning

208299
vim	emacs
although i know with addins you can probably get a lot of this with emacs and vim

208409
hide	show
hide it client-side with javascript and then do the redirect or do two postbacks first postback to hide the form and show the thank-you and the second to do the redirect once the thank-you has been rendered to the screen

208449
jstl	taglib
as phill mentioned the display tag taglib is very good for this but it s actually really easy to do using jstl

208471
hide	show
i m using jquery to hide and show elements when a radio button group is altered clicked

208503
tcombobox	tmemo
just put a tcombobox and a tmemo on a form and replace the code with this

208569
ant	maven
this means that your project should not rely on any ide-specific files to build but rather use an external build system like maven ant or even make or custom scripts

208588
getter	setter
in myactionclass you will have to declare the property next with its getter and setter

208601
getter	setter
this style of notation is more useful when you mix acessibility for the getter and setter

208601
getter	setter
you could also put an internal setter or even make the getter private and the setter public

208628
hide	show
any window that must be show above some other window specifies that window as its owner when being created - if you have multiple document windows each one gets its own set of owned child windows that you can dynamically show and hide as the document window gains and looses activation

208632
mouse	keyboard
this means that you are using the actual hardware network comms and all but with screen keyboard and mouse reflected to the screen

208707
min	max
each salary component has 3 rules associated with it a calculation rule calculate component as of another component or of a fixed number or a fixed number an eligibility rule whether an employee dept is eligible for a component and a constraint rule which limits tha max and min of a component

208728
ingres	mysql
where there is no mvcc mysql ingres it is a trick to get around locking problems that can slow performance or cause the locking system to run out of locks if not properly tuned

208728
informix	ingres	ingres	mysql
in mysql db2 ingres informix not sure about sql server sybase it can be used to bypass the lock management facility for performance

208730
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled by the user

208730
opera	firefox
for me the following markup produces a checkbox which is checked in ie firefox and opera as you d expect based on the spec

208789
daemon	cron
then your cron job can just try to start the daemon every 30 minutes

208883
put	httpverbs	put	get	post	put	post	get
added a new httpverbs enumeration that contains the most commonly used http verbs get post put delete head

208883
post	put
for example the following snippet shows an action method that can respond to both post and put requests

208907
ftgl	sdl-ttf
that said when i had your problem i eventually went with ftgl as the way sdl-ttf produces an sdl-surface with its font rendered on it overcomplicated matters in my situation

208985
x86	64bit
i am on vista 64bit and i have a project built with x86 configuration

208993
pop-up	dialog
but when i try with ie7 vista the pop-up opens and closes after about a second without displaying the file download dialog

209008
drools	jess
good free rule engines for java is drools some people also like jess which is a clips clone

209051
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning look for bug reports post on the mailing list switch to another product

209110
hide	show
what i want to do is at run time show and hide one of these panes

209110
hide	show
whilst with the following code i can show and hide the view associated with the pane i can t temporarily remove the pane itself

209147
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

209171
bash	tcsh
add it to your .cshrc file for csh and tcsh .profile file for sh and ksh or .bash_profile file for bash

209194
width	height
use a tween to tween the height from 0 to whatever height you want and width from 0 to whatever width you want

209242
hide	show
specifically i need to show hide items on a page depending upon whether the currently logged in user is part of domain groupa in active directory

209246
put	get
you need to get out the string call the function and put it s result in place as above

209353
g++	gcc
gcc g++

209353
perl	tcl
a scripting language bash ruby python tcl perl

209383
put	get
i could make a temp table to put the results in but because there are 80 columns so i would need to make an 80 column temp table just to get 2 columns

209384
delphi	oxygene
if you must move to .net yeah i know you didn t make the decision someone with less information did then i would suggest using delphi for .net or remobjects oxygene

209396
post	get
for me asp.net always worked fine -- if http request contains a valid post i can get to values using request.form.

209422
jobs	cron
we have cron jobs that run every minute and they don t have any noticeable effect on performance

209427
margin	height
to expand on mitchel sellers answer give your content div height 100 and give it a auto margin

209463
bash	tcsh
the tricky part of trying to do this is the fact that the user could have their shell set to anything sh bash csh tcsh and so on and each shell sets up its terminal environment differently

209463
info	dscl
on os x this info is stored in directory services which can be accesed either through the apis in directoryservice.framework or by using the dscl command line tool

209491
firefox	safari
this is only an ie issue as firefox and safari work just fine

209534
vim	emacs
please don t reply i should use ddd nemiver emacs vim or any other front-end i just prefer gdb as it is but would like to see its output with some terminal colors

209553
rss	feed
the final improvement was that if we did want to follow a specific app more closely say after making a change we could subscribe to an rss feed for that specific application until we were satisfied

209569
profiling	instrumentation
assuming you want to profiling a whole app not just a snippet of code and that your app is written in c c++ objective-c not ruby and that you re using xcode 3.0 or higher you should also check out the instrumentation application

209576
boost	stl
i also recommend you learn the stl and boost - the latter is especially useful when writing c++ apps in linux as you get libraries for threading file system regex etc

209576
boost	stl
this is how i got started in linux - i took a windows project and converted to use the stl boost and added a browser-based ui

209601
post	get
web applications using get and post allow users to create view modify and delete their data but do so at a layer above the http commands originally created for these purposes

209624
hide	show
dannysmurf gives you one example - ceditview - of a cview that creates a caret that you can show and hide

209642
put	get	post	put	post	get
get put delete and post are holdovers from an era when sophomores thought that a web page could be reduced to a few hoighty-toity principles

209642
put	get
i would choose to use get or put methods based on efficiency not the underlying multiple paradigms

209705
wtl	atl
obviously there is no atl or wtl in the unix world.

209731
kde	gnome
ideally the solution should allow me to apply a look and feel that looks like the underlying windowing system ie windows lnf for windows gtk lnf for gnome gtk qt lnf for kde qt the default one for other platforms

209731
swt	swing
however swing with gtk lnf would be the best solution to avoid the hassle of swt native libraries and jgoodies extra jars also jgoodies lnf doesn t look as integrated as swing gtk under gnome

209732
put	get
however if i actually put an alert called inside this if statement like line 4 it becomes consistent and i get the result i want

209742
gentoo	linux
i would recommend you to start by using gentoo it should be hard the first weeks but after a while say 2 months and less if you have basic linux understand you will be able to use every distribution and you will know exactly what will happen and how on your system when you press digit something i think that you will be re-paid for this more time learn gentoo is a bit harder then other distros spent on gentoo

209770
min	max
each salary component has 3 rules associated with it a calculation rule calculate component as of another component or of a fixed number or a fixed number an eligibility rule whether an employee dept is eligible for a component and a constraint rule which limits tha max and min of a component

209779
rss	feed
i ll post it in the future so subscribe to this questions rss feed if you want to be informed of the update

209862
opera	firefox
this page displays beautifully in firefox but i get all kinds of problems when testing the site in opera or internet explorer mostly with the menu

209875
pthreads	fork
after posting about this problem online i got some feedback indicating that this should not occur on newer versions of linux since they implement the pthreads fork method using copy-on-write presumably meaning it will only copy pages that it needs to modify when it is required instead of the entire address space immediately

209945
ws-addressing	soap
has several protocols and technologies relating to it wsdl xsds soap ws-addressing

209945
put	get
for example to obtain a resource you use http get to put a resource on the server you use http put

209945
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest is a very simple in that it uses http get post and put methods to update resources on the server

209981
cpu	processors
this loop repeats infinitely until some state of some game element or input tells it to stop or quit. this approach keeps the cpu and graphics card pretty busy hence the market for gamer machines with fast processors and even faster graphics cards

210003
gridview	rowdatabound
then use the gridview rowdatabound event to discover the label and assign its text

210035
post	get
otherwise html entities will get converted to their character representation when the post is rendered

210081
tabcontrol	tabitem
note that the visibility of our tabitem will not be affected while that tabcontrol is in view so we can apply styles only when the tabcontrol visibility changes

210096
ubuntu	linux
if you are using ubuntu linux there was a patch added to the python-mysql package that added the ability to set that same mysql_opt_reconnect option see here

210105
hide	show
using states you can selectively show and hide components

210117
hide	show
instead of actually using roles to hide show certain controls i would suggest having another layer of permissions for each role and show hide based on those instead

210180
opera	firefox
edit i am on a debian box only on firefox i see this code i just tried opera this code doesn t appear in opera really strange never heard of firefox having such problems

210235
xsl-fo	xslt
you need an xslt transform for html to xsl-fo

210240
gentoo	linux
no solution here but as a datapoint it doesn t look at all like that for me firefox 3.0.3 in gentoo linux

210254
post	put
edit as noted in another post you can put something in the general version to give you a more useful error message if an unsupported cast is performed

210272
client-side	server-side
going beyond that it can become even more complex keeping your client-side script in sync with server-side support

210282
implements	extends
specificdto would extends or implements dto

210352
int	double
the js number representation is a standard ieee double so you can t represent a 64 bit int

210352
int	double
iirc you get maybe 48 bits of actual int precision in a double but all js bitops reduce to 32bit precision that s what the spec requires

210363
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i thought i d let the exception bubble up as the exceptions thrown argumentexception or argumentnullexception by int.parse would be the same exceptions that i would throw in my method anyway

210371
ubuntu	linux
i can download the file just fine using firefox or ftp in passive mode on ubuntu dapper linux

210375
rss	feed
i have been attempting to write some routines to read rss and atom feed using the new routines available in system.servicemodel.syndication but unfortunately the rss20feedformatter bombs out on about half the feed i try with the following exception

210375
rss	feed
this seems to occur whenever the rss feed expresses the publish date in the following format

210400
freebsd	linux
the site says ratproxy is currently believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments but i ve only used it on linux

210412
equals	gethashcode
as you are using at least .net 2.0 i recommend implement equals and gethashcode on stepdoc

210515
postgresql	mysql
i d like to find a very generic way of doing this that would work in mysql oracle postgresql etc

210643
pop-up	dialog
just calling click doesn t seem to do anything or at least it doesn t pop-up a file selection dialog

210685
put	get	post	put	post	get
restful web services chapter 8 section overloading post reads if you want to do without put and delete altogether itâ s entirely restful to expose safe operations on resources through get and all other operations through overloaded post

210685
post	put
in short replacing put delete in favor of post makes the api harder to read and put delete calls are no longer idempotent

210693
prepare	execute
the sql statement is sent to the database server when you do prepare and the parameters are sent separately when you do execute

210693
prepare	execute
you will circumvent the benefits of prepare queries by interpolating variables into the sql string before execute

210693
prepare	execute
internally if you use pdo attr_emulate_prepares pdo makes a copy of the sql query and interpolates parameter values into it before doing the prepare and execute

210740
integer	unsigned
so what i did here was casting m to a c 32-bit unsigned integer and retrieving its value back in python format

210765
phpunit	simpletest
write a shell script to run phpunit simpletest tests to be called by item 4a

210778
google-chrome	firefox
when i go to it in firefox or google-chrome it says connection partially encrypted

210824
post	get
curl -- gives you very good control over get post and many other attributes

210842
keydown	keyup
i ve been able to achieve keyboard triggering with creative shifting of focus in and out of the control between keydown keypress keyup events

210850
np-hard	np-complete
np-hard np-complete is a way of showing that certain classes of problems are not solvable in realistic time

210888
np-hard	np-complete
that doesn t mean that you can t solve a particular instance of an np-complete or np-hard problem

210979
width	height
i m not sure what part of the cycle you re trying to grab the height and width and is it of the loader object or the loaded content but you can can access the height and width of the loaded object using swfloader.loaderinfo.height and swfloader.loaderinfo.width

211034
command-pattern	memento
remembering object oriented design courses i immediately thought of memento and command-pattern

211049
superclass	subclassing
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclassing of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass

211051
width	height
edit so i took a debugger to the panel object and manually inspected the non-object properties and i didn t see anything that resembled width height

211051
width	height	awt	swing
edit 2 so swing classes are subclasses of awt classes so i imagine if you re able to find the height width of those the approach would generalize

211060
getter	setter
for things like trivial getter and setter share the comment between then and describe the purpose of the property not of the getter setter

211071
folder	directory
i have a vb .net 2005 winform application and each time i do an installer build it deletes overwrites the _svn folder in the directory

211078
tooltip	scrollbar
edit in response to the comments it sounds like you re trying to have the tooltip appear without affecting the positioning of existing elements and thus causing the scrollbar on the main window

211083
width	height
css specify the tooltip s width and height add overflow hidden or overflow scroll to it

211093
mp4	h.264
there s no real advantage to one over the other for a simple program either way x264 only takes a single type of input raw yv12 video and spits out a single type of output h.264 elementary streams or in the case of the cli app it can also mux mp4 and matroska

211095
width	height
generally you get the exact size of a component via the getsize method which returns a dimension object containing width and height but getwidth height should work too

211151
width	height
you can use a hidden div positioned at 0 0 with width and height set to 100 as a yardstick to measure the client area of the screen

211154
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
it only checks for gif bmp jpg and png files

211198
getter	setter
it made life difficult to document setter and getter

211245
cvs	svn
before proceeding further i need to confess that all this was done in vs6 + cvs and of late svn

211306
traceroute	packets
traceroute transmits packets with small ttl time to live values

211306
traceroute	packets
by using small ttl values the packets will quickly expire so traceroute causes all routers along a packets s path to generate the icmp messages that identify the router

211343
gentoo	linux
for instance in gentoo linux you would do the following from the command line to get a list of possible package updates

211361
mvp	presenter
i still start by envisioning user actions that i want to implement if you ve got usecases that s a great way to start and using a mvp or mvc-ish model i start with writing a test for the presenter of the first screen

211385
tunnel	vpn
there is a vpn tunnel between the service s and the client s machines but they do not use the same active directory

211400
addclass	removeclass
best using addclass and removeclass in this scenario

211419
typedef	using-declaration
typedef names and using-declaration

211468
getter	setter
for things like trivial getter and setter share the comment between then and describe the purpose of the property not of the getter setter

211505
vbscript	vba
vbscript has a lot in common with vba so it should not take long create something usable and there is a great deal of help available for asp and vbscript on the internet

211535
openbsd	freebsd
also thanks for the tip about strcasestr and checking out other implementations from other sources like openbsd freebsd etc.

211564
extjs	mootools
personally i always used to say something like gallery or some other os script but recently i have found myself using more and more something like a simple php script which just spits our a list of images maybe 7 a page but relying on a javascript library such as mootools or extjs to provide all the functionality particularly for small or individual galleries

211566
pop-up	dialog
it all depends on the kind of pop-up from system s message box to custom dialog

211587
nsis	uninstaller
see nsis s page on add remove programs for more details on uninstaller registry keys

211658
apache	nginx
i do not know what your use case is but you may find nginx is a worthwhile alternative to apache as a load-balanced http reverse proxy in front of tomcat

211659
junit	jmockit
i want to use jmockit s incremental test runner instead of the standard junit test runners from within eclipse

211671
post	get
make sure that the request is a post request not a get

211673
openbsd	freebsd
for example of glib glibc openbsd freebsd etc

211674
hide	show
in windows explorer the file extension for links lnk is never show even if you have disabled the hide extensions for known file types feature

211722
versioning	upgrade
also if you want these settings to persist between assembly versioning ie be upgradable you will need to upgrade the settings on application startup

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
next unless some poor soul has already made an fckeditor xhtml - xsl-fo xslt for your xsl-fo implementation you ll have to make one

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
that involves learning xsl-fo xslt and xpath

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt formatting objects xsl-fo an xml vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
anything as long as it isn t fighting html xsl-fo fop xslt and xpath

211949
dlsym	dlopen
on unixy platforms the equivalents are dlopen and dlsym

211951
dlsym	dlopen
you can use the posix dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose functions in linux unix to dynamically open shared libraries and access the symbols including functions they provide see the man page for details

212006
put	get
if inside the same project i include this header from more than one cpp file i get an error saying multiple definition of test_ns testclass testmethod while if i put the method definition inside the class body this does not happen

212008
rss	feed
i had to recently build some rss feed and part of that included going over the xml schema including the items for webmaster and managingeditor both of which are defined as an e-mail address matching this pattern

212009
awt	swing
the thread dump showed that there are a couple of non-daemon threads notably swing s edt awt and a couple of websart related threads

212034
awt	swing
the console window is used to see stdout err of the webstart process as well as rudimentary log debug but has the side effect of created a top-level awt swing window

212053
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
if you want to teach sorting algorithms then you should really be teaching quicksort mergesort insertsort and possibly even heapsort so that students can get a feel for the tradeoffs between various sorting methods

212072
quicksort	mergesort
it s also a great example of why simple solutions are not always the best which could lead into a discussion of more interesting and faster sorts like mergesort and quicksort

212088
awt	swing
however there are recurrent problems with leaks including within the implementation of awt and swing

212088
daemons	systemd
the webstart thread should all be daemons when there are no systemd windows console javax.jnlp services and other dialogs showing

212109
mouse	keyboard
what would be really helpful is a logging tool that keeps track of mouse and keyboard actions and possibly also stores the properties of components that have been clicked the aut is written in java

212142
toolbar	tabs
rather than spending hours choosing and customising a set of toolbar you have access to everything through the tabs

212143
versioning	upgrade
the business problem is really that they need an incentive to upgrade and so they keep adding new features who do you know that uses all the features of word and then they need to find ways to present those without making the application impossibly cluttered which was certainly happening in the previous versioning of office

212166
quicksort	heapsort
introsort short for introspective sort starts as a quicksort and switches to a heapsort if the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the logarithm of the number of elements being sorted

212219
rdf	owl
it features semantic data in rdf owl skos n3 syntax

212345
short	base
cycorp have a short description of how their cyc knowledge base derives meaning from sentences

212374
sudo	passwd
aside from the sudo policy which is probably better there is no reason why each admin couldn t have their own account with uid 0 but named differently with a different passwd and even different home directory

212387
google-chrome	firefox
if it runs fast in firefox or google-chrome then it s a javascript issue for sure

212387
google-chrome	firefox
we had a sharepoint page that took 10 seconds to render in ie and sub 1 second in firefox and google-chrome

212524
hash	md5
one option would be to store the hash sha1 md5 of the password instead of the clear-text password and whenever you want to see if the password is good just compare it to that hash

212535
hash	md5
otherwise use hash sha1 or md5 like others have said here

212550
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is in the title - ie is misbehaving and is saying that there is a script running slowly - firefox and google-chrome don t have this problem

212587
onfocus	onblur	onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur	mouse	keyboard
weâ ve looked at various ways to utilize the onfocus onblur onchange keyboard and mouse events to attempt to solve the problem but still some issues

212589
hash	salt
c hash the combined password salt

212589
hash	salt
d append the salt to the resultant hash

212589
hash	salt
this approach means you don t need to store the salt separately and then recompute the hash using the salt value and the plaintext password value obtained from the user

212589
hash	salt
this using salt hash will provide the illusion of security more than any actual security

212589
hash	salt
since you need both the salt and the choice of hash algorithm to generate the hash and to check the hash it s unlikely an attacker would have one but not the other

212624
super	implements
the same will go for methods that implements an interface 1.6 and above only or override a super class s method

212693
int	chars
but for objects that are primitive types int chars etc. i think that compilers can be quite aggressive in optimizing

212762
width	height
i need generate thumbnails for a bunch of jpegs 200 000+ but i want to make sure all of my thumbs have a equal height and width

212809
hash	salt
if you want to make it more robust when a user verifies their email change the hex digest to just be a hash of the email address itself with no salt

212830
memset	malloc
piecewise construction of objects can also be a lot slower than one dirty great memset of the aforementioned malloc ed array of structs

212831
informix	ingres	ingres	oracle
the first informix sql-based dbms was released in 1985 so it also has longevity and pedigree similar to oracle db2 ingres sybase

212831
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
it runs on unix and derivatives solaris aix hp-ux linux and macos x as well as on windows xp vista etc

212900
yacc	bison
i ve used lex and yacc more usually bison in the past for various projects usually translators such as a subset of edif streamed into an eda app

212930
yacc	bison
one major difference is that antlr generates an ll parser whereas yacc and bison both generate parsers that are lalr

212930
yacc	bison
antlr is generally considered to be easier to use than yacc bison for precisely this reason

212944
geocoding	geocode
most of the services also restrict the number of geocoding queries you can make per day so it s ok to look up addresses of say new customers who get added to your database but if you run a batch job that feeds thousands of addresses from your database into the geocode you re going to get shutoff

212973
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up change transport to smart device

this includes the more recent firefox and safari and opera browsers

213035
decoder	encoder
they also provide g729 decoder and encoder written in c

213107
inline	inlining
the second snippet works because you ve inline the definition of the function which means that even if the compiler doesn t generate any inline code for the function say you ve got inlining turned off or the compiler decides the function is too big to inline the code generated for the function definition will be visible in the translation unit only as if you d stuck it in an anonymous namespace

213146
int	chars
advice is to use class if it is expected t will always be a class with typename if other types int chars whatever may be expected

213157
vb6	vba
granted its been a while since i ve done classic vb6 and my vba experience is even rustier.

udp	tcp
it s perfectly possible to do your own secure communications over udp you don t have to use tcp

213374
folder	directory
the resharper plugins are in the v4.1 bin plugins directory -- do i set my output directory to that folder run it then start another instance of visual studio

213380
hash	salt
the products i work on use something like a user name or phone number to salt the hash

213380
hash	salt
now if i know how to apply the correct salt to a password to generate the hash i d do it because a salt really just extends the length complexity of the hash phrase

213425
superclass	subclassing
- subclassing need to know about the injections needed by their superclass

213449
perl	tcl
swig which has already been mentioned is a tool that helps automate the wrapping process it can take your c++ code and create a wrapper that allows it to be loaded into a number languages such as tcl perl python ruby .

213489
hash	salt
here is a simple example showing why it is bad to have the same salt for each hash

213510
int	double
this creates an expression tree for the lambda a function taking an int and returning the double

213530

213617
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
check into the boyer-moore and knuth-morris-pratt algorithms for more efficient ways of searching for substrings -- both as low as o n

213621
min	max
a where clause that uses a function other than min or max or an operator with an indexed key does not make available the access path that uses the index except with function-based indexes

213638
children	parent
but ultimately i d like to come up with an abstract parent datacontext in linq whose children can register which table types they want observed so i can have events such as beforeupdate and afterupdate but specific to types

213649
typedef	struct
if i have a typedef for a struct that makes use of it for some reason.

213685
pascal	delphi
it s written in delphi might be compilable after some minor tweaks with a modern pascal compiler

213730
hex	binary
instead i was able to write conversion code to convert binary to hex encoded strings

213779
hash	md5
good practice is storing only a one-way hash of the password in the database -- typically md5 or better sha1

213816
punctuation	words
what i want to do is check for duplicated words right next to each other but even if there is punctuation in between

213826

contrary to other claims the n character is mapped to the correct platform end of line sequence only if the stream is going to a file std cin and std cout being special but still files or file-like

214136
comparator	comparable
with a treemap it s trivial to provide a custom comparator thus overriding the semantics provided by comparable objects added to the map

214162
postgresql	mysql
at that point you should think about migrating the database to postgresql or mysql because they ll be able to handle concurrent requests much faster

214164
codeigniter	cakephp
although i personally love cakephp and i ve done many projects for clients running on shared hosts and it runs just fine if a light footprint is really important for you codeigniter would be my choice

214199

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all the test i run are made over ie 7 firefox 2 and 3 safari google-chrome and the stand alone player

214333
vbscript	jscript
however vbscript or jscript used with the winows scripting host works just as well and requires nothing additional to install

214344
interbase	firebird
interbase and firebird need to set the sql dialect to 3 to support delimited identifiers

214382
put	get
put your startup.m in any of those directories and it will be found whenever you start matlab startup.m is also found if it is in the directory from which matlab is started but the technique above allows you to start matlab from an arbitrary directory and still have startup.m get run

214650
uninstall	upgrade
the upgrade element inside the product element combined with proper scheduling of the action will perform the uninstall you re after

214696
zlib	libpng
if you go with libpng you ll also need zlib and if you re using devkitpro you ll probably run into some missing functions from playing with the code for 5 minutes it looks like it relies on pow which doesn t seem to be in libnds. i have no idea what the official nintendo sdk offers in the way of a standard library - you might be in better shape if that s what you re using

214710
superclass	subclassing
the superclass doesn t know about any of its subclassing

214794
hash	md5
#1 there are several different ways you can compute the md5 hash

214830
getter	setter
i don t document getter setter or anything done by the book

214835

hide	show
i would like to use jquery s show hide feature to minimize the table but still show part of the top and bottom rows

215219
hide	show
if javascript is on then it hide the middle table rows and adds the show hide links

215238
hide	show
to get it to degrade nicely you d have to have all the rows show initially and then hide them with your jquery document ready function and also create the row with the link in

215251
many-to-many	one-to-many
edit tvanfosson changed from many-to-many to one-to-many since each venue is associated with a single city

215257

i have a custom uiview that generates a set of subviews and display them in rows and columns like tiles

215383
uiview	subviews
i tried moving the functionality into a custom tile class a sub uiview which the class above would create and add as a subviews

215422
int	chars
that s just a matter of the way the spec defines enum declarations - the part after the colon has to be the integral-type production which is one token of sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars .

215422
bitconverter	binaryreader
the .net framework designers have followed this pattern good examples being in the bitconverter binaryreader and convert classes

215445

but even if you put debug if you disable the log for the module in question you dont get any messages from it

215457
titlebar	window
i am looking for a way to display a modal window in wpf the same way as a window in cocoa can be displayed as a sheet it slides down from the titlebar in front of the main parent window

215457
titlebar	window
my guess is that this would be accomplished by having the modal window as a user control which is loaded into a panel when displayed and that this panel is the one which would be animated somehow from the titlebar

215473
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
os x has many webkit-based browsers safari shiira icab omniweb as well as firefox seamonkey camino and opera

215473
opera	firefox
even if you test with mozilla firefox opera and konqueror from kde 4 on windows you re not even close to covering most of the userbase

215473
webkit	gecko
that being said if you narrow your focus to browsers with support for modern css you ll find that there s only a few underlying engines trident ie gecko mozilla webkit apple khtml kde and presto opera

215473
google-chrome	safari
webkit used by safari shiira icab omniweb google-chrome epiphany-webkit kazehakase-webkit arora

215473
google-chrome	safari
rendering should be completely consistent across all os x browsers as they use the system-provided webkit library but safari and google-chrome on windows have very different drawing engines underneath and on linux there s both gtk+ and qt versions with different behavior

215494
opencms	alfresco
open source examples would be things like alfresco bricolage and opencms which you can take a look at to get a feel for what this space does

215498
antivirus	norton
it s been my experience that some security software like symantec s norton antivirus oftentimes prohibit their removal from a windows system via the add or remove programs utility going so far as to occasionally require a removal program obtained from symantec s homepage

215534
folder	directory
right click the desktop and navigate to new and then from the sub-menu select shortcut â browse to the windows directory or folder and then to the system32 directory and click ok

215539
norton	mcafee
norton is not the only one that does this however mcafee and norton are the only ones who make it almost impossible to remove the software

215539
antivirus	norton
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove

215539
norton	mcafee
norton and mcafee are some of the most invasive resource hogs that you can never get out of your system once installed

215545
delphi	oxygene
2- a partial reuse of your existing delphi business layer code by using oxygene from remobjecs a visual studio plugin with a syntax that is very similar to the delphi syntax

215575
queue	fifo
implements a circular buffer style fifo queue

215579
getter	setter
for example if you were writing a cd player and wanted the go find info about this cd bit customizable rather than make those methods public you d put all that functionality into its own object and make just your object getter setter public

215579
public	protected
many languages find the hierarchical nature of public protected private to be too limiting and not in line with reality

215603
mouseup	mousedown

google-chrome	safari
konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and google-chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta

215754
objectdatasource	detailsview
this is off the top of my head but i believe you could connect your class to an objectdatasource component which would in turn connect to a detailsview control

215766
folder	directory
due to legacy issues i have two folder under app_code directory

215778
codeigniter	kohana
as a result several people took up a huge interest in getting their contributions in and while kohana is based on all the same principles and ideas as codeigniter the implementation is much better and much easier to work with

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i m wondering if there s any way to have firefox 3 or ie 7 or safari 3.1 or opera flag that a redirect has occurred any deltas between the hyperlink or url entered into address bar and the page you land on whether you ve arrived from a hyperlink or entering url into address bar

216078
hex	binary
hex editors are made to view and edit binary files

216079
hex	binary
as for showing the raw binary values you need a hex editor like xvi32

216088
lisp	smalltalk
and some of them support functions as first class citizens languages in that area are ecl embbedabble common lisp iirc gnu smalltalk gst smalltalk has blocks then there are libraries for closures e.g in glib2

216088
haskell	ocaml
well or you can go learning ocaml haskell mozart oz or the like

216089
hex	binary
you could always open a file binary or text file there really is no difference in a hex editor and look at the raw binary data

216156
haskell	scheme
the semantics of functional programming could certainly be added to the c compiler but by the time you were done you d essentially have the equivalent of one of the existing functional languages such as scheme haskell etc

216157
width	height
for things like width height you can verify them with is_numeric and with the rest you can run the values through htmlentities and construct your own tag from the information

svg	vml
if you want to display a chart directly in your web page you could possibly use either vml vector markup language or svg scalable vector graphics

216379
svg	vml
vml is supported by ie whereas svg is supported by many other browsers although ie can display svg by means of a plugin

216379
svg	vml
google maps for example uses vml when running in ie and svg for other browsers

216379
svg	vml
both vml and svg use an xml format for defining the grahical charts you want to display

216381
postgresql	mysql

216459
mouse	keyboard
if you have a linux or windows pc already then you probably have a monitor usb mouse and usb keyboard

here s one way to do it using mouseenter mousemove and mouseleave to trigger the necessary redraws

216724
stateless	stateful
but again the stateless tier has some sort of rule s that it uses to contact the stateful tier

216733
required	placeholder
working around it either required you to write the expression manually or to use a delegate as a placeholder

216733
put	get
the get expression is where you put your extension stuff orderbywhatever first etc.

using the data url in the img src doesn t work in ie but it does in firefox and opera

216805
ubuntu	debian
on debian including ubuntu will not work because that points at usr share tomcat6 which has no link to var log tomcat6

216841
opensuse	linux
i have used c# in visual studio with .net and i have played around a little with mono on opensuse linux but i don t really understand how it works

216848
cvs	svn
for a small team svn is best in my experience i ve used cvs svn and vss in the past

216995
folder	directory
say i want to copy the contents of a directory excluding files and folder whose names contain the word music

217102
post	get
post methods have post parameters but get methods do not

217119
client-side	server-side
not only that -- with most client-side models they have direct access to your server-side model which defeats the purpose of your server-side mvc

217119
client-side	server-side
this way you can build helpers on the server-side that sit between your client-side app and any existing controllers

217137
width	height
the application object has a hwndaccessapp that probably can be used with some windows api call to find out its width and height

217198
temp	tmp
many machines have multiple hostile users -- think shared web host -- and many scripts and applications need to safely create temp files and directories in the shared tmp directory

217230
informix	ingres	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	postgresql	informix
my engine works on postgresql aka postgresql ingres db2 informix sybase and oracle - oh and ants

217230
informix	ingres	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	postgresql	informix
oracle varchar x sybase text db2 long varchar informix lvarchar postgresql varchar x ants varchar x ingres varchar x y

217284
hash	md5
otherwise simply taking the first 8-10 characters of the guid or sha1 md5 hash of the guid is probably your best bet

217292
kate	kde	kate	kdevelop
and by extension any other kde program that uses kate as an embedded kpart kwrite quanta+ kdevelop

217307
ant	cruisecontrol
continuous builds with cruisecontrol ant and phpunit

217317
postgresql	mysql
long experience with java and databases an example post postgresql mysql oracle differences has taught me that the jdbc drivers we use in doing this work frequently have problems

217322
min	max
you have to do it in o n time because you need to loop through all n of the elements to check them because any one of the elements may be the min or max

217322
min	max
in other words you need to loop through all elements and do the max and min check like you have

217330
min	max
profile your code first to find the real bottleneck before you worry about optimizing your max min algorithms

217330
min	max
doing it all in one loop is more efficient than calling max then min which takes 2 n time

217330
min	max
the most efficient min max algorithm is one where min max is recalculated every time an element is added or taken away from the list

217330
min	max
getting the min max in that structure is o 1 or o log n depending what tree style you use

217409
objectdatasource	detailsview
once you have that class definition you can connect it to a form via an objectdatasource component and a detailsview control

217440
reentrantlock	reentrantreadwritelock
jdk 6 even contains information about reentrantlock and reentrantreadwritelock

217463
pop-up	dialog
when a fatal crash occurs in my code the crashrpt dialog box pop-up and when i enter my email address and click the send button it takes me to a save file dialog box where i can save the zipped package and the account specified in the install function never receives an email

217508
min	max
although it s still an o n algorithm you can do it 25 faster that is the proportionality constant is 3 2 vs 2 by comparing adjacent elements pairwise first then comparing the smaller to min and the larger to max

217514
disk	ram
when the size of the array to be sorted approaches or exceeds the available primary memory so that much slower disk or swap space must be employed the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in ram may become impractical

217514
disk	ram
for example the popular recursive quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate ram but due to the recursive way that it copies portions of the array it becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in ram because it may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk

217528
post	put
i agree with the post advocating for embedding your enum in a class but there are cases where it makes more sense to not do that but please at least put it in a namespace

217594
config	ini
we have done loading config files based on the same server_name server_port combination but found that it s another file you have to maintain plus we weren t sure on the speed of parsing ini files although having extra cases for each server may be just as slow

217600
ingres	postgresql
i did some work on this back when i was a researcher under michael stonebraker - you know the professor who came up with ingres postgresql etc

217607
concave	convex
edit by the way this method works with concave and convex polygons

217623
allocator	stl
i think you can preallocate a certain number of elements for stl containers thus having a constant memory allocator cost if you know how many elements will be in the container

217649
button	checkbox
for example push button and checkbox use the class name button the edit control edit etc

217659
implements	extends
i m working on a custom cms for my own use and was thinking about implements a plugin system so i could extends the code a little easier

217672
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
since your container is a list but with some other things i would inherited from list and add your additional properties to your subclassing

217683
vim	kate
in bash and vim i use lucida typewriter but in kate scintilla eclipse and netbeans i currently use lucida casual a proportional font

217708
config	ini
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

217783
pseudo-class	visited
links appear as visited when the browser chooses to apply the visited css pseudo-class

217783
pseudo-class	visited
i think a better solution would be to tweak the page style so the visited pseudo class renders the same as the link pseudo-class

217814
min	max
examples from t-sql include min max and sum

217827
jboss	glassfish
we are considering jboss and glassfish

217836
jboss	geronimo
a comparison table between jboss geronimo and tomcat for latter 2007

217836
jboss	geronimo
packages found in jboss and geronimo

217836
jboss	geronimo
bottom line jboss geronimo and

217843
jboss	glassfish
you won t go wrong with either glassfish or jboss

217899
client-side	server-side
it s up to you to choose this or the client-side approach as mentioned in the comments here just wanted to point out that server-side is still possible

217910
config	ini
the creators of the .net framework want you to use xml-based config files rather than ini files

217921
temp	tmp
temp tmp input i never really use foo and bar

217940
post	get
i have some code where i capture the faulted en unknownmessagereceived event but even when i post a wrong message to a particular service i never get the event

217949
width	height
move the tiles using a modulo of the tile width and tile height as position so that the tile will reposition itself at its starting pos when it have moved exactly one tile in length

217966
mouseover	mouseout
jquery also has an alternative syntax for doing mouseover mouseout stuff called hover

217998
width	font-size
if textbox contents were returned with line-breaks representing where word-wrapping occurs that result will be dependant on style font-size width of the textbox etc. rather than what the user actually entered

218004
udp	tcp
typically for tcp udp comms you always convert data to network byte order using the htons function and ntohs and their related functions

218013
boost	stl
it s not stl or boost but since you have two cstring s it seems the most reasonable method to use

218031
mouse	keyboard
so as others pointed out you will have to talk to the 8042-compatible keyboard mouse controller directly

218031
mouse	keyboard
unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler

218047
post	get
you d need to post any and all constructors in the class to get a definitive answer

218081
min	max
iterate over all points of the polygon and find the min max values of x and y

218081
concave	convex
here are examples of solid ones one convex one concave

218082
post	put
you can google for the instructions i put on my blog or drop me a line and i ll post the vanity link

218083
profiling	benchmarking
jxinsight s probes technology is also the only one that could even run in production considering that we out perform netbeans profiling by 20x and yourkit 100x in specjvm2008 benchmarking

218184
put	get
i answer to my own question thanks to philho who put me on the right track an article from codeproject with the right algorithm to get a window icon wether it s java or not

218204
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
as an example the various argument validation exceptions argumentexception argumentnullexception argumentoutofrangeexception etc are suitable for use in application code but accessviolationexception isn t

218244
put	get
you ll also get this error if you try and add a datasource and your project doesn t have any datasources in the project s root if you ve put all your datasource classes in a subfolder

218294
cvs	svn
if you don t have cvs svn at work there are free options available

218326
hide	show
you may have to tweak the code and hide show the rectangle but basically this is it

218398
equals	icomparable
i used icomparable originally because i needed to sort them on certain criteria but overriding equals worked perfectly for .contains

218417
post	get
if you do this though make sure so set the method parameter to get as the default method for prototype ajax requests is post

218435
equals	gethashcode
also remember if you are going to override equals that you need to also override gethashcode as well

218438
postgresql	mysql
i would look into mysql and or postgresql

218441
accessor	properties
bear in mind that while taking the value for comparison inside your handler code you might get into an infinite loop you call the properties accessor which calls the aop handler which calls the accessor and so on so you might need to reflect into the class containing this properties to attain the backing field

218488
boost	stl
boost or stl tr1 from vs9 with featurepack are also possible

218527
cvs	svn
the only options i m aware of that meet your requirements are cvs and svn

218540
hide	show
in card layout you can add multiple panels in the same place but then show or hide one panel at a time

218543
cvs	svn
i ve used both cvs and svn to great effect for home projects

218543
cvs	svn
although svn is generally seeing greater use throughout the industry if you don t have any problems with cvs i would worry too much about the distinction

218544
solaris	aix
it s great to have the newer tools in your toolbox but if you don t know the old school way then you re going to be in a world of hurt if you re ever on a aix solaris hp-ux etc system which doesn t have the newer tools and may not even have bash

218544
solaris	aix	centos	linux	centos	solaris
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

218558
hash	md5
the function hash can be any hash function for example the function md5 from digest md5

218563
clistctrl	cdialog
i have an mfc clistctrl in a cdialog and i need to add to the clistctrl the tap and hold behavior

218613
spweb	spsite
i really need to find the source of these spsite spweb leaks and fix them but i can t just start editing code that may or may not be the source of the problem

218625
cpython	ironpython
these are implementation details of cpython so this probably does not work in other implementations of python such as ironpython and jython

218628
post	get
http basically i know there are more has two methods to request data get and post

218640
spweb	spsite
take a look at troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007

218699
sproutcore	cappuccino
an interesting comment in another thread compares jquery dojo prototype mootools sproutcore and cappuccino the question was removed

218760
children	parent
the parent div in this example will not expand to contain its floated children - it will appear to have height 0

218855
hash	md5
assembly version is the intended mechanism for this but you could roll your own by comparing an md5 hash of the gac assembly with the md5 of your latest version

218959
typedef	struct
i only had to change the first typedef to a struct

218972
spweb	spsite
also it is unneccessary to dispose of certain spsite and spweb objects if they are obtained from the spcontext class

219072
spweb	spsite
make sure all custom code properly disposes spweb and spsite objects using this

219110
web.py	cherrypy
what do i need to know install and do if i want to run a web framework say web.py or cherrypy on my basic cgi configuration

219116
versioning	upgrade
i would still say upgrade from vb6 directly to .net 3.5 actually .net 3.5 sp1 and vs2008 as long as your client operating systems support that versioning of the framework otherwise you will need to choose the lowest common framework versioning which very well may be .net 2.0

219124
fastcgi	scgi
flup is another way to run with wsgi for any webserver that can speak fastcgi scgi or ajp

219131
put	get
it s pretty painless if you get past the put the certificate in the store and give the correct user access to it part

219154
mouse	keyboard
in particular check out adam chapweske s resources on keyboard and mouse programming

219224
post	get
on advantage of doing it this way is that you can change from a get to a post without changing the url

219231
put	get
i hope once you put this data in db after that all you will get delta of information not 25 gb of flat file

219305
versioning	upgrade
that is if i link against versioning 4.3.2.100 my program should still work if the user upgrade bigcorp s app so that the .dll is versioning 4.3.3.20

219305
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
continuing my previous example my build machine has versioning 4.3.3.20 installed but i want the .dll it generates to be compatible with installation that haven t upgrade and only have versioning 4.3.2.100 installed

219335
installation	upgrade
update april 12th 2010 with the release of team foundation server 2010 the installation and upgrade procedures have improved a lot

219363
width	height
make sure your height and width properties are defined for each cell of your table

219373
put	get
if you put the values in the .resx file by default they get compiled into your assembly or a satellite resource assembly

219431
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
what i need to know is how to close a datareader or if there is a need at all to close that is specified in the selectstatement attribute of the sqldatasource or objectdatasource tags

219506
mouse	keyboard
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs

219506
hide	show
note that the display none check is necessary because once an error field is show and then it needs to be hidden extjs will simply hide error field instead of entirely removing it from the dom tree

219541
filtering	grouping
instead of a factory that returns a grouping object consider filtering adding some filtering objects that require less granular configuration

219599
super	implements
then in 6 months when your app is super famous and getting dugg and slashdotted and you decide you need more than a single connection all you have to do is implements some pooling in the getconnection method

219620
hex	binary
in terms of representing arbitrary binary data as text base64 is more efficient than plain hex

219628
put	get
but the put and get functions require a default value and i do not want to spread default values all over the source files

219704
interbase	firebird
interbase and firebird developer s for visual studio .net

219704
interbase	firebird
firebird - interbase .net mono providers

219706
jar	manifest.mf
we get around this problem by deploying a main jar file myapp.jar which contains a manifest manifest.mf file specifying a classpath with the other required jars which are then deployed alongside it

219706
folder	directory
so if you deploy the main jar into some directory and then put the dependent jars into a lib folder beneath that the manifest looks like

219729
flexunit	puremvc	flexunit	cairngorm	cairngorm	puremvc
if you re already using an mvc framework like cairngorm or puremvc flexunit should integrate pretty painlessly

219834
interbase	firebird
i do not recommend using a driver designed for firebird as interbase and firebird have somewhat different sql syntaxes and differ in other features as well

219835
accessor	properties
compare to the same for properties vs fields since properties before the same function as events encapsulation via accessor

219917
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

219922
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
either autoresetevent or manualresetevent

219922
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
the difference between the two is that autoresetevent lets one thread proceed each time it is set while manualresetevent releases all waiting threads on set

219929
getter	setter
having a setter and getter isn t really any better than having a variable at that level of visibility

219929
public	protected
therefore you could just make the variable itself protected and the reader public

220026
actionscript	mxml
i am attempting to import mxml files that i developed with emacs into a new project in flexbuilder...i have created a project and manually added all my mxml and actionscript files into flexbuilder

220050
hash	salt
also add a salt to the password before you hash it

220066
client-side	server-side
you ll need something like cometd on the server side and a client-side library that groks server-side push

220075
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
so a few questions for the cruisecontrol.net folks the msbuild folks and the mbunit folks

220077
hash	salt
the way i see it i will have to either allow the client to receive the hash + any salt information or use a separate pin password and allow the client to receive the hash+salt for that password

220081
post	get
if you are reading out of your textarea post you can use the explode function using the newline character as your separator to get each line in the variable as a new element of an array then you can do explode on your array elements

220082
hash	salt
the real solution is to hash salt and then store the passwords

220089
jboss	glassfish
glassfish v3 still in beta has a microkernel so is jboss 5 architecture

220089
jboss	glassfish
books and other 3rd party products are available for jboss but not for glassfish

220157
client-side	server-side
so you could server-side customize hack the wp_list_pages function but here s a client-side option if you so choose

220164
xslt	xquery
i think i heard all those limitations were adressed in the xslt 2.0 specification sadly ms decided not to implement it and promote xquery instead

220179
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
however whatever route you decide to go i d still recommend to not add the mbunit as part of your build step but add it as a separate step in cruisecontrol.net

220187
rss	feed
what i want to do is similar to word clouds built from a url or rss feed that you find on the web except i don t want the visualization

220204
public	protected
variables aren t subclassed at all they don t go into the dispatch table but public or protected variables can be hidden by local variables

220229
getter	setter
i should get default getter and setter without writing any code but overriding a default getter or setter is as easy as declaring get fieldname or set fieldname functions with the behavior i want

220257
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
both safari 3.1 and firefox 3.1 well the current alpha and possibly opera 9.6 support true type font ttf embedding and at least safari supports svg fonts through the same mechanism

220273
width	height
both div s contain data that varies in height and width

220277
post	get
i get by with sifr for display type headlines titles of blog post etc. and using one of the less-worn-out web-safe fonts for body type like trebuchet ms

220310
codeigniter	kohana
both codeigniter and its php5 only fork kohana contain implementations of the activerecord pattern

220362
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the local web server doesn t care whether you use opera safari firefox ie to connect to it

220434
int	chars
btw both 0 and 0 are int s in c and either one will be converted to chars when stored in a chars variable

220439
cos	sin
i think it has something to do with the old sin and cos methods and the amount angle that the triangle has been rotated but i m a bit rusty on that stuff

220440
doc	rtf	wordprocessingml	rtf
of doc ooxml rtf wordprocessingml

220463
subtract	add
the classical arctangent gives you an angle normalized to -90â r +90â degrees however so you have to add or subtract 90 degrees from the result depending on the sign of the result and the sign of vx

220465
png	ico
i was wondering how i would be able to use a 256x256 png file in the ico file used as the application icon and show it in a picture box on a form

220482
memset	calloc
because on these systems neither memset nor calloc can clear out a struct that contains pointers correctly

220535
getter	setter
one that no one has mentioned is being forced to write unit tests for classes that are brainless getter and setter

220538
xslt	xquery
saxon is the xslt and xquery parser --

220561
post	get
this is the blog post i used to get all the info needed

220563
cvs	svn
cvs - svn import is pretty shaky really it s a one-off thing probably not that many individual people work on it enough to really care about making it perfect

220563
cvs	svn
going from another scm system to cvs and then to svn sounds like a recipe for useless history data and frustration

220563
cvs	svn
i ve only done it a couple of times and really the best part is once you re done you re in svn and never touch cvs again

220594
free	realloc
consequently realloc has probably free the original memory and then you pass it the same pointer again and it complains that you re freeing the same memory twice because you pass the original value to it again

220642
vim	emacs	mouse	keyboard
vim and emacs do not take full advantage of my screen mouse and keyboard

220642
kate	gedit	kate	geany	kate	scite	geany	gedit	geany	scite
i ve heard of scite eclipse gedit medit nedit gvim gemacs kate geany gnotepad ozeditor etc

220664
kate	kdevelop
also for a more development oriented tool you could try kdevelop whose default editor is kate but you can change for any other editor implementing the ktexteditor interface

220686
jboss	glassfish
after using jboss from the very beginning and then switching to glassfish in the last 6 months i can honestly say that glassfish is fast reliable and full-featured

220699
put	get
if i put the prog_delegate back in and remove everything else i get the exception back

220710
vim	emacs	mouse	keyboard
vim and emacs do not take full advantage of my screen mouse and keyboard

220750
mergesort	timsort
timsort is an adaptive stable natural mergesort with supernatural performance on many

220764
int	chars
in my experience the uuid broken up into two int will still be more efficient than using a chars field

220805
icmp	tcp
the browser uses the tcp ip protocol to communicate with the server the http requests when you use ping it uses the icmp protocol and seems the server behind a firewall that drops the icmp echo requests

220824
firefox	safari
browsers it looks okay in for example firefox for os x safari for os x

220839
pthreads	fork
it is quite easy to fork for exection of another program and redirect that one s stdin out under pthreads provided to you by cygwin i don t know about plain dos windows though

220855
g++	gcc
by default gcc g++ prints a warning message with the line number only

220855
g++	gcc
i am looking for the option by which g++ or gcc associates the build warning messages with the warning ids so that the warning messages can be identified easily without parsing

220856
nunit	mstest
to do anything in nunit or mstest you have to decorate methods with a testfixture or testclass attribute

220878
rss	feed
slashdot s rss feed is

220878
post	get
if i download the xml file directly i only get a few of the post from today

220885
rss	feed
for rss they also have the benefit of having multiple people subscribing to the same feed

220886
icmp	tcp
ping packets as others have stated are a different type of packet than html packets - ping packets are icmp ip while html are tcp ip

220886
icmp	tcp
all kinds of stuff in between you and the website could choose to block the icmp packets while allowing tcp packets through

220889
rss	feed
to do the same you would have to poll the rss feed you want at regular intervals and store any unique articles you find locally

220899
put	get
you can do joins and sorts in the dbms but if you don t want to put too much pressure on dbms - just get sorted data out of it and merge it using two ssis merge join transforms

220922
elf	coff
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others

220931
apache	lighttpd
apache lighttpd and many other web servers can also function as reverse proxies

220977
glassfish	resin
the biggest bonus of using apache in front of glassfish tomcat resin jetty whatever is the versatility it grants you

221065
ncover	nant
nant together with the nant contrib extensions seems a bit more flexible in handling oss tools like nunit ncover etc while the fact that msbuild can build vs solutions is a big plus for it

221065
mbunit	nunit
i found light weight xunit.net mbunit or nunit to be far better suited for unit testing

221141
public	protected
the approach i take is to check arguments and throw exceptions on publicly visible members - any by publicly visible i mean outside assembly boundaries so any public protected or protected internal method on a public class

221165
hash	md5
using these guids as the primary key for the object seems a reasonable idea and i ve followed delicious and connotea in using the md5 hash of the guid

221165
hash	md5
you ll see the md5 hash in your browser status bar if you mouse over the edit or delete buttons in a delicious or connotea book mark

221165
hash	md5
where e4a42d992025b928a586b8bdc36ad38d ais the md5 hash of

221165
hash	md5
for me an advantage of this approach as opposed to using an auto incrementing primary key generated by the database itself is that i have to do a lot of links between objects and by using md5 hash i can store these links externally in a file say as the result of data mining scraping then import them in bulk into the database

221165
hash	md5
in the same way if the database has to be rebuilt from scratch the urls to the objects won t change because they use the md5 hash

221191
junit	jmock
most of my testing is done using junit and jmock

hash	md5
multiple strings can produce the same md5 hash

221272
inherited	properties
use the doublebuffered properties inherited from the system.windows.forms.control

221298
free	malloc
you should not free the memory as you didn t malloc it yourself

221337
keydown	keyup
for all your keydown keyup keyboard needs use the jquery hotkeys plugin

221345
width	height
im quite new to image manipulation but this is fine for getting simple values like width height aspect ratio etc but what i cannot work out is how to retrieve the physical file size of the jpg expressed in bytes

221345
hash	md5
final solution including an md5 hash of the image for later comparison

221404
post	get
if you want to get a callstack of the crash what you really want to do is post mortem debugging

221413
rmagick	jmagick
if you need to go further the simple gradient imagemagick and one of its wrappers like rmagick or jmagick for java could be useful

221434
google-chrome	firefox
until recently i had this working fine in firefox 2 3 ie5 6 and google-chrome

221448
post	get
the api is implemented as an asp page that accepts get or post params and returns xml after a user has been authenticated

221448
post	get
be aware that the http send adapter can only post data - it cannot use the get verb

221483
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
there are four public methods defined equals gethashcode gettype and tostring

221554
rss	feed
i m creating several rss feed from a database to publish things like job openings volunteer opportunities and links in general

221580
rss	feed
but i d be guessing that aiming for the last 48 or so hours would be safe - seeing as a lot of users would be running stand alone rss readers that will need to hit the feed to pull down whatever is current

221601
post	get
in the php script that is the target of the request pull out of the parameters from the _ post or _ get

221639
free	malloc
after all not just gc is not deterministic free is as little deterministic as malloc is

221639
free	malloc
it might as well try to combine smaller free memory blocks surrounding the free d one to a big one and this behavior is not deterministic nor is the runtime for it sometimes free won t do that and malloc will do that instead on next allocation but nowhere is written that free mustn t do that

221639
free	malloc
in a critical realtime system you might even replace the system standard malloc free with a different implementation maybe even writing your own one it s not as hard as it sounds

221639
free	malloc
for me gc is a plain convenience thingy it is to get programmers away from focusing on sophisticated malloc free planing and instead having the system deal with this automatically

221639
free	malloc
if i need a more sophisticated memory handling i d maybe write my own malloc free that works as desired and most deterministic and write my own reference counting model on top of it

221639
free	malloc
reference counting is still manual memory management but much more comfortable than just using malloc free

221639
free	malloc
your malloc free implementation can have a function finddeadobjects that searches for all objects with a retain counter of zero that have not yet been released and free them at a later point when you are in a less critical part of your code that has more time for such kind of tasks

221790
int	double
for each type of property int double varchar etc. add a value table

221804
min	max
i need to find the min and max value in an array

221814
ant	maven
i am assuming that you are neither using ant nor maven to create your .war file

221871
inherited	subclassing
you could put what you have into an inherited method and then wrap the results in each subclassing

221907
min	max
it doesn t unfortunately have min and max methods but it does have a toarray method from which you could then run the min and max methods

221916
implements	extends
however unfortunately an enum cannot extends a class but it can implements an interface so the best you can do at the moment is define an interface which includes the getfieldname method and have all your enums implements this interface

221918
implements	extends
enums can implements interfaces but not extends since when compiled they translate to a java.lang.enum

221953
mathml	tex
likely not what you wanted to hear but after trying mathml i went back to tex as it s far more readable and compact than the xml representation

221984
pop-up	dialog
i have a command that pop-up a dialog and from the dialog i do some work like collecting data from the used range of several sheets

222007
client-side	server-side
the thing about webforms is that it s very easy to make a page that performs really bad because it encourages you to do a lot of simple updates server-side that really should be done client-side

222019
prepare	execute
when running the above java example i see 5 pairs of prepare and execute commands in the mysqld log file

222019
prepare	execute
moving the ps assignment outside of the loop results in a single prepare and 5 execute commands of course

222023
post	get
we don t run the most popular blog but we did get good amounts of traffic for some of our post

222024
vb.net	vb6
however you might be able to find a msaccess to vb6 translator their syntaxes are roughly similar and from there there are vb6- vb.net translators and even vb.net - c# translators

222060
rss	feed
i know that the number of people using igoogle for rss feed viewing is going up and there is a max display limit of 9 entries there

222060
rss	feed
many other rss feed displays are limiting at 10-15 entries

222060
rss	feed
i find that an rss feed unless it is specifically an all encompassing feed by nature is usually a small quick-hit update of what is going on or what is available

222080
httphandler	httpmodule
going to rewrite the httpmodule as a httphandler and bind it to .aspx so it doesnt interfere with webresource.axd

222165
children	parent
begin by removing all the floats and clears from both the parent div and children divs

222165
width	height	children	parent
if that doesn t work remove all padding and margins and give the parent div and children divs each a width of 100 leaving in your height of 100px

222183
migrate	upgrade
if you want use this wizard to upgrade the back-end to sql express then manually migrate to another db platform

222220
for-loop	arrays
if i iterate using a for-loop i have to account for the missing indexes and just copy the keys to a new arrays but that seems clumsy

222234
public	protected
assuming that you are talking about using _declspec dllexport dllimport on a class or class member yes you can do that and it should give you the expected result - the static data would be accessible outside your dll and other c++ code could access it provided that that c++ access specification public protected private wouldn t block outside access in the first place

222266
int	double
wrote i m reading binary data written by another program from a file and outputting int double

ie and firefox will but opera will not

222367
websphere	ibm
websphere message broker is ibm s flagship esb which runs ontop of mq

222384
int	double
regarding double float just store them to int by memory casting

222384
int	double
a double is defined to always be 64 bit unlike int it does not vary in size it is fixed at 64 bit hence it will always fit into a int64_t sized variable

222411
dictionary	map
you could potentially store several separate dictionary - one for i ve only got one element direct mapping then i ve got two elements map to a pair struct with the two references in etc until it becomes silly - quite possibly at about 3 entries - at which point you go back to normal lists

the simplest of answers is an editor take your pick - at least one is already on there and gcc g++

222494
vim	emacs
some sort of editor ide emacs vim eclipse

222494
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
apache lighttpd nginx

222504
getter	setter
plus my java objects all have getter and setter whereas the as3 equivalents do not which means the public private accessors are different in any case

222513
kate	kde
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace

222513
vim	emacs
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories

222513
g++	gcc
your compiler should probably be gcc - on a debian system installing the g++ package as well as build-essential should be enough to get c++ going build-essential should contain the gcc package required for c development

222545
awt	swing
it s pretty straight forward as long as you re using one of the standard java windowing libraries swing awt

222606
mouse	keyboard
i need a way to detect mouse keyboard activity on linux

222682
width	height
i m not sure if this applies for swf loading but whenever i m loading content i cannot access width and height before the whole thing is loaded

222682
width	height
so make an event listener that listens when the loading is completed and then read the height width

222702
post	get
good luck and be sure to post a follow-up if you do get results from the google group which i have posted on before and received feedback very quickly

222714
valgrind	gprof
among others you should also have gprof and valgrind or something in it s class

222721
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu or any debian based distribution you can issue the following command to install all the necessary tools

222756
width	height
i need to be able to specify a height and width of the image either in inches or pixels i don t necessarily care which and have the xaml scale to that size for the generated bitmap

222756
width	height
the root canvas stored as myimage has a height of 600 and a width of 800

222767
firefox	safari

formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview
i m not using a gridview formview detailsview or any other rad type object which persists the key value by itself and i don t want to use any of them

223029
interpreted-language	compiled-language
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

223045
put	get
multiple workspaces on a single machine numbered changelists developer branches integration with ide visual studio eclipse slickedit ... many build variants composite workspaces integrating some fixes but not others etc i ask because if all folks are doing is get and put from the command line git has that covered and so do all the other rts

223104
client-side	server-side
the javascript could be slotted into the client-side validation the c# info could be used for a reflection load call for server-side validation and the sql expression could be used for database validation

223119
client-side	server-side
server-side validation because client-side code can be bypassed or modified and so can t be trusted

223173
mp3	ogg
i ve got two directories containing 20 gb of music files mostly mp3 some ogg and i would like to detect all duplicate songs

223184
ready	each
the nice thing about this is that i can more easily update the libraries and just use the -rxyz specifier for the externals definition to avoid pulling in newer versions than i m ready to accept and still have only one copy of each file version in my repository

223184
folder	directory
just to make it clear in the bin debug directory i don t want another layer of libs systemhooks in there and all the files presently being copied to the bin debug libs systemhooks folder needs to be copied to the bin debug folder instead

223284
vsto	add-in
with .net and vsto creating outlook add-in is far less painfull compared to the bad old days

223284
vsto	add-in
i have made office add-in in com that was not funny at all and in the previous version of vsto but vsto 3 is very good news for the office developer

223312
post	get
if i change to urlrequestmethod.post and append some data to req.data then the header is sent but the receiving application requires a get not a post

223355
folder	directory
svn external keyword for project directory was well defined also lib folder still contained proper version of libraries trunk version

223435
try-catch	exception-handling
the only way to log exception-handling irrespective of idisposable is try-catch and then to re-throw in the catch

223435
try-catch	exception-handling
you would have to wrap every call at your api s public boundary with try-catch in order to log that the exception-handling came from your code

223474
ssl	https
or do i need to use https ssl to accomplish this

223477
ssl	https
if you are concerned about security use https with ssl encryption.

223485
ssl	https
i would use ssl https if you want your authentication to be secure

223494
rss	feed
think about a situation where you might want to display the information as an rss feed instead

223517
hide	show
for modulea show hide option

223558
serializable	deserialization
your case might be slightly different if you re attempting to pass a strongly-typed dataset as the desktop s serializable may not match what the device wants for deserialization

223570
pygtk	pygobject
gst-python isn t coupled with pygtk at all - it just happens to share a common object model pygobject and a way to help generate bindings

versioning	upgrade
edit turns out i was wrong about the versioning of mysql i needed in the first place and i fixed and upgrade a bunch of stuff

223737
yacc	bison
interesting question - i have a parser that can be compiled with bison byacc mks yacc or unix yacc and i don t do anything special to deal with resetting the grammar whether it fails or succeeds

223761
post	get
i have an api consisting of asp.net webservices callable through get post soap

223761
post	get
i m thinking of dropping soap support since our php clients mainly use the get post methods and the .net clients don t mind either way

223768
superclass	subclassing
i don t think you can do what you want without changing either the superclass method signature or the subclassing list declaration

223774
quicksort	mergesort
in contrast i d show quicksort and mergesort being very good divide and conqueror algorithms and both also very fast

223774
heapsort	shellsort
algorithms i d not use as their concept is harder to get are shellsort radixsort heapsort and bucketsort

223774
quicksort	shellsort
you might mention the little sister of shellsort insertionsort which is basically a shellsort where the step width has finally reach one but only because many quicksort implementation use inesrtionsort as fall-back sort once the recursion gets too deep or the remaining data set to sort recursively gets too small .

223789
vbscript	vb6
this is actually a sample written in vbscript for printing crystal 8.5 reports but the syntax is the same for vb6

223809

i am limited to an open source solution so it ll be mysql or postgresql if that helps at all

223825

here s a blog post i found useful to get you started

223858
mouse	keyboard
it neither processes mouse or keyboard input nor sends wm_command messages to its parent

223870
put	get
i ll put this up on github when i get home this evening

223887
profiling	debugging
and especially won t find beyond zend debugger a debugging protocol and definitely won t find any other extension that does profiling

223920
ati	nvidia
you won t get the performance of modern ati or nvidia chipsets but they aren t that bad either

223961
folder	directory
nb it seems very odd to have your library solution folder inside an include directory which are really intended for .h or other #include d files

224013
filtering	grouping
filtering the grouping by grouping that have more than 1 element

224041
put	get
i have put the code in the onopen event which i thought occurred before any data is loaded but when i test this out i get a message telling me that the back-end cannot be found it s looking in its old location

224067
prng	random
if i generate my secret number and random gunk using a prng then an attacker trying to brute-force my hash doesn t have to try every possible number+gunk only every possible seed for the prng

224072

i ve copied the extracted folder to my plugins directory and run eclipse -clean but i can t find anything matching jalopy in preferences

224090
ubuntu	linux
i am currently running gdb version 6.7.1 on ubuntu linux and working in a c++ project

224104
ada	pascal
but pascal has repeat - until and while for each scenario and if i remember correctly ada has another construct that lets you quit in the middle but of course that s not what you re asking

224108
post	get
there s no reason you can t include additional post or get for that matter parameters

224108
disk	ram
asp.net 2.0+ spools uploaded files to disk as they come in to avoid preloading the entire request into ram

224180
post	get
this is what the get and post super globals are for

224214
translation	localization
i m not sure how comprehensive an answer you re looking for but if you re really just using string string pairs for your localization and you re just looking for a quick way to load resource .resx files with the results of your translation then the following will work as a fairly quick low-tech solution

224214
translation	localization
csv or excel interop you could also instruct your translators to store their translation content in excel saved as xml then use xpath to retrieve your localization info

224215
do-while	break
lets you break out of the loop in the middle rather than at the start while for or end do-while

224223
innodb	myisam
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

224234
stringstream	ifstream
i m using an istream which could be stringstream ifstream or a user-defined stream type and i need to know if in the case of an ifstream it was not opened in binary mode so i can throw an exception

224266
pop-up	dialog
the command line options appear to be the same but one difference is that tortoiseplink pop-up a password dialog if you don t have a keypair for your server

224337
put	get
i have to put a button on each page to get the values from a previous page rather than simply having fields auto-populated

224352
button	checkbox
note that the s around the radio button and checkbox line up correctly

224388
visualvm	jprofiler
jconsole visualvm or other profilers such as jprofiler will also show you the threads and their stacks however if you don t want to use any external tool i think ctrl-break will give you what you re looking for

224409
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are distributed control systems that operate of the idea that you aren t always connected to the net and that there need not be one central version of the repository

224436
folder	directory
svn export is like a checkout but w o the .svn folder and w o the ability to do subversion work in that directory

224438
robocopy	xcopy
use robocopy or xcopy to filter out the .svn folders

224471
minimum	max
meaning if you have a fancy javascript effect that displays a div that s supposed to be on top of everything e.g lightbox multibox etc.. onclick of a certain element and that div overlaps a your div get s to be displayed as if it s under the on this case a max and minimum z-index doesn t work

224479
inherited	properties
unfortunately this then lead to the issue that enherited classes in the entity framework cannot have navigation properties all navigation properties must be on the base entity so inherited is going to prove to be non-usable for our needs

224518
springlayout	boxlayout
i use borderlayout 90 of the time while nesting boxlayout and springlayout

224551
cvs	svn
i mainly used cvs and svn happy and content then i started researching distributed source control as there was lots of fuss made about dsvc

224551
pull	push
you may also setup a http server run push and pull via ssh

224551
pull	push
also have really neat option of getting together with your coding buddies and simply startup http server run it over localhost and your mates can push and pull while you doing a code sprint

224578
equals	gethashcode
it is very important that your values that you store override the gethashcode method and the compiler will warn you about equals so override that as well

224579
public	protected
for example with wxformbuilder you can select visibility public protected private for each control on the form

224598
int	double
this probably isn t worth it for things like float double etc since they are stored verbatim under protocol buffers - but there may be savings for things like int simply due to how it packs ints.

224702
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
a connection transaction such as sqltransaction is tied directly to the db connection such as sqlconnection which means that you have to keep passing the connection around - ok in some cases but doesn t allow create use release usage and doesn t allow cross-db work

224784
unix	aix
all application execution in a unix linux mac os x aix etc. environment depends on the executable search path

224791
subtract	add
store the difference and add subtract it from the sleep interval at the end of this loop sleep delay can go too long or too short

224793
addclass	removeclass
or you can use your favourite addclass removeclass implementation

224988
public	protected
you can have private protected and public inheritance in c++ which will determine what derived classes can access in the inheritance hierarchy

224995
spaces	delimiter
if the string always contains 4 numbers delimiter with spaces then it could be done with sscanf

225002
versioning	upgrade
as i understand weblogic has a feature called parallel deployment to eliminate downtime during ear versioning upgrade

225016
ati	nvidia
with windows 7 probably going to rtm next october and directx 11 with it would it be worth waiting for directx 11 s explicit gpgpu features meaning it will be cross-platform ati nvidia not windows linux mac whatever

225022
outputstream	inputstream
cat method that pipes an inputstream to an outputstream

225043
nfa	dfa
regexes are usually implemented as one of two algorithms nfa or dfa that correspond to two different fsms

225053
nunit	mstest
testdriven.net has the ability to test nunit mstest etc with team coverage which you already have since you have team system dev

225064
ncover	testdriven.net
testdriven.net will also work very well with ncover

225064
ncover	nant
you can get some very nice html reports out of ncover and you can integrate it with nant

225098
hash	salt
sha1 hash of the filename + a salt or if you want of the file contents

225130
post	get

225150
innodb	myisam
one of my projects use the myisam engine in mysql but i m considering changing it to innodb as i need transaction support here and there

225197
post	get
if you re still having problems try copying the project and seeing if you get the same behaviour and at a last ditch attempt post a bug for eclipse it may take a while for them to fix but at least you know that you re being heard

225225
inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
another option is to create your own class that implements ilist and inotifycollectionchanged then you can attach and detach events from within that class or set olditems on clear if you like - it s really not difficult but it is a lot of typing

225268
bufferedreader	ioexception
the key is to try to close the bufferedreader even if an ioexception is thrown

225274
rss	feed
i m trying to get the dates from entries in two different rss feed through feedparser

225315
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
that works in bash zsh and tcsh and probably other shells too.

225315
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
if the path it gives back doesn t include the directory that has git-upload-pack you need to fix it by setting it in .bashrc for bash .zshenv for zsh .cshrc for tcsh or equivalent for your shell

225360
spaces	delimiter
this groups all white spaces as a delimiter

225375
folder	directory
my project has two source directory that are both built and then some files are copied into the output folder

225382
rss	feed
parsing of dates is a pain with rss feed in-the-wild and that s where feedparser can be a big help

225494
filesystems	ntfs
you can encrypt a file on a ntfs filesystems

225534
width	height
something as basic as resizing the image to equal width or height subtracting image_a from image_b and summing the difference

225655
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby and ironpython do not work on the xbox 360 because they are based on the dlr dynamic language runtime and the dlr makes heavy use of system.reflection.emit types which are not currently available on the xbox 360 .net framework a modified version of the compact .net framework

225662
versioning	upgrade

post	get
jeremy hylton s blog post is suggestive about the causes but i don t really understand cpython s implementation well-enough to figure out how to get around this

225716
post	get
i think in terms of keeping people happy during post switch over one of things to get across early is just how private a local branch can be in git and how much freedom that gives them to make mistakes

drwatson	minidump
if your app crashes get drwatson to generate a minidump run drwtsn32.exe check the minidump checkbox get that dump sent to you and then load it up in windbg

225776
postgresql	mysql
not sure about mysql but postgresql pg_dump has a command to just dump the schema without the table contents so you can see if you ve changed the schema any

225838
gmail	hotmail
for example imagine what happens if a bot starts going around stealing twhirl passwords or hotmail gmail yahoo paypal from applications that run on the user s desktop

225923
put	get
they both do o n searches over the list to try and find the key which pretty much defeats the purpose of a hashtable hashtables are generally constant time for get put

225958
inherited	properties
when you select an html element in the wysiwyg designer you can use the css properties window to see all css rules and their corresponding settings including the cascading settings inherited from the various css rules

225985
hash	md5
entering each name as some hash value of the name suppose md5 - 32 bits

226070
children	parent
it s possible that in the future someone will count on the fact that fks usually prevent deletion of parent when there are children and not realize that your use of on delete cascade not only doesn t prevent deletion it makes huge amounts of data in dozens of other tables go away thanks to a waterfall of cascading deletes

226070
children	parent
otoh if i place the deletion of the parent and all its children in a procedure then it is very easy and clear for anyone to see exactly what is going to happen when i issue the command

226172
innodb	myisam
we know about the tools available for myisam table repairs but cannot find anything for innodb

226192
int	chars
what you d get in the above example would be the returned value which is an int cast into something string can understand most likely a chars

226249
width	height
you can then set width and or height as you like

226253
versioning	upgrade
the c++ redirector was never upgrade for versioning 9 of symbian os

226346
internationalization	globalization
here are some web sites dedicated to internationalization and globalization

226357
serializable	deserialization
another option is to group like settings together into their own classes and then use xml serializable deserialization to store and retrieve instances of these settings classes to and from the database

226357
serializable	deserialization
this doesn t specifically provide advantages above and beyond a key value pair other than you don t have to yourself perform any type conversions this is done behind the scenes as part of the serializable deserialization process - so it still does happen

226357
serializable	deserialization
also in a pinch you can direct your settings to come from database tables or the file system without altering your serializable deserialization code this is very nice during development

226362
mouse	keyboard
not a keyboard shortcut but with your mouse you can use forward and backwards buttons on your mouse to go to previous locations in your code and return to your current location

226401
gentoo	linux
well try it out yourself grab a gentoo or other linux distro or try out the singularity project from microsoft research

226422
innodb	myisam
one of the big ones to watch out for is that is much slower in innodb than myisam

226448
cvs	svn
i m trying avoid giving examples of actual software used cvs svn ant etc. because i d like to avoid the use xyz s feature to do this and concentrate more on general practices

226467
postgresql	mysql
i think storing your sessions in a database like mysql or postgresql will involve the least headaches especially if you already have a db for whatever it is your app does

226512
multiplying	add
well if we assume that an add subtrack operation costs 1 then multiplying costs 5 and divide costs about 20

226515
division	multiplication
multiplication is faster division is more accurate

226519
division	multiplication
floating-point division is generally especially slow so while floating-point multiplication is also relatively slow it s probably faster than floating-point division

226523
postgresql	mysql
i m working on this package while we support traditional session handling through files we also support database mysql postgresql sqlite etc

226546
vb.net	vb6
support for vb6 has ended but vb.net is still very much alive and gaining new features

226559
vb.net	vb6
vb.net seemed a lot different from vb6 when i last used it though

226564
folder	directory
i m wondering if it s possible to point iis to a shared windows folder that exists on another server and have that folder serve as the root directory for iis

226593
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i ve used both cruisecontrol and teamcity extensively

226593
cruisecontrol	teamcity
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol

226602
vb.net	vb6
when vb.net was created microsoft wanted developers to be able to import existing vb6 projects into .net

226602
vb.net	vb6
that was only feasible if the vb6 functions and method calls had matching functionality in vb.net

226646
folder	directory
in an app server the current working directory is usually the bin folder depends on what app server you use etc

226658
versioning	upgrade
btw i still have no idea what an unsafe expression is - nor why it continually asks to upgrade to jet 4.0 sp8 when it already has been i verified that it was updated by checking the file versioning

226663
rss	feed
i want to use jquery to parse rss feed

226708
versioning	upgrade
the microsoft.visualbasic.compatibility namespace is exclusively for use by the vb6 upgrade wizard may be removed in future versioning and should not ever be used for new development

226738
vbscript	jscript
but you may want to build your own simple solution since youâ ll have to modify the codeproject project to support objectivec instead of jscript vbscript c xml and c#

226744
rss	feed
use google ajax feed api unless your rss data is private

226765
put	get
i have a proof-of-concept test that uses staf to start a vm image from a pool of images install the application under test run the rrafs test and put the results on a web server for others to get at

226774
int	boolean
when using int as boolean this isn t true

226783
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
so if you do not use the dumpformat you will stick to checkout all branches tags from svn and adding them to git bazaar mercurial manually via script

226823
google-chrome	firefox
when i use some icons near links using background-image and padding-left on the links the icons display nice on firefox and google-chrome but in ie6 they take a kind of gray background and sometimes the flash strangely

226867
postgresql	mysql
if this is a public facing web application which is expected to receive hundreds of orders every day you ll probably want to run a mysql or postgresql server alongside it on the same server

226867
postgresql	mysql
if you re looking at hundreds of thousands of orders you ll most likely want mysql or postgresql running on a separate server

226867
postgresql	mysql
if you ve got all coders who are just starting out or who have experience with mysql or postgresql then obviously that makes more sense

226885
mouseup	mousedown
if you are referring to the webbrowser control s document property type htmldocument it only has events for mouseup mousedown etc but not keyboard events

226930
folder	dir
i would try turning off indexing for the temporary asp.net files folder located in your windows dir microsoft.net framework whatever version folder

226932
.nettiers	codesmith
serious answer .nettiers for codesmith might help you out

226934

while not open source this is a very good tool for designing building and administering firebird and interbase databases

226960
gridview	repeater
apply to gridview repeater

227064
hide	show
often times i need to surround a block of html and related server controls with a panel that i can show or hide based upon some ui logic in the code behind

227064
hide	show
in this situation i usually just set each tr to runat server and show hide each of them individually but there must be a better way

227239
boost	stl
the callstack is entirely stl boost code

227239
boost	stl
bad idea with stl boost containers

227256
getter	setter
typically entities that don t really do anything but contain getter and setter for private members mean you re working with an anemic domain model

227304
awt	swing
the getname is used in tostring methods when setting the names of child components inside a composite parent component and in awt and swing debug logging code

227304
awt	swing
i suspect strongly that the getname method is also used by some awt swing testing frameworks

227318
int	boolean
the configuration data takes all forms boolean int floats and strings

227325
vbscript	jscript
it will also generate vbscript perl and jscript

227368
nsstring	nsdata
it s nice to add convenience methods to commonly used classes such as nsstring or nsdata

227448
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net has optional parameters in method

227448
vb.net	vb6
vb6 vb.net way of saying shift xltoright allows passing value of a specific parameter by name

227453
hash	md5
generate the hash sha1 md5 etc for a key and hardcode the hash in your application

227457
post	get
i need to get a summary where type x and a summary where type y separately...let me post a better example

227555
accessor	properties
the big issue is that as mmalc said the code the sets up the properties default state should not go through an accessor because it leads to all sorts of nasty issues

227555
accessor	properties
in the above case init is not responsible for initing the properties state and it is completely safe even necessary for one to use the accessor in the init method

227555
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties	superclass	subclassing
admittedly this does impose additional restrictions on your code for instance subclassing with custom accessor for a properties in the superclass must call the superclass accessor but those restrictions are not out of line with various other restrictions common in cocoa

227644
websphere	ibm
paid at my day job i administer an ibm websphere mq messaging system with several hundred nodes and have found it to be very good

227708
hide	show
say for instance to dynamically show or hide a related control

227708
client-side	server-side
i came up with a way using asp.net 2.0 callback mechanism ajax with a combination of client-side javascript and server-side logic in the code-behind

227717
stdout	stderr
so to be clear i want to launch a text based process psexec actually and read the output from that command stdout stderr etc into a variable rather than have it directly outputted to the console

227754
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox safari and opera provide the non-standard xmlserializer api so you could do something like this

227847
debian	linux
i m used to debian linux where my command history is automatically saved when i log out so that when i log back in i can press up or ctrl-r or whatever and have access to my history

227900
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the last step free is easy you always and only return to free a value that one of malloc calloc or realloc returned to you â anything else is a disaster

227938
versioning	upgrade
so if you re doing a minor versioning upgrade to one of your apps the main application also goes up by a minor versioning number

227942
objectdatasource	formview
in some cases usually when an objectdatasource is involved i ve had to override the values set by the formview control by doing something like this

227946
post	get
querystring seem to have only get parameter not post

228001
getter	setter
but note that if you don t have any domain logic then you will end up with anemic domain objects bags of brainless getter and setter which is how some shops claim to do soa service layers

228073
notepad++	regexbuddy
previous developer recommendations have led me to discover great tools like notepad++ and regexbuddy so i m really looking forward to your answers

228079
division	multiplication
pointer arithmetic isn t very fond of division or multiplication

228134
inherited	properties
i then want to make an awesomedragonimmunetofire object so i make a new child of the awesomedragon awesomedragonimmunetofire inherited properties from awesomedragon and put immunetofire as a properties with a value of true

228154
hid	keyboard
unfortunately the new leopard hid apis have the ability to peak at keyboard events as they pass by but not to intercept them so you can t build your own application-level device handler unless it s ok that the key events are also going to the appkit as well

228248
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
in other words first find the shortest distance between each pair of vertices you can use dijkstra s algorithm or others but with those small numbers 100 nodes even the simplest-to-code floyd-warshall algorithm will run in time

228267
sunos	bsd	openbsd	sunos
me windows me open bsd openbsd sun os sunos

228419
qtkit	quicktime
if you re willing to do a little coding you want to take a look at qtkit the quicktime framework for cocoa

228448
onclientclick	checkboxlist
depending on how you are populating your checkboxlist this might be as simple as adding an onclientclick attribute to the listitem for that checkbox that calls your function with the same value assigned to the label say oncheckboxclicked this label

228470
swt	swing
netbeans is based on swing while eclipse uses swt

postgresql	mysql
i work with mssql mysql and postgresql regularly using .net java and php

228589
innodb	myisam
be sure you are defining your tables to use the innodb storage engine instead of myisam which is designed for speed.

228625
pdcurses	ncurses
longer answer use a ncurses ncurses on unix pdcurses on windows

228625
pdcurses	ncurses
ncurses should be available through your package manager and both ncurses and pdcurses have the exact same interface pdcurses can also create windows independently from the console that behave like console windows

228750
innodb	myisam
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

228757
typedef	struct
while a typedef will enable you to write it without the struct keyword

228757
typedef	struct
thus you ll be able to use mystruct everywhere you want to avoid adding the struct keyword and still use mystructtag when a typedef won t work forward declaration

228812
postgresql	mysql
i am using sql server and interested in mysql and postgresql as well

228827
printf	atoi
itoa was a non-standard helper function designed to complement the atoi standard function and probably hiding a printf most its features can be implemented in terms of printf

228850
ord	chr
to do things the way you re used to treating letters as numbers you can use the ord and chr functions

228882
post	get
this blog post has a good rundown of what you need to do to get it working

228923
int	chars
you somewhat cheated because you sent an int to a function waiting for a chars and wrongly sent the number six when the chars value of 6 is not 6 but 54 in ascii

228992
bazaar	svn	pull	push
on further option which i consider is to use bazaar to push our updates to the sftp server and then pull the updates from there but unfortunately there is no working svn plugin for bazaar available on windows

229022
unicode	ucs
however java s native character encoding is unicode utf16be sixteen-bit ucs transformation format big-endian byte order

229028
width	height
finally you could consider using watch on the width height properties although i don t know whether this is fully browser-compatible think this might be mozilla-only

229041
client-side	server-side
forget client-side and use the classic postback and add or remove the listitems server-side

229631
pull	push
you may need to get the user who is using the spreadsheet to run a macro that will push the data out of the spreadsheet instead of you running a process to pull the data from the spreadsheet but usually it is quite doable

229635
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
ie6 works under os x without windows fonts aren t quite right but it s enough for everyday testing and you can get it 100 perfect under virtualisation parallels vmware virtualbox

entity-relationship	diagram
i ve got into the habit of using entity-relationship diagram to design databases and want to do the same when working with access

229671
for-loop	loops
how could you implement a for-loop that wasn t just syntactic sugar for a while loops

229680
jsf	wicket
innovative technologies spring hibernate wicket jsf ws rest ... - taking new dependencies is strongly frowned upon

229723
for-loop	loops
if you know how many time the for-loop is going to execute you can literally copy and paste the contents of loops

229724
maven	pom.xml
all i did was use the official maven eclipse plugin and add this to my pom.xml

229736
for-loop	loops
basically the c and java javascript and lot of c-derived languages for-loop is indeed syntactic sugar for a while loops

229763
ubuntu	linux
in linux it is as slow as in windows in the same machine ubuntu 8.04 x64

229838
width	height
change your overflow to auto and define the height and or width of the element

229915
for-loop	loops
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

229917
int	chars	int	boolean
byte chars int short boolean float are all stored in 4 bytes each

229922
for-loop	loops
in ada and i believe most other algol-derived languages the terminating condition of a for-loop is evaluated only once at the beginning of loops

230090
int	chars
also worth noting mode values of _accesss const chars path int mode

230139
put	get
if they use the moodle wysiwyg view the html would just get put into one line with no breaks

once you have the offset you can simply add subtract depending on which way the conversion is going to get the appropriate time in either timezone

230318
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
also different editors and ides use different tokenizers and highlight rules and js is one of more dynamic languages to parse so try opening the file in emacs vim gedit with js plugins .

versioning	upgrade
solutions seem like they can be upgrade by incrementing the versioning number but it doesn t seem to modify things like content types and columns--especially if they re in use

230444
stdout	stderr
so this little piece of code just captures the output redirecting stderr to stdout and searches for error messages

230601
disk	ram
if your ram usage is high though windows can swap this out to disk

230712

versioning	upgrade
just open the vb6 project using file â open â convert and it ll automatically upgrade the vb6 code to the current versioning

230856
profiling	benchmarking
you can use the pear benchmarking package for getting timing and profiling information

230861
public	protected
perhaps you have a public property which supplies access to it or maybe you declare it as protected and derived classes can use it

230862
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you would do better do avoid the passwd and try a scheme like sudo and sudoers

230877
cldc	midp
alchemo for iphone is capable of converting j2me applications utilizing an extensive subset of java me cldc 1.1 and midp 2.0 including touch screen support and supports several jsr extension apis including the jsr-256 mobile sensor api

i ve used this to associate two tables where one used an int but associated it to a chars field in another table

231332
integer	unsigned
very simple as your counter is a 16 bit unsigned integer it can not have values bigger than 0xffff as that value is still valid you need to have some value that extends beyond that as the guard

231367
rdf	owl
i am using rdf in my project and what we have done is use owl to define an ontology for the rdf data and give it some structure

put	get
if its a h1 tag it will put it in the h1 column and if its a title tag it will get put in the title column

231448
client-side	server-side
because of requiring the presence of a service update we never considered performing any client-side xslt with msie6 and instead performed transformations server-side when the client browser was msie6 and relayed the transformed content

231490
charat	indexof
when people call length indexof and charat methods they re interested in the character position not the byte position

231596
vbscript	vba
you can use getstring in vba which will return the recordset separated by any value you like comma dash table cells etc. although i have to admit i ve only used it in vbscript not visual basic

231602
hash	salt
or is it just hash and possibly salt

231608
int	chars
the overhead is due to including a chars object reference and three int an offset a length and space for storing the string s hashcode plus the standard overhead of simply being an object

231614
min	max
i added a static member function dump which creates a table of elapsed times sorted by timing category specified in timer s constructor as a string along with some statistical analysis such as mean elapsed time standard deviation max and min

put	get
depending on how much effort you want to put into it you should be able to get somewhere

231755
rsa	aes
if it s a recent well-regarded method such as rsa or aes you re probably out of luck

231774
post	get
do not be tempted to use request.param because it can be used to apply cross-site request forgery on your application an attacker could lure user into issuing a get request which your application would interpret the same as it would interpret a post one which is usually not a good thing

231810
post	get
you can use findcontrol and pass the textbox id to get an instance of the textbox when post back

231821
vb.net	vb6
i am working on a vb.net winforms app that was upgraded by visual studio originally 1.0 or 1.1 from vb6 code which was itself upgraded from vb5

231824
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i don t think i could see a logic to testing across all browsers as i initially fill out a form or do some other basic functionality as it could be a big productivity drain to test across at least a few browsers ie 6 7 firefox 2 and 3 opera 9.5 safari and google-chrome if one wants to get all the big boys and at least a couple o s as safari on a mac can be different than safari on windows which is a lot of tests even for just one or two pages

231849
weblogic	oc4j
oc4j orion will continue to be supported however the weblogic release is the future of the platform

231860
datalist	objectdatasource
efficient data paging with the asp.net 2.0 datalist control and objectdatasource

231861
mouse	keyboard
if it was more than a few hours 3 then i could see it if you tend to optimize what you are doing at any moment when you are programming do you try to optimize where the mouse keyboard and monitor all are

231889
dynamic-languages	typechecking
on the other hand a simple compiler for a fully dynamic-languages will need to do some form of typechecking anyway

231914
profiling	debugging	profiling	benchmarking
when i need to optimize resources on any script i try always to analyze profiling and debugging my code i use xdebug and the xdebug profiling there are other options like apd and benchmarking profiling

231931
mouse	keyboard
monitors under the simultaneous command of one keyboard mouse pair and i still

231937
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide an inline element eg a span using jquery

231973
portrait	landscape
the features i m looking for in particular are to print landscape or portrait without user intervention

232009
portrait	landscape
i haven t found reliable ways to control the print options from within a page either so relying on your users to change from portrait to landscape or to set or adjust margins or turn off the print headers and footers just doesn t work in the long run - you ll end up annoying them and creating more headaches for yourself when they can t or just don t follow instructions

232023
int	chars
obviously the binary value of an int containing the binary int of another chars doesn t mean that the decical does the same

232055
clistctrl	ccombobox
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl

232113
width	height
an inline span like you mention has no specific height or width though it does have an opacity

232117
acrobat	indesign
using their server side modules you can have a designer create your document in indesign or illustrator then programattically drop in the dynamic fields on top even using acrobat to place the fields

232134
cvs	svn
i ve used cvs and svn in the past and tfs source control provides me with everything i need

232213
pop-up	dialog
it s not the greatest for example i think you have to make sure itunes.exe is running in a desktop session and several commands can cause dialog to pop-up and block your automation but it does let you do things like create new play lists and add songs

232227
width	height
if display inline-block was well supported you could change the style to inline-block and then animate the width or height but unfortunately that won t work very well these days

232230
folder	directory
the application totally behave like a normal asp.net application except for the directory or folder where users can create pages

232290
int	boolean
public boolean containssum int nums int sum

232308
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	centos	linux
it is a good idea to keep practicing linux on vbox for windows in advance before switching using one of pclinuxos centos opensuse ubuntu

232345
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
it appears that mono.addins was influenced by system.addins sharpdevelop and monodevelop

232351
put	get
i ve even found that the best way to write technical documents -- which i generally dislike doing -- is by doing some interesting coding even if it s prototyping or experimental or otherwise throw-away to put me in the right mode and just get my brain working

232370
daemons	launchd
an alternative and more complex solution would be to create a small windows service or unix daemons that checks periodically to see if there are updates this service can download the update and launchd the installer

232382
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
so you want to use as little division as possible in favor of multiplication or modulo

232382
subtraction	addition
not shown are subtraction addition and comparison operators cause they blow all of these out of the water

232430
filtering	grouping
the problem was that the user being authenticated was a local account and by default local accounts have a filtering token with the builtin administrators grouping having a deny acl

232444
datarow	dataview
load your two-dimensional string array into an actual datatable system.data.datatable and then use the datatable object s select method to generate a sorted array of datarow objects or use a dataview for a similar effect

232468
realloc	malloc
also obviously in real code you d check that the return from malloc realloc isn t null

232488
dxcore	coderush
mark miller is the architect for dxcore coderush refactor pro

232500
pull	push
the clients are part of a product that will be installed in the wild and phoning home to push and pull data

232558
ienumerator	idisposable
i noticed that the generic inherits from idisposable but the non-generic interface ienumerator does not

232559
int	boolean
the functional spec is f int int - boolean not f string string - boolean which is kind of the domain of indexof

232562
for-loop	arrays
the actual extraction has to use a for-loop though as far as i can see array.copy requires the source and target ranks to be the same and buffer.blockcopy only works for value type arrays

232563
min	max
i have exhausted the various settings of margins padding sizes min max locations anchors.

232602
ienumerator	idisposable
ienumerator t does inherit idisposable however whereas the non-generic ienumerator doesn t

232602
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	idisposable
even when you use foreach for a non-generic ienumerable which returns ienumerator the compiler will still generate a check for idisposable and call dispose if the enumerator implements the interface

232607
ienumerator	idisposable
having ienumerator descend from idisposable ensures that it can clean up when enumeration is complete

232616
implements	extends	ienumerator	idisposable
with c# 1.2 introduced in vs2003 - there s no 1.1 bizarrely foreach began to check in the finally block whether or not the iterator implements idisposable - they had to do it that way because retrospectively making ienumerator extends idisposable would have broken everyone s implementation of ienumerator

232616
ienumerator	idisposable
if they d worked out that it s useful for foreach to dispose of iterators in the first place i m sure ienumerator would have extended idisposable

232644
children	parent
and if you were trying to access the children from the parent you would do

232666
ienumerable	iqueryable
because of this a jagged array is iqueryable ienumerable because you can iterate over it to receive an array at each iteration

232666
ienumerable	iqueryable
whereas a rectangular array is not iqueryable ienumerable because elements are addressed in full dimension 0 0 0 1..etc so you won t have the ability to use linq or any predefined functions created for array in that case

232684
width	height
add width and height as attributes to show dialog function and the set them to the dialog and dialog-content elements on line 68

232695
filesystems	ntfs
the first part of mark bessey s is somewhat correct however even on modern versions of windows with modern filesystems ntfs for example you can still run into problems

232696
free	malloc
free uses the malloc chain to free the block that was allocated which does not necessarily have the same size as the array you requested

232750
put	get
therefore you could put the items the user has picked into a table then join from this table to the table containing the price then use the set function sum to get the total price

232756
free	malloc
then figure out when the memory that is about to be free d was malloc ed

232770
post	get
then in the code you see if the editingby is greater than 0 you can warn userb that usera you know the userid is editing the ticket like so does when someone post an answer and you are writing yours or when you get a new badge for example

232833
for-loop	loops
in the reviewer s ideal language you just well hack some ugly code crying because you don t have a for_while loops or c s for-loop

232888
post	get
by using conditions on your routes you can map both the login form which is a get and the form submit which is a post to the same path

232931
lisp	smalltalk
learn ruby learn groovy learn smalltalk learn lisp learn the differences between then both in theory and in practice

232960
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk comon lisp python javascript all have very interesting ways of implementing oop

233004
inject	interceptor
you can leverage inversion of control containers like castle windsor to inject logging auditing into the commands without having to change your application at all using the interceptor pattern

233013
haskell	ocaml
i m very curious how other languages php ruby java lua ocaml haskell handle recursion and why they handle it that way

233018
multiplying	transpose
if we could change it to something else for instance if we were to transpose the matrix and multiplying the other way around then it would be very easy to get a more succint and probably elegant way

233024
equals	gethashcode
or implement your own wrapper that overrides the equals and gethashcode

233038
allocator	stl
2 - transfert allocator ownership which happens without your consent when using allocator and or deallocating inlined code or stl

233142
multiton	singleton
actually there is a variant on the singleton called multiton or multiplton or something like that

233166
addition	multiplication
you have an addition in either case but in the second one you have no multiplication you avoid the cpu time needed for one multiplication

233166
multiplying	add
as cpus can do more and more in a single assembly command ages ago a compiler really had to manually fetch the address multiplying i by four and add both together before fetching the value statements that used to be an absolute truth ages ago are nowadays more and more questionable

233168
actionscript	mxml
the difficulty with flex is to understand how a mxml component maps the equivalent pure actionscript class

233188
width	height
if you go to the link in both ie and firefox resize width until 800 is displayed in the green box top-right and resize height until the scrollbar at the right is enabled you can see the problem

233197
free	malloc
also make sure you link statically with the runtime libraries and do not try thing such as allocating memory ptr malloc 1024 in a module and then releasing that memory in another module free ptr

233206
children	parent
threads have different contexts and stacks and generally the parent thread is not required to stay there and wait for the children to finish so that it could catch their exceptions

233232
sudo	passwd
hardcoding a passwd in an expect script is the same as having a passwordless sudo actually worse since sudo at least logs its commands

233288
put	get
note i have put the t with extra spaces otherwise they get stripped from the question

233379
titlebar	window
i can think of trying to subvert mouse messages if there s a mouse-down on the titlebar though nc hit-testing doesn t at first glance seem completely obvious in winforms and i can think of responding to move messages in some way which restores the window position

233457
folder	directory
it applied on the c windows directory while i called the command from the wwwroot folder

233561
postgresql	mysql
i would require you go with mysql or postgresql if you don t need the advanced featuers of oracle

233618
mouse	keyboard
edit after peeking at the kernel source actually patch history it looks like linux at least gathers entropy from keyboard presses mouse activity interrupt timing but not all interrupts and block device request finishing times

233618
mouse	keyboard
on a virtualized system i suspect that mouse keyboard events would be pretty low and thus not contribute to the entropy gathered

233687
hash	salt
that s why using salt random bits in your hash is the way go

233687
hash	md5
in md5 there s actually possibility of hash collisions where as sha-1 is supposedly still secure but there are also rainbow table attacks against both of the hash

233687
hash	salt
generating a hash with salt user id and time stamp sounds feasible for your solution

233819
width	height
querying the svg s xml content server-side determining a suitable width and height and then dynamically adding the width and height attributes prior to returning markup to the browser would be your best bet

233895
versioning	upgrade
the problem reports and solutions suggests that i upgrade to the latest retail versioning of visual studio team edition for software testers which is not right

233936
hide	show
i basically want it so that when they click choose option 2 the options 1 div hide itself and the options 2 div show itself and then gives the second link the selected class and removes the class from the image link

233985
width	height
where each brick s width and height is q the brick s current location of the upper left corner is x1 y1 and the new brick location is x2 y2

234017
post	get
here s a post to get started

234122
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
also i think you ll find that safari and opera behave like firefox in most circumstances

234180
mouse	keyboard
i need something to capture and record mouse and keyboard events in addition to coded events

234181
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i have a sorted collection of objects it can be either sortedlist or sorteddictionary i will use it mainly for reading so add performance is not that important

234285
firefox	safari
if you don t expect -moz properties to work on safari and filter on firefox you can ignore that warnings

234378
accessor	properties
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well

234394
int	chars
then you could use int egers rather than chars acters

234423
x86	64bit
if you decide to go this route be sure to install opencv version 1.0 and install it to c program files opencv if you are on vista 64bit or mklink opencv c program files x86 opencv from the correct directory or else opencvdotnet will not install

234437
int	chars
that being the case you can save yourself some additional programming and pain by giving the cards int values 1-13 instead of chars values

234591
tolower	toupper
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

234591
tolower	toupper
toupper depends on what your strings contain more of and that typically strings contain more lower case characters which makes tolower more efficient

234639
tolower	toupper
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

234681
inherited	properties
i have a custom control that inherited from webcontrol and implements ivalidator but i also want to have a properties for validationgroup

234698
int	double
my func is mapped to a c# .net method which takes a double or int as parameter

234724
serializable	deserialization
i ve been using java for 3 years now and serializable deserialization is fairly trivial in that language

234731
snmp	mib
depending on the library you use and how it hides the details of interacting with snmp you may have a hard time finding the correct parts of the mib to change and even knowing what or how to change them to do what you want

234732
put	get
the same as c++ except that the bullets the gun parts the tools you use to put it together the hospital you get taken to afterwards and the ambulance that takes you there are all owned by the same company

234735
hide	show
in my specific implementation i added custom metadata attributes to methods and properties and i had to invoke a securitymanager.test method in each secured function as a final layer of authorization securitymanager.test was normally invoked to determine whether to show or hide pieces of a form and determine which buttons were visible in the ui

234752
ftp	telnet
often heard as in freela casts a tac nuke at shub-internet for slowing her down. a forged response often follows along the lines of shub-internet gulps down the tac nuke and burps happily. also cursed by users of ftp and telnet when the system slows down

234768
struts	stripes	jsf	stripes
i also came from a struts and jsf background into stripes

234768
struts	stripes	jsf	stripes
i went from a large enterprise environment that used mostly struts and jsf on newer projects to a smaller environment that did all their j2ee in stripes

234768
jsf	stripes
if i had to start a fresh new project and i had my say i would choose either stripes or jsf

234909
hl7	x12
i have some edi messages x12 hl7 etc ... stored in an oracle database

234914
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
standard image formats bmp png jpeg tiff

234970
csla	.net
in a recent episode of .net rocks rocky lhotka talks about the upcoming version ov csla will have mvc support

234976
folder	directory
it was using the c winnt system32 or the asp.net temporary folder directory

234999
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
let me guess in netbeans it was loading it from the file system which is case-insensitive whereas when running it from the desktop it was in a jar file which is case-sensitive

235080
hide	show
application c show and hide a form repeatedly

235114
int	double
another thing to try if you know the number of objects beforehand is to use the hashmap int capacity double loadfactor constructor instead of the default no-arg one which uses defaults of 16 0.75

235126
mouse	keyboard
and you may find this page of firefox s default keyboard and mouse shortcuts useful another version of same information

235126
opera	safari
keyboard shortcuts for opera and safari

235142
getter	setter
in this i have a sessionvars class which does the grunt work for session state getter setter

235142
getter	setter
i then also add getter setter for specific types especially string since i often prefer to work with string.empty rather than null for variables presented to users

235142
getter	setter
i deploy on a web farm at work so added checks to my code in the core layer to see if the object is serializable another benefit of encapsulating the session getter and setter

235155
inherited	properties
fwiw this same issue exists in vb.net with the exception being that microsoft specifically overrides and then hides the forecolor and backcolor properties inherited from the generic control object to do nothing

235161
profiler	visualvm
in particular i d suggest using either netbeans profiler or visualvm which comes with java 6 but i see you re stuck with java 5

235169
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
back in school on of my instructors said for business applications all you need to know know add subtract multiplying and divide

235185
hide	show
the toolkit primarily includes fancy controls especially ones with dhtml effects show hide mimic animation

235194
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can do this with a stringwriter writing the value directly to a stringbuilder object

235259
ant	cruisecontrol
here s an article on configuring phpunit to work with ant and cruisecontrol not that hard

235268
gridview	detailsview
if you are using the gridview or detailsview control the datacontrolfield objects that are automatically created for example when the autogeneratecolumns property is true are not stored in the publicly accessible fields collection

235310
range	max	range	min	min	max
show max min average for the time range

235329
children	parent
for example if you try to import data you need to make sure that you first import the parent and then children

235373
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been trying to modify the following menu to make it look indentical in ie firefox and safari google-chrome but i can t seem to get it to look right in safari google-chrome

235373
google-chrome	safari
when viewed in safari or google-chrome notice that the menu is ignoring the padding

235384
put	get
stories that get added as the project go on get put into the right group and handled as appropriate for that group -- if it s current release enough detail to work with if later just the title as a placeholder

235387
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql and mysql are good options especially if you can use those in your production environment

235405
google-chrome	firefox
at least ones with bug trackers firefox google-chrome chromium etc

235515
children	parent
currently we have a view that maps children to levels in the hierarchy and a nasty query that does the heavy lifting to connect parent with their children

235532
jar	manifest.mf
that entailed doing a number of things unfortunately the package with the incorrect manifest.mf still had the log4j jar specified in the bundle-classpath and that seems to override the import-package list

235555
squash	branch
one thing that i like about git is that it allows a person to easily squash all the changes made in a branch when pulling the changes back into the master branch

235564
public	protected
the messagequeueexception has no public constructor only the standard protected constructor for an exception

235573
post	get
if you really want to prevent access via bots make the link to it a post instead of a get

235603
pop-up	dialog
the basic file upload feature that s in the html specs results in the browse... button that pop-up a file open dialog and uploads the raw file data as is to the server

235672
fgets	ftell
if you are certain that the new line will be the same length as the old line you can open the file in read write mode use r+ as the second argument to fopen and call ftell to save the position the line starts at each time before you call fgets to read a line

235685
getter	setter
i mean if they re a pojo one class setter should take the other class getter as arguments

235699
multiplying	addition
bit shifts are so simple where a multiplying could be a shift and an addition that this makes sense

235744
jar	war
the war will get updated and place a jar in the web-inf lib containing the pre-compiled jsps

235744
jar	war
you can also just work with the ojspc jar directly and avoid trying to configure the oracle compilejsp task the code below takes a war file and pre-compiles the jsps in it

235788
hash	md5
to elaborate there are 16 bytes in an md5 hash

235814
kate	kde
there s also kate if you run kde

235855
width	height
i m trying to get a background image of a html element body div etc. to stretch its entire width and height

236001
free	malloc
my understanding is that in unix when memory is free the memory doesn t get returned back to the operating system it stays in the process to be used again for the next call to malloc

236012
free	malloc
malloc does not normally return the free memory to the operating system

236018
serializable	deserialization
it is my understanding that the performance degradation you get from overloading the session is due to the overhead of serializable deserialization not storage size

236058
public	protected
putting huge java comment section headers for the public private protected fields constants etc throughout your file

236097
int	chars
in gnu emacs chars seem to be ordinary int

236098
rss	feed
have an rss or atom feed with update info

236111
free	malloc
on linux with glibc the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glibc malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory

236137
cout	cin
for example printf and scanf both are faster then cin and cout significantly the fopen syntax is a lot more friendly for binary types and they also tend to produce smaller exes

236148
put	get
if you put any of their code in your box then you have to make sure you are operating within the terms of their license and they will almost certainly make you jump through some hoops to get yourself approved by them

236152
versioning	upgrade
then we had to support several different ecel versioning and upgrade of our content between them

236172
boost	stl
preferably using the stl or boost

236197
listview	gridview
with the listview + gridview control il quite complex because this control thinks in column so you have to create a template for every column and switch the read-only template with edit template for every cell

236221
smtplib	imaplib
you can build one using email for generating and parsing mail imaplib for reading and managing incoming mail from your mail server and smtplib for sending mail to the world

236229
getter	setter
your getter setter should do what they say on the tin

236229
getter	setter
if your getter setter methods aren t getting and setting then describe them as something else

236231
packets	multicast
if several independent instances of my application are in use on the same network they could each use their own multicast address - but if they don t they will be able to coexist anyway they ll just have a small amount of overhead ignoring each others packets

236323
int	double
i need to compare the int part of two double for inequality and i m currently doing this

236335
integer	unsigned
if being signed is the problem i can solve this by making the integer unsigned but this would only be a temporary solution as the next iteration yields 938043756000 which is far above the 4294967296 limit

236337
free	malloc
malloc uses also mmap particularly for large allocations where a whole chunk of memory can be easily returned after being free

236339
gif	bmp
you can try it online provided you can transform your bmp into a gif first

236340
int	double
edit realized that if you are comparing int parts of double casting to int values first runs the risk of overflows should your double be outside the range that could be represented as int

236341
unsigned	short
unsigned short int max 65535

236355
packets	multicast
you should have some logic in your application to handle foreign packets to alert the user through logs or some other mechanism that your application has detected multicast packets from another app with instructions on how to change the configuration

236387
for-loop	loops
i would ideally like to do it in one while of for-loop but i m not sure how to tell that loops what the order of the fields is going to be so it can fill all 8 or 6 strings correctly

236411
int	chars
is_int returns true if the argument is an int type ctype_digit takes a string argument and returns true if all the chars in the string are digits

236439
int	double
the point is i need to compare the int part of two double and i m just casting them to int and then using but as someone pointed out in one of my earlier questions this could throw an overflow exception if the double can t fit into the int

236476
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that when showing that dialog box it causes another validation event because it s considered losing focus on the control again and you end up with an infinite loop of dialog pop-up

236534
google-chrome	safari
i ve just had a look at the webkit google-chrome safari â source

236534
quicksort	mergesort
contiguous arrays of non-numeric type are stringified and sorted using mergesort if available to obtain a stable sorting or quicksort if no merge sort is available

236536
folder	directory
unpacking all .zip files within a single deeply nested directory structure may require only on stack but you need to shorten the threshold a bit to account for folder in the .zip etc

236550
serializable	deserialization
this is designed to be side-by-side compatible with regular .net approaches such as xmlserializer datacontractserializer but is much smaller than xml and requires significantly less processing cpu etc for both serializable and deserialization

236584
daemon	cron
i d say that if your server can handle the load but not in real time i d build a queue on the server and have a cron job or daemon process the images outside of the request

236603
children	parent
nested set trees are one parent to multiple children

236616
coalesce	isnull
a particular nasty t-sql example is the use of isnull use coalesce

236631
awt	swing
swing and awt

debian	linux
i am trying to use timerfd_create and timerfd_settime under debian linux lenny

236709
uniq	grep
-name .java | xargs cat | grep import java | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -100

236739
ienumerable	ilist
havn t check the nulls and off-by-one cases and ilist ienumerable differences but you should get the idea

236779
ready	each
work in small iterations say 2 weeks have ready application by the end of each and single iteration your testers should be happy to release the results to your customers

236783
agile	sprint
if you want to prove that agile works i d probably vote for using the sprint to show what release early release often means

236792
min	max
has min and max number if lines

236811
width	height
the recommendation of the developer explicitly freeing up the memory used in image manipulation is sure just to make absolutely sure not to have a memory leak as bitmaps can be straining on the memory side of things height width bit depth 3 + 1 if you have an alpha channel

236826
onchange	onkeydown	onchange	onkeyup	onkeyup	onkeydown
in general for text inputs you want to use onkeypress onkeyup onkeydown events not onchange for this type of autocomplete

236838
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd	debian	linux
i d like this to be as platform-independent as possible meaning it has info that s relevant for any linux distro as well as bsd solaris os x etc but the unix systems that i use the most are os x and debian ubuntu

236873
stdout	stderr
what follows below is just the core runtime.exec plus 2 thread to listen to stdout and stderr

236984
yacc	bison
you could again convolute the heck out of it to avoid that but it s probably even better to avoid regex s altogether here and handle it by parsing one field at a time perhaps by using a recursive-descent parser or yacc bison or whatever

237001
getter	setter
a simple java class that takes an object and test all the getter and setter methods

237001
getter	setter
i do think you should avoid getter and setter methods as much as possible but as long as they re around and it takes two lines to test them it s a good thing to do it

237022
istream	getline
use getline istream string to read in a full line at a time not including the eol

237028
for-loop	loops
the truth is python performs the above two steps anytime it wants to loops over the contents of an object - so it could be a for-loop but it could also be code like otherlist.extend mylist where otherlist is a python list

237028
for-loop	loops
when the for-loop tries to loops over the generator object the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the yield it previously returned from executes the next line of code in this case a yield statement and returns that as the next item

237038
fileinputstream	filechannel
reading files using java nio s filechannel and mappedbytebuffer will most likely result in a solution that will be much faster than any solution involving fileinputstream

237048
min	max
now find the max of the winners and the min of the losers

237048
min	max
from above finding the min or the max of n elements takes n-1 compares

237048
min	max
n 2 for the initial compares + n 2 - 1 max of the winners + n 2 - 1 min of the losers n 2 + n 2 + n 2 -2 3n 2 - 2

237093
ctime	posix
unfortunately on windows ctime means creation time whereas on posix it means change time

237111
ostream	istream
for char istream and ostream

237114
children	parent
you want your parent to know their children but not the other way

237140
subclass	accessor
the benefits of this are that each subclass doesn t have to define its own set of fields and can still access the key and value by their accessor

237140
subclass	accessor
if a subclass truly needs to define its own behavior for the accessor it can implement the map.entry interface directly

237140
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
bloch warns against calling overridable methods item 17 from classes designed for inherited as it leaves the superclass vulnerable to changes made by subclassing

237144
cvs	svn
sometimes the sources come deliveded in the .jar file of the lib sometimes as a seperate download my favorite and sometimes i have to create a seperate cvs svn dir where i can checkout the sources

237206
super	self
just wrap the existing method or create a new one breakout synthesize whatever values you need store them in your new fields and then super session self .save

237208
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
to hide the uinavigationbar you ll want to use the navigationbarhidden property of your uinavigationcontroller

237291
vim	emacs
a fellow developer i work with wants to use either vim or emacs for the low overhead without running visual studio

237291
vim	emacs
in essence he would like to be able to write tests edit code in emacs or vim then just run nant scripts to compile the code and run the tests

237316
multiplying	multiplication
multiplication is kind of like multiplying two two-digit numbers except each digit is in base 2 32 instead of base 10

237316
addition	multiplication
an addition requires two adds instead of one and a multiplication would i think require four multiplies instead of one

237319
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you can switch to a uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller based hierarchy and hook your current opengl uiview to a uiviewcontroller s view outlet

237341
boost	stl
i ve used a lot of template code mostly in boost and the stl but i ve seldom had a need to write any

237350
setinterval	settimeout
i am trying to call a settimeout from within a setinterval callback

237350
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval works as expected but settimeout call is failing

237356
boost	stl
templates i regulary consume are a multitude of container classes boost smart pointers scopeguards a few stl algorithms

237356
int	double
bool containsnan double int

237367
postgresql	mysql
or is this just because of the versions i am using php 5.2 mysql 5.0 postgresql 8.1

237371
postgresql	mysql
it s just an accident that the person who implemented the mysql connector did it differently than the person who implemented the postgresql connector

237387
setinterval	settimeout
as a matter of best-practice try not to use strings as parameters to settimeout and setinterval because that will invoke eval .

237410
mouse	keyboard
i have this vague feeling that beos used to let one pair a mouse and keyboard and have separate active windows and inputs

237472
vim	emacs
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth

237495
disk	ram
now this is offset quite a bit in a typical streaming scenario because the block that is read from disk is going to still be in memory when you hit the next read we are doing sequential reads here after all - so you wind up paying the ram - l3 l2 cache latency price on the next read but not the disk- ram latency

237524
disk	ram
in our case the real reason for doing this was to save space on disk and reduce time spent on disk - ram transfers and that 1 3 savings made a huge difference in effective disk performance

237639
post	get
normally i d say log all of the request including get post cookies form state in aspnet user agent other headers date time server machine etc

237643
post	get
this post covers everything you need to get started

237659
put	get
if you put this in a class you will need to get the control reference like

237660
google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome uses webkit it has the same rendering engine and dom support as safari not necessarily the same revision of webkit though

237660
google-chrome	safari
by testing in safari you can generally get by without worrying about google-chrome

237660
google-chrome	safari
however because google-chrome uses a different js engine there may be a few incompatibilities with safari

237715
delphi	oxygene
what i mean are about not the delphi for .net or oxygene tech plugin but clean .net c#

237745
int	double
it would return comparators for stuff like string double int but would have a

237774
xstream	jibx
finally as others have mentioned if you could it s a good idea to consider an xml marshalling library jaxb castor jibx xmlbeans xstream to name a few

237818
folder	directory
this basically adds a .git folder to the current directory

237839
hash	salt
you could modify it as follows to encrypt the data with the application password salt with password hash

237843
folder	directory
cant i simply just ftp the blog folder to one of my virtual directory and then access it online

237859
int	double
it will either double print each string and add the int together or it simply returns the int depending on how i format it

237896
range	max	range	min	min	max
for example if i have a range object with two properties min and max and the invariant min max then i will create an exception invalidrangeexception

237955
macbook	bootcamp
recently for dealing with ie6 i used bootcamp bought and an msdn copy of xp to install xp on partition on my macbook

237959
width	height
output width 1 height 1

237961
vim	emacs
to a lot of people this is an issue which prevents them from attempting to use emacs or vim when working with rich large unwieldy delete as applicable apis

237969
cos	sin
the scalar - circle projection is simple as x cos v pi r y sin v pi r where x y is the resulting vertex point r is a radius and trigonometric functions work on radiances not degrees

237982
restrict	shared
with shared tomcat access to server.xml file is restrict

237990
drawimage	todataurl
html5 can export its content as png file using todataurl and it s possible to paint any element on canvas using drawimage so it should be possible to create paint it on canvas and export as data url

238057
int	chars	int	double
we had used in c++ and in c i guess compiler-defined literals to type int numbers as short or long int real numbers as float or double or even long double and chars strings as normal or wide chars

238057
int	boolean
i d guess it s very similar to .net s decision to make every primitive a struct including boolean int etc. and have all structs derive from object

238081
apache	lighttpd
i have the application running as fcgi server and i m using apache web server as frontend although thinking of going to lighttpd

238087
stdout	stderr
some will give you output on stdout or stderr that you can use

238140
freebsd	linux
an earlier version of linux and freebsd shell scripts appears on my blog

238151
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
because windows is case-insensitive and because svn is case-sensitive and because vs2005 tends to rename files giving them the lower-case form which messes my repositories history i ve tried to add the pre-commit hook script from

238195
setlocale	strftime
be also very carefull of the use of strftime it looks like a nice function but it is very unrelyable as it depends on setlocale which is process-wide

238263
bazaar	svn
subvertpy is quite new and is written by the author of bzr-svn the transparent svn inter-operation bridge for bazaar

238356
filesystems	ntfs
in addition fr regulatory compliance we have a middleware layer that archives newly posted documents to an optical jukebox system which exposes them as a standard ntfs filesystems

238427
ncover	ndepend
concerning the tool ndepend it comes with 82 different code metric from number of lines of code to method rank popularity cyclomatic complexity lack of cohesion of methods percentage coverage extracted from ncover or vsts depth of inheritance.

238446
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
it integrates with your source control system currently supports cvs svn and perforce and analyzes all your files that way

238477
uiview	subviews
one way you could do this is to create a new uiview and then when the button is pressed add that new uiview as a subviews therefore making it what you see

238536
jquery	simplemodal	google-chrome	firefox
i tried to override the settings in the default stlyesheet that comes with the simplemodal jquery plugin with containercss which is working fine in ie7 but not firefox or google-chrome

238591
rss	feed
it s pretty nice we can do things like get an rss feed for an app to watch for a few days when we make a change

238608
filesystems	ntfs
my understanding from the mercurial book is that mercurial should handle filenames in a case-insensitive manner on a case-insensitive filesystems such as ntfs which is what i m on

238652
jruby	mri
i run capistrano tasks using mri rather than the jruby interpreter

238655
tcplistener	tcpclient
in my past experience with tcp ip and the tcplistener tcpclient classes there is not much of a way to force the listener to drop it s connection until you drop the client connection

238692
sequence	permutation
it only works if there are no duplicate elements in the sequence if there are it misses some permutation and doesn t end in the correct perumtation

238739
profiler	vtune
you could use a sampling profiler like intel s vtune to obtain a measure of how many cpu cycles are being consumed with a minimum amount of disturbance on the system being measured

238744
gif	png
bitbtns don t accept gif or png images

238749
ssl	https
with ssl https the host name will be in the clear obviously as it has to find the server but the other parts of the url should be safely encrypted

238767
put	get	post	put	post	get
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request

238770
inherited	properties
it allows you to beget new instances of any object extend them while maintaining a live prototypical inherited link to their other properties

238894
subtraction	addition
z is what determines if the adder does subtraction or addition

238894
subtraction	addition
if it s 0 it means subtraction and i want to convert y to two s complement then just do regular addition

239007
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort is really hard to beat if you can hold things in memory and heapsort is quite effective for massive data set ordering although i personally prefer to use b+tree type implementations for the heap b c they are tuned to disk paging performance

239048
folder	directory
the web server will need the images to be stored in a web folder root or virtual directory to interperet the url to a local file location

239086
onclick	onsubmit
the main thing to notice is the removal of the event attributes onclick onsubmit or onkeypress from the html

239137
inherited	subclassing
an abstract class is used when you have some base functionality that you want subclassing to inherited but it wouldn t make sense to instantiate the base class

239138
post	get
as long as the necessary key value pairs are preserved at each redirect either by get or post everything will operate correctly

239145
hide	show
using expressions to hide and show objects is the correct way of achieving this sort of functionality

239232
portrait	landscape
some of the pages would look better if they were printed in landscape mode rather than portrait

239493
content-disposition	content-type
i d use the file name the server supplies in the response headers content-type or content-disposition depending on what you expect

239496
min	max
ideally i should be able to specify which keystrokes can be sent and control rate random min max

239507
swt	swing
swt is an alternative to swing though there is a degree of interoperability between them

239525
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
nice tools are tortoisesvn explorer plugin smartsvn vss-lookalike and commandline flexible

239528
allocator	stl
don t let memory allocator failures crash your legacy stl application

239532
spaces	delimiter
you can change delimiter cut -d would use a spaces as a delimiter

239588
put	get
am i right in saying that the worst that can happen is that new entries may get put into the wrong place which actually i can live with

239611
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could look into writing your own extension method like the one in omer s library but using iqueryable instead of ienumerable to support server-side execution

239622
versioning	upgrade
followup #2 figured i d try to upgrade the oracle client drivers but 10.2.0.1 is apparently the highest versioning available for windows 2003 server and xp clients

239622
post	get
if i manage to get to the real cause of this i ll update the post

239653
inherited	properties
you cannot do that on that way but you can access a properties s setter method from a derived class so you can use inherited for the purpose

239655
public	protected	inherited	properties
you can achieve to this by making a public properties in your settable class that will inherited from the real class that will have a protected property.

239674
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if you re getting that from an updatepanel set enablepartialrendering to false in the scriptmanager for the page and then it should give you the actual error

239728
jboss	weblogic
you just package your application in a war file web archive and provide that war file to the appserver tomcat jboss weblogic ... that will unpack the war and deploy it automatically

239817
folder	directory
for code in the app_code directory it s compiled on a per folder basis

239860
width	height
swf width 455 height 200 backgroundcolor #123456 framerate 25

240021
width	height
personally i view any html attributes like height width or the inline style attribute to be bugs

240024
wmv	ogg
strange thing is it works for example for wmv videos with yuv on their ouput only this ogg decoder has a problem with it

240029
inherited	properties
2 split the set from the properties with an inherited interface

240033
organization	naming
normally i use a naming scheme that puts common reusable components into a namespace that reflects our organization and project-specific components into a namespace tied to the project

240033
organization	naming
my inclination is to go the organization naming route and create an organization project name space for this application

240036
getter	setter
simply define the getter in one interface and create a second interface that has both the getter and the setter

240064
punctuation	words
i would prefer to avoid using punctuation and reserved words in table and column names and not use the square brackets

240150
post	get
if you re using that means you accept post get and cookie but it s mainly the first two we re interested in

240159
post	get
_post if data is being updated somewhere if the action has a side-effect _request otherwise and if you don t care whether or not the data comes via get post or any other method

240162
asterisk	pbx
an example of this type of approach is used in the asterisk pbx via the ztdummy module

240167
post	get
lately i ve been trying to be more diligent about using get only for read-requests post only for write-requests

240167
post	get
to that end i think using _get for get requests _post for post requests makes my intent much more clear in my code

240169
post	get
unless you have a good reason to do otherwise such as the search engine mentioned by michael it s probably better to use _get and _post for their respective methods instead of _request to avoid any ambiguity or confusion over possibly having the same argument name in the get and post data

240220
free	malloc
malloc free just allocate and release raw memory

240221
free	malloc
malloc free simply allocate memory from the heap

240222
free	malloc
new delete is c++ malloc free comes from good old c

240222
free	malloc
malloc and free coming from the dark ages before oo only allocate and free the memory without executing any code of the object

240226
free	malloc
malloc and free are c functions and they allocate and free memory blocks in size

240226
free	malloc
malloc and free are nonetheless more low level as they just reserve a chunk of memory space which will probably be associated with a pointer

240239
free	malloc
the only similarities are that malloc new both return a pointer which addresses some memory on the heap and they both guarantee that once such a block of memory has been returned it won t be returned again unless you free delete it first

240239
free	malloc
malloc free only ever allocate and free memory

240256
post	get
indirectly he doesn t talk about php itself but does say that you shouldn t accept both get and post for forms. the reason is that it s easy to use get requests for csrf attacks but not so easy to use post

240273
lisp	scheme
today lisp is a family of programming languages including common lisp and scheme which are standards with various implementations each and also clojure arc and many others

240308
free	malloc
whether they call malloc free is implementation defined

240308
free	malloc
malloc free

240308
free	malloc
malloc free can not be overridden legally

240308
free	malloc
technically memory allocated by new comes from the free store while memory allocated by malloc comes from the heap

240324
free	malloc
the global new and delete can be overridden malloc free cannot

240375
webkit	gecko
gecko and webkit based browsers really like their units

240388
kerberos	ldap
it is using gss api jndi to connect to active directory ldap server using kerberos

240421
implements	extends
you extends the behavior by sub-classing adesignerhappyimp which forces you to implements all the abstract members

240471
versioning	upgrade
the client code was also all versioning 1.1 of .net so we d have to upgrade all the client code

240499
post	get
you can try using post and get methods for transferring user inputs within php scripts

240608
client-side	server-side
just because it looks like it might be doing something special its not all that happens is it post s back with some info about what caused it so you can do things like handle client-side events in server-side code

240692
httpconnection	downloading
i am trying to downloading an xml.gz file from a remote server with httpconnection in java but i am getting an empty response

240709
post	get
see post redirect get

240709
post	get
you want the code that s handling the post to redirect to a get when it s work is done as refreshing a get will not resubmit form data

240755
put	get
if i put in a value of .5pi or less it works but otherwise i get the incorrect result

240769
post	get
if you are worried about someone looking over the user s shoulder use form post instead of get

240790
quad	uniform
however if you want uniform distribution the probability of having a point in one of the triangle must be equal to the area of the triangle divided by the area of the quad

240864
profiling	benchmarking
as well as the other suggestions which are good - profiling and benchmarking are very important i d say that if jformula is doing anything significant within each method call then the boxing unboxing when making the call is likely to be insignificant

240881
public	protected
if the base class member variable is protected or public than you can just refer to it by name in any member function of the derived class

240881
getter	setter
there is also something to be said for keeping all member variables private and providing getter and setter as needed

240886
versioning	upgrade
files were named after those versioning - so if my upgrade script got the database versioning 10 it just took all files from 11.sql to n.sql and applied each one of them incrementing database versioning number at the same time

240887
int	chars
symbol public virtual int __thiscall cwnd create chars const chars const unsigned

240889
post	get
i was originally going to agree with joseph bui on the grounds that it would be more processor efficient to use the post method instead web standards dictate that if the request is not changing data on the server the get method should be used

240903
rdf	owl
i m looking for a library that can deal with rdf and owl data

240917
installation	upgrade
another advantage to this is that we can keep various installation at different functionality levels for different customers yet when we do upgrade all the scripts are in place and ready to run

240948
google-chrome	firefox
right now i am printing them directly to a webpage and it works properly in google-chrome and ie 7 but not firefox

241005
post	get
i actually have a call in to the sqlce team directly to find out if there is a count limit on this i ll post back when i get a reply likely later today though with pdc ongoing it might be longer

241044
sequence	permutation
in all cases to meet the constraint you probably need to test all permutation of the sequence

241167
dictionary	map
i suppose you could create a map dictionary to maintain an external intuitive mapping

241239
pecl	pear
wamp server comes with pecl pear

241258
instances	transient
i had failed to mark my controller with the transient lifestyle so i was getting the same instances back on each request

241396
put	get
as a first step i am looking for a good way to get a number of ms software products xp vista server 2003 2008 office 2000 2003 2007 ... to put on some vms in my testing setup so i can start to play around

241414
put	get
you ll have to put it somewhere but you get to keep the original in case like e you mess up regularly on your regexps

241468
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
if you can t find any on-line crerate a gif or bmp or png image for each char

241503
rss	feed
this is just a short snippet from kuler rss feed

241526
rss	feed
i ve been tasked with build an accessible rss feed for my company s job listings

241526
rss	feed
i already have an rss feed from our recruiting partner

241526
rss	feed
so i m transforming their rss xml to our own proxy rss feed to add additional data as well limit the number of items in the feed so we list on the latest jobs

241527
folder	dir
i believe the minimum you need to have a wp show up in the new part of the webpart catalog you need the dll in the bin folder bin in the web dir not the 12 hive or in the gac and a safe control entry

241527
folder	dir
if this doesn t work you can try adding a .webpart file to the wpcatalog folder in your web dir

241568
apache	lighttpd
perhaps look into something like lighttpd if apache iis isn t fast enough

241575
django	turbogears
django could be an option but doesn t seem as flexible as turbogears

241595
google-chrome	safari
the problem browser at the moment is safari and google-chrome

241595
google-chrome	safari
the problem seems to be webkit based browsers with safari and google-chrome being the problem i d presume that konqueror may suffer the same fate but at the moment i don t have a linux install at my disposal

241621
nstableview	nssplitview
i generally use an nssplitview with a single column nstableview in the left pane

241621
nstableview	nssplitview
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc

241648
.htaccess	httpd.conf
using your example urls and building on what i said before i d say to use this code in your httpd.conf or .htaccess

241713
google-chrome	safari
it looks like safari on my os x at least - which should be default settings and i assume google-chrome don t allow 3rd party cookies by default

241715
post	get
i don t want a cookie to store the session as it should get lost when the user gets out of the post cycle

241760
int	chars
int chars

241787
sorting	filtering
if you are new to .net you will want to learn about the list collection and the flexibility it will give you in respect to sorting filtering and iteration

241882
width	height
what i did was start with 640x480 and increase the width and height by 80 and 60 respectively until it failed

241882
width	height
jpg mvideocontrol.getsnapshot encoding jpeg quality 100 width + width + height + height

241883
octal	decimal
the fix ahem was to convert the pid to a string representing its value in octal rather than decimal making it impossible to contain a 9 and unnecessary to address the underlying problem

241897
int	boolean
i need an int count variable or boolean odd even variable to track the row

241908
integer	unsigned
if you want the biggest unsigned number within one of the standard integer types why not

241908
octal	hex
but groups of four which is another power of 2 gives the humans a lot more mental computing power than octal hex is based on 4 bits which is also a power of 2

241908
octal	hex
octal is rarely if ever used you can tell someones age if they think octal instead of hex

241908
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
i am from the hex generation but have worked with those from the octal generation that struggle with hex because they cannot get from octal to binary to hex in their mind

241908
put	get
back to four bits though the biggest symbol for a single bit is 1 put that number in each storage location you get 1111 four ones

241908
octal	hex
just by looking at those four ones you should be able to in your mind easily see the octal and hex version of that same number 17 octal or f hex

241908
hex	binary
so when you want to think big numbers and math on a computer you have to think binary or hex

241908
subtract	add
essentially the add subtract integer math functions in the computer allow you to have n+1 bits

241908
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
the problem is multiplying and divide which even today many processors do not support yes many have no fpu and only do add and subtract sometimes multiplying but divide is rare

241908
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software

241908
integer	unsigned
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first

241908
subtraction	addition
because of the relationships between addition and subtraction and base systems you can play some tricks

241908
subtract	add
well there is no such thing as a subtract circuit you instead add a negative number so instead of 7 - 1 it is really 7 + -1 it makes a difference

241908
integer	unsigned
the compiler first looks at that -1 and thinks ...11111 binary then it looks at the equals sign and the other side oh you want a to be all ones it sees that you have a signed integer and an unsigned but the conversion is to just move the bits over so you are saying above that you want a 0xff

241908
int	chars
other compilers will look at that -1 and see it as a 32 bit or these days maybe 64 bit signed int constant and then when it evaluates the equals into an 8 bit unsigned you will get a warning that you cannot store -1 in a signed or unsigned chars without a typecast

241908
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
supposedly there are tricks to do add and subtract well duh those are easy but also multiplying and divide

241942
inherited	properties
if your class did not have any child properties that you wanted to expose then instead inherited from typeconverter

241949
width	height
i want to change item s height and width according to a slider but as far as i know there s no measureitem method as clistbox

241983
post	get
i think you d be best off switching the script to a post method as most edit-in-place uses will be too big to use get practically

241983
post	get
if your ajax url is a php file i m fairly certain it should be able to access the session without needing to pass it in either a get or post array

242008
post	get
since you say jeditable uses get i can only assume you re using the loadurl option since the jeditable uses to save the changes and always uses post

242115
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	sml	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	scheme
having scheme sml ocaml or haskell on your resume suggests you are a very well rounded programmer and quite a thinker

242157
lisp	scheme
i worked through most of it earlier this year and used common lisp simply because i didn t have scheme available don t ask

242157
lisp	scheme
as has already been noted scheme is a lisp-1 language whereas common lisp is a lisp-2

242173
uiview	calayer
additionally on the iphone every single uiview is backed on a layer i do not believe there is anything on the iphone s screen that is not in a layer so i don t understand why you are worried about using animation on something that is not a calayer

242215
post	get
if it s not selected it won t appear in the request get post in php at all

242219
disk	ram
i would use whatever server hardware you can afford 1 2 3 machines with plenty of ram and disk space and use virtual server or vmware server

242254
rss	feed
it wouldn t be too good if you were parsing any old rss feed but because the data is from adobe kuler you can be pretty sure that it s not going to vary enough to break your app it s a trusted enough source

242254
rss	feed
so yeah the rss feed are probably the easiest way of interfacing with kuler

242317
free	malloc
seeing as malloc free normally involve extensive data structures that exist in userspace free ing memory when your program ends can actually be a performance drain

242317
free	malloc
of course free ing at other times is usually beneficial as further malloc s can re-use the space you free and free might even unmap some memory which can then be used by other processes

242324
overlay	z-order
for example if you have a floating div with a higher z-order overlay on top of a select - the select element will still render on top of the div

242432
post	get
check out this post on how to enable get query strings together with segmented urls

242432
put	get
you may get the uri you submitted has disallowed characters error if you simply put anything the user enters in the uri

242479
jar	war
i would definitely just create an executable jar that embeds jetty and uses your war

242546
kerberos	ldap
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server

242551
awt	swing
tools- palette- swing awt components

242564
for-loop	arrays
i recommend using plain old for-loop but you should consider different arrays lengths

242599
vxworks	qnx
python agents works on qnx vxworks - and most problems we have was to port properly threading and network related parts of our code

242663
hash	salt
also don t forget to use a salt to help protect the hash against dictionary attacks

242680
cvs	svn
if you are generating your diff from a version control system then take a look at the vcscommand.vim cvs svn svk git integration plugin

242682
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql only though

242683
directx	directdraw	direct3d	directx	direct3d	directdraw
i believe directdraw the old school way of doing 2d in directx is obsolete so i guess you must be using direct3d

242684
hide	show
in case you need possibility to hide and show scrollbars dynamically you could use

242700
classname	inherited
new-style classes inherited from object and must be written as such in python 2.2 onwards class classname object instead of class classname

242705
width	height
also floating elements more often than not needs to have width an height attached

242731
folder	directory
basically i get the header paths to be equivalent by making a directory named externals in my iphone project root then a directory named with the appropriate name myframework in the externals folder

242735
perforce	cvs
as cvs bonsai or perforce scm bugzilla provides a

242810
cvs	svn
i will never use svn again for a personal project - ya its great compared to cvs but isn t even in the same class as the modern breed of distributed version control systems

242810
bazaar	git
bazaar vs git

242864
postgresql	mysql
schemabank a web-based saas vendor can turn your er design into sql statements for mysql and postgresql

242879
boost	stl
stl s auto and shared in boost c++0x pointers may help

242894
cublas	cufft
when writing cuda applications you can either work at the driver level or at the runtime level as illustrated on this image the libraries are cufft and cublas for advanced math

242915
client-side	server-side
and are there cases where it s better to use server-side sproc or client-side inline linq queries

242953
cpu	processors
on a 32 bit cpu a 64 bit integer will be more processors intensive to perfom calculations with

242991
rss	feed
i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss

243011
int	double
as an aside at my company we have a number of these custom types defined as standard for lists of strings double int and so on

243017
ssl	https
if you find an easy way to factorize numbers that large you break e-mail signing and ssl https for example

243071
websphere	ibm
i can t find it in websphere and i m getting tired of googlin around ibm pages

243074
appkit	nsanimation
appkit provides couple examples as well nsanimation retains itself in startanimation and releases itself when the animation is done

243112
csv	tsv
if the database isn t sql server and doesn t support xml natively another option would be to use a basic xslt to transform the xml into csv or tsv

243130
filtering	grouping
while on the intranet site we may use a more robust grid control in our case the devexpress grid control this allows the user to sort grouping filtering and add remove columns without putting an excessive programming burden on the developer but delivering a better user experience when it comes to working with the data

243170
mouse	keyboard
at each application tick i query the current state of the keyboard and mouse and wrap them in individual classes and data structures

243170
mouse	keyboard
for the keyboard it s an array of my keys enum one item for each of the keys that are currently pressed and for the mouse it s a class containing coordinate delta s and bools for each buttons pressed

243179
websphere	ibm
we are running apache ibm http server 6.0.2.0 in front of websphere 6.0 on linux

243197
redmine	bugzilla
i have used jira too hard bugzilla too rubbish and fogbugz too expensive and i think redmine is fantastic

243275
lsp	principles
public inheritance must model the liskov substitution principles lsp

243328
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	trac	mantis
of the open source ones trac python redmine ruby mantis php and my own bugtracker.net c# all have their fans but i think with the open source ones there is a tendency to pick the technology as well as the application

243332
many-to-many	one-to-many
but it does depend on those many-to-many one-to-many relations being 2-way

243356
integer	unsigned
note there is still the issue of signed unsigned which can t always be avoided and the fact stl use its own integer types std vector size_type but all the remaining code should not mixing

243356
integer	unsigned
some bugs are created by comparing unsigned type to signed types mysterious loss of precision or integer under overflow

243356
int	chars
the source of the bug is mixing different types converting unsigned chars into int for example thus this kind of mixing must be avoided

243388
put	get	puts	gets
use http methods semantically - get gets put puts delete deletes etc.

243484
serializable	deserialization
in theory my preferred approach to deserialization is chain of responsibility write factories capable of looking at serializable data including the type header and deciding for themselves whether they can construct an object from it

243503
vxworks	qnx
use a real time kernel such as vxworks or qnx

243515
post	get
this will get you an image as the result of a post -- you may not like it

243518
put	get	post	put	post	get
we usually use only two methods of http get and post but there are some more delete put etc

243525
mouse	keyboard
a much better and traditional solution would be to capture events fired from the keyboard and mouse

243531
fortran	ada
c c++ ada and fortran yes fortran are supported as well as some others

243650
diffmerge	winmerge
i tried two different diff merge software winmerge and diffmerge and the files are exactly the same

243714
udp	tcp
the internet protocol ip represents a standardization higher up the stack and has several different flavors tcp udp etc

243714
ftp	telnet
the introduction of the transmission control protocol guaranteed packet delivery defined communication contracts that opened us up to a whole new set of services ftp gopher telnet http for the application layer

243727
hex	binary
there s no option for binary constants in c or c++ but it s a bit clearer in hex

243729
hex	binary
hex values make it easy to see the underlying binary representation

243772
octal	decimal	octal	hex
there s a direct mapping between hex or octal for that matter digits and the underlying bit patterns which is not the case with decimal

243772
hex	binary
as a vestige of my 8-bit days i find hex a convenient shorthand for anything binary

243783
hex	binary
generally the use of hex numbers instead of decimal it s because the computer works with bits binary numbers and when you re working with bits also is more understandable to use hexadecimal numbers because is easier going from hex to binary that from decimal to binary

243783
hex	binary
it s much more simple to pass from hex to binary

243800
hide	show
i have an area of the screen that can be show and hidden via javascript something like show hide advanced search options

243814
folder	directory
i have copied by .net 2.0 web service project to the server and have created a virtual directory to point to the necessary folder

243860
post	get
this avoids having to get or post to the script and the images will have manageable filenames

244000
post	put
i am trying to post and put files to a feed but i am getting a 400 error saying that the content type must be application x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart form-data

244020
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
i find it maddening that the c family of languages have always supported octal and hex but not binary

244021
hash	salt
at least let me believe that it s hidden in a nice salt hash somewhere where you can t retrieve it ever

244036
folder	directory
second test your code on a directory you created under your own user folder

244054
ssl	https
https requests are the same as http only using ssl certificates

244099
ssl	https
i think https is a hosting issue you have to configure the keystore with your certificates or certificate chains setup your ssl tls map your dns settings also done for http and go ahead

244138
gw-basic	qbasic
i started off programming in basic on the zx81 then basica gw-basic and qbasic

244164
gif	png
i need to resize png jpeg and gif files

244217
free	malloc
this can be done safely if you are using heapalloc heapresize and heapfree functions but cannot be done using c runtime library eg malloc free resize

244217
free	malloc
but if you don t have a good reason you should stick with malloc free resize functions

244233
octal	hex
hex and octal have the property that they are powers of two so they map groupings of bit nicely

244253
rdf	owl
edit my main target is rdf owl skos in n3 notation

244272
portrait	landscape
however i haven t tried it since the 2.1 f w was released but when i tried this in 2.0 i found that the setting was lost after a rotation from portrait to landscape

244286
cout	ofstream
if you want a cout that writes to a file use an fstream particularly an ofstream

244294
qsort	bsearch
occasionally the perceived overhead of the function-call-per-comparison associated with using qsort or indeed bsearch is too great

244294
quicksort	heapsort
this would be good anyway - they are excellent - but more programming pearls also includes a library of simple algorithms written in awk including insertion sort heapsort and quicksort

244296
mouse	keyboard
if you simply query your keyboard and mouse every tick i can guarantee you ll run into problems

244300
puts	gets
the database needs to be reset before each test for proper isolation - a failing test that puts in bad data could cause false failures on tests that follow and it gets messy if you have to run tests in a certain order for consistent results

244375
mp3	ogg
the obvious option here would be to use mp3 or ogg vorbis

244481
xls	ods
i want to use google spreadsheets to store data online so multiple people can enter and maintain data then publish or export csv xls ods the sheet for their application

244482
ubuntu	linux
developing a heavily xml-based java-application i recently encountered an interesting problem on ubuntu linux

244493
serializable	deserialization
so i tried basic java serializable but from a basic test i conducted this somehow becomes a very costly operation building a bytearrayoutputstream an objectoutputstream and so on same for the deserialization

244550
floating-point	integer
you may have to be careful about precision errors but there are ways of finding the integer square root which do not require floating-point computation

244550
floor	sqrt
edit btw you can prove that floor sqrt 8ii+1 -1 2 isqrt 8ii+1 -1 2 where isqrt x floor sqrt x is integer square root and the division is integer division truncation

244584
cout	ofstream
cout ofstream etc

244592
r-tree	quadtree
if this is too much of a cheat i d recommend the quadtree as another answerer did or the r-tree

244615
hide	show
if i build the whole tree then expand it enough to show the project i m looking at it s also going to have expanded all my siblings even though it could hide my children

244703
put	get
you can run a get on foo to put it into the hibernate session and then replace it with the object you created elsewhere

244709
children	parent
their web page demos their application which allows you to traverse through a tree structure with parent children siblings visually displayed around the node you are examining

244755
folder	directory
i can automatically publish the .dll to the bin folder of the virtual directory but i cannot figure out how to push the .aspx pages and images to the server without manually using sharepoint designer

244770
versioning	upgrade
if you re using oracle 10g to store blobs upgrade to the latest versioning since c blob performance is massively increased

244773
formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview
i usually switch to the design view when dropping user controls and also when attaching events of some of the heavy controls like gridview formview detailsview etc

244803
scipy	sympy
i saw there is sympy for python and i just could use it with scipy but i d lost the conversion toolbox thing

244819
put	get
practical approach write a test for two threads doing put get operations in never-ending loop validating the result on every get

244827
rss	feed
i generate an rss feed very simply using linq to xml

244871
post	get
the next question you re going to post on is going to ask how you get lazy loading on one-to-one associations

244876
actionscript	mxml
remember mxml gets converted to actionscript by the mxmlc compiler before the actual compilation commences so a declarative swfloader or any other declarative element for that matter is just a short-hand way of creating something instead of coding it by hand

244908
hash	salt
the only meaning is that you are adding something to your password before you hash it similarly to adding salt to your meal -

244910
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the subclassing s method overrides the superclass s method by definition of inherited

244999
robocopy	xcopy
besides xcopy robocopy and teracopy that have already been suggested you may also try out total commander

245054
hide	show
inject the new content with a hide or animate width method show in the other answers

245078
width	height
calculate width of strip times height of overlapping distances to get areas

245170
authorization	access-control
if you want to prevent some people from committing to something they are not supposed to be committing to you can use repository-level access-control or path-based authorization

245207
matlab	simulink
from my quick google search i didn t find anything comparable to matlab s simulink

245208
lambda	first-class-functions
boost bind lambda and function do offer first-class-functions

245290
cvs	svn
i ve used both svn and cvs a little bit but will need to choose one for a new project i will be starting

245295
int	chars	int	double
in java for example there are primitive types int bool double chars that aren t proper objects

245295
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
that s why java has to introduce int boolean double and chars as first-class types

245297
bazaar	git
you may also consider using a distributed vcs one like git bazaar or mercurial

245303
bazaar	git
having said all this i recommend you also explore some of the distributed vcss like bazaar mercurial and git

245323
cvs	svn
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

245361
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable implements ienumerable so right off the bat with iqueryable you can do everything that you can do with ienumerable

245361
ienumerable	iqueryable
basically you should usually not have to care one way or the other if it is an iqueryable or an ienumerable

245383
cassini	iis
however when running outside of cassini in the ide the iis process did not have permissions to access to the private key store

245414
spaces	delimiter
would parse each line in myfile.txt ignoring lines that begin with a semicolon passing the 2nd and 3rd token from each line to the for body with tokens delimiter by commas and or spaces

245444
tax	shipping
similarly you can export the data once but split it it into system data that s not frequently changed but is necessary for correct operation stuff like tax or shipping rates etc. test data that s easily identifiable and operational data that needs to be moved from db version old to db version new last week s orders

245489
post	get
but why do you need the form name are you going to have more than one form on your .aspx page if not you can get the whole post back js code for the control that will do the post back submit using page.clientscript.getpostbackeventreference and use it to set the onclick attribute of whatever you will use to submit the page

245546
cvs	svn
svn over cvs is almost a no-brainer

245546
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce	perforce	accurev
however you would be remiss not to at least consider what dvcs s have to offer git hg bazaar or if your budget allows there are commercial tools with excellent reputations accurev perforce

245573
ironruby	ironpython
the purposes of dynamic include interoperability with dynamic languages and platforms such as com c++ and dlr ironpython ironruby

245603
integer	radix
because you know that you re dealing with integer values you can get o n sort times radix sort and the hash table will also use o n time

245688
int	chars
weird is a pointer to an array of 6 pointers to functions each accepting a chars and an int as argument and each returning a pointer to a pointer to void

245746
floating-point	integer
if both operands are integers the division operation is an integer division otherwise it is a floating-point division

245793
int	chars
chars int int

245793
int	chars
chars or int float float

245793
int	chars
chars + int int

245793
int	chars
signed int + unsigned chars unsigned int

245793
division	addition
this is because the integer division is performed first then the result is promoted to float for the addition

245801
goto	break
there is no straightforward way to break out of nested loops without a goto

245814
put	get
i even put the assemblies in source control so other new developers get them without having to think about it

245826
move	drag
basically the best thing i ve seen for this sort of thing would be either flash or java that let you drag the nodes around and it would auto stretch move expand based on tension values on the edges

245840
folder	directory
rename .html to .htm in a folder which has directory and sub directory

245871
versioning	upgrade
you may need to upgrade to the most recent versioning of jython or eclipse

245932
maven	pom.xml
i use the option allowtimestampedsnapshots in my project s pom.xml to allow timestamped snapshots but i assume that the 3rd party module bar is not timestamped unless i build it myself as maven still complains about unresolved snapshot dependencies

245944
mouse	keyboard
the obvious would be a killer keyboard mouse and multi-monitor rig.

245958
mouse	keyboard
nice to have a couple monitors fast machine good keyboard mouse etc but i usually find i can be a lot more productive in front of the puta if i move away from it first

246029
postgresql	mysql
at least postgresql mysql and sql server 2008 have spatial query capabilities

246032
mvp	presenter
this runs contrary to the view being independent and ignorant of the presenter and therefore undermines the mvp pattern

246054
pop-up	dialog
this kludge should pop-up the dialog for you however

246056
pascal	delphi
you can do similar things in c c++ with typdef in java with static final or in delphi pascal vb with const but be careful in those and many other languages symbol means something different

246065
lisp	scheme
in my humble experience macros in scheme are to used as much as in other lisp like common lisp or clojure

246074
srp	principles
the obvious sign is when your class ends up looking like a big ball of mud which is really the opposite of srp single responsibility principles

246097
post	put
i am put in mind of a few members i ve had for other services that had addresses in countries i had never heard of that even the woman at the post office couldn t tell if they were formatted correctly

246111
suppressfinalize	finalizer
to be on the safe side if you are designing such a class which holds an unmanaged resource you can write the same object-freeing code in both dispose and finalizer method but if you do so always use suppressfinalize in your dispose method because it will prevent the finalizer method from being called if your object is already on the finalization queue

246165
libjpeg	libpng
you can generate jpeg and png files from c using libjpeg and libpng respectively

246177
post	put
this is a bit of a hobby horse of mine as i ve had a few issues with websites in other countries that simply refused to let me put in a non-numeric post code and i had to resort to faxing over my address information as i couldn t fill in the online application form

246177
post	put
i d be tempted to offer the standard house number + street combine them different languages put the house number in different places so separating them out is not a good idea imho unless you know how to reassemble them correctly plus sometimes you ll end up with a house name instead of a number town and zip post code possibly with an optional county state field

246251
public	protected
stick a private protected internal or public before the function declaration

246273
inherited	properties
the data input forms all had controls that inherited from textbox and these were bound to properties of an object entering data immediately validated it and the box was a light pink if validation failed and a light green if it passed

246304
debian	linux
this isn t a standard part of linux but is included with many distributions aptitude install sysnews on debian

246390
put	get
while it would be nice to code review everything it s difficult to get folks to put in the proper time especially those new to formal code reviews

246437
gmp	bigint	perl	tcl
if you want to do it in code you should use an arbitrary precision library facility like java s biginteger perl s math bigint tcl s math bignum or of the many multiple precision arithmetic libraries that are available for c like gnu gmp or mpi

coalesce	isnull
if in the course of normal expected programming query writers have to write a lot of isnull nv coalesce or similar code in order to substitute a valid value for the null

246649
vb.net	vb6
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

246666
int	double
work with varchar int double other than datetime values

246673
decoder	encoder
the encoder as opposed to the decoder will know the length of the input data and be able to figure out whether to output nothing or at the end

246685
getter	setter
we use the getter to alert us of cases where code that has explicitly flagged what it is going to read in order for the base class to be able to call it only when those properties change and gets it wrong and we use the setter for property change notifications dirty-flag handling validation etc

246787
children	parent
every page have a slug url friendly name of the page and every page has a nullable for top-level pages parent and children

preferably in javascript and in internet explorer although it would be nice if it could also be done in firefox safari etc.

246817
nant	cruisecontrol
the nant script will successfully execute the add command however it displays the tortoise svn add dialog and this is not acceptable because it will execute on a build server running cruisecontrol

246863

pyopengl	pyglet
you may also want to consider using pyglet instead of pyopengl

246897

width	height
the width and height of the loaded swf as defined by the fla it was created with can be found in the loader object in which you ve loaded the swf into

247143
int	double
the difference between anint and nint seems to be the return type where anint returns a double precision value but nint returns an int

247171
int	double
for aint an explicit cast from double to int will achieve that result

247185
int	double
for the other two i think you are right that the only difference is the return type nint returns an actual int while anint returns a double fortran real that happens to have an integral value

247207
ant	maven
failing a good maven plugin perhaps i can embed an ant task into my maven build

247229
lisp	scheme
but honestly all the useful macros i ve defined are stolen from paul graham s on lisp and are generally easier to write with defmacro define-macro in plt scheme

247235
hide	show
instead of dynamically adding columns could you define them at the outset and hide show them as needed either with visible false or setting the cssclass of the control header footer to a class with display none

247259
getter	setter
write the appropriate getter and setter for these columns

247333
post	get
or get hold of a good http packet analyser fiddler on windows and look at what your browser sends when you manually post

247379
hash	salt
you should also salt the hash

247438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

in a nutshell i d say use http for stateless calls which could end up meeting almost all of your needs and whatever proprietary formats you need for stateful calls

247873
integer	unsigned
am i correct to say the difference between a signed and unsigned integer is

247940
integer	unsigned
over and above what others have said in c you cannot overflow an unsigned integer

247944
post	get
in this blog post i will first show the results we have achieved and then describe what we have done to get them

248059
gif	png
i fixed a gif transparency problem by switching to png

248077
pascal	delphi
long time ago before there was electricity and auto-mobiles you couldn t simply use c-generated .obj files in a pascal or delphi application and vice versa without explicitly wrapping them in a dll and taking care of the calling method and parameter sequence and parameter compatibility or calling out to another executable

248088
ati	nvidia
ati and nvidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for linux

248099
pull	push
if you start with two datetime instances that differ by 37 minutes and 54 seconds before you push them into xml they will still differ by 37 minutes and 54 seconds after you pull them out of the xml

248113
hash	md5
in addition you may want to md5 hash the file and compare it before initiating the download no need to update if the file has no changes this will help with point #2

248121
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
even though it is cumbersome i actually use a few classes that check the database versioning and run the necessary scripts either installation of sqlexpress installing the database or doing upgrade

248222
int	chars
i realize you may get into a problem with similar signatures but if you re passing objects instead of base types string int chars datetime etc this will be less of an issue

248268
for-loop	arrays
if you initialise your arrays to 0 starting from the end of the arrays that s right make a for-loop to do it the errors might go away

248268
free	malloc
i m not sure about how this can be done portably except of course for using malloc and free

248309
put	get
if the library has an init function then you could put the check there but then the client would have to supply the api to get the size of its off_t which generally isn t how libraries work

248315
firefox	safari
this seems to work perfect in ie however i get strange results in firefox safari the repeater works for n number of times and then the text seems to get cut off disappear in the repeater see the attached image

248406
swt	swing
for myself gui-builders for swing or swt never worked that well that s why i code layouts myself using layout managers

248418
jsf	seam
seam is fixed jsf based on annotations

248427
vsto	add-in
i could use a vb6 add-in to draw the menus and forward the calls via interop but then why would i even write a vsto add-in in the first place

248538
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i used to do build a lot of uis using gridbaglayout but for years i ve never seen an office-environment ui that couldn t be built with nested borderlayouts gridlayouts and the occasional boxlayout or flowlayout

248580
min	max
when i start a new gui project in netbeans i set the properties of the main panel for min max preferred size to 800 x 600 and the panel within the design view changes size

vsto	add-in
if you put a debug.write statement as the first line in your vsto add-in does it take 15 seconds to show up in the debug window

248757
sudo	passwd
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks

248757
sudo	passwd
it s been awhile since i ve done much unix development so i m not really sure whether it s possible to set up sudo to not prompt for a passwd or even if there is an api for it but as a fallback you could enable setuid to root only when needed

248769
folder	directory
save this automatically saves a local copy in my default directory which is also the folder i have setup using subversion with tourtise svn

248774
width	height
mark is very likely right that the content loader info object will contain the correct width and height

248774
width	height
another idea is to create a movieclip based on a rectangular shape set it s alpha to 0 place it at x 0 y 0 and match it s width and height to stage

248786
getter	setter
you must have a getter and a setter even if you never intend to use deserialization to turn xml into an object

248794
post	get
you can also view all the get and post information that might need to be sent in order to have your request succeed

248814
inline	inlining
note that in the last two links about criteria for inlining the one about structs not being inline is out-of-date

post	get
i ll post my 8 bit code which is working and my 4 bit code which i m trying to get to work

cvs	rcs
if you keep the file under rcs or cvs control you would have just current version of the file and the diffs between prior versions stored

249011
cpu	processors
i hear a lot of people talking about the revolution that is coming in programming due to multi-core processors and parallelism but i can t shake the feeling that for most of us cpu cycles aren t the bottleneck

249012
subtract	add
one that lets you subtract the tail byte and add a head byte to get the checksum of a block 1-byte forward

249012
subtract	add
if the strong checksum didn t match or if the weak checksum wasn t in the hash roll the weak checksum that is add the next byte after the bloc and subtract the first byte from the tail

249012
subtract	add
add the byte subtract from the tail to the list of new bytes in the patch

249043
super	abstract
given that i would think the better approach would be to define abstract methods in a super class for your types

249043
super	abstract
a method on the super class can house the boiler-plate method code and delegate to the concrete implementations via the abstract methods for the individual type s behavior of that method

249064
ironruby	ironpython
it seems natural that we would look at some of the nice dynamic web languages ruby python etc and with things like ironruby and ironpython i started seriously investigating

249153
awk	ksh
you can use the ksh builtin pattern-substitution syntax to do this you don t need to use sed or awk or anything

249155
profiler	yourkit
however if i were you i would use a profiler like jconsole comes with jdk or yourkit to measure what is happening

249158
folder	directory
as long as the local directory exists i ve got my working copy svn or working folder vss set up

249200
post	get
i need a webserver to serve up very simple post get requests as json

249314
inline	inlining
now i like vb in all it verbosity but i m just a bit worried that writing sub...end sub inline could get a bit messy i can see some merit in inlining when you are writing c# when you only have to use something like c .... and you can cut out a lot of code

249319
hide	show
i ve always been curious to see if i can show hide or change a notifyicon created by another application via a c# application

249341
int	double
the above is ambiguous if there are versions of foo that can return double int float etc

249381
multiplying	subtract

249409
google-chrome	safari
it s good to have ie6 7 8 ff2 3 and google-chrome safari

249409
google-chrome	firefox
you can use ie developer toolbar for ie or firebug for firefox or the integrated inspection tools in google-chrome to inspect which rules are applied to particular element or modify the style of an element on the fly

249422
xming	x11-forwarding
you can also enable x11-forwarding in ssh and use say putty to open up different x applications running on the suse box this if i remember correctly requires some sort of a x server to be running on the windows box and for which i have been using xming

249439
int	double
i would love to see this feature in some language not only so that function foo could return a double or an int or a string but also so that foo could return a structure or objects of different classes

249463
terminate	timeout
timeout can handle the hang situation and waiting on the other process s handle using waitformultipleobjects along with both the process and event handle can determine if when the other process terminate

249482
unsigned	short
unsigned short is 32 bits

249498
int	double
int are stored with the right-most bit being 1 and each bit to the left being double that 2 4 8 ...

249513
subtract	add
for lower uppercase you need to add subtract 32

249516
integer	unsigned
ah the link patrick posted includes this the typedef name uint_leastn_t designates an unsigned integer type with a width of at least n such that no unsigned integer type with lesser size has at least the specified width.

249532
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if the 3rd party component does not support the standard asynchronous programming model i.e it does not use iasyncresult you can still achieve synchronization using autoresetevent or manualresetevent

249565
perforce	svn
if you have experience with both perforce and subversion and you don t believe that there are any advantages or believe that svn has advantages over perforce i d like to know why as well

249589
perforce	svn
i agree with the previous yuval - having worked with perforce and svn both in gui and command-line mode i prefer svn

249589
perforce	cvs
however the company i worked for at the time switched from the free cvs it was using to perforce

249604
perforce	svn
perforce has the a bit different model than say svn

249617
cvs	rcs	perforce	cvs
i ve worked with perforce for years as well as clearcase sourcesafe rcs pvcs cvs and subversion

249617
bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days

249652
addition	multiplication
assuming addition and multiplication are both counted as a single operation this function performs o m n operations

249664
public	protected
start with public methods and when code coverage is given by higher level tests turn them protected and remove the tests

249664
public	protected
inherit a class with a testable interface making protected methods public

249664
public	protected
it seems that junit automatically changes protected methods to be public but i did not have a deeper look at it

249703
stdout	stderr
this question is only focused on getting access to stdout and stderr of the running process after starting it

249752
stdout	stderr
seeing what is being written to stderr and stdout is probably not going to help

249752
stdout	stderr
if it is useful you could use tee 1 before you start the script to take a copy of stderr and stdout

249776
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if you use inherited you can see a superclass as providing an interface for the subclassing

249863
min	max
and in that case your panel will be unable to use your min max settings and revert to default sizes

249873
post	get
use to determine whether your page was accessed via a get or post request

249879
post	get
i m pretty sure you can access a page via get and post so this would be the safest way imo

249885
post	get
if you want to pass the same variables by both post and get then you can always use request which contains parameters from both post and get

249885
post	get
if you want to test on whether the request was sent post or get then you can either

249908
nant	cruisecontrol
i m currently using nant cruisecontrol to automate the tests and need something i can recreate on the fly based on the current live legacy content

249982
switching	screens
apart from the above at the absolutely lowest level excluding chip-level that you can go is to call the interrupts that switching to the various graphics modes available - there are several - and then write to the screens buffers but for this you would have to use assembler anything else would be too slow

249991
firefox	safari
so i tried getcomputedstyle in firefox 3 and safari 3

250038
vim	emacs
in my project pysmell i have some support files for vim and emacs

250094
int	chars
in c++ and java for example the primitive types int chars etc

if that s the case you might be able to use a second table can be a temporary one if like your question says you re limited to just sql code to join on which have min value max value and what you want to display based on that

250103
division	multiplication
complex multiplication and division follow fortran rules

250103
division	multiplication
range reduction is done as part of complex division but there is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is nan + i nan with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case

250106
hash	whirlpool
whirlpool is a royalty free hash algorithm that has as yet not shown any weakness

250117
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
one compromise solution might be to have vms either virtualbox or vmware or parallels so that you can fire up a virtual solaris windows mac and or linux box to test it - that will show you how your site looks in the default browsers on each plus you can make sure things actually work through a non-local connection

250117
opensolaris	vms
if your base os is opensolaris you can even use zfs and use snapshots in order to rollback your vms back to their base state after each test run

250160
int	chars
typedef std istream_iterator int chars std char_traits ptrdiff_t is_iter

250193
getter	setter
note that it doesn t work with xmlserialization as you need getter and setter on all xmlserialized properties. you can override this but it seems like too much work for little effort

250234

250795
g++	gcc
you didn t specify what compiler s you are using but if you have access to gcc g++ you can use the -mm option

there are a lot of programs that write other programs such as yacc or bison but they don t have the same dynamic quality you seem to be looking for

251102
rss	feed
it s one of the few generic parsers out there that has an intuitive structure to it which makes it extremely easy to build a meaningful class for something specific like an rss feed

251142
cvs	svn
for simplicity i d go with svn ignore cvs as svn is basically a better cvs

251332

251509
getter	setter
the validation code for getter n setter only fires if the domain object is modified from the ui

251582
listview	gridview
i would think you could define the accordianpanes in the itemtemplate then bind an inner gridview or listview inside each row

251586
qscrollarea	qmainwindow
the qscrollarea is just a widget that you put in a frame or qmainwindow

251619
equals	gethashcode
as the dictionary adds and checks existence of each item it uses both equals and gethashcode functions but has to rely on the equals function when the hashcode is less unique

251619
equals	gethashcode
by providing a more unique gethashcode function it excerises the equals function far less often

251632
ironruby	ironpython
i d have to say that it isn t so much about the individual language ironruby or ironpython as it is about the style of development that they enable

251643
put	get
so what is a hiring manager to do since people don t put on their resumes i don t get pointers and i never will.

251764
rss	feed
take a look at this jquery extension jfeed - rss atom feed parser

i have already done this many times in other pages but none have had the gridview tied to the formview and they have all worked

251911
opera	firefox
opera and later firefox 1.5 do not consider loading a page from the cache as requiring to trigger an onload event as the complete dom state is also cached

251911
opera	firefox
this is trivial to standardise across browsers as opera and firefox do not exhibit this behaviour if you define a window.onunload event

251993
ienumerable	ilist
you take the property as an object and then do some type checking against ilist ienumerable etc to make sure that it is correct

251995
getter	setter
the only one besides the aforementioned singleton and its partner in crime the factory wouldn t be a gof it would be setter and getter when applied to an object s native properties

251995
getter	setter
setter and getter applied to member variables are functionally identical to public member variables

251995
getter	setter
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.

251995
getter	setter
with a setter and or getter you are still exposing your inner member structure to the outside world for instance you ll have to refactor other classes if you find you need to change a int to a long and you are almost assuring that some code that should be inside your object is instead being placed outside

252031
disk	ram
that space is equivalent to computer resources like ram hard disk etc

252034
free	malloc
unmanaged clean up after yourself malloc free

252050
width	height
i think if we can specify percentage width or height as we do in css html then we can adopt this cross-resolution policy

252053
versioning	upgrade
if a new versioning of the 3rd-party library is released it s usually easy to apply your customizations to it allowing for critical upgrade

252071
bazaar	svn
personally i ve been recently forced to use ide integrated source control in both eclipse and visual studio and eclipse after using tortoise svn wincvs and bazaar on the command line

252115
wan	lan
it looks great for inter-machine cluster lan wan communication between applications but i m not sure if it is suitable in architectural and current implementation terms for use as a software bus within one machine

252132
rss	feed
an alternative is to have the program generate an rss feed and direct the user how to subscribe to it

252132
hide	show
also once a new update is generated show the update toast for about a minute then hide it automatically and change your systray icon to something different

252153
free	malloc
malloc and free

252191
udp	tcp
while there are use cases i would guess they re much less common than guaranteed delivery - just like tcp seems to be used significantly more than udp

252193
unix	solaris
we are an all unix shop solaris linux

252250
put	get
if you do get them to specify their own smtp server make sure you put a send test email button on there so they can test it

252285
postgresql	mysql
asp.net pretty much requires windows server 2003 but if you re feeling adventurous you could probably use linux or macosx with mono free for your database engine you can use mysql free postgresql free ms sql 6000 or one of many others

252393
getattr	setattr
then iterate them explicitly and use setattr new attr getattr old attr

252473
int	chars
the ctypes stuff has all the c-type data types int chars short and so on and can pass by value or reference

252490
modifiers	sealed
the worst that can happen is that a new version of the base class will add a member with the same name as the deriving class in which case there will just be a compiler warning saying you should use the new or override modifiers or the base class is sealed which is a design no-no if the class has already been released into the wild

252518
free	malloc
the way it stands now a new or delete will behave as efficiently as malloc and free

252587
versioning	upgrade
ultimately though you ll want to check out your specific versioning information regarding upgrade to make sure you ve considered any versioning specific compatibility issues

252649
linefeed	delimiter
have the web service emit a string buffer where cells are delimiter by the tab character and rows by a carriage return linefeed

252650
strncpy	memcmp
then i believe you can get the good memcmp functions if you pass const char match 64 instead of const char match into the function or strncpy match into a 64 128 256 whatever byte array

252654
disk	ram
this will usually be a physical ram page but could eventually be a page in the page file on the hard disk or it could be a page in a memory mapped file on the hard disk

252667
int	chars
in the example above each element in the array consists of 10 bytes which is the smallest amount of memory that can hold either 10 chars s or 1 int

252680
listview	gridview
on my team we connect our middle tier to objectdatasources and then all of our gridview listview etc.

252680
listview	gridview
then from there you can connect any of your data-view controls gridview listview etc... to the data source

252681
antivirus	mcafee
my conclusion here is that mcafee antivirus is active with at lot of memory in use

252738
equals	gethashcode
for what it s worth that s not the only mistake along the lines of being too close to java personally i d rather equals and gethashcode weren t in object and that you needed specific monitor instances for locking too.

252740
awt	swing
as i said java gui toolkits might not feel native inside osx or even on windows but they sure work on both platforms you could use either swing or awt

252783
typedef	struct
using a typedef avoids having to write struct every time you declare a variable of that type

252785
ienumerable	iqueryable
see also what s the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable that overlaps with this question

252789
ienumerable	iqueryable
reactive programming for .net and c# developers - an introduction to ienumerable iqueryable iobservable and iqbservable

252792
strcpy	malloc
it makes a duplicate copy of the string passed in by running a malloc and strcpy of the string passed in

252792
free	malloc
the malloc ed buffer is returned to the caller hence the need to run free on the return value

252802
strdup	malloc
if the allocation failed it sets errno to enomem and returns null immediately setting of errno to enomem is something malloc does so we don t need to explicitly do it in our strdup

252810
typedef	struct
as greg hewgill said the typedef means you no longer have to write struct all over the place

252810
typedef	struct
update note that there are also highly-regarded c projects where this use of typedef to hide struct is considered a bad idea the linux kernel is probably the most well-known such project

252817
int	chars
i know i can tell the compiler if i want a value to be interpreted as a certain numeric type as int 32 bit signed this way appending an i type chars to the constant value

252825
hash	md5
so using a secure hash like sha256 md5 has collisions and is slow by comparison i can process about 30mb sec on my ho laptop

252852
postgresql	mysql
support for oracle hsqldb mysql db2 postgresql mssql and derby

252860
super	extends
josh bloch also has a good explanation of when to use super and extends in this google io video talk where he mentions the producer extends consumer super mnemonic

252867
typedef	struct
gtk+ aside i m not sure the tagname is used anything like as commonly as a typedef to the struct type so in c++ that is recognised and you can omit the struct keyword and use the tagname as the type name too

253024
versioning	upgrade
maybe you could distribute a new software versioning and then you want to upgrade the database when a client is actually starting to use this new software

253083
implements	extends
you have to use explicit interface implementation in order to implements both and the generic form extends the non-generic form

253194
ant	maven
vim has good support for writing little macros like running ant maven builds

253259
kerberos	ntlm
this method works for both ntlm and kerberos authentication

253306
ironruby	ironpython
in the case that there is a significant portion of common code i would suggest looking into python and ruby as implementation languages as there are cocoa bindings for those languages on the mac and on windows with the use of ironpython and ironruby you could use reuse that code in a .net application as well

253320
hash	salt
would make more sense to generate a random salt for each hash and store it in a separate field

253327
post	get
to understand i am planning to write a email client which would make restful get call to the server to fetch the emails and post to send an email

253375
stdout	stderr
i had to resort to using popen and checking stdout and stderr and then parsing those

253426
switching	screens
i want to pass in the strategy for printing output in a tcl function so i can easily switching between printing to the screens and printing to a log file

253454
folder	directory
for .net i set the config file to deliver mail to a folder then you can have the automated test inspect the directory and files

253463
redmine	trac
i previously used trac to manage my projects but i switched to redmine

253463
redmine	trac
redmine uses textile markup but trac uses markdown so i had a couple of troubles there

253477
put	get
if you want to get super fancy about it put this in your .vimrc

253549
post	get
i have the following code which works just fine when the method is post but changing to get doesn t work

253625
getter	setter
it can also be arguably valid to turn off coverage calculations for trivial getter and setter those that simply set or return a member variable with no other checks or side-effects

253628
udp	tcp
monitor a variety of services on tcp udp

253640
innodb	myisam
i think exactly what happens will be dependent on which database engine you re using there may even be differences between innodb and myisam in mysql

253703
hash	salt
edit to help defeat rainbow attacks -- where the attacker has retrieved your hash passwords and finds suitable matches that hash to the same values -- consider both using a random salt unique to each user s hash password and a fixed salt that is part of the algorithm not the data

253703
hash	salt
this should invalidate the rainbow tables since even knowing the user s salt and the hash algorithm the values in the attacker s rainbow tables won t map onto your hash passwords because of the addition of the fixed salt in the algorithm

253711
hash	salt
that means add a salt preferably a different salt for every user and think of using a sha2 hash function or maybe ripe-md i have not looked at that much

253722
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the replace is for cross-browser compatibility opera and ie add quotes to the url and firefox google-chrome and safari remove quotes

253820
vim	emacs
next i wanted to learn vim or emacs

253852
ready	each
in agile their is some up-front planning -- perhaps gathering large grain understanding story titles -- so that reasonable releases can be described but each release is planned independently and we delay discovery of the details until we are ready to begin implementation of that release

253883
wtl	atl
technically you do not need a global _module instance since atl wtl version 7

253883
wtl	atl
earlier atl wtl code referenced _module by this specific name and expected you to declare a single instance of this object

253903
expander	togglebutton
you need to retemplate the togglebutton within the expander s template .

253903
expander	togglebutton
so that you can template bind the background brush set on the expander all the way down through the expander s visuals and into the togglebutton s visuals using two templatebindings

253990
textmate	gedit
setup gedit to be almost like textmate

253993
public	protected
if i want all public internal and protected properties but not private properties i can t find a way of doing that

254005
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu debian plain old emacs with ruby-elisp package isn t bad

254023
aptana	radrails
i prefer aptana radrails on both mac and linux

254026
punctuation	words
it just replace bounds start end of string transition from words chars non punctuation by single quote

254086
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
there are no trig functions just some multiplication division and addition

254092
cvs	svn
tailor a python program which lets different version control systems interoperate simply calls the external programs cvs and svn when working with repositories of those formats

254130
mouse	keyboard
however i think most flash developers and especially those who make games rely on the fact that keyboard input is caught by the flash application regardless of where the mouse is

254135
redmine	trac
trac or redmine are both pretty good

254142
post	get
3 change your ajax code to add a variable to the get or post

254146
rss	feed
heck if you use google docs rather than excel you can even publish the thing as an rss feed and get it anywhere

254160
minix	linux
this book is written by tanenbaum the main guy behind minix which is what linux was based on

254184
pop-up	dialog
i know validation is possible using javascript but i would like the user to only see .drp files in his pop-up dialog

254194
extjs	prototypejs
i ve been using extjs+prototypejs for a while now and it helped me a lot to work into the extjs code with having the more familiar prototypejs along for the ride as well

254229
execl	fork
the hard part is that my popen2 uses fork and execl to start the process and assign the streams to stdin and stdout of the child processes

254250
typedef	struct
to prevent these problems it s a good idea to typedef your classes and struct in c++ too even though at first glance it appears to be unnecessary

254276
next	except
first off i know next to nothing about language theory and i barely know any other languages except java but i had an idea that i think would be cool but i need you guys to tell me

254288
post	get
if you post the error you get it might be easier to diagnose your problem

254361
stdout	stderr
the trick here is that createprocess has a parameter where you can pass stdin stdout stderr of the newly-created process

254374
hash	md5
for larger files you could compute a md5 or sha hash of the files

254435
floating-point	integer
however most real code is not this way and real performance benefits from a caching system often come from being able to cache common integer and floating-point data structures not huge quantities of pointers

254437
folder	directory
for recursive directory uploads your best solution is using chrome 11 s new folder upload api

254441
persistent	transient
it turned out that if a dataresult was created with a transient subobject and the subobject was persistent the dataresult hashcode was changed

254493
organization	naming
the advantage to this is visual organization in sql management studio you can get the same thing by putting everything under one schema and naming tables with a single identifier

254510
width	height
you can enter any width and height values and it will shrink stretch accordingly

254518
hash	md5
i would use a hash of the file s contents using md5

254594
x86	64bit
i ve seen somewhere that the best mix on x86 cpus is to use a 64bit os and 32-bit applications

254635
executable	upx
pythoninstaller comes with built-in support for upx and uses it to compress the executable but they are still really huge about 2 7 mb

254641
public	protected
it only operates on public properties though no protected or internal members and no fields

254732
client-side	server-side
edit in our shop client-side sendmail only works if the site is trusted and i can t change that due to security requirements nor can i switch to server-side sendmail

254748
for-loop	arrays
my own recommendation would be to use an indexed collection then use a for-loop with an appropriate index calculation here one could use a random number generator if necessary with an integer arrays or some other technique for verifying that the same index value is not used twice if you have to do this in actual practice

254781
groovy	gsp
i haven t done this in a while for jsp but frequently use a similar technique in gsp groovy grails server pages

254864
getter	setter
i ask because i don t believe i ve ever seen this style before for if or loops but i do see it used for getter and setter in c# properties like

254874
inherited	properties
it is protected because dgv inherited the properties from control

254993
hide	show
in other words just hide the button that the user presses and show the other two

255005
gif	bmp
just like gif jpg emf wmf bmp

255073
typedef	struct
then for each pointer you ll need to use marshal.ptrtostructure to dereference the pointer into a pcredentials struct instance sorry i cannot find the typedef for pcredentials anywhere i ll assume you have it - and if you do don t forget the correct marshalas attributes and structlayout attribute when you do define it

255082
codeigniter	cakephp
i have narrowed it down to cakephp and codeigniter

255095
klocwork	coverity
so it depends on whether your priority is quality checking findbugs coverity or security vulnerability analysis klocwork or fortify

255109
uiview	subviews
i went ahead and wrote my own uiview with a uiimageview subviews that uses an nstimer to switch between images

255117
klocwork	coverity
we use findbugs pmd coverity and klocwork because they all have different strengths and we are paranoid

255124
solaris	bsd
you can follow tpgould s link to the solaris source or it s easy to find the source online from any linux or bsd distribution

255212
diffmerge	winmerge
which illustrates the concrete settings of diffmerge and winmerge for msysgit and gitk

255235
factors	matrix
the matrix can scale down by a factors of ab.mag 2 remember the matrix are only calculated once per a b meaning that it s better that finding them is slower than the actual check itself

255284
appkit	nsimage
appkit is not available on the iphone nor is nsimage

255292
int	double
int decimals double and other numeric value-types can be compared to 0 zero with a simple test

255316
trac	bugzilla
i also like mylyn and tasktop to work with bugzilla trac to manage projects

255362
clang	llvm
i am not a compiler guy but when i get frustrated with some limitation of llvm or clang it is usually pretty easy to dive in and change it

255474
opera	safari
mozilla safari and some recent versions of opera actually implement an almost standards mode which is dedicated entirely to transitional pages

255476
wxpython	pyqt
it would simply be a browser gui instead of a wxpython pyqt gui

255481
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade the application easily and all users have the same versioning of the app running

255481
awt	swing
qt gtk wxwindows java awt swing xul -- they all suffer from the same problem the resulting gui doesn t look native on every platform

255485
cvs	svn
2 a version control system cvs svn git

255501
installation	upgrade
easier to manage no installation required on user machines upgrade need only be performed on server side and are immediately available to all users

255507
typedef	struct
if a future standard allowed you to declare a struct elem without a struct qualifier or appropriate typedef the above program would fail because elem is being used as an identifier for an int

255518
sorting	grouping
displaytag - for generating sophisticated html tables that includes data paging grouping sorting exporting etc

255530
stdout	stderr
using gcc -v --help produced a very long listing of options from sub-processes actually 1001 lines on stdout and 14 on stderr on my mac ppc g4 and macos x 10.4.11

255608
cvs	svn
all our corporate projects are controlled by cvs but i want to use svn for my personal documents and tortoisesvn as client

255644
lsp	principles
this conflicts with my long-time believing in lsp liskov substitution principles

255682

i m making a program which the user build directory not in windows in my app and in these folder there are subfolders and so on

255819
emma	checkstyle
findbugs isn t included yet but pmd checkstyle emma and some other stuff

255819
cpd	emma	emma	checkstyle	checkstyle	cpd
the file doc.xml contains the generation of the reports with emma cpd checkstyle etc

255822
cvs	svn
you can try cvs or svn subversion

255841
children	parent
to move a folder and its children you have to update all the records that use the same parent to the new parent

255896
getter	setter
reinforce the cohesiveness of transactionmanager by centering its api around transaction steps like inittransaction persisttransaction ... avoiding any getter or setter for any transaction instance

255905
postgresql	mysql
i work with mysql and postgresql databases

255934
x86	64bit
make sure to download the x86 edition for 32-bit computers and the x64 edition for 64bit computers oses

255958
ilist	icollection
it is specifically important when looking at framework library classes - in your example for instance it highlights the idea that this class can be treated as either an icollection or an ilist without the developer having to know that ilist is actually an icollection

255988
jquery	simplemodal
i ve been quite happy with the jquery plug-in simplemodal

256027
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
the only differences are sqlcommand oledbcommand and sqldataadapter oledbdataadapter

256027
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
in this case sql query string is also the same for both databases but there is the difference between the type of cmd sqlcommand oledbcommand

256040
client-side	server-side
you can t just do this in html because an html page only does stuff client-side and you can only delete files server-side

256046
hash	md5
insert into example hash value md5 hello

256092
bazaar	git
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

256099
client-side	server-side
there s two parts - client-side and server-side

256106
serializable	deserialization
maybe if you find serializable and deserialization esoteric

256117
min	max
i don t even want to try to count the different flavors of sql that exist so i try to keep functions especially non-standard extensions out of my sql code except for things like sum or min max

256118
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
for those who might call out sqldatasource and objectdatasource you don t always have to have them declared in your .aspx.cs or .aspx.vb

256146
post	get
i ve seen the examples and the blog post regarding anonymous methods but i don t get them yet

256234
serializable	deserialization
all the necessary serializable deserialization is contained in the web service client - meaning when control is returned to me after calling the client the entire xml string contained in the soap response is not available to me - just the deserialized components

256241
ant	maven
ant and maven are there

256241
versioning	upgrade
not the latest versioning but that s easy enough to upgrade

256243
profiling	debugging
first turn off all the profiling and debugging switches

256245
internationalization	translation
the recent gwt is also great for building weblication with ajax it translation the java code into javascript with internationalization features etc

256305
width	height
let s say you want an array of width height the most efficient way is to just use a single dimensional array

256321
agile	sprint
if this is an agile project using scrum xp etc. then presumably you are working in iterations or sprint

256326
put	get
get the last 24 hours of logs count the number of requests to each article and put those numbers in the database

256359
put	get
put is often described as the edit method as by replacing the entire resource with a slightly altered version you have edited what clients will get when they next do

256359
post	get
the html5 spec defines get and post for the form element

256362
backtracking	greedy
solutions using a lazy or greedy dot will always lead to a lot of useless backtracking when the regex does not match the subject string

256376
aptana	radrails
you can use either eclipse with the aptana plugin and then install the aptana radrails plugin or you can use aptana as a stand-alone application

256434
xml-rpc	json-rpc
json-rpc and xml-rpc in c c++

256444
trie	tree
a search on the boost main page suggests they have a splay and avl tree but not a trie

256498
dictionary	map
and the interface of a dictionary data structure in java is map

256529
rss	feed
what further confuses me is that i am using the same xmlreader code to parse rss feed from external websites in this application without problem

256591
public	protected
using reflection it is further enforced that child object has no public methods nor any package or protected methods except those inherited from isolatedobject nearly all of which are final

256591
getter	setter
no getter returning stale cached thread data and no setter changing object state while another method is acting on it

256628
jquery	scriptaculous
i ran into this problem with scriptaculous before i switched to jquery and discovered a beforesetup animation callback

256634
for-loop	loops
but if i put the services in a loops a simple for-loop

256639
powerpc	thumb
look at bundling on ia64 dual instruction sets on arm thumb register windows on sparc the count register on powerpc

256667
websphere	ibm
ibm is now trying to implement a technology called embedded websphere with java

256672
coalesce	isnull
i think coalesce function partially similar to the isnull but try it

256678
implements	extends
this architecture scales extremely well and is very easy to implements and extends as soon as you understood the basic principle

256698
postgresql	mysql
i m a postgresql fan too and this is something that has always frustrated me about mysql when i have had no choice but to use it

256713
cvs	svn
and unlike svn cvs you don t have to be connected to the grid in order to be able to commit

256713
cvs	svn
you can set up a local svn cvs server but that wont work with the grid server

256761
vim	emacs
a hack that would end the vim emacs flame war

256778
profiling	instrumentation
of course using a profiling makes your code slower but that is unavoidable when adding any kind of instrumentation

256812
int	chars
in c# a string is an array of chars and since a chars is basically an alias for 16bit int you can probably get away with storing arbitrary binary data in a string

256826
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest is a principle and atom is how you convey bulk of data when it needs to for post put requests and get responses

256826
ssl	https
it is obvously ssl https

256826
ssl	https
i can t currently remember how xmlrpc deals with but with jsonrpc implementation that i have it is trivial - you merely change http to https in your urls to jsonrpc and it shall be going over ssl enabled transport

256830
margin	height
note the the height of the first and the top margin of the second will need to be adjusted to suit your needs

256838
rss	feed
it also supports rss feed which would enable some form of notification to individual files

256997
children	parent
searches for a parent tag t would then match all descendants of t t tags whos parent is t children of t grandchildren of t etc.

257039
rss	feed
for example you could use xslt to automatically transform xhtml into an rss feed or another xml format

257072
jquery	simplemodal
two using jquery simplemodal plugin

257072
jquery	simplemodal
jquery simplemodal plugin demo

257085
firefox	safari
i got a javascript that runs very well on firefox and safari but refuses to run on ie

257132
ant	maven
it has built-in support for maven and ant if you use those but if not you can simply write your own batch file shell script

257172
hex	binary
0x2 becomes 0x12 if you concat the hex and 0b101 if you concat the binary

257276
getter	setter
default snippets suck but customizability shines searching for usages and going to declarations eclim grep ctags generating getter and setter java_getset or eclim automatic imports eclim

257279
firefox	safari
firefox safari and co

257304
int	chars
a chars is just an 8-bit int

257305
mouse	keyboard
you ll need to create a window with sdl_setvideomode to get mouse and keyboard events

257305
mouse	keyboard
i don t think you ll have luck trying to sdl_wm_grabinput the mouse and keyboard without a window

257306
min	max
you can choose to do min or max or some other tiebreaker if you want

257321
firefox	safari
when firefox and safari encounter this ambiguity they return the text of the selected option

257346
int	chars
in c++ chars are interchangeable with int and you can compare their values directly

257354
rss	feed
i d say the answer is having an rss feed be nothing more than another view of your data

257354
rss	feed
this means that your rss feed is simply an xml representation of the data in your database

257355
rss	feed
an rss feed is just an xml document that conforms to a specific schema

257359
x86	64bit
on an x86 platform usually double is 64bit and long double is either 64 or 80 bits which gives you 19 significant figures if i remember right

257366
rss	feed
here s a simple asp.net 2 based rss feed i use as a live bookmark for my localhost dev sites

257377
rss	feed
an rss feed is just an xml document formatted in a certain way and linked to from a web page

257410
unsigned	short
unsigned short s

257417
emacs	jedit
i think you re either stuck with some emacs variant or jedit

257524
width	margin
like eoin said you need to put a non-breaking space into your empty spans but you can t assign a width to an inline element only padding margin so you ll need to make it float so that you can give it a width

257533
versioning	upgrade
there s no upgrade path to newer versioning of windows mobile for this device and i doubt i ll be getting any newer devices any time soon

257577
joomla	oscommerce
i do a lot of work on sites that run joomla oscommerce drupal etc and so i have created a lot of custom components plugins and hacks etc

257651
min	max
first use datetime.subtract to determine how many minutes seconds whatever between your min and max dates

257661
post	get
if you re sending i d be checking to see that nusoap is sending via post rather than get you ll probably have to dig into the code to see

257709
packets	multicast
this is done for scalability reasons - it wouldn t be a good idea to allow one host to originate multicast packets which are propagated to every ip address on the internet

257779
opensymphony	webwork
opensymphony webwork

257790
tapestry	wicket
there s also wicket a very decent comparison of wicket and tapestry is available here

257790
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
tapestry and wicket in particular seem to be gaining ground while everyone seems to have a horror story about jsf

257849
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs	filesystems	xfs
linux and some filesystems ext4 xfs btrfs and ocfs2

257849
solaris	sunos
os x solaris sunos and probably other unixes

257849
filesystems	xfs
most linux systems have xfs_mkfile which works exactly the same way and not just on xfs filesystems despite the name

257849
ubuntu	debian
it s included in xfsprogs for debian ubuntu or similar named packages

257849
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs	filesystems	xfs
most linux systems also have fallocate which only works on certain filesystems such as btrfs ext4 ocfs2 and xfs but is the fastest as it allocates all the file space creates non-holey files but does not initialize any of it

257952
vsts	tfs
vsts 2008 test edition home btw there s a link to a trial vpc w tfs vsts suite on the right-hand side

257953
width	height
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height

257954
disk	ram
edit - yes virtual memory is memory blocks copied to disk because the ram is full

257954
disk	ram
there is a conflict here - the more ram you use for cache the more other memory you have to swap out to disk

257989
filesystems	fat
make sure you understand the structure of the filesystems and pick one that allows for extending - i know that ext2 is fairly easy to extend by another block group and fat is difficult to extend need to append to the fat

257992
kde	gnome
unfortunately while konsole of kde doesn t use this key gnome terminal does so the f1 key becomes inaccessible to my application

258132
width	height
the difference was that i am not allowed to have a decimal number for the width or height of images in the postscript but rather only integers

258137
mbunit	nunit
luckilly most unit-testing frameworks like xunit.net nunit and mbunit have their own stand-alone testrunner

258150
disk	ram
then of course the hardware and os have multilayer caches on chip-cache sram cache dram cache ordinary ram working set and backing store on disk

258212
hash	md5
the file names are md5 hash exactly 32 hex characters long and are being kept in a tree structure that looks like this

258275
folder	directory
i m trying to run a command-line process which is extraction of a .7z archive on a file that lies in a temporary folder on the windows user temp directory

258305
bazaar	git
there is a great and exhaustive comparison tables and charts on git mercurial and bazaar over at infoq s guide about dvcs

258318
mvp	presenter
i would assume only the presenter should know of the session as that object is the closest thing to a controller in mvp

258338
stdout	stderr
assuming that the process writes errors to stderr stdout you could set useshellexecute to false and redirect stdout stderr

258338
stdout	stderr
there is an example on msdn here stderr and here stdout

258338
stdout	stderr
if you need to read from both stderr and stdout and use waitforexit then things get more interesting - usually involving either a few threads or async methods

258338
stdout	stderr
one other final option is to use pipe redirection in the command - - this pipes stdout into out.txt and pipes stderr into stdout so this also goes into out.txt

258356
google-chrome	safari
check on google-chrome safari

258366
uiview	calayer
if you are just repeating the same pattern over and over again you are likely to find the best performance is implementing a custom uiview calayer uicolor that knows how to draw what you want rather than placing visually identical layers or views next to each other

258387
stdout	stderr
i don t know if it is any better but i ve just been looking at something similar using threads to read both stderr stdout like below

258400
width	height
you can also make it overflow auto and give a maximum fixed height and width that way when the text or whatever is in there overflows it ll show only the required scrollbar

258440
post	get
well if the user arrived to the previous page by post as opposed to get and reposts the page the server is going to process the request again

258445
uiview	calayer
in another attempt i tried a very simple small 20x20 calayer object as a sublayer of my uiview s layer property but that didn t show up

258461
subtract	add
whereas with ints you can add to or subtract from the value this makes no sense for functions

258500
getter	setter
a property is a single attribute-like name that wraps a collection of setter getter and deleter functions

258540
mvp	presenter
i am doing something like this in my mvp implementation i inject an icookiemanager isessionmanager icachemanager iconfigurationmanager iredirector into my presenter which are implemented by classes that wrap the functionality for this

258555
multiplying	add
i guess what you did is calculate that .000694 is about the value of a minute and you are multiplying it by the number of minutes you want to add 31 in the example although you said 30 in the text

258607
google-chrome	firefox
it s available everywhere with gears installed it is available offline and binds well to firefox and google-chrome

258625
post	get
example vulnerabilities default gpc array merge-order means that cookie values override get and post so can be used for xss and http attacks

258625
post	get
example countermeasures reconfigure array merge-order from gpc to cgp so get post overwrite cookie not the other way around

258645
yacc	bison
gnu s replacement of the yacc parser generator is named bison

258684
websphere	ibm
if you want rock solid commercial support and integration to just about anything ibm s mq series now websphere mq provides all the features described in your requirements

258775
children	parent
for example given a lazy parent- children relation and an instance x of parent i d like to know if x.children is already loaded without triggering the query

258779
inherited	properties
when you need to pass a value to a form such as a filter inherited from another control or another form for example just add the corresponding properties for your form and add your value to this properties

258790
ecdsa	rsa
asymmetric cipher rsa with 4096 bit key i believe that is the maximum in .net or ecdsa with 571 bit key but that is only supported in .net 3.5

258812
hide	show
i would like to manipulate that .xap file through the use of javascript in the browser to show and hide user controls based upon java script events

258813
implements	extends
extends system.runtime.serialization.formatter implements system.runtime.serialization.iformatter

258983
inherited	subclassing
thusly all the constructors of my subclassing have the parameters or the classes they inherited from

259038
post	get
start issuing commands to the server through the post request and get the corresponding rtsp stream as part of the get response

259038
post	get
update #3 ok in the light of the above the magic value of 48 02 02 00 is clear 48 h is for http_response the next 02 is the length of the following data the next 02 is called post_not_received meaning that the post request did not reach the server within a second from the corresponding get request

259080
bluej	greenfoot
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old

259130
int	double
i cast an unsigned int to float then to double and back to float

259144
hide	show
also a method is added to show hide the views...this could will probably get more advanced robust with animations etc...but this show the basic idea

259151
mouse	keyboard
there is x11vnc x11vnc allows one to view remotely and interact with real x displays a display corresponding to a physical monitor keyboard and mouse with any vnc viewer

259151
ssl	https
it has built-in ssl encryption and authentication unix account and password support server-side scaling single port https and vnc mdns service advertising and tightvnc and ultravnc file-transfer

259246
multiplying	add
if you pass in mask instead of nbits and use bitshifting instead of multiplying or dividing and change the tail recursion to a loop this will probably be the most performant solution you ll find since every other call it will be nothing but a single add it would only be as slow as alnitak s solution once every 4 maybe even 8 calls

259249
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve also developed ajax applications using js frameworks such as jquery prototype and scriptaculous

259286
istream	getline
the istream returned by getline is having its operator void method implicitly called which returns whether the stream has run into an error

259323
mvp	presenter
the mvp pattern which is usually the one that ms promotes is more geared around the presenter ie your wpf form having more control and thats fine too..

259334
postgresql	mysql
runs on oracle postgresql mssql mysql etc.

259336
http-get	http-post
a http-get request should be without side-effects while a http-post may have side-effects and thus can t be cached

259409
postgresql	mysql
from the looks of it the major choices are postgresql mysql or firebird

259460
postgresql	mysql
if you aren t sure if you want to use mysql or postgresql i suggest trying them both out

259460
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

259461
getter	setter
it would use an inner class to hold its properties and i would require all data access to pass in and out of getter and setter

259461
getter	setter
these would in turn call the getter and setter on the inner class

259517
postgresql	mysql
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

259582
hide	show
next use the showwindow api function specifying either sw_hide or sw_show to hide or show the window respectively

259591
cpython	ironpython
we re using ironpython not the more usual cpython

259599
ant	maven
you could use ant maven to check it out of a repository and move it into the correct location

259616
vb.net	vb6
there s already a lot for vb6 programmers to learn in moving to vb.net

259688
stdout	stderr
it looks like you are redirecting stdout to your log file but not stderr - would suggest adding 2 1 to the end of the command line to ensure you re not missing any error information from the log

259774
post	get
note when automatically redirecting a post request after receiving a 301 status code some existing http 1.0 user agents will erroneously change it into a get request

259889
post	get
the button for the image shows the image in the preview section but when i actually post the data i only get some text back like the tags are getting messed up

259947
client-side	server-side
you should then hydrate the objects into a different class on the client-side than on the server-side

260056
dictionary	map
i m trying to figure out if there s a reasonably efficient way to perform a lookup in a dictionary or a hash or a map or whatever your favorite language calls it where the keys are regular expressions and strings are looked up against the set of keys

260056
dictionary	map
i can think of a naive way to implement this in which i iterate over all of the keys in the dictionary and try to match the passed in string against them but then i lose the o 1 lookup time of a hash map and instead have o n where n is the number of keys in my dictionary

260058
doc	odf
now most every project can be saved as one file like doc ppt and odf

260058
firefox	safari
firefox and safari with a cumbersome extension

260058
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox opera and safari support it without gaffes

260062
pop-up	dialog
i d like to create a pop-up dialog box in silverlight in which i can manipulate controls enter data and return a value

260077
trie	tree
if the class of regular expressions you ll be using is more restrictive you might be able to use a data structure such as a trie or suffix tree

260148
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
if you have libxml2 and libxslt installed then also install lxml

260148
elementtree	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree

260148
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

260168
hex	binary
you can add attachments as binary but you ll have to manually do that with a hex editor or create a tool and support for it by clients might not be as good

260197
pop-up	dialog
using pop-up to create a dialog class

260200
obiee	microstrategy
the top contenders are obiee oracle bi enterprise edition formerly siebel analytics and microstrategy

260206
submit	submission
you can add an additional datasource for submission send to sharepoint library and add a rule to your submit button before the save close rules

260236
hash	md5
i know that php has md5 sha1 and the hash functions but i want to create a hash using the mysql password function

260264
disk	ram
edit in response to the edit the lag you re describing sounds like your machine is out of ram and is swapping to disk rather than you being video card limited

260277
skip-lists	tree
transactional red-black tree are comparable with transactional skip-lists

260295
subtract	add
currently you add subtract 5 whenever the event fires and that s not really predictable

260335
geocoding	geocode
geocode all the addresses with google s geocoding

260375
ant	cruisecontrol
i use ant to build delphi applications called from cruisecontrol

260405
vim	emacs
for keyboard centric apps like vim and emacs the fact that i can use them comfortably unaltered should be fairly impressive

260423
profiler	visualvm
for runtime metrics use any profiler such as visualvm netbeans profiler or the eclipse tptp tools

260430
distance	polygons
though if you want to calculate within a certain distance from a zip you need to think about if you are going to use the zip centroid or a polygons representation of the zip code

260446
disk	ram
fast disk will make a difference also lots of ram as much as you can

260446
disk	ram
something like a sun ultra 20m2 or hp xw4550 2nd gen opteron based with 4-8gb of ram and a couple of fast disk would be about as quick as you can get and will run vm s quickly

260453
innodb	myisam
you have to specify that the tables are innodb because myisam engine doesn t support foreign key

260485
direct3d	directx
since managed directx is not being supported any longer by microsoft this is a good way to use managed code with direct3d

260487
int	double
you can process these however you need depending on whether you re intending it for double or int or whatever

260582
int	boolean
int real or boolean is converted

260582
put	get
i would read that as varnull cannot be converted to a tdatetime to put into the field and hence you get the exception that you re experiencing

260608
testcase	fixture
the django folks offer a subclass of python s standard unittest testcase class that populates a database with a known fixture -- a known set of data rows

260608
testcase	fixture
this testcase subclass allows to write a typical-looking testcase that exercises the database with the known data fixture

260642
post	get
first check to see which file is selected from the post or get it s unclear what action the form is taking from your post

260678
int	chars
in practice this means that 7 an int type is different from 7 a quoted chars of string type

260678
int	chars
php javascript and other dynamic scripting languages are usually weakly-typed in that they will convert a string 7 to an int 7 if you try to add 7 + 3 although sometimes you have to do this explicitly and javascript uses the + chars for concatenation

260710
subclass	abstract-class
except that abstract-class can t be directly instantiated only extended so the use is therefore always from a subclass s constructor

260722
hash	md5
this will hash mystring and store the md5 sum in md5str

260730
rss	feed
find the best design blog s and stick them in your rss feed

260731
daemons	launchd
this will launchd the gconf daemons

260731
daemons	launchd
if the d-bus environment vars are not set the daemons will not launchd

260741
keydown	keyup
keyup is usually a good time to respond to any action that is going to have an effect on a document but keydown would be better if it s a game where the user wants immediate effect

260744
public	protected
the constructor s of an abstract class can have the usual access modifiers public protected and private for internal use

260755
subclass	abstract-class
abstract-class the constructor used in subclass must explicitly call

260779
public	protected
since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260779
initializer	class-method
an abstract class cannot be directly initializer by calling its constructor however any concrete implementation will inherit the abstract class-method and visibility

260779
public	protected
actually the abstract class s constructor can only be called from the implementation s constructor so there is no difference between it being public or protected

260826
public	protected
since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260826
public	protected
for abstract classes this constructor scope public or protected is not of much difference since the instantiation is not allowed even if public

260826
public	protected
since it is meant to be invoked by the subclass it can invoke either public or protected constructor seamlessly

260827
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is an extension to easymock that allows mocking of static methods

260829
hash	salt
second if you must store credentials prefer rather to stored passwords using a non-reversible salt cryptographic hash so if you data is compromised the passwords cannot easily be reverse-engineered and there s no need to store a decryption key at all

260830
folder	directory
familiar microsoft outlook features are supported including rich text folder and directory catalog

260878
gif	png
you may fall foul of file formats ie reportedly only supports it s .ico format whilst most everyone else supports png and gif images and possibly caching issues both on the browser and through proxies

260891
cas	opensso
i would look at a system such as cas or opensso either of which will redirect users to the login page without any need to enter a url

260915
free	malloc
firstname is a pointer to an array of char which is not being allocated by the malloc only the pointer is being allocated and after you call free it doesn t erase the memory it just marks it as available on the heap to be over written later

260918
realloc	malloc
check out malloc and realloc

260950
realloc	malloc
if you want to grow the array dynamically you should use malloc to dynamically allocate some fixed amount of memory and then use realloc whenever you run out

260955
serializable	deserialization
things like and are mainly used during serializable the exception being which is set during deserialization as well as queried during serializable

260972
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	memmove	strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	memmove	memmove	strncpy
standard c provides strcpy strcat strncat strncpy memmove memcpy etc

260972
strcpy	strncpy
it makes sense to use strncpy over strcpy for safety if you don t know the source string will fit inside the destination buffer

260976
cpu	affinity
the only exception is when you set a thread affinity mask to a single cpu - then you can be certain that if the thread executes at all it runs on that single cpu

260981
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you re using c things are a lot harder yes malloc realloc and free are the tools to help you

261079
int	double
you can think in bytes int double and other higher level data types

261115
post	get
if you post the modem carrier goal etc you might be able to get more specific help

261138
mbunit	nunit
on the other hand i seem to remember that asp.net mvc has unit testing options for ms test nunit and mbunit

261140
tabcontrol	tabitem
i don t believe that the wpf tabcontrol can be brought to fade from one tabitem to the next since it is not equipped to display multiple tabitem simultaneously

261163
stdio	fflush
fflush only fflush the buffering added by the stdio fopen layer as managed by the object

261189
gif	png
for image to be able to construct itself from a stream the data must be in one of the supported standard image formats gif png jpeg etc

261277
boost	stl
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out

261280
lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme
i m also working on article about using emacs as development environment for many languages - c c++ java perl lisp scheme erlang etc.

261292
width	height
i will probably be bashed by css purists here but using a table with 100 width and height works in any browser and does not require browser-specific css hacks

261378
installation	upgrade
i have a tool which automatically creates installshield installers installscript not msi and my main problem at the moment is that when upgrading an installation i need a way to prevent features from being upgrade

261378
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
during the installation i want to check the versioning of a exe-file installed on the target system and depending on this i want to be able to exclude a specific feature from the set of files being upgrade

261388
rss	feed
if you want to generate a feed of elements that already exist in html one option is to modify your html markup to use hatom and then point feed readers through an hatom- atom or hatom- rss proxy

261410
getter	setter
getter and setter are a bodge to get around this

261410
getter	setter
this isn t just a best practice thing either serialization in c# will rely on properties not getter setter so not using properties could lead to all sorts of problems in the future if you need to serialize your classes

261434
getter	setter
i made a custom valueobject class with properties getter setter and i need this class for data binding of elements on form

261435
getter	setter
prior to that it used a slightly different naming scheme for getter and setter which naturally can still be used with properties or for plain old attributes

261435
getter	setter
the typical getter has the same name as the attribute the setter is the attribute prefixed by set as per java s convention

261450
onchange	onblur
validation occurs in the onchange event rather than the onblur

261586
radiobuttonlist	datalist
how to get the values of the radiobuttonlist which will be selected in nested datalist to use it in multi insert later

261596
hide	show
edit you can also use .toggle instead of .show to show hide

261601
min	max
i need to hide a windows form from the taskbar but i can t use ws_ex_toolwindow because i need the system menu and min max buttons on the form s title bar

261603
xstream	jibx
i am trying to weigh up whether to use an automatic binding program like the one supplied in jaxb or jibx or whether to manually write my own classes and use something like xstream for marshalling unmarshalling

261619
min	max
and windows menu and min max buttons are still visible

261745
jar	war
i do not want to start a long and endless holly war on the question but from my experience - if you can use tool that generates all code for you and do not require jar dependable

261812
internationalization	localization
for more details for resource bundles check out java internationalization localization with resourcebundles

261873
post	get
i have a website in asp.net c# which receives some data via get post

261958
allegro	sdl
i ve done lots of games in c++ before using sdl sfml allegro etc etc but never gotten around to using the network libraries

261958
udp	tcp
i ve read about the arguments between tcp udp so i don t want to start a war like that here

262000
int	double
we can safely assume the vector only contains pods usually float s and sometimes double s and int s

262005
google-chrome	firefox
check that site with firefox or google-chrome they have js debuggers

262013
versioning	upgrade
i got tired of trying delphi every year hoping that i will find a stable versioning to upgrade from my good old delphi 7

262041
128bit	64bit
if you just need very large numbers you could use long 64bit or even decimal 128bit floating point

bazaar	git
5 - git bazaar hg - bazaar and hg have their tortoises so good for windows even though i m not sure about maturity git would be linux only for the time being even though it is very good and much better and easier to use than a couple of years ago

262090
width	height
i understand that you can use getimagesize to get the actual pixel height and width of an image in php

262101
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby ironpython on .net and .net is gaining the dlr - dynamic language runtime

262158
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the simple html below displays differently in firefox and webkit-based browsers i checked in safari google-chrome and iphone

262158
firefox	safari
in firefox both border and text have the same color #880000 but in safari the text gets a bit lighter as if it had some transparency applied to it

262174
hide	show
a combination of css and javascript can then be used to show and hide portions of the hierarchy of the tree or menu

262197
int	double
the problems these days tend to lie in the int to float and float to int and not single to double and double to single as you have specified above

262228
jsfl	fla
you cannot run jsfl from command line but compiling a fla file should be possible

262251
cvs	svn
but other source control products cvs subversion microsoft team foundation source save server svn do not support shared files

262346
int	chars
i am storing a dash and an x so that explains the chars and anyway you won t be doing int arithmetic on the phone numbers i guess so it makes little sense to try to use a numeric type

262362
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux with gnome running my swing application by double clicking on the jar file in gnomes file browser leads to errors because required libraries that are dynamically loaded via the java plugin framework residing in subdirectories are not found

262372
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you have to tell either the objectdatasource what object to use or the sqldatasource what stored proc to use

262412
min	max
advantages of this design is that it s easy to count how many items a given user has it s easy to compute things like min and max for a given property you can enforce a foreign key for the referential property etc

262427
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in firefox 3.0.1 and google-chrome 0.3 and just as a disclaimer i know this is not cross-browser functionality no ie

262436
jar	manifest.mf
i believe if you add to the jar a meta-inf manifest.mf file containing a classpath attribute with a value specifying the relative paths to the jars you need i m not sure whether they are space or comma separated that might work

262439
free	malloc
hey i am trying to create wrapper functions for free and malloc in c to help notify me of memory leaks

262442
kerberos	ntlm
i figure if we changed the sharepoint authentication to kerberos instead of ntlm it would solve the issue

262476
sorting	grouping
when your query implicitly generates a temporary table for instance while sorting or grouping by this can use a lot of memory

262479
free	malloc
if you define your own functions for malloc and free and explicitly link that with your applications your functions should be used in preference to those in the library

262479
free	malloc
in other words you d have to implement the internals of malloc and free yourself

262481
free	malloc
not only it lets you specify custom malloc and free but will also identify the caller by the return address on the stack

262481
free	malloc
define malloc and free as wrappers to the original allocation routines in your executable which will override the version from libc

262486
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if there are readily available versioning of stl that do this already but it s worth sticking to the library functions so that when you upgrade to a versioning that does this optimization is there for you without you needing to make any changes

262508
uiview	subviews
the main difference between my example and the apple example is that my views are not full screen i have a container uiview which contains both subviews and i am applying my animation to the container layer instead the root view layer

262583
pop-up	dialog
i only want the keypress events that belong to the document i don t want to hook events for pop-up windows or other dialog boxes

262623
firefox	safari
if you only need it to work in a couple browsers you could use -webkit-border-radius and -moz-border-radius which would let it work in safari and firefox respectively

262674
postgresql	mysql
for off-the-shelf software say mysql postgresql instead of sql server oracle you still have to do many considerations

262706
bash	zsh
however i have started using zsh for all of my scripts and i have found it to be far superior to bash in terms of scripting

262714
allocator	stl
i ve considered the use of a custom allocator and placement new to place a regular stl container into a shared memory segment

262826
lisp	scheme
i d like to generate these in scheme or a lisp of your choice

262846
rtos	qnx
my suggestion is to review the message passing primitives that qnx rtos www.qnx.com supports before making any decisions

262878
tapestry	struts	jsf	tapestry
if you re writing a web app use the contextloaderlistener in web.xml so that it creates the applicationcontext and you can later get it from the servletcontext regardless of whether you re using jsp jsf jstl struts tapestry etc

262886
scheme	racket
use racket formerly plt scheme

262886
scheme	racket
the racket ide is an excellent starting point for all things scheme including sicp

262934
for-loop	arrays
i know that in javascript creating a for-loop like this is costly as it computes the arrays length each time

262935
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools cobertura clover emma etc can identify holes in your branches but not in the quality of your test datasets

262983
post	get
if you are asking whether it is possible to send parameters via both get and post in a single http request then the answer is yes

262983
post	get
one such example is sending authentication credentials in two pieces one over get and the other through post so that any attempt to hijack a session would require hijacking both the get and post variables

262983
post	get
so in your case you can use post to contain the actual soap request but test for whether it is a soap request based on the parameter passed in get or in other words through the url

262997
post	get
as you can see you can only use one method post get etc... however due to the nature of how various languages operate they may pick up the query string and assign it to the get variable

262997
post	get
ultimately though this is a post request and not a get

263011
post	get
an http post which is different from an http get is a separate logical call to the webserver but it still defines a uri that should process the post

263011
post	get
at the point where your application takes control from apache during a post you should have access to both the get and post variables and be able to do whatever control logic you wish including replying with a soap protocol instead of html

263035
free	malloc
if you are only talk about memory that you have under control that you malloc and free on your own you can take a look on rmdebug

263063
submit	submission
html specifies in the form submission protocol how a browser processing a form element should submit it

263063
post	get
if the service is practically defined by means of a html form then you cannot use a mix - you can t even use post if the form specifies get and vice versa

263068
stdout	stderr
you have to spawn a new copy of the shell that uses the upgraded environment and has access to the existing stdin stdout and stderr and does its reinitialization dance

263073
ant	cruisecontrol
use ant and cruisecontrol - you call the unit tests in the ant script as well as the rest of your build logic and can run them with each build iteration - then cruisecontrol can automate your build calls and run these tests each time

263079
division	multiplication
use integer division and multiplication

263097
multiplying	add
take the integer portion of number 30 using the int function and multiplying it by 30 to get your lower bound then add 30 to that number to get your upper bound

263117
ubuntu	linux
i m not a great linux expert but i m comfortable running my ubuntu desktop

263137
rss	feed
rss 2.0 formatted syndication feed utilize the rfc 822 date-time specification when serializing elements like pubdate and lastbuilddate

263142
bluej	greenfoot
it has links to bluej alice and greenfoot all already discussed as well as a couple of other resources

263144
min	max
you can handle the day render event to handle the binding of the individual days and record min max values

263164
ubuntu	debian
but if your team has ubuntu experience maybe debian would be better choice for server infrastructure if you do not need the bleeding edge set of applications

263173
ubuntu	debian
also ubuntu basically just grabs the existing versions in debian unstable and polishes them a little before releasing them

263175
merb	ruby-on-rails
i am looking for a backend solution for an application written in ruby-on-rails or merb to handle data with several billions of records

263206
ssl	https
also if your site will be using any ssl certificates you want to plan for this by calling the script via google s https connection

263283
mbunit	nunit
edit the guide by carel lotz uses mbunit for unit tests see his earlier document version for nunit though you can replace the mbunit with nunit pretty easily if you follow the nunit help files

263333
opera	firefox
don t care if it works in firefox opera ..etc

263350
rhel	suse
i think if you intend to install software from oracle ibm or other big vendors they may require you to use rhel or suse for support

263350
ubuntu	centos
fewer companies support ubuntu or centos

263350
ubuntu	debian
assuming you do not want to use 3rd party or big vendor software then you should take advantage of your familiarity with ubuntu or debian and stick with it

263350
ubuntu	debian
if your sysadmin is any good he should be able to learn ubuntu debian in no time

263370
int	chars
i m reading the c++ programming language and in it stroustrup states that the int value of a chars can range from 0 to 255 or -127 to 127 depending on implementation

263390
rss	feed
but it s being replaced by feed and feedreader rss and atom

263410
ncover	cruisecontrol	ncover	fxcop
as for the automating of your tests with reporting and integrating with nunit fxcop ncover fitnesse etc - i think the best free tool out there is cruisecontrol .net

263411
lisp	smalltalk
you should learn those patterns that are useful in your language many gof patterns aren t needed in lisp or smalltalk for example learn their advantages and disadvantages understand the constraints of your system and make the choice that best fits your needs

263434
cpu	processors
processors type intel r pentium r d cpu

263477
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a page with a gridview and a objectdatasource control

263564
jobs	cron
you might also want to get one of the users whose cron jobs are working to do it as well

263569
vim	textmate
vim with the help of a few plugins rails.vim project and fuzzy file finder textmate really makes for a good--and cross platform--editor

263647
pop-up	dialog
in access you could hit shift-f2 and it would pop-up a nice dialog to edit your text in

263679
notepad	textpad
other than that most notepad replacements textpad notepad+ offer a find in files as well

263680
memcpy	memmove
you chould be able to easily create a couple of apis that use memcpy memmove and take char s which will work everywhere and likely be faster than the non-std

263689
pull	push
as i understand it regular twain is a pull not a push from the scanner

263758
min	max	min	median	median	max
you might keep around max min mean median and possibly compute error bars for the data you display to the user

263766
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
you should try using a qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene qgraphicpixmapitem instead of the scroll area and label

263766
qgraphicsview	qimage
for example you have a .ui file with a qgraphicsview on the gui called qgvimageview and a qimage called image .

263791
folder	directory
in this case the export directory doesn t need to be in the www folder at all

263794
ftp	smb
if you are looking for something a little more push oriented then look to a scanner or mfp that supports ftp smb email etc

263796
firefox	safari
with firefox safari and other gecko based browsers you can easily use textarea.selectionstart but for ie that doesn t work so you will have to do something like this

263797
gridview	objectdatasource
when you are using an objectdatasource or any other datasource you set the datasourceid for your gridview not the datasource

263816
sum	coalesce
i tried using coalesce around the sum but that didn t do the trick and i didn t really expect it to

263841
hash	salt
search the database for a hash and a salt related to the given login

263843
put	get
you might get an error with the call to put but calling it a second or third time should make it work

263887
spweb	spsite
the spsite and spweb objects actually wrap the com objects which is why they fail in your 32-bit process

263938
opera	firefox
it works with ie but not with firefox or opera

263966
ubuntu	centos
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions

263974
post	get
in the first case the data are passed to the script via get in the second via post

263988
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
sadly java.util.date and java.util.calendar were poorly designed leading to this sort of confusion

264029
forth	ada
ada and forth

264043
actionscript	mxml
i find it much easier to write mxml classes with embedded script than trying to make an actionscript file

264084
g++	gcc
calling gcc as g++ or in your case mingwin32-g++ will also get the right language and will link the needed library

264156
profiling	debugging
this is a good thing to do once you get into debugging and profiling your project since you can really see where the compiler is doing the right or wrong thing

264165
int	boolean
it only accepts return values of type boolean int floats arrays structures dates or binary data

264180
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
won t work in older browsers of course and firefox shows false while opera google-chrome safari and ie show true

264216
google-chrome	firefox
here is the weird part in firefox and google-chrome - everything works

264222
firefox	safari
that s very strange - it looks like firefox safari are expanding the draw area of the embed but somehow flash is not getting the message that it needs to render the new pixels

264286
gridview	objectdatasource
i am working on an asp.net page with a gridview and an objectdatasource

264286
gridview	objectdatasource
i can set the typename for the objectdatasource and attach it to a gridview

264293
metaphone	soundex
if it isn t in the array try comparing the soundex or metaphone value of the misspelled word with the words in the array of correct names to find the correct way of spelling it

264307
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i m obviously looking at all the big names like cruisecontrol teamcity etc etc but the biggest consideration to me is ease of setup and to a lesser extent memory footprint

264321
getter	setter
i also prefer classes with simple constructors and property setter getter for configuration over classes with lots of parameters in the constructor

264345
folder	directory
this will find all matching files folder starting in the current directory and perform the action on them svn delete

264400
datalist	linqdatasource
basically i am binding a linqdatasource to a datalist

264406
put	get
you can t because there s no installer redist for the debug runtime and in fact the software license forbids distributing it so you d be breaking the eula even if you did get something put together

264406
allocator	stl
i believe with the msvcp stl implementations the debug verions also omit all the allocator pooling that is usually done so that a leak checker can show exactly the block you d think and not some larger chunk of memory that it s been sub-allocating but that means it makes more calls to malloc on top of them being much slower

264414
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
i ve got a repeater and its sqldatasource nested inside a gridview templatedfield

264414
gridview	repeater
the repeater s datasource selectcommand is set using the formatstring of an eval from the gridview

264419
children	parent
child applications inherit the asp.net setting from the parent so all children will have the new setting

264427
gridview	rowdatabound
rowdatabound is ideal for these situations where you want to alter data in a gridview based on values in the result set

264431
gridview	rowdatabound
for gridview s its the rowdatabound event that is ideal for altering display of values based on other values in the result set

264431
gridview	rowdatabound
again this is an educated guess since i ve typically done this with the rowdatabound event on gridview s

264447
post	get
read this blog post on which files you need to be able to run debug flavor of your app and where to get them

264453
pop-up	dialog
there s a google group and rails plugin which replaces the basic confirm pop-up with a modal dialog box

264518
cpu	processors
an external interrupt line connected to a timer circuit will wake the processors back up at regular intervals and which point the cpu checks to see if it has been asleep for long enough and if not it goes back to sleep

264535
perforce	svn
i m also interested in performance metrics for cruisecontrol with other version control systems -- such as tfs perforce svn etc.

264576
move	drag
select the folder files that you want to move then right-click them and drag them to where you want to move them

264581
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i ve some experience with using star team for continous integration - though using teamcity not cruisecontrol

264615
folder	directory
this is a lot of manual labour creating backup folder release folder recreating the directory structure and try to track what functionality that goes into what release

264633
put	get
the session id will get put into the uri but the custom data will stay in memory on the server

264642
post	get
creating a new instance of the iwebbrowser2 and simply navigating to the current url isn t a valid solution as post -variables of course doesn t get carried over

264654
google-chrome	firefox
just to let you know firefox and google-chrome consider all ajax request as non-cachable

264698
firefox	safari
i couldn t find any documentation about it and that s becoming a problem because we cannot use this web application with firefox safari and etc

264743
cvs	svn
prevent committing the generated .java files in the cvs svn repository

264758
getter	setter
you have to use concrete types instead of interfaces in setter and getter

264766
firefox	safari
my code works great in ie8 firefox and safari

264787
getter	setter
why setter and getter are evil

264843
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade the versioning of your current container

264869
getter	setter
of course you don t have to make the values publicly accessible you can make them only accessible via setter getter methods and by only having getter you can avoid them from being altered after object creation

264945
width	height
this is just a workaround but you could try to create placeholders initially for the flash objects like div s with the corresponding height and width and only load the movie via something like swfobject when it first becomes visible

264957
jboss	weblogic
if i understood your problem correctly mymdb listens to a topic on weblogic and you want to use an additional jms destination provided by jboss defined in a deployed configuration file and identified by its jndi name by default deploy jms jms-ds.xml only contains the configuration for the jms provider and connection factories -- no data sources

264959
udp	tcp
i run mono servers dealing with giga-bytes of udp tcp data processing related tasks and couldn t be happier

265002
glassfish	weblogic
if you tell me which container you re using i may be able to help you specifically i have done this successfully before on weblogic websphere glassfish and jrun

265041
cpu	affinity
set thread affinity to a specific cpu so you don t get switched between cpus

265146
versioning	upgrade
i m now trying to compile a 64 bit versioning without having to upgrade to c++ cli

265151
swt	swing
at first when i read gui framework i thought you meant swing or swt but i see you mention struts so i guess you mean presentation framework

265151
jsf	tapestry
it is quite easy to get up and running with struts+spring+hibernate or jsf or tapestry and so on

265151
appfuse	spring
i use struts2 with spring and hibernate and sitemesh which was an appfuse project to start with and it has served me well

265164
vb.net	vb6
the short answer is that vb6 and vb.net and consequently c# are separate but related languages

265164
vb.net	vb6
how to switch a large app from vb6 to vb.net

265170
versioning	upgrade
if ms has nerfed the express versioning so that you can t attach to a process then i guess you re stuck and will need the upgrade which wouldn t entirely surprise me

265171
debugdiag	debugging
edit i m aware of microsoft debugging sdk and i also just found out about debugdiag

265211
spaces	delimiter
stackoverflow would use token there should be a spaces between the quotes but the autoformat is removing it to specify spaces at the delimiter between multiple takes although is more commonly used

265259
prepare	execute
you might need to copy a set of statements from profiler due to the prepare + execute steps involved

265326
put	get
i do not use a parameterised query - i just get the parameter values from the user and put them directly into the sql

265359
children	parent
you need to process the data recursively to find all children under a given parent

265372
client-side	server-side
asp.net validation controls also provide two ways of validation server-side or client-side

265372
client-side	server-side
this client-side server-side detection and validation is done without extra work by the developer

265395
expression-blend	silverlight
i have expression-blend 2 service pack 1 and cannot create a silverlight 2 project

265395
post	get
if i get a response there that works i ll post it here in case anyone else ever has this issue

265478
hide	show
i have some html jquery that slides a div up and down to show hide it when a link is clicked

265513
cassini	iis
apparently iis handles this but cassini doesn t

265530
hide	show
my problem is that everytime i drag one groupbox on top of the other hide show groupboxes upon listview catagory select the base groupbox auto-parents the second groupbox i just dragged on top

265552
folder	directory
in particular notice the use of the web-inf directory folder

265593
versioning	upgrade
the company i work for uses an asp.net grid component from a commercial vendor but won t upgrade the buggy old versioning we have to a newer versioning because of cost

265616
aptana	radrails
i use eclipse with aptana radrails

265676
rss	feed
then you can get the yahoo pipes data as an rss feed and do as you want with it

265679
subversive	javahl
i use subversive 0.7.5 with the native javahl 1.5.3 r33570 connector

265689
pop-up	dialog
they should pop-up up a dialog informing the user that administrative rights are required to complete whatever task it was that they were attempting

265692
fink	macports
also if you re building postgres from source you might have better luck using a os x package from fink or macports

265707
put	get
it has been awhile since i used that particular setup but subclipse will automatically add a new non versioned file - one that hasn t been versioned or put in the repository yet meaning you shouldn t get your error

265714
short	base
short answer here is the list of base controls

265742
vmware	esx
we use vmware esx 3.5 and are very pleased with it

265764
inherited	properties
mostly xml but when i have a bunch of beans that inherited from a common class and have common properties i use annotations for those in the superclass so i don t have to set the same properties for each bean

265857
textmate	gedit
here s an excellent guide on how to turn your gedit into a linux textmate

265876
put	get
you could put the connection string in the connectionstrings section of the web.config and then have nhibernate get it from there

265878
getter	setter
you can do this by implementing the translation in the getter setter methods of the bo so that the private variable is in utc and thus when it is stored back to the database it is already in the form you need

265883
min	max
i have a com+ data service that is configured to use object pooling with a min and max pool size of 1

265889
post	get
second the http requests both get and post need to be formatted so that they get proxied properly

265889
post	get
also it appears that real invented its own way of doing the same thing but the basic design is very similar - get for the downstream link post for the upstream with some magic cookie in this case the guid to tie the two together on the server

265889
post	get
either way the post should get to the server and in your case it seems like it doesn t

265922
folder	directory
i generally create a new working directory named branch set up the source control to monitor the branch and pull to the new folder

265922
put	get
i also put in an exculusion filter on the trunk build so it does not get kicked off by a check in to the branch our branches usually reside within the trunk realm of checking for changes

265923
post	get
now i know a difference between parameters in a url and a post parameter some browsers may misbehave if the url is too long so it is not a good idea to stuff hundreds of parameters in a url even if your app can respond to a get request

265952
put	get
form method get will put all the form s input into the url

265979
free	malloc
the last argument to safearraygetelement is a pointer to the memory that will hold the result so the contents of l the pointer returned by malloc will just be overwritten which is why free gives you a crash

265985
post	get
this isn t an answer to your question about get and post but in a situation like you are describing it is quite often easier to store the more complex data on the server and associate it with a session id or a user account rather than putting it into the url every time

265990
post	get
post or get should be chosen mainly for their semantics

265990
post	get
on the other hand many vulnerabilities exist because unsafe operations are accessible through get requests as well as post

266012
post	get
it would be legal to send a message-body in a get request like forms using post do

266075
perl	tcl
some nice examples in ruby perl and tcl can be found at

266106
organization	naming
i m mostly just curious but can see situations where more flexible naming rules could improve code organization

266143
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora
in my experience the following should work the debian family including ubuntu and the redhat family including fedora and centos

266143
redhat	fedora
building rpms for fedora or redhat or centos draft documentation rpm guide

266143
ubuntu	debian
building .debs for debian or ubuntu debian maintainer s guide

266145
toolbar	tabs
and out of that 12 inches overall perhaps two full inches are taken up with browser toolbar tabs rows of bookmarks and the statusbar none of which have anything to do with the web app i m interacting with

266161
stdout	stderr
try making sure stdout and stderr have somewhere to go

266199
mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to do a very simple button that changes color based on mouseover mouseout and

266199
mouseover	mouseout
click i m doing this in prototype and the weird thing is if i used mouseover and mouseout

266233
int	chars
all primitive types things like int chars bool and even should just work as keys in a hash_map

these raw hex binary values are the machine code

266357
spaces	delimiter
i have been trying to tokenize a string using spaces as delimiter but it doesn t work

266364
hash	md5
i ve got a db table where we store a lot of md5 hash and yes i know that they aren t 100 unique... where we have a lot of comparison queries against those strings

266427
stdout	stderr
well you could probably extend replace the existing console view and add an option to write to stdout stderr

266427
stdout	stderr
if you re talking about a java-program and you want it to open a new console window for stdout stderr you will probably have to modify the jdt launcher

266427
stdout	stderr
i find it much more convenient to have stdout stderr in the eclipse console

266466
versioning	upgrade
even upgrade in vista between versioning is pretty much a complete reinstall

266505
cpu	processors
i seem to vaguely recall that in old versions of windows early xps and 2000s cpu utilization was considered from total of two processors so a single thread wasn t able to make it past 50 unless it was the idle process

266549
mvp	presenter
the way the mvp triad works is that in presenter i have a constructor that takes both imodel and iview and wires them up

266575
pop-up	dialog
when i click on the configurations tab i get a pop-up dialog for the password

266576
post	get
this helpful post shows you how to get the record count

266585
google-chrome	firefox
the error doesn t occur in firefox or google-chrome

266634
disk	ram
templates are discouraged because of the concern for generated code size small amount of ram and disk space

266657
submit	submission
if you do get rejected ask apple to remove the first submission and instead of replacing the binary on the rejected app submit it as a new application with a newer version number 1.1 etc

266668
submit	submission
for example a user submit a simple html form and then an gwt app shows up in the next page how can i get the form submission info into the gwt nicely

266699
int	chars
also converting an int to a chars will only give you from 0..255 or -128..127 depending on the compiler

266756
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
it allows you to right click on a test method mstest nunit mbunit etc and select run in debugger

266780
post	get
the path of the php file requested in the original get or post is essentially the working directory of that script

266782
min	max
not so sure about the off-kilter min max close icons

266785
free	malloc
that said memory leaks are caused by those system calls that allocate memory by means of malloc and leave the application the responsability to free the memory once the returned data has used

266868
getter	setter
this results in obvious performance gains for simplistic functions such as getter and setter

266869
post	get
if it s a web application form submissions etc make sure the forms will work using just http get and post

266871
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
openfiledialog savefiledialog etc

266871
folder	directory
will cause the current directory to change if a different folder was selected

266890
getter	setter
and being less readable is quite a stretch if it s limited to things like getter and setter

266902
int	chars
hence things which do not have a specific size like chars are the same size as an int

266906
put	get
edit workaround - if you put on the you can get the border to appear but it has to be a different colour - just use one that s as close to the others as possible

267003
sqldatasource	formview
inside each of these user controls is basically a formview control and a sqldatasource control that displays values from the database

267016
integer	fractions
this capitalizes on the fact that sql server s internal representation for datetime and smalldatetime values is a two part value the first part of which is an integer representing the number of days since 1 jan 1900 and the second part is a decimal fractions representing the fractions portion of one day for the time --- so the integer value 0 zero always translates directly into midnight morning of 1 jan 1900.

267030
folder	directory
i repeat all the files from the directory tree end up in one folder

267030
folder	directory
i need it to copy the tree of folder and directory into the destination folder

267032
g++	gcc
try using g++ instead of gcc

267033
put	get
i am ordering by number of projects in each category to show the categories with the most projects on top - thus i would like to split projectsbycat in two - if i put all the odd numbered categories on the left and the even numbered categories on the right i think i will get a reasonably sane view

267039
g++	gcc
gcc is the c compiler while g++ is the c++ compiler which also links in the required c++ libraries

267062
udp	tcp
i would use a local socket with negative acknowledgment udp if the bit rate is going to be too high for tcp although i would try tcp first and confirm that it is a problem

267065
put	get
put your files some that sharepoint can get them

267099
g++	gcc
gcc serves as a frontend for g++ when compiling c++ sources

267099
fortran	ada
gcc can compile c c++ objective-c fortran ada assembly and others

267099
g++	gcc
by default g++ does this but gcc does not

267124
google-chrome	firefox
it s slower than i would like at 2-3 seconds in firefox and google-chrome for each popping up but it s entirely unworkable in ie taking easily 7-8 seconds for each time it pops up and loads

267124
google-chrome	firefox
i m thinking it has to do with ie s handling of the updatepanel because the same code is much faster in firefox and google-chrome

267191

267237
public	protected
i ve got several methods that are protected or private for good and valid reasons these private protected methods are moderately complex and the public methods in the class depend upon these protected private methods functioning correctly therefore i need a way to test the protected private methods

267245
hide	show
you can t hide show the asp.net version of the control as that only exists in a server context

in java the hashmap implements the map interface while the dictionary does not

267397
interbase	firebird
i ve only worked with sql server oracle and interbase firebird

267437
mouse	keyboard
here s a ms kb article about a mouse hook in c# which appears to be expanded to a keyboard hook in this article

267469
strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
you could use the macro preprocessor to redefine malloc and free to use the mem package ones but i recommend against it because it won t redirect library calls to malloc like what strdup does

267480
scrollable	panels
have a scrollable panels and show 10 columns at a time these can be actively loaded or cached or whatever you need

267503

267758
xna	slimdx
slimdx since managed directx 1.0 is out of the question where as 2.0 never leaves the beta and later replace with xna which has quite different from directx itself and require you to install xna game studio

267857
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	aix	netbsd	aix

if the sidebar had a fixed height i could put a containing element before the main content float it right and give it a suitable width and height and then use absolute positioning to put the sidebar on top of the pre-made space

268096
children	parent
at a later stage i would fetch parent and populate the children and save

268114
sorting	filtering
i recommend jquery plugin tablefilter - it gives you not only pagination but also filtering and sorting

268262
int	chars
the compiler needs to be able to decide whether the enum fits in a chars short int or long once it sees the

268476
client-side	server-side
i have two broad options a server-side redirect or a client-side one

268477
post	get
it lets you send post and get requests and parse the results in php

268507

268526
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
all pages are working fine in ie7 firefox 3 safari and opera

268659

268671
ienumerable	ilist
i have a hql query that can generate either an ilist of results or an ienumerable of results

268673
updatepanel	scriptmanager
then put a scriptmanager on your page and wrap your ddl in an updatepanel

268674
mouse	keyboard
i pretty sure i can accomplish what i want by writing some custom code to handle the mouse and keyboard events but i rather not

268921
ant	maven
you can use ant or maven for automating tasks like generating packages and deploys to remote servers

268925
nant	cruisecontrol
if you take a look at the nant documentation for the cruise control config it doesn t make it clear if i can run an nant task from inside the xml node in my cruisecontrol config - it only says that it can be part of a

268925
nant	cruisecontrol
i have found a few examples of setting up your cruisecontrol config and a few examples of nant tasks but nothing that integrates the two specifically zipping up a cruisecontrol build

268925
nant	cruisecontrol
if anyone has some sample xml of their cruisecontrol config hooking up to an nant zip task post samples here

268961
formview	detailsview
the data component like formview and detailsview are so generic-looking that it s ridiculous

268985
folder	directory
it is insecure unless perhaps you ask the user to point to the wanted directory with a folder browse dialog if we remain in the above logic.

269015
opera	firefox
neither firefox nor opera at least provide this info

269117
swt	swing

269152
unsigned	short
the value of ffff for a short is -1 but the value of ffff for an unsigned short is 65536

269152

children	parent
don t visit children if the parent is set to not visible

269207
implements	extends
i have implements a sax parser in java by extends the default handler

commonly check anything that passes between an inputstream outputstream and a reader writer

269262
yacc	bison
it s a yacc bison like implementation for c#

269268
addition	multiplication
my main concern is how i would implement things like addition and multiplication

269269
jms	jta
you can have most j2ee features such as jta jpa jms jsf with no full stack j2ee server

269269
jboss	geronimo
you can also have no cost full stack server such as glasfish geronimo or jboss

269277
addition	multiplication
once you have the digits of the number in an array you can do addition and multiplication exactly as you would do them longhand

269289
int	double
could be an int float double etc

269299
addition	multiplication
if your target architecture supports bcd binary coded decimal representation of numbers you can get some hardware support for the longhand multiplication addition that you need to do

269316
objectdatasource	detailsview
in visual studio i have set up a detailsview and an objectdatasource which connects with my bll

269350

inherited extend the functionality of a class by creating a subclassing

269496
superclass	subclassing
override superclass members in the subclassing to provide new functionality

269496
superclass	subclassing
make methods abstract virtual to force subclassing to fill-in-the-blanks when the superclass wants a particular interface but is agnostic about its implementation

269523
children	parent
i ve got a page class in my .edmx ado.net entity data model file with with parent and children properties

269525
getter	setter
if a property is of type or address you can make it dirty without calling the setter method calls only the getter method

269553
inherited	subclassing
when a subclassing inherited from a subclassing it typically inherited both the implementation and the interface

269600
inherited	subclassing
remember that inherited means the subclassing gains the methods as well as the data

269662
int	chars
basically once you start having to deal with pointers as in int chars things get ugly

269700
superclass	subclassing
just switching from a superclass to an interface means changing nearly every subclassing in the system

269713
hash	salt
these are basically stored as a plain text username a password hash and an associated salt for this hash

269713
hash	salt
algo salt hash

269713
hash	salt
where the salt is a plain string and the hash is the hex digest of an sha1 hash

hash	salt
so far i ve been able to ascertain that asp is storing these hash and salt in a base64 format

269716
ienumerable	ilist
generic list implements ilist and ienumerable both are non-generic

269718
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
you only use the datasourceid if you re using a sqldatasource or objectdatasource control for your binding

269719
hide	show	children	parent
allain is correct it is better to operate only on the parent then use css selectors to show or hide the children flip + - images etc

269949
outputstream	inputstream
you should use inputstream outputstream and to handle xml documents not reader writer and string

269963
post	get
your question might get better answers or be answered by you yourself if you placed some output inside of those logic tags and post both the output and a bit more of the context actual parameter values -- what is result

269986
put	get	folder	directory
i need to from within vbscript get the latest version of all files in a set of folder and put them into a local directory so that other operations can be performed on them

269996
zlib	libpng
i ve incorporated libpng and zlib into my c software for a microcontroller project due to their nicely liberal license which permits such use without requiring me to disclose any of my code it s very similar to bsd mit apache but with no attribution requirement

270009
put	get
the closest you can get is to put a delegate on a queue for the other thread to execute but that assumes that the other thread is cooperating about this

270046
serializable	deserialization
now ideally we would like to use the same client and server side objects for different message formats xml and amf and have a pluggable serializable deserialization layer

270133
subtract	add
yes you d always have to add one though you may be able to add one to the end date or subtract one from the start date to also get this effect

270154

ncover	testdriven.net	ncover	nant
gallio provides tool support and integration with ccnet msbuild nant ncover pex powershell resharper testdriven.net typemock and visual studio team system

270258
multiplying	subtract
but before going into any algorithmic details about adding subtract multiplying let s find some data structure

270258
division	multiplication
you can also implement multiplication and division by using your plus and minus operators but that s very slow because that would recalculate results you already calculated in prior calls to plus and minus in each iteration

270258
std	ostream
then make your class useful by befriendig std ostream

270286
fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
wherever they re using fileinputstream use bytearrayinputstream instead

wrap your byte array with a bytearrayinputstream and feed it into a gzipinputstream

270300
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
edit i have got a surprise discovery the add subtract and multiplying operations for short s actually return int

270370
pull	push
if you want to ensure that every changelist gets reviewed after checkin then you could see if code collaborator will play nicely with your source control system and automatically make a review task after each checkin push or pull

270398
folder	directory
for eclipse typically all you need to do is set up a folder somewhere within your source code directory

270398
folder	directory
for instance if the directory containing your source is src then you can create a src resources folder to place your images files in

270398
folder	directory
you can also place the image file within the same folder package as the class trying to access it if you wish example place the image.png in the com.mycompany package with the com.mycompany.foo class that needs to access it and call getresource image.png but i ve found it s easier to keep resources like images and other files in their own special directory outside of the class folder -- they re just easier to manage that way

270435
int	chars	int	double
it used to be generally recommended best practice 1 to use pass by const ref for all types except for builtin types chars int double etc. for iterators and for function objects lambdas classes deriving from

270443
google-chrome	safari
this thing does not work in safari google-chrome

270474

we looked at some other packages - dwr gwt but either there was too much dependency on javascript or required ui components to be present in the java classes

270783
int	chars
after that the 4 chars code can be treated as an int key

270810
int	double
i think the original poster is trying to create an object wrapper around simple types int double etc etc so constraining t to class would perhaps not work for what he wants

270835

271045
rss	feed
i have seen some examples of creating an anonymous type but can not figure out how to convert an rss feed to a generic list and pass it to the view

271045
rss	feed
i don t want it to be strongly typed either as there will be multiple calls to various rss feed

271072
mouse	keyboard
in the keyboard mouse system preferences in the keyboard tab click modifier keys... at the bottom and then change caps lock to behave like control. then train yourself to use the caps lock key to the left of the a instead of the control key down in the corner

theoretically chars int and long could all be 1 byte in which case char_bit must be at least 32

271146
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
because of that and your chain of else if statements i m assuming you want to give the user a choice of whether to add subtract multiplying or divide

271146
int	chars
to do this i would define choice as a chars chars instead of an int and would get the user to type in one of these four chars to be assigned to the choice variable + - or

271204
put	get
all the types get converted to ansi strings before they are put into the ostringstream buffer

271229
cpu	processors
newer processors have other faster ways to do it and which ones are available depends on whether the cpu is from amd or intel and on the specific cpu model

271321
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an object that returns an ilist which i m getting from my objectdatasource and binding to a gridview

271329
superclass	subclassing
one superclass and two subclassing

271345
stdout	stderr
i d always assumed that the file names emitted by tar go to stderr but that isn t always the case only if you write your tar file to stdout do the files written by -v go to stderr

271419
dictionary	map
a map is a dictionary and you retrieve from this dictionary a or in the case of multimaps a collection of value s you re interested in

271427
switching	screens
note that they use a handheld type stylesheet that kicks-in when you re viewing on a handheld or switching to small screens mode

271436
move	drag
in the case above you can drag the console window by the tab outside of eclispe and you open another window you can move around like a cmd prompt

271646
subclass	accessor
hiding the filtering logic in your business logic layer but kicking off the query in the display logic layer. then write a custom resultset subclass that has an accessor that runs the query and does the desired filtering

271649
int	chars
if you want to use an elegant ie ugly minimalistic approach you could make a loop of sorts to parse each line basically using strchr to first find the chars then the next space then using atoi to convert each number into a real int and then using some pointer hackery to push them all into the structure

271654
spaces	delimiter
now that works only if the delimiter is a spaces

271658
width	height
to calculate the height of an owner drawn string s given a certain width w we use the following code

271690
ubuntu	linux
i decided to put ubuntu linux on my laptop

271713
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
i fixed this the problem was that i was attaching the onclientclick of the radiobuttonlist instead on the individual radio buttons

271733
punctuation	words
the second column is the text that has been pre-preprocessed just words no punctuation normalized so as to be easier for your like approach

271740
rss	feed
if you can process an rss feed then

271772
post	get
when i move it to a sub folder of the existing site and try to open the global.asax in the browser ti tells me that this extension is prohibited even though the application configuration is - as far as i understand - identical to that of the sharepoint site and allows get head post debug for .asax

271781
getter	setter
think property getter setter

271782
union	distinct
i would first select 10 distinct users then selecting images from each of those users with a limit 3 possibly by a union of all those and limit that to 10

271794
vb.net	vb6
vb.net has little in common with vb6

271800
packets	multicast
i am using multicastsocket to receive udp multicast packets

271800
packets	multicast
i really want to distinguish if the packets was really multicast

271800
packets	multicast
update currently it seems like unicast packets just sent to that port also end up in the multicast sockets receive binding to devices also gives me no better results

271879
post	get
as soon as i get a look at it i ll post it here in more detail but off the top of my head i believe this was the way i did it

271913
packets	multicast
i m a bit fuzzy on the details but a multicast packets will have been sent to the ip port combo you subscribed to and this info will be in the packets somewhere assuming you managed to have a clear path of intermediary routers that understand multicast

271913
packets	multicast
i don t think you have any way of knowing if the packets was really multicast someone could always forge one since there s no real security built in

271952
debian	linux
you can find more commands at the debian gnu linux faq

271965
glut	sdl
there is a similar function in sdl sdl_warpmouse but i want to stick to glut

272043
punctuation	words
it returns all records that contain words term whether it is surrounded with spaces punctuation special characters etc

272131
rss	feed
i have a website that draws rss feed and displays them on the page

272188
cpython	ironpython
an interesting option for me is to integrate cpython unit testing of python code and code coverage of python code with visual studio 2008 through plugins something similar to ironpython studio

272197
wordpress	phpbb
one option is openid which you can integrate into phpbb wordpress and mediawiki

272197
wordpress	phpbb
a second option is to set up an ldap server which you can also integrate into phpbb wordpress and mediawiki

272212
int	boolean
votes table id int vote boolean voteable_type string name of the class being voted on voteable_id int id of the class being voted on voter_id identifer for the user voting

272261
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does

272277
implements	extends
i ve had good luck with bitmap indices when manipulating a lot of data in memory using custom data structures but they are kind of awkward to implements over a third-party database that doesn t have a good postgresql-like api for extends their index structures

272367
readonly	temporary
this doesn t work really well if you need to provide readonly access since access can t write out the temporary .ldb file that it creates when opening an access file .mdb

272428
put	get
given 2 classes animal and elephant which inherits from animal my understanding is that you would get a run-time errors if you try and put an elephant into an array of animals and this happens because elephant is bigger more specific than animal

272492
sorting	grouping
i ve been able to get my dynamic grouping down and then the sorting except now my generated linq-to-sql sql order by statement is backwards from what i want it to be

272492
sorting	grouping
i think i need to figure out how to get at the result returned from the linqdatasource when the sorting event is fired in the listview so that i can then append my grouping order by clauses

272492
sorting	grouping
currently i m overriding the linqdatasource selecting event to provide it s result and do the dynamic grouping there but then the result is modified by the sort on the listview and i was thinking there must be some way to get at that result during the sorting or sorted event

272522
postgresql	mysql
mysql + postgresql

272576
rss	feed
one of my test usercontrols is an rss feed control

272597
post	get
rather you should get an event every time they post a bug and you achievement system records found another bug

272631
folder	directory
also in vs2005 it s under the platformsdk folder inside the vs2005 directory whereas there doesn t appear to be any such directory on for msvc6

272653
public	protected
making it protected instead of public will at least prevent outside objects from calling it

272762
put	get
you can do that if you have the correct hibernate ids of the objects you re working with calling a get and then merging your copy with the one hibernate just put into session

272775
executable	upx
in general if you want to keep the size of your executable down you can use upx to perform exe compression

272803
super	extends
now there are already several parsers which all extends the same class but were designed to read logs from a single threaded application no fragmentation - from original system and use a readline method in the super class

272828
versioning	upgrade
most of the time testing is an exact copy of the live system except that errors are turned on when a new versioning is about to be moved live it s replaced with the new versioning before live is to detect upgrade issues

272854
children	parent
i ve got a class with parent and children properties

272891
firefox	safari
css transforms safari and firefox

272918
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream or outputstream of an

272941
vb.net	vb6
i ve done development in both vb6 and vb.net and i ve used adodb objects in vb6 to handle recordset navigation the movefirst movenext etc

272973
sqldatasource	formview
in the past pre-linq i ve accomplished this with my own extensively customized formview and sqldatasource objects which take care of temporarily persisting the data changes getting the event id from the formview etc

273188
udp	tcp
assuming that it s a tcp rather than udp port that you re trying to use

273200
children	parent
i ve got a class with parent and children properties

273322
g++	gcc
in gcc g++

273337
put	get
get db data and put into a table

273347
g++	gcc
but 12 years later i can t persuade either gcc or g++ to give me any kind of warning for assigning a literal to non-const char so it isn t all that loudly deprecated

273350
post	get
louis gerbarg suggested in this post that i use html5 cache manifest to get this working however following the w3.org docs does not appear to work for the iphone

273448
for-loop	loops
you see a while loops that iterates down is faster than a for-loop that iterates up

273502
google-chrome	safari
i have ie8 beta2 ff3 google-chrome beta and safari 3.1.2 with the applicable developer plugins

273536
opera	firefox
for several browsers like firefox or opera it is just a matter of copying the original program directory elsewhere and upgrading

273543
versioning	upgrade
at least they did include an upgrade wizard to upgrade source from one versioning to the next it worked for most of our code

273685
lisp	scheme
the lisp to scheme thing involved a rename

273698
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux

273711
width	height
i thought of taking all of these images and concatenating them by creating an imagedata object of the proper total concatenated width with a constant height and using setpixel for the rest of the pixels

273729
gif	png
printing a png or gif would be much easier -- just extend the printdocument class and use the normal print dialog provided by windows forms

273734
mantis	bugzilla
i prefer a website bug tracking system like mantis or bugzilla if you want to host it yourself or something like fogbugz if you want to outsource it

273846
converter	multibinding
wpf multibinding with converter

273854
int	double
obviously that number is going to exceed the size of an int float or double

273859
gridview	rowdatabound
okay- i added extended properties to the datatable columns with the proper data type and checked them on the gridview s rowdatabound event in a loop from 1..numcolumns

273893
sage	maxima
if you want free mathematics software look at maxima or sage

273962
width	height
then compute a resize ratio by taking min maxwidth width maxheight height

274019
post	get
if you could post a description of the kinds of strings that you want to generate and what language you are using we may be able to get you started

274020
cpu	processors
it all starts with the cpu or processors

274020
division	addition
the instructions cpus can execute are fairly basic and simple addition division negation read from ram place in ram read from register and so on

274024
google-chrome	firefox
this works in internet explorer and in google-chrome but does not work in firefox

274024
google-chrome	firefox
and now it works fine in firefox as well as continuing to work in ie and google-chrome

274169
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i haven t been doing asp.net-mvc too long but i ve already written some extension methods to generate menu tabs based on html.actionlink

274173
wordpress	joomla
i have a few sites that only get minimal traffic that run on wordpress but i also admin a site that runs joomla and gets reliable amounts of traffic

274191
gif	png
i m looking for some image library that can work with multiple formats jpg gif png and is fast at displaying the images to the screen

274285
unix	bsd
macports - - decently sized library of bsd unix apps for your osx machine

274312
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the winner is gnu linux debian ubuntu in a landslide

274371
jquery	scriptaculous
i d learn to use jquery or even go directly to the prototype library check out scriptaculous

274433
free	malloc
a memory leak is when memory is dynamically allocated eg with malloc and all references to the memory are lost without the corresponding free

274440
hex	binary
the correct utf-8 encoding of those is unicode binary hex

274457
iboutlet	ibaction
i hooked everything up using iboutlet and ibaction

274487
int	double
the closest is system.math.round which is only for rounding numbers of types decimal and double to the nearest int value

274530
http.sys	httplistener
2 as you say an embedded web-server - herhaps httplistener - but note that this uses http.sys and so requires admin priveleges or you need to pre-open the port

274553
mp3	wav
i need help converting wav files to mp3 format in vb6

274582
mouse	keyboard
it makes it very easy to give someone access to your desktop including allowing them to share control of your mouse keyboard and it works well through firewalls you just get an access code from the other party you paste it bang

274605
nunit	mstest
that s why we use nunit instead of mstest

274623
cvs	svn
the diffstat utility is a nice tool for getting some simple metrics from the output of cvs svn or other diffs

274630
superclass	subclassing
so it s when you assign an object of a subclassing to the superclass

274630
superclass	subclassing
the superclass knows nothing of the additional information in the subclassing and hasn t got room to store it so the additional information gets sliced off

274647
folder	directory
step 2 change directory to extensions folder within the profile folder created in step 1

274653
vsto	add-in
i have verified that the add-in is not inactive or disabled and i have tried to repair and uninstall reinstall vsto several times

274725
firefox	safari
the prob is this script works in safari and ie but not firefox

274738
getter	setter
i m not sure why it s a problem that exposing a dto type as a service would cause use of its getter setter to do a round trip

274738
getter	setter
if the service is a remote service the returned dto is serialized anyway and your getter setter will get the copy of the values

274756
versioning	upgrade
if you re going to do this ensure that when people buy your product that they will get free upgrade to new versioning for a year or some other period of time so that they don t feel like they got ripped off when a new versioning comes out 2 months after they bought a copy

274756
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
also ensure that you support old versioning so that those who don t want to upgrade just want bug fixes can do so without risking breaking their current installation with new versioning of the software

274758
versioning	upgrade
for example if ms released new versioning of visual studio every 3 months with a new .net versioning c runtime etc then we would spend a good portion of our time just dealing with the upgrade which would not be good

274761
getter	setter
i d do the latter approach since it s a convention that helps me to see at a glance whether a private member has a public getter setter or not

274773
dns	spf
investigate adding an spf record to your dns zone file

274816
hide	show
this way all hide show mechanics will be handled by it

274880
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
actually we don t even know if you are talking about js on the browser validation of upload field you can no longer do it at least in a simple way with ff3 or on the server side neither firefox nor opera nor safari upload the full path of the uploaded file

274891
int	chars
i think that statement accesses the third row of the usermask array then accesses the maskelement th pointer in that row and since that is an int pointer it can point to the beginning of an int array think chars strings which i assume it is doing and that array is sub-indexed by user

274917
versioning	upgrade
it is also worth noting that if a user decides to upgrade to the full versioning if you do not have some mechanism in place to transfer over the existing data you will likely see a negative reaction from your users

274923
folder	directory
in every iis web i would have a virtual directory called custom which points to a different folder for each web

274923
folder	directory
update i d like to point out that this virtual directory custom is not suited to contain an inherited web.config - that web.config would be valid only for the custom folder which doesn t contain aspx ascx files

274964
firefox	safari
javascript performance can be a real pain unless you are using the latest versions of safari or firefox 3.1

274977
public	protected
it suggests a somewhat sophisticated pattern to fully deal with the issue have a protected copy constructor a protected pure virtual doclone and a public clone with an assert which will tell you if a further derived class failed to implement doclone correctly

275017
gridview	repeater
with a repeater i assume i d then have to loop through the form values on postback and with a gridview control i d have to override onrowdatabound and on postback some other method

275034
accessor	ivar
while the objective c 2.0 documentation states that the synthesized accessor on the modern runtime will synthesize the ivar on first use

275034
accessor	properties
while i could implement my own side storage for the data backing my properties i would much rather use the mechanism that synthesized accessor are using

275042
free	malloc
in c this happens when you malloc to a pointer and let that pointer leave scope without doing a free first.

275042
free	malloc
by proper use of malloc and free anyone who looks at your code will be at ease

275092
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this function works on ie opera and safari but somehow is ignored in firefox

275105
rpm	yum
i ve seen many people recommend centos and it does seem like a good server distro but i m not a big fan of rpm yum

275113
keydown	keyup
in your game view define the keyup and keydown methods

275113
keydown	keyup
note that the keydown and keyup events are actually defined on nsresponder the super class for nsview

275151
ubuntu	centos
for example i don t think that the ubuntu apache install is a radical hot new version but pretty much the same version as is installed on rhel or centos

275183
std	ostream
in your example cout uses your to convert your x1 object using a user defined implicit conversion to a pointer which is then output by ostream s cout is of class std ostream which takes a void

275239
moq	typemock
i m going to be looking into moq and typemock etc soon

275327
textarea	textbox
a bunch of libraries of controls and other resources the typical window frame combobox listbox image container textbox textarea a wysiwyg-y richtextarea etc. these are the province of flex

275394
post	get
i decided to post what i did to get my solution working

275407
avr	microcontroller
if you are looking for a microcontroller or similar my advice to you would be to check out either an avr pic arduino or beagleboard

275407
avr	microcontroller
avr s and pic s are types of microcontroller that you can program with c or asm however you will need some type of prototyping board or similar to achieve anything

275428
short	base
the short answers is that you slice the object by assigning a derived object to a base object by value the remaining object is only a part of the derived object

275439
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
vm communicates with devices both on and off its subnet icmp tcp udp

275454
restrict	shared
most shared hosts don t use a true medium trust environment because it restrict some things that are just too vital

275465
ssl	https
with https the ssl connection is negotiated before any of the http headers are sent to the server including the host -header that tells the server for which virtual host the request is actually intended

275521
hide	show
for your select list of rooms add an onchange event handler that will show hide the text boses

275555
nexus	artifactory
this is with reference to setting up repositories like artifactory nexus etc

275578
vmware	virtualbox
i ve found vmware fusion works the best but there are free open source alternatives such as virtualbox if you just want to get your feet wet

275646
octal	decimal	octal	hex
there s no such thing as a variable that stores a hex value or a decimal or octal value

275646
octal	decimal	octal	hex
hex octal and decimal are just different ways of representing numbers to the compiler

275703
folder	directory
from there find the point of divergence and work your way back to the assembly folder prepending a .. everytime you pass a directory

275797
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
for opera firefox and safari you can use the following function

275811
return-value-optimization	nrvo
to avoid these inefficiency smart compilers may apply the return-value-optimization or the nrvo optimizations but there are cases in which they can t -- multiple returns

275819
return-value-optimization	nrvo
by the way i can t take credit for the information about return-value-optimization and nrvo

275828
public	protected
the custom method can be written in the code behind file but has to be declared public or protected

275894
stdout	stderr
os.popen3 - stdin stdout stderr

275920
post	get
i have added a wildcard mapping to the .net isapi dll as suggested in other blog post but get the following error when i access the root of the website

275931
fadein	fadeout
i see fadein fadeout and animate but i don t see anything like flash

275939
post	get
when you start to get many duplicates you can post there a simple list of bugs you are working on

275947
width	height
in .menuitem so height and width are taken into account

275996
integer	unsigned
if you just said this is always true for an unsigned integer so the loop will be an infinite loop

276021
wxpython	pygtk
ui python people are slow and python is great for uis using wxpython or pyobjc on mac or pygtk

276030
printf	strtod
as we all know global data like the locale settings affecting the numeric decimal point printf and strtod are using is evil

276063
tunnel	vpn
even though the mtu at the switch is 1500 you can have situations like tunnel through a vpn that wrap a few extra headers around the packet- you may do better to reduce them slightly and go at 1450 or so

276065
prepare	bindvalue	prepare	execute
note that this way with prepare statements will automatically escape all that needs to be and is one of the safest ways to execute mysql queries as long as you use binbparam or bindvalue

276087
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening in both firefox and ie 7 although not in google-chrome

276089
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade your app to use .net 4.0 then your long term users aka previous versioning will end up having to install a whole new versioning of the framework

276096
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp	udp	tcp
if you have not done so yet it could be a good idea to look at some recent alternatives to tcp udp like sctp or dccp

276096
udp	tcp
they were designed for niches where neither tcp nor udp was a good match precisely to allow people to use an already debugged protocol instead of reinventing the wheel for every new application

276137
udp	mtu
that being said if you want to achieve low latency and can tolerate loss using udp with an overall packet size set to the path mtu be sure to set the payload size to account for headers is likely the optimal solution esp

276167
innodb	myisam
with mysql you can specify different engines like innodb myisam etc

276206
hide	show
to simplify things i m just checking to see if those fields whose name ends in surname are empty and then show hide appropriately

276217
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it s because of feature-creep in the later versioning or because of some compatibility which the newer one doesn t support or just because there isn t enough of a difference to upgrade for etc

276217
versioning	upgrade
what makes the older versioning preferable what would need changing for you to upgrade

276224
client-side	server-side
someone will hate this solution but as far as i know the only way to retain state data server-side is viewstate - session - page.transfer or client-side cookies

276242
profiling	benchmarking
if you implement it in that way and then later need to speed it up then you can use benchmarking profiling to locate the bottleneck and either link to a compiled language for that or optimise the algorithm

276252
inherited	properties
therefore when you request its attributes you are getting the ones defined at car even if you requested not to go up in the inherited chain as the properties you are querying is the one defined in car

276272
gridview	sqldatasource
when you can slap an advanced gridview onto a page along with a sqldatasource and bind it directly to a stored procedure you throw your test automation out the window

276285
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	redmine	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
we evaluated trac bugzilla mantis lighthouse and redmine fogbugz wasn t an option due to the incredibly high price and decided that we like redmine the best

276304
disk	ram
current system status current cpu ram free disk space etc. and nix and windows platforms can be a difficult combination to achieve

276308
versioning	upgrade
they force you to upgrade every 3 years by disabling online support for versioning older than three years

276336
sorting	filtering
i want the user to be able to apply dynamic sorting or filtering on the result returned so as to obtain a more refined result they wish to see

276361
post	get
post an answer and we ll critique it but to get the most from your presumably expensive educatiom you really need to do some work on this

276400
gif	png
i will limit the file extensions to the most common images like jpg jpeg png and gif

276491
post	put
this makes it easier to send snippets in e-mail post on blogs put in comments etc

276519
for-loop	loops
two extra details of the for-loop which were not in the simplified conversion to a while loops above

276519
goto	break
if the condition is omitted it is always true resulting in an infinite loop unless a break goto or something else break the loop

276532
versioning	upgrade
you need to have the full versioning of visual studio 2008 installed in order to upgrade to service pack 1

276603
sorting	grouping
if you had an array of 10 million objects in only a few grouping then sorting is not a reasonable option

276635
uilabel	uitextview
ok i ve answered my own question a uilabel placed on top of the uitextview will also hide the insertion point but can still become the first responder and get input

276645
free	malloc
most libc malloc implementations work by storing a header before each returned memory block which has fields to be used by the free call which has information about the size of the block as well as a magic value

276657
getter	setter
should i only include the difficult algorithm that i implemented or any code i wrote for a pojo that had 300 properties and whose getter setter were generated using ides

276660
jquery	jqmodal
using jquery and jqmodal i have tried this kind of thing using a custom confirm dialog

276684
put	get
then put the stupidity behind you and get on with your life as quickly as possible

276688
ready	each
with berkeley sockets each time you read or write your application will block until the network is ready which could make your application unresponsive unless the network i o is handled in a different thread

276699
width	height
you can do it through css height width or on some controls directly on the control itself

276710
client-side	server-side
older versions of opera do on the client-side and i think an ancient test browser of some sort possibly viola and a few form-parsing components on the server-side but not the php built-ins

i m able to get access to a list but i get a bunch of warnings when compiling with -wall with g++ gcc 4.2.4 the generated c++ code that say

276785
inherited	properties
perhaps it was done this way since controls inherited the font of their container and tracking individual font properties changes would be more work than tracking a wholesale font change

276789
width	height
once you have the control you can set the height width as needed

276804
post	get
as doofledorfer said you are likely to get more specific advice if you post schemas

276806
free	malloc
it s quite likely that free will not return pages to the operating system under the assumption that your program will malloc more memory later

276806
free	malloc
but if you free first malloc might re-use the free memory instead

276829
partcover	opencover

here s something i put together a while ago it s windows only but may help you get part of what you need done

276976
vrml	x3d
unfortunately vrml x3d has not become anywhere near ubiquitous in the past decade

276993
put	get
we manage 5 000 desktops in a large enterprise and what we did to get the app on all of the machines was create a simple msi file that put an icon on the desktop you could put it in the startmenu or whatever i guess

277000
mouse	keyboard
if you don t get rid of it the only way to give it focus again is to use the same keyboard shortcut or the mouse which is what we re trying to avoid....

277004
int	double
like you could select all of the int in the block and then search and replace to double for example

277016

this post may help you to get started how do you write a c# extension method for a generically typed class

277186
pull	push
git does use origin by default when you do things like git push or git pull

277197
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when sending 1 menu item it renders html that is absolutely correct in firefox and ie but really messed up code in safari and google-chrome

277218
post	get
the method attribute of form elements in html4 xhtml 1.0 will only accept get or post

277233
g++	gcc
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler

277239
int	chars	int	double
because the types are being promoted chars - int float - double if there is no declaration of the function at the time you call it the arguments could not be passed at the right places in memory anymore

277239
int	chars
edit thanks to chris for pointing out that chars literals like a are always of type int in c

277253
nunit	mstest
then just right-click on the class on the method on the project on the solution and use the test options that testdriven.net provides including if you have mstest test with - team coverage which runs your nunit tests with the mstest coverage tools including giving the colorization back into the ide to show which lines executed

277259
subtract	add
you can add or subtract date-periods with english-language style phrases via the strtotime function

277268
hash	salt
what i think rick was trying to say if that if an attacker knew you were using the sha1 algorithm for hashing and the salt you were using they could make a mapping of hash to passwords to attempt to retrieve passwords

277290
google-chrome	firefox
so to address this issue the best way i see is to do like visual studio firefox google-chrome roolup your own tab control with your theme.

277306
boost	stl
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions

277316

277402
ncover	ndepend
we used ndepend and ncover to provide the raw information to calculate the metric

277426

i think it s going to come down to if the x y position of the component is beyond the width and height of its container and so on up through the parent containers until you reach your top level application.

277437
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome show only the default source

277444
innodb	myisam
the major difference is that innodb supports transactions whereas myisam doesn t

277445
innodb	myisam
the main difference is that innodb supports transactions while myisam does not

277445
innodb	myisam
myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance

277445
innodb	myisam
innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not

277445
innodb	myisam
myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking

277450
next	except
next if the measures are taken at regular intervals replace the timestamp with the difference from the previous timestamp except for the very first tuple for a sensor of course. for example if all measures are taken at 5 minutes intervals the delta between two timestamps will usually be close to 300 seconds

277452
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb also store their data on disk differently

277461
udp	tcp
if you need any level of reliability from udp or require two-way connections you will end up needing just about everything from tcp so you might as well go with that to start with and let the network stack take care of it

277474
haskell	scheme
if it was up to me i d teach scheme haskell or f# but since he d rather learn something that can be useful in his job as a fiscal consultant programming excel

277478
superclass	subclassing
the superclass has got some initializers say initanimal the subclassing has some initializers say initdog

277499
superclass	subclassing
however it should be stated that you should have a very good reason for doing this and that it should be very well documented that the subclassing may not use the same initializer as the superclass

277499
superclass	subclassing
that way each animal and true subclassing of animal can handle their designated initializers themselves and won t have to rely on superclass behaving in such a specific non-standard manner

277511
innodb	myisam
the most important difference between myisam and innodb is that innodb supports transactions and foreign keys

277511
innodb	myisam
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

277527
vbscript	vba
in addition it is a very short step from vba to vbscript

277528
client-side	server-side
you have either client-side or server-side caching and these are discrete in that they have no knowledge of each other

277543
put	get
these are interesting as we all get a sense of the investigation and thought that was put into your answer

277564
bluecloth	rdiscount
i ve done a bit of research and decided to use rdiscount instead of bluecloth

277564
bluecloth	rdiscount
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth

277596
jms	jta
if the answer is no because i need jms or jta then i resort to an application server

277596
websphere	ibm
any time i negotiated with ibm it was always ended up costing twice as much as a weblogic equivalent but corporate policy dictated websphere had to be used

differences between innodb and myisam

277812
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme	lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml	erlang	scheme
ocaml haskell erlang and all free lisp and scheme implementations that i know of do not have concurrent gcs

277818
loops	while-loop
note that since the while-loop will only update fig_handles when it is run you will always have at least 0.2 seconds delay until loops catches the modification of fig_handles.continue_loop

277839
required	placeholder
i then go to the content pages and add new placeholder for the plaintext equivalents and add text as required

277844
vb.net	vb6
several points about vb.net versus vb6

277867
width	height
that still needs sum width height bytes-per-pixel of all the strips

277877
union	distinct
be aware that union is an implicit distinct on the result set

277884
post	get
i know that i can just use the string values post or get for the request type but i could have sworn there was a constant somewhere in some class in .net that contained the values

277884
post	get
out of curiosity i was wondering if anyone knew what class these string constants for get and post were in

277891
put	get
i tried being intuative in using a master page with content place holders but i couldn t get the placeholders to grow to say nothing of not being able to put a text box where i wanted one

277895
notepad++	scite
notepad++ is another scintilla -based as scite source code editor

277907
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can then override onkeydown onkeypress and or onkeyup to handle the key press before any of your controls

277944
int	chars
in a nutshell the file has a header consisting of several int bytes and fixed-length chars arrays followed by a list of records which also consist of int and chars

277944
pascal	delphi
in any other language i would create struct s c c++ or record s pascal delphi which are byte-by-byte representations of the header and the record

277961
post	get
i don t see that mentioned in the initial post but assuming that is the case as it would get much more complex if the header has optional args and different sizes

278040
post	get
so the process becomes much smoother for your users and you get the post in a form that doesn t require you spend thousands of dollars on developing or buying conversion code

278082
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

278121
translation	localization
its my understanding that the recommended approach to localization in wpf is to use the locbaml tool to extract the localizable items into a csv file translation the items into the desired language and regenerate a new sattelite assembly from this csv file

278134
vb.net	vb6
if you have an automated vb6 to vb.net tool and vb6 itself please save the code as a vb6 project and do convert the code

278148
internationalization	localization	internationalization	globalization	globalization	localization
internationalization or globalization is the design and development of a product application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture region or language

278149
switching	screens
our application pops up when an internet connection is made and after prompting the user to accept the downloads we d like to switching back to the home screens while we do our stuff

278166
width	height
once you have an image object loaded from its source the height and width and size and all ancillary properties are read-only

278167
vb.net	vb6
your vb6 code has to call windows api functions to do the work and vb.net code has to do the same

278174
textile	bbcode
for my site we went with textile but i ve found that bbcode tends to be the language that most people already know

278194
translation	localization	translation	globalization	globalization	localization
globalization is about producing a map from strings or identifiers to translation in other languages while localization is about using that map to find the correct translation

278194
globalization	localization
globalization happens during development localization happens at runtime

278212
addition	modulo
say that n and m are known and you re looking for x under addition modulo k

278225
width	height
in winforms if you contain the image inside a picturebox control the picturebox control can be set to zoom to a particular height width and the image should conform

278234
actionscript	mxml
javafx script from what i ve seen is quite similar to actionscript and not at all like mxml

278266
put	get
and i don t care if you outsource to india china or the guys down the street - if you re not specific you re likely to get something that will meet the bare minimum of what you put on paper but not what you wanted

278269
clistctrl	ccombobox
you need to use a ccombobox which is basically a combined cedit and clistctrl

278288
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
you have the debian derived systems like debian ubuntu which use .deb and the apt dpkg family of management tools

278288
rpm	yum
you have the redhat derived systems which use the .rpm format and the rpm yum family of management tools

278288
dpkg	aptitude	rpm	yum
ideally learn the command line options to do this for yum and rpm and then dpkg and aptitude and you ll have most bases covered

278288
ubuntu	debian
i think the most important thing to remember is that it s generally a mistake to mix packages from different distributions or releases in the same system even if they use the same package format do not install debian .deb files on your ubuntu system or suse rpm files on your fedora system unless you really understand what you re doing

278297
pull	push
sql server reporting services supports both on-demand pull and event-based push delivery of reports

278317

278374
unix	bsd
it is part of bsd unix not sure if it is standard

278422
octal	hex
be warned that the vt102 documentation generally uses octal so keep an ascii table handy if you re using hex

278423
printf	strcpy
functions such as strcat strcpy and printf can easily overwrite the end of their target buffers leading to spurious runtime errors and security vulnerabilities

278487

278507
datalist	repeater
while customizing a couple of the modules for some internal use i was a little surprised to see that instead of having apis that returned data via your typical result set that was bound to a datagrid datalist repeater that the apis returned an xml node collection that was then passed to an xslt transformation and rendered on the page that way

278523
int	boolean
i ve replaced to boolean value with an int shakecount

278527
superclass	subclassing
i d rather not manage the extra objects floating around to assure that all superclass features are part of a subclassing object

278527
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i d rather have inherited to be sure that each subclassing is an instance of it s own class plus is an instance of all superclass too

278550
rss	feed
for example it would be trivial to turn that grid into an rss feed or write a program to scrape that data periodically and send a more pressing alert

278572
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
inherited is a good thing when the subclassing really is the same kind of object as the superclass

278572
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
that said as you note there are too many real-life class hierarchies where the subclassing inherited from the superclass out of convenience rather than bearing a true is-a relationship

278572
superclass	subclassing
so it s unsurprising that a change in the superclass will have side-effects on the subclassing

278596
jar	manifest.mf
to clarify the question is not about how to write manifest headers into the manifest.mf file in a jar that is easily googleble

multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
for example this method is a neat way of doing this test without using multiplication modulo or division operators

278850
getter	setter
with say a 2d point class and the desire to extend it to higher dimensions you would presumably have to add at least z getter setter modify getdistance and maybe add a getvolume method

278887
internationalization	localization
i m guessing that you mean localization or internationalization or i18n

278893

the property getter and setter of an explicitly implemented interface property has an unusual attribute

279229
public	protected
the public start will call the protected that will be ovveride in the abstract class

279248
getter	setter
bunch of properties and locking at the property getter and setter level looks wrong

279342
superclass	subclassing
you can then treat an instance of ferrari as either an instance of the ferrari subclassing with getengine returning the turboengine or as an instance of the car superclass when getengine will return an engine

spaces	delimiter
popular choices for delimiter include spaces tabs commas semi-colons vertical-bar characters and tilde

279455
gridview	rowdatabound
in the gridview s rowdatabound event i m selectively hiding links in some gridview fields based on the query results

279455

279548
16-bit	64bit
edit 3 doing the math you d need to use 16-bit keys in ecc to generate 64bit signatures which is very weak

279607
ready	each
this code would fire on document ready attach an event handler to each input with currency as its class and then do the replacements

279652
hide	show
if you want to show or hide them place them inside of a div and show or hide that

even if you mark a function inline it is actually still up to the compiler wither it will actually do the inlining it is just a hint

280247
mouse	keyboard
this underlined letter is called the accelerator key and is standard in windows applications so that you can use the alt-key and that letter to quickly select the menu item and then submenu item with the keyboard rather than with your mouse

checkbox	dropdownlistfor
how to design a dropdownlistfor that can have multiple selections using checkbox

280342

i d probably say if you want backwards compatibility use tstringlist and if you want forward compatibility perhaps the option to change that list of strings to say list of int64s in the future then go for tlist

280453
std	ostream
a similar example of using this is when you derive from std ostream but don t want random people to write into your stream

stdout	stderr
i am confused about how popen redirects stdin stdout and stderr of the child process in unix

280580
phpunit	simpletest
my main reason for using phpunit over simpletest is that it has great phing integration

280628
stdout	stderr
if you want to capture the stderr too that s possible but then you ll need three pipes and a select loop to arbitrate reads between the stdout and stderr streams

280690
post	get
i need http get and post both of which are not simply reading writing files on the filesystem they need to run custom .net code

280730

you have the content-length in the header and additionally there is the content-type in the header of the file part each file has its own header which is the purpose of multipart encoding

280750
content-length	content-type
server-side check the header content-length content-type .

280840
debian	linux
i switched from mongrel cluster to passenger two weeks ago debian linux server

280861
opera	google-chrome
all browsers respect definition order with the exception of google-chrome and opera which do for every non-numerical property name

280902
ati	nvidia
consider if you can use gpu processing - nvidia and ati provide the cuda and ctm frameworks and there is an ongoing standarization effort from the khronos group opengl

280909
cpu	affinity
is there a progamatic method to set cpu affinity for a process in c c++ for the linux operating system

280912
hash	md5
i always compare an md5 hash of the modulus using these commands

280968
sorting	filtering
the class implements some of the required interfaces that enable sorting and filtering in a datagridview

280978
filtering	grouping
finding the maximum value within a collection or filtering or grouping etc

280996
cpu	affinity
look in cpu affinity for more details

281024
redhat	fedora
in centos which is redhat enterprise edition with the serial numbers filed off and so therefore pretty close to fedora we did this using kickstart files

281035
ubuntu	centos
i m considering a virtualization host and multiple client os ubuntu and centos being the top 2 candidates - that way once i get the client configured as i want it i can save it off for reloading as needed

281081
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
i m looking for a way to connect a windows mobile device to a pc via bluetooth and have it show up on the pc as a hid device keyboard or mouse

281107
des	aes
looking though the code with reflector it looks like the algorithm is des if the key is 8 bytes long and aes rijndael otherwise

281142
getattr	setattr
in c++ instead of a getattr setattr pair it is common to provide two overloads of an attr function

281225
kde	gnome
for example emacs runs pretty much contrary to every interface guideline on os x or windows and probably even gnome kde and it s not going away any time soon

281241
versioning	upgrade
we haven t been able to use linq yet because we re still on 2.0 and haven t been allowed to upgrade to a newer versioning

281286
post	get
i have a support ticket open with apple dev support for the same problem and fwiw i ll post their recommendations if and when they can get my toolchain working

281354
put	get
using cvs keyword expansion you could put in the file and it will get replaced with the date of the last checkin

281400
folder	directory
if they are other resources such as graphics perhaps you have a customer-specific set of folder under one directory

281443
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome browsers insert an extra text node at the end of the body tag

281469
getter	setter
what you might be able to do is provide both a getter and a setter but throw a notimplementedexception in the abstract setter decorate it with the appropriate attributes and document so that no one uses it unless the setter has been property overridden

281488
integer	unsigned
the queue is implemented as a circular buffer unsigned queue maxlength and it stores integer indices into a table of states

281488
queue	fifo
i could also expand the states in a different order so in this case it s not really important if i break the fifo properties of the queue

281512
tiff	png
i am having issues converting a png to tiff

281521
versioning	upgrade
recently my company underwent an upgrade re operating systems and visual studio versioning so i m stuck with windows vista and visual studio 2008

281534
vb.net	vb6
recently i changed the first function from vb6 to vb.net still using an access database

281557
pop-up	dialog
in the property sheets click the ... button beside the addition include directories line and expand the macros button in the dialog that pop-up

281568
jar	war
this guy seems to have worked around the problem by extracting the tld from the jar modifying it placing it in the war s web-inf directory and adding an entry to his web.xml like this

281587
firefox	safari
firefox and safari were ok with that ie wasn t so it s possible that whoever wrote the code didn t even know it was a problem

281595
x86	64bit
as far as hardware int64 will be more efficient on an x64 and ia64 than x86 because the 64bit processors have 64bit registers to perform the operations on them

281606
udp	tcp
i am guessing that the length of the segment in tcp is inferred from the ip header but one should be able to do the same for a udp datagram

281642
freebsd	linux
the stability is huge factor for me and freebsd makes up where linux and windows leave you wanting

281651
memcached	apc
there s all kinds of downsides to using temporary files mainly it s slower and if you really need a way to store the buffer before outputing it go look for memcached or apc cache

281667
cassini	iis
more answers for cassini v iis here

281688
cassini	iis
the xp version of iis has limitation that are not present in the server version that cassini side-steps

281688
cassini	iis
the only argument i know against is that there are a couple very rare edge cases where the cassini built-in server doesn t exactly mimic iis because you re using odd port numbers

281688
cassini	iis
i doubt you ll ever run into them and using cassini as the primary dev environment does not preclude developers from also having access to iis on the machine

281688
cassini	iis
in fact my preferred setup is cassini first for most small work then deploy to my local iis for more in-depth testing before moving code back to the shared source repository

281786
cpu	processors
if your database is using 3-20 cpu and the final performance is still unacceptable it means that you don t lack processors power since it is most of the time idle

281798
disk	ram
you ll need lots of ram but if your db is only a few hundred mb then you d be skipping the heavy disk io

281802
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
firstly i d recommend using tortoisecvs as it has better cvsnt support

281812
inline	inlining
inlining won t affect heap usage as the same allocations and deallocations would occur for the inline code as would occur for the non-inlined version

281823
cvs	svn
there s a general clean code practice that says that one should never keep removed code around as commented out since it clutters and since your cvs svn would archive it anyway

281846
superclass	subclassing
you can interpret a subclassing as an instance of a superclass but not vice sersa

281882
junit	testng
they are built using junit or testng and interact with the system under test using something like selenium that hits the web pages as if they were users

281890
ant	maven
not using ant or maven workarounds

281944
emacs	aquamacs
under emacs btw you mentioned aquamacs go with emacs.app instead i then specify via the preferences to have option command and command option

281996
put	get
when you put them all together you basically get something where you can write plain text in one end and get encrypted binary data out having stored it in memory temporarily of the other end

281999
png	ico
i have an ico file that contains a 48x48 and a 256x256 vista png version as well as the 32x32 and 16x16 versions

282019
getter	setter
preferrably without loads of getter setter

282045
ndepend	fxcop
tigraine has mentioned fxcop - there s also ndepend which is somewhat different - a code analysis package which can identify design issues

282046
hide	show
show and hide do just that

282048
getter	setter
if you need to save memory i would make getter and setter that manipulate bits of internal integers or similar

282095
width	height
i think ie before version 6 incorrectly included borders and padding in width and height

282118
button	checkbox
i know that you can use a checkbox control and set it s appearance property to button but it doesn t look right

282127
post	get
note that you can also get comments made by the user but users can t comment on their own post so the comments through a post are different and mutually exclusive

282127
post	get
it seems reasonable to me that i should be able to get a page of all the comments added to all of a user s post

282162
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest and phpunit which i prefer

282164
implements	extends
you d have to implements a custom collection or perhaps extends bc to implements queue item priorities

282202
inherited	properties
since the form inherited control class it is sufficient to call mousebuttons properties directly

282205
serializable	deserialization
apartments are essentially lightweight running com servers with a serializable deserialization mechanism called a message pump where calls get serializable and queued for a single thread

282233
serializable	deserialization
make user that you version the serializable and that the object that does the deserialization throws an exception if the version it tries to read is not backward compatible

282233
serializable	deserialization
it would be a bad practice to have the serializable and deserialization all over the code

282241
mouse	keyboard
ideally it would be a tool that records mouse clicks and keyboard presses and takes screenshots at that point of time

282267
width	height
in real space i gained a couple inches width but i lost a lot off the height

282267
width	height
for the life of me i can t seem to find an actual measure of screen height and width other than diagonal which could be anything depending on the diagonal angle

282271
mouse	keyboard
could then give keyboard and mouse

282279
folder	directory
i then tried running it outside of the release folder in the bin directory and what do you know it worked

282292
width	height
the ratio of the resolution width height should be the same as the ratio of the physical dimensions

282332
sitemesh	stripes
we want to keep moving forward with our new stuff using tomcat stripes and sitemesh

282342
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode and equals shouldn t be in system.object - not everything s suitable for hashing

282392
unsigned	short
lots of nasty little bits of c poking through in particular all the conversions between short int unsigned etc..

282421
emacs	aquamacs
not sure if you re totally married to using emacs from the terminal but another option is to use carbon emacs my favorite and aquamacs very mac-like

282445
explode	implode
for all it s otherwise excellentt list handling i miss php s built-in explode and implode

282448
int	boolean
nearly all of the web service functions specify a response that includes an int to indicate success really a boolean and an error message string

282502
factors	mean
what are the factors to be considered while profiling i mean the best practices

282519
singleton	facade
one solution is to use a singleton and have one or both of the application and facade register with that singleton

282576
merb	ruby-on-rails
in ruby-on-rails one would use admin categoriescontroller is this similar in merb or is this another recommended way of doing it

282580
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
when that vector based file is rendered to a bitmap based format - bmp png tiff jpg etc.

282616
profiler	yourkit
yourkit is an excellent profiler for java and will integrate nicely with eclipse

282635
g++	gcc
you can check what gcc g++ do by using the -s option

282635
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ more or less behave the same in this case

282643
codeigniter	cakephp
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter

282659
glassfish	weblogic
i downloaded a free glassfish server from sun then as i am an oracle developer downloaded the latest jdeveloper which comes with a weblogic server from bea oracle

282659
glassfish	weblogic
i want to write a soap interface to my oracle database 10g can i get away with the glassfish server why should i used a weblogic server and how does this differ from the oracle application server for j2ee apps

282697
factories	presenter
my solution for both is to use a factories for views that will allow the caller to access and pass messages to the new presenter

282698
ssl	https
your best bet in this scenario is to use an iframe which contains an https ssl page that just contains thelogin control

282708
post	get
you might have to do some messing around to get stdin to read from get post etc

282730
georss	kml
the easiest way to do this is to select to xml and then transform the data into georss or kml

282764
spaces	delimiter
the values of the other fields in each line contain no spaces so a spaces delimiter works fine for them

282798
ssl	https
i d recommend getting an ssl certificate and requiring https any time users submit a password to your website

282811
cassini	iis
i don t think it simulates either tbh it just a web server for local development where iis is not an option based off cassini

282818
typedef	struct
in c++ you cannot name a function the same name as a class struct typedef

282825
put	get
dont get me wrong i believe rails has brought very good ideas to the mainstream like convention over configuration but has this oversimplification just put this line of code and .

282835
hash	md5
a simple hash function md5 sha1 whatever accumulates the bytes of the object to create a 4-byte number

282857
width	height
if you want the line to be just a simple horizontal or vertical line put another panel disabled so it doesn t pick up any mouse events on the main panel set its height or width to 3 or 4 pixels or whatever you want and bring it to front

282947
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
but if you re used to notepad++ you ll probably find it as hard to move to vim as you would to emacs so maybe your proposed solution is the best one

282950
lisp	scheme
also if you are doing scheme you don t say which lisp you are referring to i second the recommendation of drscheme

282951
for-loop	arrays
he she also points out that a temporary arrays is created and thus is slightly more expensive than a normal for-loop

282988
vim	jedit
i just use vim or jedit

282992
daemons	systemd
of course the immediate answer for most situations is yes and i am a firm believer that a process should correctly cleanup any resources it has allocated but what i have in my situation is a long-running systemd daemons that opens a fixed number of file descriptors at the startup and closes them all before exiting

283011
opera	safari
i m trying to process a credit card transaction in .net and it works perfectly in safari opera and ie

283039
free	alloca
but all the blocks are free when you exit the function that alloca was called from just as if they were automatic variables declared in that function

283041
free	malloc
just use malloc free if you need to explicitly free it - those functions are usually heavily optimized

283074
int	chars
use the simplest column types possible chars int

283088
pop-up	dialog
if you need to edit the text i would then either pop-up a editor dialog or send the data that is stored in content to an textbox on your form for editing

283090
pop-up	dialog
i d like to pop-up a simple dialog with an editor box to let user enter some value then just return

283151
coalesce	isnull
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283170
spaces	delimiter
i m trying to read in a spaces delimiter textbox data exactly like the tags textbox in a new stackoverflow question such as this into the model

283177
versioning	upgrade
you don t really want to upgrade the system versioning of sqlite on mac os x

283190
formview	linqdatasource
i am connecting to it with a linqdatasource and binding with a formview

283206
websphere	ibm
my application communicates with another system via ibm websphere mq

283248
strcpy	strncpy
edit good suggestion from healthcarel - use strncpy rather than strcpy

283255
hash	md5
while i might be totally misunderstanding you maybe it s a good idea to treat a vector as a byte stream and do some know hash on it sha1 or md5

283278
strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strcmp	strncpy	strcmp	strncmp	strncpy	strncmp	strcpy	strncmp	strcmp
using non-limited string functions such as strcpy or strcmp instead of safe versions like strncpy and strncmp

283308
free	malloc
iif this is a c program which uses the function make sure you allocate with malloc and free with free

283312
int	chars
int get_string const chars buffer

283316
opera	safari
this only occurs on ie6 and ie7 but not ff2 ff3 opera latest nov 12 2008 or safari again latest

283374
put	get
it also allows iteration over the keyset without locking it takes a copy at the start of iteration and get operations can generally be interleaved with calls to put without blocking it uses fine grained lock striping iirc

283398
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization should do the trick

283400
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
in terms of general concurrency utilities - .net has always provided a bit more than the basics which java used to provide in terms of mutex manualresetevent autoresetevent and readerwriterlock

283405
jboss	glassfish
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

283405
jboss	glassfish
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

283441
put	get
commonly you might want to do a related get and put in close succession and if another thread is looking at the same values you have an immediate thread race

283450
boost	stl
the advantages of the second method is that you can take use your compilers pre-compiled header support plus you can wrap stl #includes in pragmas that disable some warnings for example some boost headers will cause warnings when compiling at level 4

283451
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
i don t know glassfish or jboss particularly but both the oracle and weblogic application servers will provide a fully integrated suite of functionality including soa security grid clustering systems management and development tools over and above just the standard j2ee container

283454
instances	transient
transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

283520
cpython	ironpython
note there was a mission by some of the crew at resolver systems to allow you to use cpython bindings with ironpython called ironclad but this is in its early stages and i think they will concentrate on getting things like numpy working first gui toolkits will always be the last and hardest

283566
boost	stl
stl boost are neatly arranged in namespaces so they don t ever cause any mix-ups or overlaps either

283686
put	get	post	put	post	get
it also helps if you understand the basics of http - for example the request methods put post get delete head and so on

283686
post	put
the error you pasted means that the header content-length is missing with your request and most servers if not all expect it to be send when you issue put or post because those are assumed to be data changing create update

283695
avr	microcontroller
the arduino board is based on an 8-bit avr microcontroller for which the .net micro framework isn t even available

283722
g++	gcc
if you mix code compiled with gcc and with g++ see graeme s answer

283737
pop-up	dialog
this code is called by a pop-up window that displays this file or gives a open save dialog in internet explorer

283751
post	get
i have the problem that php replaces all spaces with underlines in post and get variables

283754
ftp	telnet
telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin

283757
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i usually test when designing using opera and firefox and my collegue who used a mac tested it in safari too

283757
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if you design using the standards and test using relatively standard compliant browsers like opera firefox and safari and then add the dreadful hacks for ie preferably using conditional comments allthough it is nonstandard and proprietary it s fortunately and correctly regarded as commendt by real browsers so you won t break the working code you have less problems

283774
client-side	server-side
also those cookies would be accessed both via javascript client-side and php server-side

283779
folder	directory
what is left visible is everything in the target directory besides these two folder the generated jar file for example

283859
cassini	iis
i m working on vista and i d prefer not to install iis i d rather just us cassini for local testing

283908
client-side	server-side
you don t really need more than one anyway - just use one to store an id client-side and store everything you need stored server-side against that same id

283957
post	put
we have a rest api which clients routinely post and put data to

283962
sorting	filtering
it gives us ajax sorting filtering paging all server side

283985
width	margin
as suggested by arief you must specify a width and you can then use auto when specifying margin in order to center a div

283994
fontfamily	font-size	width	font-size
the width of the characters depends on fontfamily and font-size

283994
fontfamily	font-size
i rewrote it for you and added classname so you can use a style to set the fontfamily and font-size

283994
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
that is not necessary since modern browsers do that for you tested with firefox ie opera and google-chrome

284040
int	chars
this will copy an array of chars into an array of int

284040
int	chars
this assigns the values of a null terminated chars array a s d f a s d f 0 to an int array yielding 97 115 100 102 97 115 100 102 0

284045
getter	setter
these scripts allow you to automate the generation of getter and setter methods for any highlighted instance variables

284056
jboss	geronimo
you need something like jboss application server or geronimo for that

284077
put	get
you can put a logging statement at your end of the queue so that as soon as you get the message you dump the contents into a log

284105
int	chars
chars array - int array

284105
int	chars
if you want to convert a chars array a into an int array b you can do it like this

284105
int	chars
the cast to unsigned chars makes the values of the int array positive useful if you want to convert extended 8 bit chars which will be represented in a signed 8bit chars type as a negative number and would otherwise be negative int too

284126
for-loop	loops
for the other for-loop you need to check inside the brackets to have an idea for what this loops is used

284126
vim	emacs
so i think it s the vim vs emacs things coming back in your question with the for vs foreach loop people who like the for will say this foreach is useless might cause performance issues and is just big

284129
ilist	icollection
if you really want to use readonlycollection t the issue is that the constructor of readonlycollection t takes an ilist t while the keycollection of the dictionary is only a icollection t

284134
post	get
it s not a killer -- good programmers will get through it but they ll curse your name and probably post you on thedailywtf

284156
int	chars
if you want to explode a byte array to an int array you can just do it chars by chars

284171
put	get
you might need to put some time into tweaking them to get the windows application look and feel just right but that should be more than compensated for by the lack of a need to write a whole new presentation layer

284184
hide	show
you may want a button to hide show the category lists as this can take a lot of space even when using scrollbars

284265
put	get
your best bet is to put the code that uses side_bar_html in your onreadystatechange function so that it doesn t get used before it s set

284287
gif	png
i am by no means an iis expert that s why i just gave up and went with converting to gif files but from the research i did before giving up i can tell you that not all versions of iis support the png mime type by default

284293
hex	binary
watchdog timer reset pins 8-bit counters overflows delay loops hex binary bit-masking interrupts interrupt service requests io ports etc. it s all very educational - and a great feeling to get so close to the machine - but being able to code something in c will hide some of this complexity so you can focus on results

284313
int	boolean
note dosomething is just there because of the where extension method being ok with a method that takes in a user and int and returns boolean

284321
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an application with 5 uiviewcontroller s each inside a corresponding uinavigationcontroller all tucked inside a uitabbarcontroller that displays 5 tabs at the bottom of the screen

284321
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i want to display another uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller when a dialog button is pressed

284321
hide	show
then i can show it and hide it using the tabbar s selectedindex property

284331
getter	setter
another issue with xmlserializer is that it doesn t like to serialize immutable types everything must have a public getter and setter unless you do it all yourself by implementing ixmlserializable in which case you haven t gained much by using xmlserializer

284360
config	ini
use ini file with config

284388
ncover	xunit.net
i m setting up ci at present using thoughtworks studios cruise gallio to run xunit.net fact tests and ncover 2 to do code-coverage

284481
post	get
if it bothers you you could use default arguments to use given arguments first then search for get post values if none are provided though that might be a security risk

284489
folder	directory
so i took alien.lua core.dll and struct.dll from the unzipped folder and put them under a directory named alien in a common library repository

284533
public	protected
comment each public method or even better also protected and private ones with explanations what do they do and what parameters are needed

284533
post	get
get vs post

284542
calloc	malloc
well the simplest answer would be to use calloc instead of malloc

284581
pop-up	dialog
but i don t want that message to pop-up when the the application has a modal dialog in the foreground because the user couldn t do anything about it

284588
addition	multiplication
i run a little speed check on them which just uses addition and multiplication

284658
16-bit	64bit	int	chars
this exapmle is based on chars 8 bits int 16-bit long int 32 bits and long long int 64bit

284661
tcombobox	tmemo
it s very interesting to quickly translate a delimited string to a control like a tmemo and similar ones tlistbox tcombobox just to list a few

284661
tstringlist	tlist
i just don t like much tlist as tstringlist satisfied my needs without needing of treating pointers as tlist is a list of pointer values

284677
actionscript	mxml
you can use that sort of technique to create the components in actionscript you will still need to set all the properties that are usually set in mxml but they all have the same names

284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller

284851
junit	testng
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too

284920
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if i remove clientaccesspolicy.xml and instead add the flash style crossdomain.xml policy file then it works

284920
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i do see through inspecting the network how clientaccesspolicy.xml is requested first unsuccessfully and then silverlight falls back to crossdomain.xml

284922
solaris	aix
the subversion webpage has links to unofficial binaries for many nix systems including hp-ux solaris aix the bsds and linux distros

284929
subclass	abstract-class
what i would suggest is to write your tests on the desired functionality of a non-abstract subclass of the abstract-class in question then write both the abstract-class and the implementing subclass and finally run the test

284929
subclass	abstract-class
your tests should obviously test the defined methods of the abstract-class but always via the subclass

284933
pop-up	dialog
avoid pop-up dialog like the plague

284950
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
we are using various svn clients tortoisesvn smartsvn subclipse etc.

284961
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest really only uses the http verbs get put post delete on a resource

284969
stdout	fflush
immediately before sleeping call fflush stdout

284986
subclass	abstract-class
if you do not want to subclass the abstract-class just to perform a unit test on the methods which are implemented in the abstract-class already you could try to see whether your framework allows you to mock abstract-class

285005
sorting	grouping
as i really only want to find the start and end values of grouping with small gaps the sorting only needs to create buckets and can discard the data

285023
quicksort	heapsort
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

285074
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
update i ve tested this in firefox 3 internet explorer 7 opera 9.5 and safari 3.1.2 all on windows xp x64 and this issue occurs in all of them

285086
getattr	setattr
however you can to an extent do this with the setattr and getattr built-in functions

285112
min	max
the buckets will contain a min and max value of their contents but won t store the contents themselves

285204
vim	emacs
but there is one advantage with ides over emacs vim related environments i want to focus on you spend less time installing configuring the features you want

285204
vim	emacs
no idea how many hours i would need to get the features i use up and running with emacs vim

285225
vim	emacs
you ask should i use an ide instead of... but i don t understand what the alternative is - vim and emacs fulfil many functions any ide will give you

285225
vim	emacs
then your question boils down to simply what ide should i use with arguments to be made for the simpler realm of vim and emacs

285239
put	get
remember that if you re still at the tutorial stage any tutorial is going to have a lot of just put this line of code in because they are trying to get concepts across not dig down into the inner workings of everything

285254
solaris	aix
edirectory is cross platform and runs on windows netware linux sles and red hat at least solaris aix and hpux

285324
multiton	singleton
you could use static class singleton multiton to implement the desired functionality

285345
post	get
when scouring the web i find all sorts of post which all seem to be about setting headers on the request some want me to not send the expect header some want me to send the keep-alive header but irregardless of the headers i send i still get this pesky error

285433
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the leading will not match within .htaccess only within httpd.conf src - bottom of page if you wish for processing of further rules to stop then add the l flag

285450
ienumerable	iqueryable
i find that extension methods are most useful when you are working with iqueryable ienumerable collections

285458
hide	show
in rowdatabound which initially show hide the links i add a linkvisibility instance to the collection for each row

285459
int	chars
tab is just ascii chars 9 and that has a base64 representation just like any other int

285502
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code works in firefox internet explorer not in safari google-chrome

285502
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome the divnew can only be moved vertically

285521
post	get
i know that the timeout on the server side is 20 min but if my client takes more than 100 seconds to post my data to that service then i get a timeout exception

285601
hide	show
theoretically you should be able to write some code like this and then use the return value to show hide what you want

285627
cvs	svn
most svn users treat tags the way cvs presented them

285627
cvs	rcs
i used to hand-edit rcs and cvs files with vi when i needed to fix a comment etc

285673
post	get
also i m sure if you post more code that shows how query and it are defined and used you ll get a definitive answer here too how s that for remote debugging

285753
boost	stl
for example there are stl standard template library and boost tr1 extensions to stl that are considered industry standards well stl is at least

285754
int	double
so let s say i want to write a class that operates on different kinds of numbers but i don t a priori know what kind of numbers int double etc. i will be operating on

285761
inherited	properties
however since vba does not support inherited objects of the extended class will have only the properties you define for them

285792
pull	push
either way you d pull the changes into the private repo on your computer fix any mistakes that result from the merge and then push his changes to your public repo the one on github

285818
ubuntu	linux
with java version 1.5.0_06 on both windows and ubuntu linux

285819
int	chars
instead of appending a chars to a string it will take the integral value of the chars which gets promoted to an int and add that to the value of the pointer

285827
public	protected
per josh the automatically-generated uid is generated based on a class name implemented interfaces and all public and protected members

285828
entity-relationship	diagram
my fallback option is to recreate an entity-relationship diagram by hand

285833
gridview	objectdatasource
use the objectdatasource control bind it to your gridview and set up a handler for the selectcoutnmethod property

285868
lisp	scheme
when you program in lisp or scheme you spend a lot of time thinking about functions and what actions you want to take on your data

285877
versioning	upgrade
i don t know what your product is or who your customers are but from my experience mac users are early adopters relatively speaking i ve never used an os x versioning longer than two weeks before the next upgrade was out and in my circle i am a late adopter

285973
y-combinator	combinators
while he doesn t to my knowledge look at the y-combinator itself he does look at other combinators for instance

286002
agile	sprint
you can pratice agile to your hearts delight as enhancement and fixes could be story boarded and made part of your sprint backlog

286005
.htaccess	httpd.conf
mod_rewrite rules may be placed within the httpd.conf file or within the .htaccess

286005
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you have access to httpd.conf placing rules here will offer a performance benefit as the rules are processed once as opposed to each time the .htaccess is called

286022
sorting	filtering
i m looking for good patterns for implementing a paged table of results in asp.net mvc with sorting filtering and paging provided via ajax

286029
disk	ram
so in the grand scheme of things -- if you have lots of disk ram and spare i o use whatever datatype you want

286054
nginx	lighttpd
if you just wanted static delivery then something like nginx or lighttpd would be an obvious way to go

286068
decimal	ieee
ieee floating point is binary not decimal

286114
folder	directory
what i first noticed is you are making a directory higher in the tree then attempting to make the php file in the current folder

286231
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
for freebsd netbsd openbsd macos x kqueue

286239
rss	feed
nabble and gmane both archive mailing lists and provide rss feed

286252
int	chars
primitive arrays int float chars etc are never empty by which i assume you mean null because primitive array elements can never be null

286288
public	protected
my first attempt was using the base class having a non-virtual public interface and then having another protected virtual method checkcreatedtype that would allow anything in the chain to inspect the type before the base class create was called

286300
cos	sin
you can calculate the sin from the cos using sin 2 + cos 2 1

286300
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
that is sin sqrt 1-cos cos

286303
swt	swing
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java

286305
width	height
if you don t want to use float then you might need to set the width and height manually

286315
firefox	safari
script that works with firefox safari khtml internet explorer and css3 capable browsers

286321
post	get
now it s my understanding that if a browser my browser is gwt requestbuilder doesn t support delete get rails somehow accomplishes this task with a post and some other url parameter

286323
extjs	mootools
i prefer jquery so that is my first recommendation but i worked with yui mootools prototype and extjs before making my decision

286372
fink	macports
the easiest way to start afresh with macports or fink is to simply remove the folder sw for fink or opt for macports

286372
sudo	passwd
that will install python2.6 into usr local python2.6 the last line requires sudo so will ask you for your passwd

286384
inline	inlining
in general an inline method that does nothing but pass the call onto another function is a great candidate for inlining

286418
ubuntu	linux
the web application hosted on linux ubuntu

286463
post	put
of course the form is sent with post but rails hads a hidden field to simulate a put request

286533
loops	while-loop
i ve been able to do it with a while-loop but i want to try it with a foreach loops

286563
wan	lan
i ve searched a bit and for me it looks like we must use application integration framework aif enterprise portal ep - this due to as i understand that the bc is not made for multi-users like on the web but must be implemented with a session-wrapper like ep - and also it must be run on an lan and is not capable to connect via wan

286570
solaris	bsd
my understanding is that start-stop-daemon is a command that is specific to linux or bsd distros and is not available on solaris

286583
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 8.04 but would be also be interested in solutions for other operating systems

286617
inline	inlining
however inlining opens the door to more optimizations if you have v a + b + c your wrapper class forces the generation of stack variables whereas for inline calls the majority of the data can be kept in the fpu stack

286634
gmail	hotmail
it s the way that big ones gmail g docs hotmail .. do it - lot of js code that manipulates with ui

286635
mouse	keyboard
as g mastros says the _click event is the one to use since it fires when the selection is changed via either keyboard or mouse

286698
ubuntu	debian
to use in debian ubuntu sudo aptitude install html2ps and then pipe the output to lpr to print

286724
filesystems	hfs+
edit i also forgot about macdrive which is another great tool for working with hfs+ filesystems under windows

286724
filesystems	hfs+
since a dmg is basically just a hfs+ filesystems snapshot it is probably possible with macdrive to create dmg s as well

286807
post	get
get maybe post for testing

286846
post	get
it s responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building html pages and receiving user input through get and post requests

286887
nginx	lighttpd
both nginx and lighttpd web servers have x-send-file headers you can return from php

286887
nginx	lighttpd
nginx and possibly lighttpd allow you to cap the download speed so you re not sending out streaming data faster than it can be consumed

286909
nginx	lighttpd
if i remember correctly the idea originally comes from lighttpd but - as josh states- is also available for nginx

286956
vbscript	vb6
or you could rewrite the vb6 app as a vbscript program

287014
action-filter	onactionexecuting
what i really wished i could do was have an action-filter that would return a view or partial view during the onactionexecuting event that displays this animated .gif then once the controller completed processsing and returned the viewdata the view or partial view with the actual view data could be displayed

287020
stderr	fflush
you can use fflush or print to stderr which is not buffered

287039
allocator	stl
if you really care about performance so much that you can t use a big old library like regex won t risk a bnf parser don t want to assume that std string substr will avoid a copy with allocator and hence can t use stl string functions and can t even copy the string chars into a buffer and left-pad with 0 characters

287039
int	chars
but fundamentally just 0-initialising those int variables is almost as much work as copying the string into a chars buffer with padding so i wouldn t expect to see any significant performance difference

287054
pecl	pear
is there any way i can embed insert images into this excel file without using any library only php code or library which doesn t require pear pecl extensions

287079
division	multiplication
if you re only using multiplication and division rather than operations like square roots that can result in irrational numbers you will never lose precision

287091
client-side	server-side
it s used a lot for ajax amongst other things because with ajax you typically have a server-side language php etc. passing a set of results to a client-side language javascript

287107
jobs	cron
script runner and rake tasks are perfectly fine to run as cron jobs

287107
jobs	cron
here s one very important thing you must remember when running cron jobs

287107
jobs	cron
also cron jobs probably don t run as you so don t depend on any shortcut you put in .bashrc

287135
dictionary	map
with such variable properties a dictionary approach basically a map of key-value pairs type specific or not is a great way to retain flexibility in the design

287172
queue	fifo
it is effectively a hashset but it also maintains a linkedlist to allow a predictable iteration order - and therefore can also be used as a fifo queue with the nice added benefit that it can t contain duplicate entries

287182
allocator	stl
a disadvantage that i encountered is that the latest installment of the dinkum stl containers make an assumption that pointers are used rather than the using allocator pointer policy

287192
listview	gridview
a common web ui design is to display a sortable grid gridview listview datagrid with paging

287231
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

287239
sorting	filtering
decouple the filtering sorting from the actual source so that you can mock the datasource

287259
g++	gcc
i tried autoconf but its assuming .h is gcc instead of g++

287273
g++	gcc
from reading the this eclipse cdt faq entry it sounds like eclipse can automatically generate a list of include directories if you start your build from within eclipse and if your build outputs the gcc g++ commands before actually starting gcc g++

287293
superclass	subclassing
should you realize that you need to change the superclass you can fix things without having to sweat the details in each subclassing

287307
put	get
and put the techo info in a hidden area ie click here to get the propeller head version

287315
prepare	execute
if you run the query once the statement is parsed prepare bound and execute

287317
profiling	instrumentation
i would rather spend a little time analyzing the problem up front and putting a few strategic print statements than figure out how to instrumentation your app for profiling then pour over gargantuan reports where every executable line of code is timed

287386
postgresql	mysql
also this was done in postgresql so i m not sure if this exact syntax would work in mysql

287404
vim	notepad++
the issue is when i try to use that expression in vim and notepad++ it can t seem to find anything

287405
post	get
it will get rid of all of them so you might need to have a pre-preprocessor step and a post pre-processor step to protect things you don t want to be expanded

287435
width	height
it appears that the width and height are set in the mpeg2_header_sequence function in header.c

287498
nunit	mstest
this allows us to use bizunit s library of steps directly in c# nunit mstest code

287503
parent-child	one-to-many
the parent-child relationship is also called a one-to-many relationship where the one is the parent and the many is the child

287522
hash	md5
hash them with md5

287538
hash	md5
i would imagine you will have to add a column to the database for the encrypted password then run a batch job over all records which gets the current password encrypts it as others have mentiond a hash like md5 is pretty standard edit but should not be used on its own - see other answers for good discussions stores it in the new column and checks it all happened smoothly

287544
hash	salt
what you should do is store the hash of a pre-chosen and secret salt value + the password

287544
hash	salt
i.e. concatenate the salt and the password hash the result and store this hash

287544
hash	salt
when authenticating do the same - concatenate your salt value and the user-supplied password hash then check for equality

287544
hash	salt
of course if the user send passwords across the network for example if you re working on a web or client-server application then you should not send the password in clear text across so instead of storing hash salt + password you should store and check against hash salt + hash password and have your client pre-hash the user-supplied password and send that one across the network

287649
put	get
the best line in the world to get someone on your side is i m in trouble and i need your help... you ve elevated them and subjugated yourself you ve put them in a position to save you

287654
securitymanager	classloader
class.getmethods bypass es securitymanager checks depending on the immediate caller s classloader see section 6 of the java secure coding guidelines

287669
inherited	properties
if imyinterface does in fact declare only the same methods properties as found in the control class you will have to create your own mycontrol class which inherited from control and implements imyinterface

287738
hash	salt
the basic strategy is to use a key derivation function to hash the password with some salt

287738
hash	salt
the salt and the hash result are stored in the database

287738
hash	salt
when a user inputs a password the salt and their input are hash in the same way and compared to the stored value

287738
hash	salt
first he d use the salt to lookup the correct dictionary then he d use the hash output to look up a usable password

287797
post	get
in ie 6 or ie 7 i can make one request http post to the app but when i try to make a 2nd request i get an operation aborted message

287804
post	get
the creator has a great post that should help get you up and running in no time

287808
int	chars
the table is an array of records each containing 2 chars and 1 int

287859
width	margin	margin	background-color
it won t stretch the full width between the label and the right side but you can have the label hide the bottom-border using background-color or something and have the div expand all the way to the right aswell without the margin

287865
spaces	delimiter
by default white spaces is a delimiter so you will get one stringlist item per token

287883
scrypt	pbkdf2
edit 2016 use argon2 scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 in that order of preference

287883
hash	md5
when you hash the passwords use do not use plain md5

287883
pbkdf2	salt
use pbkdf2 which basically means using a random salt to prevent rainbow table attacks and iterating re-hashing enough times to slow the hashing down - not so much that your application takes too long but enough that an attacker brute-forcing a large number of different password will notice

287883
hash	hmac	hash	salt
a good way to apply the salt when hashing is to use hmac with your favorite hash algorithm using the password as the hmac key and the salt as the text to hash see this section of the document

287907
post	get
simple http get post with data being represented as json array string variations of this being encrypted compressed string as parameter

287930
post	get
what you want to do is an http post if you are sending a lot of data or a get with a query string if theres a smaller amount of data

288004
post	get
which would result in the http get post of

288044
textview	imageview
i know that i can create an xml layout r.layout.mainmenu_item that has an imageview and textview in it but i am unsure how to set the imageview s icon

288054
hide	show
goal efficiently show hide rows based on the data in the row

288057
gridview	sqldatasource
i m working with a gridview that uses a sqldatasource element that looks like this

288084
folder	dir
exec master.sys.xp_cmdshell dir b c some folder with sql backups in it

288121
folder	directory
however within the directory that i want to recursively search through there are many folder files which have been added locally these i do not want to commit

288127
ant	cruisecontrol
we re using cruisecontrol ant and buckminster

288127
cobertura	emma	cobertura	eclemma
i have been looking at cobertura emma eclemma dbunit though am very interested to hear of any experiences with these or any other tools

288151
perl	tcl
also for a taste of how these widgets look in ruby perl and tcl see

288195
int	chars
if you know that the only whitespace is going to be #32 ascii space or a similarly limited set of chars there may be some clever bit manipulation hacks that can let you process 4 bytes at a time using int scanning

288253
rss	feed
you could probably subscribe to www.freshmeat.net s rss feed and only react when an even numbered version shows up

288263
for-loop	loops
however since we move the multiplication into the for-loop this is done every single loops

288322
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie google-chrome support the .scrollheight doesnt work with google-chrome so i have come up with a javascript example using jquery to set all iframe heights on a page based on the iframes content

288418
hash	md5
however i always get different md5 results when i hash the file after it is downloaded

288419
stringbuilder	stringwriter
feed stringbuilder to the stringwriter

288440
salt	md5
get md5 js implementation and compare salt

288476
hash	md5
if im not totally wrong here the md5 hash is only working on the actual data not the timestamps and other metadata

288486
pull	push
that lets anyone push pull their changes including branches to the bare repository and then others can fetch pull merge as they see fit

288500
ethernet	wireless
for that configuration i have built-in ethernet en1 configured to use dhcp and our company s dns server for when i m at work there is no wireless available

288501
expander	grid	expander	gridsplitter
i ran into a similar problem using an expander inside a grid with a gridsplitter

288507
versioning	upgrade
i wouldn t advise running this many versioning or instances on a production box but 2 instances until you upgrade your other applications to 2005 should be no problem

288536
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr neednâ t be built-in

288537
width	height
the arguments to the resize option are gravity x y width height so this will place the window at the top-left corner of the screen and resize it to 640x480

288562
g++	gcc
gnu gcc g++ provides non portable attributes for types which are very useful

288615
hash	md5
accidental collision of md5 is impossible in all practical scenarios to get a 50 chance of collision you d have to hash 6 billion urls per second every second for 100 years

288615
hash	md5
even though there is a known collision attack against md5 intentional malicious collisions are currently impossible against hash urls

288617
apache	nginx
with java hosting you don t need to do all the stupid tricks with apache or nginx

288625
post	get
you need to know the http protocol basics get post

288643
floating-point	integer
since floating-point values can t be compared for equality an integer may have been used to make the sql simpler

288650
rpyc	pyro
if you re even considering pyro check out rpyc first and re-consider xml-rpc

288665
sorting	grouping
either way it s seems like wrong way to pulling your data you can probably do taht with one query adequate sorting order by directly in the sql server grouping by and sum for getting the sum of your terms

288666
disk	ram
the initrd will get read from the disk once as one large file and then everything will run out of ram

288727
floating-point	integer
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

288732
hash	md5
at the moment i calculate an md5 hash for the known file and then scan all files recursively looking for a match

288735
post	put
in fact i can put any old random text in the pre and post events and no error is ever given nor do i see anything being called

288749
hash	md5
it seems pretty pointless to read the entire file compute a md5 hash and then compare the hash

288752
opera	safari
the problem is not seen with ie6 ie7 opera latest stable nov 2008 or safari latest stable nov 2008

288753
min	max
then get a random number with a min max for each section

288771
richfaces	icefaces
icefaces or richfaces jsf

288789
hash	md5
you should either use a hash function which has not been broken yet like sha-1 or as soapbox mentioned use md5 only as a fast way to find candidates for a deeper comparison

288824
wadl	wsdl
while sam s correct that restful web applications don t need a direct analog to wsdl there is an xml vocabulary that s useful for describing restful web apps wadl or web application description language

288918
ceil	floor
so the worst case depth is floor 2 log2 n call it 15 for a total of 120 and the best is ceil 1 2 log2 n which is 4

288931
pascal	delphi
delphi aka object pascal i ll talk about the native version not .net

288942
division	multiplication
but division and multiplication could be costly.

288946
division	modulo
but the modulo might be as costly as a division

288948
sharpmap	proj
to use sql server 2008 spatial data i would look at the sharpmap proj on codeplex

288999
jquery	simplemodal
i ve used the simplemodal jquery plugin and i ve been quite happy with it

289004
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that i would like to bind to an objectdatasource

289005
hash	md5
the md5 hash is calculated on the file contents and is not affected by document metadata

289034
division	modulo
but here s a fun fact gcc doesn t use division modulo for this

289038
post	get
it s essentially the same as the joins above but because you re not actually doing a join you don t have to worry about getting duplicates of the records in post so you ll just get one record per post

289047
hide	show
if you wanted to show an image somewhere else on the page you could accomplish that using javascript to hide show the image on the link s mouseover event

289057
interbase	firebird
update to answer your question in the comment most database brands don t support multiple concurrent transactions on a single connection interbase firebird is the only exception i know of

289145
post	get
it should work with post get etc

289145
post	get
it might be that you have an actionfilter that s only allowing post to get through or something else that is thwarting the behavior

289156
folder	directory
you are probably receiving errors on your build- it sounds like the dll s are actually output from other projects in your solution so you should check if they are building properly or if they are being output to a different directory instead of your bin folder

289158
folder	directory
you need to specify copy local on your references this will copy them out of the library folder into your bin directory

289159
textarea	pre
i tried setting white-space pre on the textarea s css but it s still not enough

cassini	iis
the other thing that s a pretty big gotcha is debugging web services is much easier using iis and vdirs rather than separate cassini instances

289258
ogre	irrlicht
now if you want something like this for a free project and you know c++ you may try any of the many open source engines out there such as ogre or irrlicht

289348
ready	each
work on several features at once release each individually when it s ready

289349
post	get
counter intuatively asp uses the response.codepage to determine how the characters in the form post should be interpreted hence utf-8 encoding get erroneously accepted as a set ot 1252 characters corrupting the input

289378
postgresql	mysql
not a relational database like mysql or postgresql

289382
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
even if it s not a important as in a sharepoint webapp it s still recommenced to dispose all spweb and spsite objets

289438
udp	tcp
tcp 1433 and udp 1434 are open on our firewall

289468
children	parent
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

289497
min	max
rows_this_page get_values rows min index page_number per_page - per_page max index page_number per_page - 1

289521
rss	feed
when i reach the end of the slides i pull data from an aggregated rss feed from all the different systems in order to pull information

289569
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to new versioning

289572
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
what i m searching for is the pen equivalent to the hid mouse driver hid keyboard driver and mass storage driver

289572
mouse	keyboard
the mentioned example drivers makes it possible for windows linux and mac os to recognize mouse keyboard and memory sticks without installing new drivers

289572
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
so far i m able to make usb hid descriptors that qualify as mouse and keyboard from os point of view and automatically uses the standard driver supplied by the os

289580
versioning	upgrade
but just to add xsl s answer using the lts versioning on servers allows you to have some confidence you can deploy servers which are going to be regularly patched but will not need upgrade of the entire os

289590
png	ico
it creates an ico file from 1 or more png s and handles multiple sizes etc like

289615
migrate	upgrade
it was long obsolete by then having been succeeded by both windows 2000 and xp 2003 but because companies did either not want to migrate yet or had custom software that is not compatible microsoft provided support and security upgrade until then

289712
pascal	delphi
as a long time pascal and delphi developer i always line up my begin and ends thus

289727
tinyint	varchar
tinyint varchar fields containing the values 0 1

289727
tinyint	boolean
i tend to prefer the tinyint 0 1 variant since automatic type conversion in php gives me boolean values rather simply

289738
tinyint	boolean
i use tinyint 1 in order to store boolean values in mysql

289738
tinyint	boolean
but if i m not wrong mysql can store boolean bool and it store it as a tinyint 1

289759
tinyint	boolean
otherwise according to the mysql manual you can use bool and boolean which are at the moment aliases of tinyint 1

289759
tinyint	boolean
bool boolean these types are synonyms for tinyint 1

289767
tinyint	boolean
bool and boolean are synonyms of tinyint 1

289780
putty	winscp
you ll find winscp putty filezilla and list free country list of sftp clients

289789
width	height
if i remember correctly an easy way to cure this is to create another iframe in the top page with minimum height width and call it framefix or similar

289793
bazaar	git
that being said if you have some requirements to do this that you cannot get around you can use one of the more modern version control systems like git bazaar and darcs there are others but i ve used these three

289831
disk	ram
i doubt that hardware is the issue as i m running on the latest quad core intel chip with 4gb ram and a wd velociraptor 10 000rpm hard disk

289841
inherited	properties
in oop languages like c# or vb.net if i make the properties or methods in a super class protected i can t access them in my form - they can only be accessed in my class that inherited from that super class

289841
inherited	properties
to access those properties or methods i need to make them public which defeats encapsulation or re-write them into my class which defeats inherited

289915
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering rows on conditions

290009
cpython	ironpython
i use sql alchemy with cpython i don t know if it ll work with ironpython though

290014
doc	rtf	wordprocessingml	rtf
aspose.words supports a wide array of features including document creation content and formatting manipulation powerful mail merge abilities comprehensive support of doc ooxml rtf wordprocessingml html opendocument and pdf formats

290183
post	get
post redirect get pattern can be used to address this problem

290225
submit	submission
a submit input type has the default functionality of submission the form it s placed in though of course you can still add additional functionality using javascript

290241
jruby	mri
the jruby team are now reporting better performance than the native mri

290255
tinyint	boolean
bit has a this is a boolean semantic and some apps will consider tinyint 1 the same way due to the way mysql used to treat it so apps may format the column as a check box if they check the type and decide upon a format based on that

290262
innodb	myisam
5.0.3 for myisam and extended in 5.0.5 to memory innodb bdb and ndbcluster

290298
gif	png
gif or png

290320
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t occur with firefox safari or google-chrome

290328
tinyint	boolean
if you use the boolean type this is aliased to tinyint 1

290335
firefox	safari
the following works fine in ie and safari but firefox is positioning the div absolutely on the page not within the cell code based on the solution solution here

290407
padding	overlapping
you can have a header section which has background aligned to the bottom as an image and bottom padding that prevents text content from overlapping that part

290415
hash	md5
the secret key is used to create a signature via md5 hash

290442
width	height
have a div inside the td with width 100 and height 100 then set that to position relative

290473
hash	md5
the hash is strictly a signature so a one-way hash like md5 is good enough for their usage

290516
std	ostream
note the use of constant ... since otherwise boost lambda wouldn t notice that this is supposed to be a lambda expression the compiler would try to output the string using std cout and assign the result an std ostream reference to menu help

290547
fastcgi	scgi
most python web frameworks support the wsgi standard and can be hooked up to servers in a myriad of ways but most live in some sort of long-running process that the web server communicates with via proxying fastcgi scgi etc

290547
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
if you are looking for something that comes prepackaged with web db templating integration i d suggest looking at django turbogears or pylons

290547
web.py	cherrypy
if you want to have more control over the individual components look at cherrypy colubrid or web.py

290565
inherited	properties
as long as you provided the properties that they needed to work everything was fine multiple inherited mi without the diamond problem name conflicts and other mi issues

290601
post	get
new - get - a form to post to create

290645
hash	md5
so one approach could be to sort them concatenate the bytes and take an md5 hash of all the bytes.

290650
django	turbogears	turbogears	cherrypy
however raw cgi is a huge pain when compared with the greatly simplified world of an all-python framework turbogears cherrypy django whatever.

290656
multiplying	add
if you ve actually got a sequence of guids and the order matters then i d suggest using the same approach i wrote about in another answer - repeatedly add multiplying

290664
std	ostream
this will automatically work for any type which has defined with an std ostream

290664
std	ostream
it will also automatically work with stream manipulator objects - those are really just functions which take an std ostream parameter and just calls the function on the ostream

290686
ncover	nant
for a build runner we use nant to send emails to various people copy the packaged builds where they re supposed to go run nunit and ncover and deploy the software to our web farm

290694
folder	directory
i was asked to find a way to monitor changes modification renaming deletion moving of files in specific folder on the company s shared file server simple windows shared directory

290705
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 have shown a bit of weakness two words can result in the same hash so using sha256-sha512 iterative hash is recommended to hash the password

290705
hash	salt
i would write a small program in the language that the application is written in that goes and generates a random salt that is unique for each user and a hash of the password

290712
shadowing	named
you should use size_t instead of size_t and you should also avoid naming your variables size_t since that introduces confusion by shadowing a type named with a variable named

290739
post	get
in that case the post does not get recorded.

290749
stdio	fflush	stdout	fflush	stdout	stdio
if that s a concern you should arrange to call system.out.flush before calling your jni function and in your c function if it s using stdio rather than the low-level write call you should call fflush stdout before returning

290855
int	chars
also note that the standard says that a bit-field shall have a type that is a qualified or unqualified version of int unsigned int or signed int so having a bit-field in a chars type is non-standard

290894
rss	feed
despite the proliferation of rss and atom feed i d say the average web user still has no idea what they are

290909
sorting	grouping
for example i would prefer to keep items in same order each time with like items grouping together instead of sorting them

290916
serializable	deserialization
you could potentially implement the ixmlserializable interface and use type.fullname you may also need type.assemblyqualifiedname for serializable and the assembly.gettype string for deserialization of your type element

290968
min	max
other things to consider would be to enforce min max lengths and some rules around passwords.

290988
rss	feed
for example perhaps it might be feasible for changes or summaries of them to be put onto an rss feed and have clients watch the feed instead of the real application

291082
versioning	upgrade
upgrading desktop apps can be a nightmare especially if you develop a new versioning using new tools and suddently have to upgrade all the other stuff dlls binaries whatever on all the desktops

291093
inherited	subclassing
this won t prevent others from subclassing tdefaultfileutils and calling the inherited getfile but that is just not how inherited works anyway

291102
post	get
so the way i have it written down here is all actions that actually do something other than get information will be post

291145
nant	cruisecontrol
would a combination of subversion nunit wiki cruisecontrol nant something else satisfy all of these requirements

291157
nant	cruisecontrol
as for tools to consider - i think searching stack overflow for nant msbuild cruisecontrol etc will give you more content than you can shake a stick at.

291162
submit	submission
before submission the form i d like to grab the values of the checkboxes and stick them into a text field then submit that

291183
opera	firefox
it appears to work perfectly in firefox 3.0.4 but both opera 9.62 and ie fails to execute any other js from the same .js file including what normally works

291189
firefox	safari
works great in firefox but shows up at the top of the page in safari

291189
firefox	safari
on the image breaks it in firefox and does nothing in safari

291246
lisp	scheme
scheme started out as an experiment to add smalltalk-like oop to lisp

291252
pull	push
so some way to be able to push and pull the built objects to a server is critical for this

291267
lisp	scheme
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

291270
aptana	radrails
i downloaded aptana w radrails as it seemed to be a good solution and because i love anything eclipse-based

291288
firefox	safari
the following works for me in firefox ie safari

291288
width	height
set the negative margins to half the width height of your image for perfect centering

291304
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code works on firefox ie7 google-chrome but not safari

291311
x86	64bit
the only difference is that i am now running 64bit as opposed to x86

291330
installation	upgrade
see for example the more fields plugin - it adds to the new edit post form without breaking your ability to upgrade the core installation

291366
stdout	stderr
you give it a bunch of command lines to run stored in a database it captures the exit value and stdout and stderr and if the exit value is non-zero it marks the build as broken

291372
aptana	radrails
i ve used aptana with radrails for a while now and have become quite used to it

291372
postgresql	mysql
for development i use mysql and postgresql on windows xp

291403
int	boolean
you could also package these boolean into bitmasked int

291436
rational-numbers	base
the guy proposing to base all other numbers on a rational-numbers primitive has never heard of transcendental numbers like pi for example which cannot be represented in this manner

291445
lisp	prolog
problem 2 this just feels wrong based on my prior experience with prolog lisp

291468
dia	visio
personally i use dia an open source visio kind of clone it works under windows linux and macosx

291523
filesystems	ntfs
i believe ntfs supports this and i am sure there are flavors of nix filesystems that would support it

291529
int	boolean
calls int boolean

291631
profiling	debugging
with delphi 4 i had been using gpprofile by primoz gabrijelcic as a profiling and memory sleuth by turbo power for memory analysis and leak debugging

291690
javassist	cglib
javassist and cglib are two good bytecode engineering libraries

291697
gridview	rowdatabound
in addition using the rowdatabound event would allow you to have an insert row available when the user pages to a different block of rows in the gridview

291704
opera	firefox
the check needs to work for ie firefox and opera browsers

291747
opera	firefox
i am not sure if opera and firefox use this same key but they likely have similar configuration options but this should at least get you on the right track

291752
octal	decimal
it many c-derived languages a number starting with a zero is taken to be in octal not decimal

291760
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works with firefox opera and google-chrome but unfortunately not with ie

291760
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox opera and google-chrome you can test it easily like this

291783
min	max
it would be very hard to do in regex without the min max quantifiers so hopefully your language supports them

291836
int	double
and the type of myarray is not array a b it is array int double

291836
int	double
now both bounds are tuples and its type is array int int double

291858
affinity	processors
given a process handle you can call the setprocessaffinitymask win32 api function to set the processors affinity for another process

291860
javassist	cglib
there are technologies like asm and cglib but i recomend javassist because it is a very good library for that and you can find examples in tapestry5 framework

291891
terminate	timeout
i could use a timeout to terminate the send if it is taking a long time that is the server does not respond quickly but that is not what i want

291897
ready	each
one solution is that in each process i could accumulate the text of the queries i wish to invoke in an array then loop down it once i m ready to write but i m wondering if it s possible the sqlite transaction can be made to do this for me automatically

291922
hide	show
i have a nested function to show hide paragraphs news-ticker-style

291979
explode	implode
the reverse of explode implode

292109
free	malloc
with linux gcc c++ i d like to record something to stderr whenever malloc free new delete are called

292122
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
additionally tested in firefox 2 3 opera 8 9.5 and safari 4 successfully

292129
free	malloc
as far as overriding malloc and free since you re working on linux and with gcc the easiest method is to use malloc_hook and free_hook

292143
free	malloc
you can trace calls to malloc free with ltrace

292161
aptana	radrails
i think aptana radrails is still a little confusing around the edges

292189
google-chrome	safari
the microsoft.com menu doesn t work on google-chrome or safari either but i doubt that microsoft cares

292209
decimal	ieee
though not arbitrary precision lua decnumber a lua 5.1 wrapper for ibm decnumber implements the proposed general decimal arithmetic standard ieee 754r

292225
cvs	svn
all the other points seem as valid under git or svn or cvs or .

292250
lisp	scheme
beyond personal experience the closest thing you ll get to an objective guess is the tiobe index which currently ranks lisp scheme 21st with 0.470 market share

292267
ironruby	ironpython
the dynamic keyword looks like it can bridge the gap between dynamic languages like ironruby or ironpython quite nicely which will probably help its adoption in the microsoft monoculture.

292364
vb6	vba
the versions of vba post office 2000 are almost identical to vb6

292372
width	height
i have a unit with helper functions for determining proper sizes and placement margins which compute these from the default gui font and the standard values in dialog units as given in the ui guidelines and with helper functions to compute the maximum width height of an array of controls place controls things like that

292385
vb6	vba
also as mitch mentioned if you learn the basics of vb6 you can use the same syntax for vba

292459
onfocus	onblur	onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur
try removing any validation this includes any onfocus onblur onchange event handlers

292510
versioning	upgrade
seconding klathzazts manually changing the versioning numbers. this is often the best solution for dealing with vsc++ when something goes wrong in the upgrade process

292573
folder	directory
it may be easier just to see if you can get permission to write to a single directory perhaps inside your web app folder on the server

292602
getter	setter
i ve implemented idynamicobject in c# 4 return a custom metaobject subclass that does simple property getter setter dispatch to a dictionary

292604
invokelater	invokeandwait
to run code on the event thread an application must obtain a lock on the event object or use invokelater or invokeandwait â extra work for the developer but sophistication comes with a price tag

292649
invokelater	invokeandwait
the direct way of doing this is to use invokelater or invokeandwait

292657
erd	diagram
these domain models can be represented as uml domain models class diagram and sql erd s

292687
multiplying	add
add instruction say and multiplying

292709
octal	decimal	octal	hex
customnumbereditor treats number with leading zeros as decimal removed unwanted octal support while preserving hex

292813
client-side	server-side
i believe the approach shd be based on a combination of server-side sockets and client-side ajax comet

292829
awt	swing
for awt swing you would use eventqueue.invokelater swingutilities.invokelater is only necessary due to java 1.1 not having the eventqueue method - 1.2 is about to celebrate its tenth birthday

292863
accessor	properties
you are not able to do so in this way since the way it works is that c# evaluates the value of firstname properties by calling its get accessor and passes the value of that to the indexer of the dictionary

292920
google-chrome	firefox
for heavy-weight applications those can be easily understood or at least profiled such as firefox or google-chrome

292951
firefox	safari
download a debugger for your browser firefox firebug ie visual studio express web developer safari drosera and following the execution path until the exception is thrown or you get to the portion of your code where the dom manipulation should happen

292975
domxpath	domdocument
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable

292975
domxpath	domdocument
to answer your question both libraries as well as domdocument + domxpath are standard outfit with php5 so they would be equally fine choices

292991
vb.net	vb6
i would think there is an api to allow this but my favorite vb6 site mvps vb.net does not have a way

292995
inherited	properties
...and partial classes allow me to add permanent code in parallel files simple read-only properties like fullname from firstname and surname members for a person object - or i could use inherited

293006
maven	pom.xml
the modules will each be in a maven project built by a parent pom.xml

293006
jar	war
the process has already started on moving each jar war into it s own project but it s obvious that this will only scratch the surface a few classes in each app jar and a mammoth legacy project with everything else

293036
dao	facade
while repository allows you to abstract the whole data access perhaps being a facade for multiple dao maybe different data sources

293093
getter	setter
the only intents expressed by your code are getter and setter

293159
put	get
requests to do any operation get put in a queue

293256
ironruby	ironpython	nemerle	boo
but there are a number of other .net languages out there - a# boo oxygene f# ironlisp ironscheme ironpython ironruby nemerle phalanger p# powershell and more

293304
mouse	keyboard
a hook dll allows you to intercept all mouse and keyboard events

293304
mouse	keyboard
you can also inject mouse and keyboard events

293343
put	get	post	put	post	get
the issue is that rest uses get post put and delete

293343
post	get
but the django test client only offers get and post

293343
put	get	post	put	post	get
i ve monkeypatched methods for put like post and delete like get

293392
profiling	benchmarking
finally if you make any of those changes which could affect your website s performance run some benchmarking and profiling the gain or loss in performance

293394
margin	font-size
using relative units for font-size line-height and top bottom margin and padding will also keep the typographic scale intact as users increase decrease text size

293653
post	put
if you put square brackets in an input name php will automatically turn them into an array for you in the post array

293672
std	ostream
so my question then is there a way to handle files greater than 4gb in size using std ifstream std ostream ie standard c++

293699
formview	datalist	formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	gridview	detailsview	datalist	repeater
i am using a custom datalist control but this problem also occurs with gridview detailsview formview and repeater and maybe with other databound controls

293768
bazaar	git
if you know how please explain how to do this in your vcs of choice such as subversion git mercurial bazaar or etc

293878
rss	feed
i would like to provide an rss feed for our customers of their current open issues .

293885
rss	feed
if private feed are part of the rss spec you should look there for the mechanics of rss auth

293892
shoes	fxruby
if you are interested rubylearning offers a course on fxruby and shoes

293904
queue	fifo
asides from that you really need to get to know queue especially fifo and event queue will help you avoid going into the realm of multithreading world

293909
agile	greenhopper
if anyone is trying to do agile i am trying to figure out a way to use jira greenhopper for this

293917
fast-forward	merge
merging to the upstream branch will now be an easy fast-forward merge

293920
set	bag
your bag attribute for example could be such a set

294046
fseek	fread
in this case the constructor would open the file and the destructor would close the file while the method would do some sort of fseek fread and return the value

294076
folder	directory
it s a rather specific instance where one would have to use this but if you are in the same predicament i was in simply put in your ftp server address username password the name of the folder you want deleted and the path of the folder to start in and this will iterate through the directory deleting all folder that match the name

294096
int	chars
vfilby s answer is probably the best one however many rdbms have better support for indexing chars fields than indexing dense int or floating point fields

294097
redmine	trac
i m also using trac for several projects but i m in the process of switching to redmine

294097
redmine	trac
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

294097
redmine	trac
both have integration with subversion so it s a matter of determine the features you really need and the backend language you might already have available trac runs on python redmine on ruby on rails

294100
superclass	subclassing
in order to see that the setlabel function can be applied to a wx.statictext instance you have to travel up the namespace hierarchy in the wxpython docs to the wxwindow superclass from which wx.statictext is subclassing

294101
hex	binary
typically you d base64 or hex encode binary content so that it can be transported as text

294103
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

294166
ubuntu	linux
i ve used it on both a macbook running os x as well as ubuntu linux on a desktop both with success

294178
easyhook	detours
if you only need to track process creation coming from a specific program or a few programs the easyhook detours method mentioned here will work pretty well but you effectively need to install a hook on createprocess into each program so it s not a great solution if you want to track all process creation in the system

294220
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
currently i have an image placed in the center of the window and i m thinking of using the three mouseevents mousedown mousemove and mouseup to calculate the new position when dragging the image

294246
post	put
a agree with manwood s post - you should build them as reports put a sproc behind the reports if necessary for the following reasons

294250
width	height
to do so i need to calculate the width and height of the element

294268
width	height
as of jquery 1.2.6 you can use one of the core css functions height and width or outerheight and outerwidth as appropriate

294285
pop-up	dialog
the general pattern is the user will press some key combination my program will detect it and potentially pop-up a dialog to get user input and then run a corresponding command typically by running an executable

294291
width	margin
set the margin 0 auto property and required width in px to the body tag

294349
rss	feed
i am trying to create a sidebar for a site that will allow a user to select an item from a drop down menu and show an rss feed

294349
hide	show
i am not sure how to acomplish this but my first thought was to use z-index and show hide layers

294504
ssdp	upnp
update an interesting kind of related discussion of ssdp and upnp is available on stackoverflow

294522
mouse	keyboard
the main thing to keep in mind is that oncommand is fired for any action that results in an activation of the button which can include pressing the space bar when the button has the focus using a keyboard shortcut attached to the button or clicking the button with the mouse

294522
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
the only actions that result in the button property being added to the event object are onclick ondblclick onmousedown and onmouseup

294961
versioning	upgrade
which needs to be able to read what versioning of each component is installed on their client machine in order to perform an upgrade only on that one component

294961
prerequisites	uninstaller
i have researched - and apparently prerequisites are not meant to be uninstaller

294961
prerequisites	uninstaller
perermtate i don t think there is a way to uninstaller a prerequisites that was prior installed which makes sense as the prerequisites may be required as a platform for other applications after all prerequisites were meant to be 3rd party components to the application

294965
postgresql	mysql
for both the questions mysql or postgresql is preferred as the database

294978
int	double
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider

294978
int	double
this is why you can assign an int to a double but going the other way you have to do an explicit cast - double to int is a narrowing conversion with potential loss of precision

295023

295795
terminate	timeout
i ve seen in the past that the psi project server interface within microsoft project didn t override the timeout and so the default of 100 seconds was applied and would terminate anything talking to it for longer than that time

295871
rar	zip
zip itself and rar aswell are a combination of the two processes

296011
rar	zip
it is also why zip files are extremely prevalent on windows because support is built in regardless of the superior routines in rar or 7z

the safest assumption to work on is that your implementation of securerandom is simply a cryptographically-secure prng and therefore that your keys are no more secure than the random seed that you use

296229
hide	show
the js we use manipulates the dom to show hide divs and perform incremental searching for a combobox selecting from a table

296304

even though the c standard specifies that fread and fwrite be implemented in terms of fgetc and fputc remember that the standard came into existence long after c was defined by k r and that things specified in the standard might not have been in the original designers ideas

296325
getter	setter
basically what i d like to do is to use entities if they were in my context cat getter setter etc so like normal pojos

the last line of your question is probably the quickest solution however i don t think you need to create the interface httpcontext.current.user is already an iprincipal and httpcontext.current.user.identity is already an iidentity

296497
keydown	keyup
when hiding on keydown or keypress the other application that becomes active after my window hides itself receives the keyup event for that keystroke

296497
keydown	keyup
for example tweetdeck sends the message currently being edited on enter keyup even if it did not receive keydown keypress

296784
getter	setter
you mention cases where you don t have both getter and setter

296821
idictionary	ilist
like ilist idictionary sometype myvar list idictionary sometype would not loose much if you write var at the left side of the assignment

296843
accessor	properties
for languages that have a native concept of properties which java does not you should use a properties when the accessor get or set does not have side effects is relative performant not long-running returns the same value for each call or does not depend on other properties contextual dependencies

296845
temp	tmp
rails is likely writing it s tempfiles to the global temp directory which everyone can write to but the plugins are probably trying to write to rails_root tmp which your server disallows

297269
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql sqllight and mysql but would be interested in how tools for other databases platforms work

297303
ioexception	printwriter
some days ago i realized that printwriter as well as printstream never throw an ioexception when writing flushing or closing

297326
post	get
during the get i want to send back the html but during the post i send back some xml over the wire

hide	show
below that there is a series of check boxes type_of_request for new accounts delete accounts new software etc which show hide those form elements as they are checked unchecked

297581

if i understand correctly you basically want a setup.exe that will detect the current versioning of the pre-requisites on the target system install them if they re missing and upgrade them if they re out of date

297581
uninstall	upgrade
also i haven t been able to find a way to uninstall an installed component if the msi can t do an upgrade something else i ve run into

297651
decoder	encoder
you need to implement your own png encoder decoder that works on an byte array containing the image information

297793
google-chrome	firefox
my pages all validate and they look correct on firefox and mostly correct on google-chrome

297823
post	get
from the server s perspective an ajax request is not very different from normal get post request - just some extra headers added on in the request

297825
put	get
since you are only dealing with int s it wouldn t hurt to put some type checking in your assignments otherwise you ll get sql errors if a string slips in somehow

297850
fgets	fgetc
i have also tried various methods of fgetc and fgets and printing backspace characters to hide the input since this works in other languages

297899
portrait	landscape
if my new document is in portrait the full content appears but if the new document is also landscape the content is cropped

297900
rss	feed
so to that end my best advice is to just load up your rss reader with feed from people who are working in the technologies that you are interested in

297936
versioning	upgrade
this may be named pipes or tcp ip mdac versioning upgrade vs install etc

297952
rss	feed
the motivation i am trying to use feed43 to create an rss feed from the non-rss-enabled highlearn website remote learning website

297957
floating-point	integer
it s also a floating-point number whereas 0x100000000 is an integer

297963
mouse	keyboard
virtualizing the mobile is way different from virtualizing the server or the desktop where in the the hardware components are almost standardized like the keyboard mouse usb lan etc so the hardware could be easily abstracted for any of the os

297995
vpn	lan
i do this all the time using an access gateway vpn then ssh to servers inside the company lan

298009
try-catch	exception-handling
edit try-catch will skip the succeeding statements on exception-handling

298075
width	height
frames store per-frame information like the x and y offset of the frame in sheet cell width and height and any transformation resize rotation hue etc.

298089
post	get
use post and if the user bookmarks the search save it in a database and give it a unique token then redirect to the search page using get and passing the token as parameter

298180
rss	feed
it s a web based svn viewer reasonable in what it does but provides a good rss feed at whatever level you want to subscribe to

298204
hash	md5
i would guess that performing an md5 hash on every item every time is pretty costly

298228
maven	pom.xml
in maven projects i only kept the src directory and the pom.xml in source control as everything else can be auto-generated afterwards

298265
ubuntu	linux
you could use a pre-built vmware image 1 or create your own pretty simply using a linux distro like ubuntu 2

298267
g++	gcc
it can use either vc++ gcc g++ or it can be configured to use other compilers if required

298273
nant	cruisecontrol
consider nant cruisecontrol and a faster build system

298329
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i m not sure i understand what you mean by map a subclassing one-to-one but if you want to map inherited where the subclassing have properties that are not nullable you can do like this in fluent-nhibernate

298329
joined-subclass	table-per-class	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
since you want the subclassing properties to be not-null you have to use the table-per-class joined-subclass way of modeling the inherited

298487
trac	bugzilla
i ve been using trac for a small personal project and at work we used bugzilla for this

298521
ubuntu	linux
tomcat 5.5 runs on ubuntu linux

298570
width	height	portrait	landscape
one way to get around this is to work with the source dimensions to work out a full width or full height depending on whether the image is portrait or landscape square to copy from the source

298600
vsto	add-in
for a vsto app-level add-in you can do something like this

298601
hash	salt
why not do something which guarantees there ll be no collisions as well as makes sure that no one can change a get parameter to view something they shouldn t using a salt combine the id and its hash

298601
hash	salt
even if you do accidentally stumble upon two numbers which have the exact same sha1 hash with your salt then the key will still be different and you ll avoid all collisions

298649
ant	maven
tools like maven ant capistrano insert your favorite tool here ... can help you a lot

298677
children	parent
my current attempt see code below uses the instance fields parent and children to track the objects but it obviously doesnâ t give me the functionality i require â as from obj id 6 i cannot recursively find the root parent

298705
post	get
the post office has lots of rules especially if you re doing this commercially and trying to get a better rate than first class

298724

298767
accessor	properties
i would avoid using properties if the accessor method does something non-obvious to the object like setting an unrelated instance variable

298773
daemon	cron
but i usually just write a script that checks if the daemon is running and run if not and put it in cron to run every minute

298816
sorting	filtering
so that end users can modify report layout filtering and sorting options.

298824
maven	m2e
for integration between maven and eclipse see m2e and maven eclipse plugin

298879
gtk	gdk
if it comes to gui stuff than libapr has nothing whereas glib has gdk gtk and a lot of stuff for gnome if you like

then the filereader will attempt to read that file from the base directory - which in tomcat is likely to be the bin folder

298932
mouse	keyboard
i can click select push buttons etc but it won t accept keyboard input and mouse wheel notifications as a result

298978

put	get
we have tried to put some guards around the selection but can t seem get all problems covered

299100
implements	extends
if we want to extends any thing in vista we have to implements interfaces using com

299119
division	multiplication
the elaborate on jeffery s message since you generally a better chance of truncated needed decimals than you have of overflowing a 32-bit integer and because multiplication division is commutative you should generally do multiplication before division

299121
division	multiplication
do multiplication first as long as they re not likely to overflow and division second

299143
division	multiplication
as said above you should do the multiplication before the division

299183
int	double
math.sqrt works with double as input parameters so you won t get accurate results for int bigger than 2 53

299192
profiling	instrumentation
i don t believe he has open-sourced this yet but as he describes it the basic idea is to use aop to instrumentation code that you re interested in profiling and record which thread has touched which field

299200
firefox	safari
subjects webkit safari firefox apis applescript automator javascript ruby ruby on rails os x tiger

299256
firefox	safari
i don t have any insight into safari but it s based on webkit and there should be some resources on customizing it similar to how you d use xul on firefox

if you can t use javascript then make each step a view with a method in the controller and keep your data in session until ready to submit to the database

299451
sorting	filtering
you can present different views of you folders using the data view filtering and sorting controls

299474
put	get
i am not a web developer but somehow it seems that i should be able to use some tool to tell me exactly what put get magic goes from the final request to the server

299490
filtering	grouping
the problem is that i need to add additional filtering to only look for users who are in certain security grouping

299522
hide	show
above i used the payload instead to indicate whether the shell should show or hide

299670
versioning	upgrade

299849
firefox	safari
i see this behaviour on firefox for example not safari for what that s worth

299866
minimum	max
you can fine tune your pool by playing with the minimum number of connections the max number of connections to be created and the timeout

299886
pull	push
a bare copy that you can push pull from which your would push your changes when you re done and then you would clone this into you web directory and set up a cronjob to update git pull from your web directory every day or so

299894
filesystems	fat
as technophile said removable drives usually use fat filesystems so no permission info is copied at all

299913
post	get
if that s not possible then i guess my best bet assuming i do go with php will be to pass control directly to the external program explicitly through a post or get to a cgi program or similar

299918
int	chars
id fields are normally int s so you shouldn t encase them in chars in the sql string

299929
width	text-align
then we text-align center the element and give it a 100 width so that it is the size of .image_block

299933
margin	text-align
the reason it s failing is that you can t position via margin or text-align while absolutely positioned

width	height
i am writing a simple application in silverlight2 which needs to draw an ellipse inside a canvas element - the ellipse position height and width are computed during runtime

300120
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if you are using firefox and i think opera and maybe safari

300158
gif	bmp
that way you could save the image as a 8-bit gif representing the alpha channel plus a jpg or bmp or whatever for the color data

300168
opera	safari
they are not fired in safari opera ie7 etc

300185
google-chrome	firefox
in other words does google-chrome support javascript 1.6 1.7 or 1.8 which firefox also supports or some combination of them

300233
put	get
btw would put your anchor tags as block so you get consistent width mouse targets

300246
swt	nebula
there is an swt table and the nebula project has a grid in alpha

300254
kde	gnome
the mockups i d like to do would be mainly for windows xp perhaps also for gnome kde and mac osx but these are not top-priority

300263
equals	gethashcode
you may need to override equals and gethashcode

300264
ninject	spring.net
i think you should really look into the inversion of control ioc dependency injection di design patterns that are implemented in numerous frameworks such as microsoft unity castle windsor structuremap ninject spring.net and so forth

300320
g++	gcc
especially gcc g++

300334

300441
rss	feed
you can find that archive here and subscribe to an rss feed for that tag here

300520
post	get
but then you get post like this showing people how to create one per day to set up email reminders

you might also look at telerik s radwindow control which was designed in part to solve the modal dialog problem

300581
inherited	properties
i have an application with my object types that inherited from a base class that contains the majority of properties for the application objects

300629
width	height
i m writing a direct3d application and after noticing strange bugs such as anti-aliasing occurring even when it was turned off and the mouse pointer not lining up to things with the same coordinates as itself i discovered that when creating a window the width and height parameters include the border

300655
lisp	scheme
i failed to grasp the interaction between the reader evaluation symbols special forms macros and so forth in both common lisp and scheme because those things all seemed to interact in tangled ways but i finally really understand them in clojure

300669
stdout	stderr
i am able to launch what i need but i have no idea how to capture the stderr and stdout

300680
stdout	stderr
the notation hieroglyph at the end sends stderr file descriptor 2 to the same place that stdout file descriptor 1 is going

300687
g++	gcc
check to see that gcc and g++ are installed correctly

300695
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png

there are a whole bunch of xml attributes inm this namespace that you can use to exactly control how serializable and deserialization takes place

300786
for-loop	loops
there was a single data object created then a for-loop where the properties of the object were modified including a new unique guid and it was sent to the service via remoting serializable not marshal-by-ref if that s what you re thinking loops and do it again etc

300798
pop-up	dialog
you can pop-up the eject dialog by using something like this

300808
unsigned	short
i need to cast 2 bytes in an unsigned char array to an unsigned short

300811
cpu	affinity
addition to answer your question on how to limit your app to a single cpu you will need to set the process affinity to a single cpu

300827
unsigned	short
you should not cast a unsigned char pointer into an unsigned short pointer for that matter cast from a pointer of smaller data type to a larger data type

300827
unsigned	short
a better approach is to shift the bytes into a real unsigned short object or memcpy to a unsigned short array

300842
multiplying	add
so if you want to add 17.5 you need to multiplying by 1.175

300851
integer	unsigned
i think it may have to do with the integer in php being unsigned 32 bits as in c# they are signed 32 bits by default

300859
mp3	flv
i ve never used it but apparently it will stream drm-encrypted flv or mp3 content and enable you to apply the usual sorts of drm restrictions

300861
floating-point	integer
however these only go so far if you add a large integer to a large integer php will see that the result is too big to fit into a normal integer and will assign it to a floating-point number

300875
multiplying	add
trig functions multiplying by r and add px or py as appropriate

300884
content-disposition	content-type
i doubt that adding the content-type and content-disposition prior to the redirect will have any affect since the browser sees the redirect header and makes a completely new http request to the redirected url which will be an entirely different set of headers

300890
mouse	keyboard
linux kernel uses device interrupt timing mouse keyboard hard drives to generate entropy

300915

there are also two sets of multiplication and division instructions to deal with signed and unsigned integers

301288
hash	salt
instead force it to use salt hash

301327
switching	screens
then you will switching to the memory screens and modify values in memory that is you will directly access memory while the program continues to run

301424
minimum	max
edit to answer you question why would you want to control the memory allocation or specifically max heap size you usually don t want to but if you re writing an application that is like sql server or iis or some real time application then you d have a pretty good reason to have control over memory and specifically avoid paging otherwise the clr itself and the os already do a pretty good job for you and what is left is to ensure your that application uses minimum resources for things to work well

301426
firefox	safari
the site has a massive js ajax client and works in all browsers ie firefox and safari that uses the same browser engine as cssedit

301428

i need to detect image format to save a image like image1.jpg image2.gif but i only have a stream and i do not know the image format gif jpeg png etc

301500
disk	ram
but if that s the way you like it you d actually be better creating a ram disk maybe 128-256mb and use that for the intermediate files

301500
disk	ram
but i d be happy leaving everything in ram and just committing back to svn every half hour or so or making a copy out to the real disk

301500
disk	ram
the ram disk would be perfect for the temp intermediate and build files

301500
disk	ram
you can always copy the build files off the ram disk once you re happy

301500
disk	ram
the ram disk i use is the microsoft windows 2000 one

301557
hash	salt
my intention is to generate a salt hash of the file contents and append it to the file

301625

is there a way to customize the post build event macros i would like to move the new assembly to a sub folder in the same directory named by the version of the assembly

301812
accessor	properties
one solution to avoid typos is to have a set of accessor which fetch the relevant propertyinfo for a particular properties and unit test them

301838
clang	llvm
not sure if this counts as debugging but for c and objective-c code i find the llvm clang static analyzer to be invaluable

302099
post	get
you can then use this opener object to post and get handling redirects and cookies properly

302101
getter	setter
it does not work for properties as you cannot have delegates to property getter or setter methods

302121
put	get
you get this for free from business objects but you will have to put an aggregate measure over each base measure explicitly with report builder

302121
min	max
on specific instances you might also want to expose count min max or averages as well

302128
filesystems	fat
old filesystems like fat allow only files up to 2gb

302129

302329
google-chrome	firefox
i ve written one that does its job just fine in firefox but makes google-chrome crash and burn as soon as you embed it on a page

302365
accessor	properties
a class has a properties and instance var of type nsmutablearray with synthesized accessor via properties

302368
maven	pom.xml
publishing a jar to a maven repo with pom.xml info to track dependencies is an excellent choice for libraries as well

302368
ant	maven
ant has copious examples of this and maven has the assembly plugins that can help

302426
comparator	comparable
this class guarantees that the sorted set will be in ascending element order sorted according to the natural order of the elements see comparable or by the comparator provided at set creation time depending on which constructor is used

i am trying to get all of the properties of an object that have both a getter and a setter for the instance

302507
folder	directory
i want to create a directory on a windows ntfs partition and then grant a windows nt security group read access to the folder

302530
put	get
it s a very reasonable way to get the initial structure put together but doesn t quite do the right thing with repeated runs for example component guids aren t stable yet...

302540
move	drag
but if you want to start testing mouse move keystrokes or drag and drop you d be better off choosing a more robust ui pattern like the one suggested by brian

302571
ubuntu	debian
or you can set source preferences by package but i don t know how to do it i just know that it exists in debian so it should exists in ubuntu too

302572
rss	feed
i would like to serve a different content from a single url depending on whether the user is a browser or a rss reader hence avoiding an example.com feed url

302572
rss	feed
thus www.example.com posts will return an x html page to a browser and an rss feed to a feed reader

302584
rss	feed
but as there is no sure fire way you better fail on the side of serving html more often than rss or better yet do as everybody else does and provide a different feed for rss

302608
google-chrome	firefox
i doesn t happen in firefox or google-chrome

302646
rss	feed
most modern browsers are intelligent enough to inspect an xml data source and http headers and determine if it represents a syndication feed typically formatted as atom or rss

302646
rss	feed
while there is actually no offically registered mime type for rss feed the defacto that is used is application rss+xml

302664

i can t play with my smarty sites at the moment but i d first remove the from the replacement value to see if the bug is there then remove it from the matcher and just look for height width

302829
firefox	safari
is that it does not work in safari and in firefox it only works if i put an alert

302896
interpolation	splines
to orient an object and make it follow the splines path you need to interpolation the current x y z position from a t that walks along the splines then orient it along the frenet coordinates system or frenet frame for that particular position

302899
getter	setter
whether or not to use synthesized properties is a design decision since properly implemented getter and setter methods will provide identical functionality

302922
treemap	treeset
a treeset internally uses a treemap so why not use treemap directly

302946
rsa	aes
there are many good symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms aes rsa etc many of these algorithms let you select how strong a key you want 1024bit 2048bit etc

302960
persistent	transient
i ve been tasked with writing a program to read a pop3 account and differentiate between mail returned as a permanent failure 5.x.x delivery status and a persistent transient failure 4.x.x delivery status doing a retry for the 4.x.x dsns and flagging the email as bad for the 5.x.x dsns

302978
hash	salt
in addition to looking into these libraries you should also consider adding salt to the hash which essentially means adding some extra data to the value being hash prior to the hashing and adds an extra layer of security

303020
integer	unsigned
in order to be able to compile the code you ll need to add typedefs for byte as an unsigned 8-bit integer and dword as an unsigned 32-bit integer along with the header files crc.h sniptype.h

303051
agile	sprint
try using agile when you got a corporate executive on you telling you to plan all the tasks and estimate the hours for 10 sprint at once

303079
spaces	delimiter
you can also change the delimiter so instead of a semi-colon it can use a spaces

303152
sorting	filtering
when such a stored procedure is used as a recordsource for an ms access form and user tries to use built-in sorting filtering functionality of the form ms access tries to execute the stored procedure in fmtonly mode apparently hunting for metadata of the rowset provided by the stored procedure

303198
disk	ram
memory 101 smaller stuff means holding more in ram at once and thus fewer hard disk reads

303243
boost	stl
my language is c++ windows and i have the stl as well as boost available

303255
hash	md5
high score is hash along with high-score value ex md5 oursecretkey + 200

303267
boost	stl
though they are not part of stl nor boost

mapguide	arcmap
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap

303278
web.py	pylons	django	web.py
so my question is how does the performance compare between asp.net mvc and the various oss mvc frameworks specifically pylons or web.py or django

303304
hash	md5
for a ridiculously short value ie values 64 characters md5 as a hash becomes ineffective due to rainbow table attacks and as the value you re sending will be shared over the wire all they have to do is brute force the shared secret and they have a known product to work with

303369
cdr	cons
in some cases keywords aren t even english though they may vaguely resemble english words car cdr and cons from lisp

303369
printf	fgets
printf fgets sscanf and many more from c

303371
put	get
as for boost the things that i would like to be able to do is set the node names set attributes in my nodes and get rid of all the extra crap that comes with it as i don t really care about having to put my document back into that class

303381
merb	ruby-on-rails
we have found that as far as maintainability as quickest turn around time to complete our projects are concerned ruby-on-rails or merb offers the best solutions

303388
freemarker	velocity
regarding using jsp as the presentation layer there are other technologies available like velocity freemarker as iberck mentioned above tapestry also has it s own rendering engine

303395
firefox	safari
by the way i ve seen occasional tearing on mac windows firefox ie safari flash 9 and 10 with large fonts colored tabs--i m not sure if this something i m doing something about the larger fonts or the colored tabs themselves--but just a heads-up

303540
int	chars
also structs are value types much like int chars etc. and thus are non-nullable

303628
pop-up	dialog
after further research and coming across a number of posts mentioning the unreliability of waitforexit and the process exited event i ve come up with a completely different solution i start the process and don t bother waiting for it just pop-up a modal dialog in which the user can click on update to update the temporary folder file back into the database when they ve edited and saved the temporary file or cancel

303648
mouse	keyboard
make sure you have a keyboard and mouse which are comfortable to you

303648
vim	emacs	vim	kate	emacs	kate
choose an editor vim emacs kate eclipse whatever

303688
public	protected
i would though say that using friend without a good reason sounds kind of a bit strange to me...in c# you have such a thing as assembly so you could use internal constructor instead or private constructor and several static creation methods with different access protected public internal...

303702
hash	md5
finally i just had to comment on your choice of hash algorithm md5 is a great hash algorithm for those still living in the nineties

303772
width	height
as far as i know there is no plugin images should have a width and height specified like so

303811
typedef	struct
i usually avoid these type of typedef i rather write enum in front if an enum and struct in front if a struct i will just use them here because it looks nicer

303835
children	parent
to compound it some objects are deeply nested children of the parent object which the authorization should be performed on

303946
factories	presenter
i would say to use a factories to create the presenter objects

303986
background-image	background-color
this has the advantage of allowing you to specify additional styles via css that will show if the image doesn t - a background-color or even a background-image

304020
ant	maven
additionally maven can also do some ant stuff

304030
hash	md5
finally i just had to comment on your choice of hash algorithm md5 is a great hash algorithm for those still living in the nineties

304069
ant	maven
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

304092
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
google gears does fit but its not a standard while html5.0 is safari supports 5.0 and i guess opera and firefox will too by mid 2009 if they don t already

304119
ant	maven
and don t be afraid to go with something other than maven eg ant

304119
ant	maven
the success of your project will be the project itself not its build tool so long as you choose a best-of-breed build tool which both ant and maven are

304143
accessor	properties
sadly and its counterpart are last i checked only recognized by kvo for set as in nsset properties not array properties so you don t get free kvo notifications with them unless you implement them on top of accessor it does recognize

304144
dia	visio
this is a big deal -- not everyone is an expert or even decent at visio or dia and that can be a obstacle to keeping the documents up-to-date

304185
typedef	struct
due to struct tags becoming typedef s

304185
int	chars
due to chars literals being type chars and not int etc

click is supposed to edit text while drag drop is supposed to move the tag

304222
hex	binary
binary files aren t easy to read in a hex editor

304280
cpu	processors
it depends on the size of the processors registers and how the jvm chooses to use them - but if the byte array isn t kept totally on processors then you ll see a performance hit compared to a simple or as the array is pulled onto the cpu for each check

304337
post	get
i m also going to be passing it as json but wanted to get straight post working first

our tests rely on firefox google-chrome to test file-uploads so firefox is crucial to our testing strategy

304481
minix	linux
linux was prompted on the original minix

304492
ant	maven
however this is more like ant or nant rather than maven - it is an xml based scripting language designed for software builds rather than using the convention over configuration approach of maven

304492
maven	pom.xml
in some ways you can think of the tfsbuild.proj file a bit like the maven pom.xml file - but they are very different

304584
elf	omf
if you want to convert microsoft s omf binary format to elf then you should be able to do so using objcopy but you may need to compile in support for the right object formats

304587
getter	setter
immediate and delayed update of db on object update via getter setter methods

304646
post	get
you need to edit it down to probably ten lines or less and then assuming you haven t been able to figure out the problem you could then post just those few lines that showed the problem in your question and then with a decent title and some good descriptive text you ll probably get your answer

304702

to auto-generate a proxy i guess you are looking for something that parses wadl the rest answer to wsdl

305008
folder	directory
make a bin folder in the solution directory same level as the project directory

305008
folder	dir
whatever libraries directly referenced by your projects goes to a references or libs folder sometimes i ve also tried putting them in bin too but in this case you need to remember to disable copying of references to output dir when adding the reference to your project which becomes tedious on large projects

305028
urllib	httplib
i guess that means mock urllib or httplib in python

305087

i m using the mysqli extension in php and i m wondering is there possibly any way to see a prepare query as it will be execute on the server the query is something like this

305216
ant	maven
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet

305216
ant	maven
if you like maven s dependency management but not maven you can get something similar in ant using ivy

305216
ant	maven
there is a set of ant tasks for publishing to a maven repository

305249
getter	setter
validation should be captured separately from getter or setter in a validation method

305284
put	get
i am designing an asp.net website that will run sqlcmd get some output and put this into a grid on screen

305304
postgresql	mysql
iâ m looking for anything that supports mysql postgresql and derby

305316
free	malloc
backtrace_symbols allocates memory using malloc and you use free to free it - if you re crashing because of memory corruption your malloc arena is very likely to be corrupt and cause a double fault

305316
free	malloc
malloc and free protect the malloc arena with a lock internally

305316
free	malloc
you might have faulted in the middle of a malloc free with the lock taken which will cause these function or anything that calls them to dead lock

305377
rss	feed
there should be an rss feed behind this but i can t find it at the moment

305382
getter	setter
but i cant find where to locate the getter and setter access modifiers

305480
hide	show
the easier option was rather then removing and adding the columns was to add all of the columns and then just selectively hide show the desired set of columns

305487
dbf	dbase
access can open dbf dbase files but instead of physically converting the data into mdb format it has the ability to link to the dbf table itself

305523

305735
int	double
if you re certain the incoming strings will be able to convert to int or double without a hitch the .parse is faster

305739
post	put
use post or put instead the browser should warn the user not to reload the request

305739
put	get	post	put	post	get
redirecting using http redirection to a receipt page using a normal get request after a post put request will make it possible to refresh the page without getting warned about resubmitting

305739
post	put
you could make a timestamp or a random hash etc.. when displaying the form storing it both as a hidden field just besides the anti cross-site request token i m sure you allready have there and in a session variable wich is stored safely on your server when you recieve a the post put request for this form you check that the timestamp is the same as the one in session

305803
inherited	properties
this would probably be a good situation to use inherited where you have a parent class possibly abstract define the properties and methods common to all types of records and each child class can override these methods to provide their own parsing and validation if necessary or add their own properties and methods

305867
ffmpeg	libavformat
if you don t mind using lgpl code i d suggest looking at ffmpeg s libavcodec and libavformat

305881

getter	setter
step 2 set the storage parameter of the column attribute to this member name and fill in the property getter and setter

305949
cvs	svn
if you have serious cvs svn problems maybe once a month it s still way to few to have complicated clients installed on all your dev machines

305972
getter	setter
i just wanted to add that it is because you are only using the getter not the setter

306061
uiview	subviews
you can do this with either uiview or calayers as subviews of the main superview

306106
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 3.3.2

306132
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

306190
cairngorm	flex
mysql || spring jdbctemplate for data access || blazeds remoting || flex cairngorm

306190
client-side	server-side
manually coding sql server-side entity objects client-side value objects and all the cairngorm stuff is obviously a drag but i m not sure what higher-level frameworks to introduce

306209
getter	setter
the controllers calls the setter and the views calls the getter

306222
metaclass	superclass
note that in python 3 the syntax for specifying metaclass changed and the basestring abstract superclass was removed which requires something like the following to be used instead

306252
firefox	safari
whenever i align them correctly in safari usually using vertical-align baseline on the input they re completely off in firefox and ie

306252
firefox	safari
fix it in firefox and safari and ie are inevitably messed up

306279
turing	decidable
the class np can be defined as the class of problems decidable by a nondeterministic turing machine in polynomial time

306279
sat	np-complete
this theorem shows that sat is np-complete by encoding the operation of any nondeterministic turing machine by a boolean formula in such a way that the machine accepts if and only if that formula is satisfiable

306286
implements	extends
for instance anything you can do with a closure you can do with a subclass without repeating business logic--what you end up with looks worse because of layers of braces extra class definitions but is often more reusable you can extends the class you use to implements your callback but you can t extends a closure method you have to rewrite it.

306316
width	height
i am trying to write a c++ program that takes the following inputs from the user to construct rectangles between 2 and 5 height width x-pos y-pos

306319
subtract	add

306336
strlen	strcmp
yes description 0 0 clears the string from strxxx functions pow strlen description 0 strcmp description 0 and std string description are all true

306336
free	memset
no description 0 0 is not the same thing as free description or memset description 0 sizeof description

306360
cvs	svn
svn has some important features over cvs vss like atomic commits cheap copies more efficient storage on the server side

306420
gridview	rowdatabound
override the rowdatabound method on the gridview and build the hyperlink programmatically

306457
ssl	https
some elements may not list http or https in this case whichever was used for the page will be used for these items if the page request is under ssl then these images will come encrypted while if the page request is not under ssl then these will come unencrypted

306461
dictionary	map
i just came across sglib while looking for a c implementation of a map dictionary container

306467
bazaar	git
some people prefer distributed version control systems such as git mercurial or bazaar

306529
client-side	server-side
the main problem you re having is synchronizing your client-side state with your server-side state

306593
firefox	safari
both ie 6 and 7 will notice it but safari and firefox will properly ignore it

306593
firefox	safari
setting this and then relatively positioning upwards behaved almost identically in safari firefox and ie with only a pixel or two of discrepancy

306593
firefox	safari	width	height
setting a width and height on the checkbox and then overflow hidden for some reason cuts off the extra space and allows ie s positioning to act very similarly to safari and firefox

306593
width	height
depending on your text sizing you ll no doubt need to adjust the relative positioning width height and so forth to get things looking right

306648
serializable	deserialization
make sure the serializable completed and that the serializable type matches the deserialization type make sure you re serializing with a binaryformatter if you re de-serializing with one

306657
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
use htmlspecialchars in html xml prepared statements or at least addslashes when building sql queries json_encode when inserting values into scripts rawurlencode when appending url components escapeshellargs when constructing shell commands etc

306697
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie but it doesn t work in firefox or google-chrome

306925
stdout	stderr
the real issue was that wxpython by default redirects stdout stderr to a popup window that quickly disappeared after an uncaught exception

306947
width	margin
this example also divides the width into five equal columns with borders and some padding and margin just for fun

306947
width	margin
this is because the sections that divide the width have no padding margin or borders

306947
margin	height
to get the div to fill the height of the window but alas when adding margin padding and borders the rendered height of the div becomes greater than the viewport resulting in a vertical scrollbar

306954
for-loop	loops
you could also do a simple for-loop instead of the while loops over the iterator

306967
cassini	iis
it requires using the visual studio development server cassini during development instead of your local iis see the properties box on the project

307006
stdout	stderr
we simply redirect stdout and stderr

307130
int	boolean
the built-in types such as long int boolean etc

307136
force.com	salesforce
this book is called force.com cookbook published by salesforce itself

307156
lxml	elementtree
of course a third option is given a concrete representation of the xml using elementtree or lxml you can build your own custom model around that

307167
xargs	zcat
which costs one invocation of find one invocation of xargs a few invocations of zcat and one invocation of agrep

307232
getter	setter
i am very curious about the possibility of providing immutability for java beans by beans here i mean classes with an empty constructor providing getter and setter for members

307238
getter	setter
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method

307246
vsto	add-in
at the same time we ll also be installing a custon add-in built with vsto so we could do the form install as part of that

307272
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i did a simple test with a formula x- x+1 -1 and the largest value of x i can get to work on safari opera and firefox tested on os x is 9e15

307288
maven	m2e
other options are pax construct m2e maven bnd

307288
ant	cruisecontrol
at my current clients we use buckminster which wraps pde-build and call it from ant cruisecontrol

307364
firefox	safari
i have a gallery i quickly coded up for a small site and under firefox 3 and safari 3 works fine

307419
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade from delphi 4 to delphi 2009 primarily because of unicode but also because of the many improvements everywhere in delphi since my versioning

307419
versioning	upgrade
also embarcadero still gives a special upgrade price that borland and then code gear did for all previous versioning owners

307437
children	parent
call the parent directory base and the children directories alpha and bravo

307501
mp3	wav
the snack sound toolkit can play wav au and mp3 files

as pyro says search the perimeter of a square that you keep moving out one pixel at a time from your original point increasing the width and height by two pixels at a time

307623
rss	feed
i m writing some rss feed in php and stuggling with character-encoding issues

307651
rss	feed
depending on the exact nature of the data you need to insert it may be possible to just use the auto generated rss feed to get the information you want a process will need to read the rss and formulate a query

307699
udp	tcp
the reason for that is because there are many different ways to communicate using sockets tcp udp etc

307802
serializable	deserialization
use the schema that xsd exe generated itself and that it uses in the serializable deserialization

307861
post	get
note when you do this the apache error log will generate this entry when you exceed this limit on a form post or get request

307874
sqldatasource	detailsview
the detailsview is associated with a sqldatasource authors

307884
mouse	keyboard
you would typically start with an nsview subclass to represent your canvas and handle drawing and mouse keyboard events

307899
sorting	filtering
calculated fields on forms can t be used for sorting filtering and can be annoying in how slowly they display in some situations

307899
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
but in general don t put calculations in a recordsource that you re not going to operate on as a grouping filtering sorting grouping

308016
mvp	presenter
however there are variants like mvp where the user is input is received by the view first and then pushed synched with the presenter

308156
config	ini
to allow bigger sizes i have added necessary php ini values in the apache config file to override the actual php ini values

308175
children	parent
i ve positioned my css so that the tooltip appears away from the parent div but regardless the actions should be triggering only on the parent and not any of its children

308175
children	parent
i want my hover out state on my parent element to trigger a function an animation on the children of that parent without the hover out states of the children doing anything

308175
children	parent
it seems that the normal method of onmouseover and onmouseout is triggering even for the children of the parent that the method belongs to which is causing some rather undesirable effects

308202
profiling	debugging
you can also debugging run code coverage use some of the more popular profiling with it etc

308221
dbml	edmx
i just added a ddl generation feature to huagati dbml edmx tools ver 1.47 released today

308238
post	get
so i assume any or most of pathing characters that you cant use on your filesystem will fail on iis request get post

308246
int	chars
as said here switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data types

308246
int	chars
it also works with enumerated types and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types chars byte short and int

308261
versioning	upgrade
edit i ve successfully tested an upgrade to sql2008 32-bit i m mostly concerned with any differences in the 64-bit versioning as i don t have a 64 bit server i can test on at the moment i know you can t restore a sql2000 master database to 2008

308383
int	boolean
once a block has been used for a given type int bit-field or boolean bit-field the compiler does not allocate any further bit fields of a different type until the next boundary

308389
int	boolean
if you grouped the boolean and int you would get a very different result

308441
equals	gethashcode
this doesn t override gethashcode or equals because you re not actually using those as it s in a value position

308450
vim	emacs
note i know i should be using emacs or vim but the issue is my theory at least that i m left handed so i use my right side design creativity of the brain more than the left side logic memory so i just simply cannot use emacs or vim my brain simply isn t compatible i tried them many times too even used emacs for a few months but it drove me crazy.

308511
folder	directory
i have a .net 1.1 web application sitting in a folder called c inetpub wwwroot mytestapp where mytestapp is a virtual directory and is configured to be on asp.net version 1.1.4322 in iis 5.1

308511
folder	directory
in the root directory c inetpub wwwroot there is a web.config file for a .net2.0 application because the root folder contains some web pages written in .net2.0

308537
versioning	upgrade
try latest maven versioning usually upgrade to newer versioning solve issues

308597
public	protected
then comes public data members if any remember encapsulation is a good idea followed by any protected and or private methods and data members

308617
public	protected
i used to do things backwards to this with private then protected then public

308617
public	protected
i never use multiple public protected private sections - too confusing to follow in my opinion

308618
hash	md5
use some kind of one way hash function md5 sha1 ... and keep only password hash

308629
int	chars
you can use switch only for basic datatypes int chars etc.

308632
int	chars
switch needs an integral type like int chars ...

308637
strsplit	substr
you could read a bigger chunk at a time unencode it to a string using encoder.getstring and then split into lines using strsplit r n or even picking out the head of the string using substr 0 string.indexof r n and leaving the rest for processing of the next line

308659
google-chrome	firefox
testing in firefox ie google-chrome on an xp machine

308660
public	protected
i usually define first the interface to be read that is public then protected then private stuff

308677
hash	md5
it is hard to understand the exact scheme you are thinking about but i assume the password is coming in from a request and you want to calculate the md5 hash in a jsp that the request is being sent to

308677
hash	md5
you could even be more secure if it isn t being done with https and use a javascript md5 library to hash the password before submitting it

308720
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
a good solution is to use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

308720
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the major difference between mouseenter mouseleave events and mouseover mouseout events is that the former don t bubble

308720
mouseleave	mouseenter
in this example the child paragraph of div#image still receive the mouseenter mouseleave events even if you aren t listening for them but the events won t bubble up to their parent element

308734
accessor	properties
within the public interface it s convenient to group constructors properties accessor and mutators and operators in distinct groups

308749
ord	chr
in many languages there s a pair of functions chr and ord which convert between numbers and character values

308753
public	protected
i find that most of the time public protected private is the most useful to consumers of your class

308847
hide	show
it would be easier to show hide the third dropdown rather than adding it dynamically

308889
public	protected
in addition any methods which a subclass could conceivably want to override which might mean all public methods plus potentially some protected ones used internally must be virtual

308901
postgresql	mysql
ea supports oracle mysql sql server multiple versions postgresql interbase db2 and access in one fell swoop

308931
put	get
i get an error becasue it is looking for a virtual path which i don t have as all i want to do it precompile the files i am not interested in publishing the site if i put a dummy path in i get another error correctly about it not being an application under iis

308961
ubuntu	debian
you can use the special package checkinstall for all packages which are not even in debian ubuntu yet

308971
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you can configure to the ability to select multiple values which are rendered as a dropdownlistfor of checkbox

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
generally the user and the security context where the user interacts are different things and therefore if modelled in a generic way these should be separated as the iprincipal and iidentity interfacese do

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
and finally you should also consider whether you want to implelement the iidentity iprincipal with your own user class or just populate a genericprincipal genericidentity instances

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
the most important fact here is that iprincipal and iidentity instances must be serializable as they might go to other appdomains

308995
hide	show
use different views that show or hide specific columns and grant access to those views to different users roles

309101
put	get
i know .useaccessibleheaders makes it put instead of but i cant get the to appear

309105
realloc	malloc
also malloc and realloc are useful if you don t know ahead of time how many strings are being concatenated

309115
post	get
i managed to get an array with the ids of the elements that were selected and now i want to post that

309135
komodo	notepad++
i m using notepad++ for python development and few days ago i found out about free komodo edit

309150
portrait	landscape
this should keep the image rotated along with the page portrait landscape

309191
ubuntu	debian
however this is not a built in command but for debian based distros like ubuntu you can simply install it with

309225

it can add int floats double decimals binarys hexadecimals regardless of whether they are signed unsogned how many bits they are etc.

309261
post	get
pass this parameter via either get or post to your second php script

309263
unsigned	short
in languages that have signed and unsigned types or a slew of similar types short int long or int8 int16 in32 then prefixes are useful despite what anybody else has or will say and they will you know it

309277
debian-based	ubuntu
installation was not a problem in ubuntu and any debian-based distro i suppose

309354
post	get

if jsmooth isn t working for you then i would go for launch4j

309507
np-hard	np-complete
a problem is np-hard if and only if it s at least as hard as an np-complete problem

309507
np-hard	np-complete
the more conventional traveling salesman problem of finding the shortest route is np-hard not strictly np-complete

309512
fseek	ftell
i m not sure you can fseek ftell pipe streams like this

309615
centos	linux
i m running a shared centos linux host at liquidweb

309639
serializable	deserialization
the following questions are about xml serializable deserialization and schema validation for a .net library of types which are to be used for data exchange

309647
hide	show
then size your window accordingly and or show and hide scrollbars so they re only show when absolutely necessary

309670
getter	setter
synchronizing your setter and getter here would only have the intended purpose of guaranteeing that multiple threads couldn t read variables between each others increment operations

309674
firefox	safari
it to work in ie 6 7 8 firefox and safari

309703
button	checkbox
radio button and checkbox are still input tags and will be in the inputs var

309703
button	checkbox
the problem is you ll need to add handlers for the checked state to see which radio button and checkbox are selected

309703
button	checkbox
even worse you can have more than one radio button and checkbox with the same name.

309715
hide	show
use css to hide and show inner submenus

309783
folder	directory
use 7-zip to extract it to a folder directory outside your windows python installation folder

309852
dictionary	map
the other is a dictionary map indexing the objects by an ordinal ordering integer

309867
fgetc	fread	fgets	fread	fgets	fgetc
in a loop you can read using from the stream into a temporary variable or buffer using fread fgets or fgetc as zarawesome s answer demonstrates then process that buffer or append it to a c++ string

309960
spaces	linefeed
adding s demands a special char at the end like a spaces linefeed etc.

310108
g++	gcc
but neither gcc nor g++ does even with all the warnings options i could think of -pedantic -wall -wextra

310108
g++	gcc
edit i just found that gcc -wconversion does the trick but the same option to g++ doesn t and i m really using c++ here so i need a solution for g++ and am now wondering why -wconversion doesn t seem to be it

310175
kate	kdevelop
it s used in program like kate kdevelop

310183
stdout	stderr
you won t see stdout or stderr

310306
mouse	keyboard
for example by default a program should only receive keyboard or mouse input when it is in focus

310338
komodo	notepad++
i have worked a bit with python programming for google app engine which i started out in notepad++ and then recently shifted over to komodo using two excellent startup tutorials - both of which are conveniently linked from this blog post direct here and here

310346
post	get
use linkbutton.postbackurl to set a different page to post to and some client script to get a new window and the old target restored so that future postbacks work normally

310464
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
you then write your own routine to add subtract multiplying and divide your byte arrays

310524
nswindow	nspanel
you should probably be using actual nswindow objects here instead of nspanel objects but since i don t know much about how your application works you ll have to look into that yourself

310529
subclass	abstract-class
a bit unusual but if you had some other subclass of the base class and the subclasses of the abstract-class had enough common stuff to justify the existance of the abstract-class like

310629
ostream	istream	std	ostream
in c++ i could do this by simply making my class methods use std istream and std ostream which could be a file a stringstream the console whatever

310632
rss	feed
- the goal again is the convert html to xml specifically descriptions for rss feed

310641

check if the same thing happens in google-chrome if you have access to a windows box to see if it s a webkit issue or safari itself

310699
ant	emma
i m using emma in my ant build to perform coverage reporting

310715
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i am an ibm websphere consultant - although i am not contributing here in an official capacity

310744
versioning	upgrade
i only stopped using it when my versioning got old enough that the upgrade cost was significant

310792
decoder	encoder
you could construct a test using an encoder and a decoder to re-encode a few different mp3 files a few times and watch how they change this could help you determine the rate of deterioration and figure out if it is acceptable to you

310823
post	get
first of all you can t trust the browser so any talk about using post rather than get is mostly nerd flim-flam

310866
width	height
the best advice is perhaps to take a cue from the publishing world where this is a common practice for applications that display large amounts of high resolution graphics such as adobe indesign and keep track of exact measurements for controls - the x y coordinate positions and height width

310913
vb.net	vb6
as you may have discovered vb6 does not have a ctype function like vb.net does

310913
vb.net	vb6
however the other conversion functions those that have names beginning with c which you may have encountered in vb.net code such as cint and cstr do exist in vb6 and you can use them to convert to and from non-object types

310913
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that vb6 unlike vb.net does not support inheritance

311000
firefox	safari
there are some problems with this widget left right arrow keys and home end keys are not working in firefox i am using a mac and none of any keys are working if i load the example page in safari

311080
postgresql	mysql
i recently switched a project from mysql innodb to postgresql and i feel bigger lags when inserting and updating data with ajax

311093
postgresql	mysql
measure transactions per second or even better requests per second with a web server stress tool like the grinder which can be scripted in jython with both mysql backend and postgresql and afterwards see if that makes a difference

311148
cart	oscommerce
i have this in zen cart and probably oscommerce as well in the orders table and wondered why they went that way even more as they have an addresses table

311273
cvs	svn
mercurial seems to have the best gui tools for windows at the moment but cvs or svn gui tools seem to be better i hope this would change in the future

311279
folder	directory
create in your home directory .m2 folder on windows linux and mac and all os es

311307
firefox	safari
is there an alternative to history.go -1 for firefox and safari

311317
folder	directory
i don t know where n x stores yours perhaps in a hidden folder in your root directory

311344
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing can be a new table with all the same columns as the superclass repeated

311344
superclass	subclassing
this works well when you have an abstract superclass or subclassing features that override the superclass

311344
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing can be just the unique columns with a join to the superclass table

311347
width	height
also when defining an image i recommend you also specify the width height in decipoints this should help with the scaling of the image r3a on the page so add this just after your resolution command should be an okay place for it

311448
spweb	splist	spweb	spsite	splist	spsite
you really need to look at the object model available in c# you will need to get an spsite instance for a sitecollection and then iterate over the splist instances that belong to the spsite and the spweb objects

311448
versioning	upgrade
you should never go to the database directly as sharepoint isn t designed for that at all and there is no guarantee actually there s a specific warning that the structure of the database will be the same between versioning and upgrade and additionally when content is spread over several content databases in a farm there is no guarantee that a query that runs on one content database will do what you expect on another content database

311448
spweb	spsite
when you look at the object model for iteration also note that you will need to dispose the spsite and spweb objects that you create

311477
csv	tsv
ps. i looked at the source code of your message it looks like an odd mix of tsv tabs and csv coma

311504
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari pages that are centered move a few pixels when the page is long enough for the scrollbar to appear

311508
spaces	delimiter
i would use similar formatting as your first example but without the redundant spaces delimiter before and after the parenthesis delimiter

311535
many-to-many	one-to-many
this is more of a one-to-many communication than many-to-many but could potentially be approximated by having the master device act like a network switch

311560
mef	prism
the prism or mef sample apps which include some wpf examples should give you an idea of what is posssible

311574
range	minimum
if your 100 numbers are in a relatively small range you can optimize even further by keeping the minimum and maximum around

311589
submit	submission
however it is generally better to attach the event to the submit event of the form itself as it will trigger even when submission by pressing the enter key from one of the fields

311609
perl	tcl
any of the scripting languages perl python tcl tk etc. have good mature and easy to use email handler libraries in fact you can get this sort of thing for most lanaguages so it should be quite straightforward to write the handler in one of those

311673
serializable	deserialization
this exposes methods for serializable and deserialization so you can fill the private members of complextype in these methods

311685
put	get
take the currently authenticated user s user id and just put it in there instead of passing in another iuser to get the id of

311733
ninject	spring.net
consider using techniques like dependency injection see structuremap spring.net ninject to simplify instantiation if a simple factory doesn t give you the flexibility you need

311740
xslt	xquery
saxonsa xslt and xquery processor â by michael kay

311774
inherited	properties
and finnaly the fontsize binding uses this converter applied to the inherited fontsize properties

311805
folder	directory
i am writing a test program to copy some file in application data folder on device to release directory on desktop

311811
postgresql	mysql
admitting firstly that i generally don t like mysql i will say that there has been writing on this topic regarding postgresql

311836
for-loop	loops
loops from the shell prompt for-loop - to do repetitive actions

311847
valgrind	callgrind
hopefully the callgrind or cachegrind tools for valgrind will give you the information you seek

311869
folder	directory
tmp x.sh and tmp x.x are worn bare in the directory folder

311869
comm	grep
my hammers tend to lean towards ls find sort sed vi awk grep and comm

311896
lisp	scheme
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

311909
postgresql	mysql
it is a core data-like framework in fact it can import core data models but works with postgresql though not mysql as far as i know

311932
subtract	add
just a sequence of bytes which when run causes the processor to add subtract compare goto read memory write memory that sort of thing

312092
int	double
def _numbergroups num long factor int list double int factor match

312110
integer	unsigned
as far as i can tell it is actually a bug in solaris s libc where they use an 8-bit unsigned integer type to store the fd in the file struct

312166
post	get
this is what i have came up with so far - to get the ids of all post then retrieve the actual items for the first x number of ids

312168
public	protected
so i guess there is one more field visibility other than private protected package protected and public

312219
put	get
if you really think that creating those collections is expensive then instead of creating new ones all the time put the unused ones into a list and reuse them when new keys get added to your hashmap

312231
put	get
don t get me wrong it s not that easy if you want to learn programming you need to put a lot of effort into it but in my own experience rails can bring you some instant results while letting you get deeper and deeper over time

312244
subtract	addition
i m after an addition or fix to get winw and winh to the correct size of the scrollbar for each browser only if those browsers don t subtract the scrollbar from document.body.offsetwidth automatically

312246
postgresql	mysql
i don t know how other db servers do it but i do know that you can use utf-8 in varchar and text fields in at least mysql and postgresql

312283
versioning	upgrade
tapestry has done a lot of non-compatible upgrade with no continuation of support of older versioning

312301
ostream	istream
istream and ostream interfaces to streaming data files sockets etc.

312301
ostream	ostringstream
ostringstream an ostream that saves the content written to it as a string

312308
factors	mean
by grow shrink factors i mean how many elements you add or remove when you grow or shrink

312308
multiplying	add
these are naturally power-of-two values or multiples as you can just add or multiplying by an easy number + 4096 2

312308
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
for the stack you can use a linked list a linked list with buckets an alloc d array using malloc realloc free std vector or other linear structures

312377
post	get
i get a sneaking suspicion from your post that you re having trouble mapping your texture across triangle points to make it show up straight

312377
width	height
e.g. gltexcoord2f specifies the point 0.0-1.0 within the texture in terms of the percentage of width and height of the texture that maps to the next drawn vertex

312377
width	height
with triangle fans you can have some mathematical conniptions to figure out what of width and height of the overall object you are specifying with the vertex

312417
versioning	upgrade
if the os changes and a new versioning of the library is needed to work with it properly you have to provide an upgrade versioning of your binary

312430
versioning	upgrade
if you are only to minor versioning behind there probably isn t much reason to upgrade

312468
opera	safari
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari

312477
try-catch	exception-handling
at exception-handling handling every method body should be at least in a try-catch block at least with a general exception-handling catch at the end

312490
vbscript	jscript
anyone have a script jscript vbscript or similar in the spirit of this handy script but adding the msiuserealadmindetection property

312636
hash	salt
if you need want to store plaintext values in the client side cookie but don t want the user to be able to futz with the values just store a hash of that value in a companion cookie and salt the hash with some value unknown to the user

312636
hash	salt
then you just need to compute the salt hash of the plaintext value received from the client cookie and compare it against the hash value also passed from the client cookie

312642
cpd	jdepend	checkstyle	jdepend	checkstyle	cpd
i have a bunch of reports from quality tools checkstyle jdepend cpd pmd ncss that give me more vision about code redundancy classes usage bugs etc

312668
borderless	panel
if you want to make it look like one control perhaps to make it look like an address label or something you can use borderless textboxes and put the labels and textboxes all within a panel that has a border and a systemcolors.window background

312681
pascal	delphi
you need a bit of understanding in either pascal or delphi but this overview from thinkquest is pretty helpful from a programming stand-point

312777
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
i am using a sqlcommandbuilder object to generate update statements from select statements in a sqldataadapter

312785
getter	setter
the only methods that the class had were getter setter

312795
getter	setter
in fact one would argue that beans and entity beans are essentially that - data containers with getter and setter

312795
getter	setter
i have seen certain sources the book clean code arguing that one should avoid methods with multiple parameters and instead pass them as a single object with getter and setter

312800
getter	setter
note that in this case you probably shouldn t use getter setter just make the data public

312837
innodb	myisam
frequently-updated tables may show performance improvement by moving them to innodb where they can benefit from row-level locking as opposed to myisam s table-level locking

312859
width	height
my problem is specifically accessing the downloaded image height and width attributes in order to pass the correct parameters to the scale method

312863
getter	setter
a passive struct-like java bean all getter and setter may represent a real-world thing

312865
int	chars
from what i ve seen going from int + some block of text to a chars is problematic because converting it to the requisite end data type lpcwstr is more difficult than a straight casting

312894
for-loop	arrays
run that code in for-loop each time assign a different variable place in an arrays perhaps or property of an object to your newly loaded e.target.content so you can access it outside of that oncomplete -type function

312943
minimum	max
when it does hit the max and you didn t finish the job reset the progress bar value back to minimum

312967
mouseover	mouseout
i am trying to fade in a on mouseover and fade out on mouseout

312972
ostream	istream
i would make it so i would have methods in the class like tostream ostream os and fromstream istream then define

312975
mouseover	mouseout
two key differences i use the jquery hover event to associate mouseover and mouseout event handlers such that child elements won t result in confusing behavior and i use the stop function to prevent animations from overlapping and canceling each other out

312983
memcached	apc
i am now using memcached for storing user data and apc only for code

312993
getdate	dateadd
with the following you should be able to use mssql syntax and get the same results as mssql such as select datediff dd getdate dateadd dd 5 getdate from dual

313046
width	height
it then manipulates the width and height of these linked windows and it finally undocks them all from the linked window frame

313054
superclass	subclassing
even if animal was not supposed to be abstract i still have the problem that for some reason since the foreignkey is defined on animal and not one of its subclassing the superclass method is being called instead of the subclassing

313054
superclass	subclassing
while experimenting with this i discovered that when django saves a subclassing model it does two things 1 it creates a row for the subclassing object in the superclass s table and 2 it makes the pk in the subclassing table identical to the pk assigned in the superclass table

313054
superclass	subclassing
cat and dog will have disjoint pk sets and any subclassing of animal will have a pk identical to the record of its superclass but unfortunately django does not perform any work behind the scenes a la i m an animal

313082
cvs	svn
svn and cvs are two very different systems that aim to address the same basic issue - source control

313082
cvs	svn
the context of this is i m building a web-based service that will involve source control hosting and i want to support both svn and cvs so as to serve the largest amount of developers possible

313112
filesystems	fat
there are a number of open source fat filesystems implementations around

313130
cpu	processors
gpu s specialized cpu s on graphics cards for example may contain hundreds of cores stream processors which operate in parallel to render the pixels on your screen

313175
width	height
you can use width and height on a div

313204
vsto	add-in
now the problem is that access add-in are not supported in vsto afaik

313214
post	get
you should have get and post

313239
rss	feed
although probably not a true mashup i created a script hat would read the apple movie trailer rss feed and then visit the links in the feed to download the html of the pages linked to in the rss feed

313239
rss	feed
so while all the information was coming from apple the script would download multiple things from different parts of their site to piece together a final rss feed that would contain links to .mov files that actually contained the movie trailer

313307
keydown	keyup
also you re code will be more readable if you use the keydown event instead of the keyup event

313322
expression-blend	silverlight
if you are planning to create applications that will take advantage of silverlight s multimedia capabilities you might want to play around with expression-blend first and then study .net

313336
margin	height
as was mentioned if you re trying to reduce the vertical height of an inline element top or bottom margin padding won t do anything

313386
ssl	https
https is just http over ssl

313387
ssl	https
https is just http used over ssl

313388
ssl	https
ssl and https are used for encrypted secure network communications

313395
width	height
which leaks into 0 width height issues

313407
cvs	svn
viewvc lets you browse svn and cvs repositories

313410
firefox	safari
it works totally fine in safari firefox mac and pc and ie6 but for some reason it s not working in ie7

313423
ssl	https
https http over ssl

313423
ssl	https
https is where the http protocol is run over ssl rather than directly over tcp and therefore the data exchanged is encrypted

313457
awt	swing
for example swing awt will typically be slower than something written directly for the native os

313458
swt	swing
see for example swt which are the graphical tools built by ibm i think meant to replace swing and give both native performance and look-and-feel

313465
free	malloc
the malloc free approach deals with blocks of memory one at a time whereas the garbage collection approach tends to deal with memory management in large batches yielding more opportunities for optimization at the cost of some loss in predictability

313490
svg	vml
it is cross-browser svg vml canvas silverlight and it looks like it fits the bill

313512
jobs	cron
the scheduler provides a calendar for scheduling the execution of jobs similar to cron or you could develop your own

313523
np-hard	np-complete
note that np-complete problems are also np-hard

313543
awt	swing
is it possible to build the user interface in java using java s swing and awt libraries that operates an application primarily written in c#

313569
ssl	https
relation b w ssl and https https is secure http communication based on ssl protocol http over ssl as they say

313596
strstr	strcpy
strcpy works fine as long as its input string starts at a character boundary for instance the return value of strstr

313598
int	double
besides this method s argument is int while i need double

313631
decoder	encoder
json encoder decoder

313737
mouse	keyboard
or is it possible to know if a click event was fired by the mouse or by the keyboard

313747
getter	setter
we use properties instead of getter and setter for the most part - which fits in well with c# 3 s object initializers

313758
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
ok html.actionlink in asp.net asp.net-mvc creates anchor tags a aka links

313758
width	height
another option would be to change the display style to inline-block which would allow you to set an explicit height and width

313848
spaces	delimiter
i have a spaces delimiter list of files names where spaces in the file names are prefixed by

313860
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if for any reason log4net throws an uncaught exception except for argumentexception and argumentnullexception which may be thrown please send an email to the log4net-user logging.apache.org mailing list

313978
public	protected
first of all you should use public protected or private instead of var

313981
ironruby	ironpython
i welcome the addition of ironpython and ironruby which as i understand it will become first class .net languages with the next release of visual studio

314128
getter	setter
code generators like in java for getter and setter

314137
nant	xmlpoke
longer version no however if you use something like nant to do you build you could use xmlpoke or similar to rewrite parts of the file on build

314159
int	boolean
if you use the datainputstream and dataoutputstream classes you ll be able to read write strings boolean int etc

314176
unsigned	short
a cancer ct picture is stored inside a unsigned short array 1-dimensional

314176
unsigned	short
i have the location information of the cancer region inside the picture but the coordinates x y are in superpixel 128x128 unsigned short

314176
unsigned	short
i already solved this one by converting superpixel coordinates into a offset a can use for the unsigned short array

314325
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to the latest versioning

314348
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade my current versioning of dnn this week

314382
portrait	landscape
this second view controller simply displays a uiimageview and the user can change the screen orientation on this view controller between portrait landscape modes

314419
inherited	properties
the inherited objects exposed the same properties of the poco it is inheriting from so while inside the persistence ignorance layer i could use attributes to map to the objects

314426
int	boolean
there are string int and boolean properties in my object

314499
int	chars
see the table here . you are just casting from the int value of the chars to the chars value - but that only works for ascii chars not different languages etc

314499
int	chars
this casts the a chars to it s int value and then increments based on this so it s not hardcoded

314517
vb.net	vb6
using vb6 after using vb.net 2008 ide shows the age of vb6 really quick

314546
disk	ram
maybe your machine is running out of ram you are using an network drive or your hard disk is encrypted

314608
disk	ram
by writing to the db you allow the rdbms to decide when disk io should happen - if you have enough ram for instance it may be effectively caching all those inserts in memory writing them to disk when there s a lighter load or on some other scheduling mechanism

314675
stdout	stderr
update joshua s answer is spot-on but i also wanted to save and restore stdout and stderr around the entire script which is done like this

314678
stdout	stderr
append both stdout and stderr to file

314706
addition	multiplication
there is no logical reason to want to perform math addition multiplication on a phone number

314721
filesystems	ntfs
you can make sparse files on ntfs as well as on any real filesystems

314869
put	get
of course you now need to have a main site where people log in that then redirects you to the appropriate site here i ve just put it as site1.com site2.com but you get the idea.

314903
accessor	properties
the papercheque properties accessor are as normal not shown

314905
charindex	substr
you can proceed similarly to get the second one and so on by combining substr and charindex one layer deeper each time

314931
free	malloc
our app does use both malloc free and new delete as appropriate

314931
free	malloc
one of our team wondered if -lmcheck was in fact thread safe and put a mutex around all malloc free calls

315068
int	chars
note for the api of your dll try keeping the data types limited to primitives long int chars etc. to prevent module boundary issues

315110
cpython	ironpython
i decided that i should write as much of the code as possible in python and django and target all the platforms cpython jython and ironpython

315113
stdout	stderr
you are right that you can preserve the original stdout and stderr with the redirections you showed but it is usually simpler for the people who have to maintain the script later to understand what s going on if you scope the redirected code as shown above

315178
gridview	objectdatasource
i m still learning about the gridview control and i have one bound to an objectdatasource

315186
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
it will override equals gethashcode and tostring

315237
getter	setter
so i m using a getter and a setter

315307
getter	setter
so you can use this in the property getter and setter

315382
goto	break
unconditional branches show up in infinite loops function calls function returns break and continue statements the infamous goto statement and many more these lists are far from exhaustive

315382
min	max
there are some cool bit-twiddling tricks you can do to compute things such as abs min and max without branching

315407
cos	sin
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos

315429
boost	stl
example stl boost vs rolling your own containers and algos

315439
addition	multiplication
how fast addition is to multiplication how fast a vector is compared to a normal array or to the higher scales how certain algorithms compare

315447
getter	setter
the point is to provide getter and setter for those things that need to be in the objects contract

315495
button	checkbox
when i click the parse checkbox button to validate the sql statement it says command s completed successfully

315541
folder	directory
unless your users are going to an open folder with a directory listing of your images i don t think folder structure will significantly increase or decrease retrieval speeds for your users

315561
windows	wow64
it is called wow64 windows on windows 64

315569
jdom	xerces
other alternatives such as xerces xmlserializer or jdom xmloutputter are more direct methods less code but they are framework-specific

315608
mouseup	mousedown
when creating a shape mousedown move mouseup this is handle by the board and it knows about his own snap flag

315626
dependencyobject	uielement
i agree with richard that it depends on the purpose of your class but as a note it seems that you can inherit from dependencyobject directly in silverlight 2.0 release without having to inherit from uielement or usercontrol

315668
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
you can wrap for example a fileinputstream in a gzipinputstream and use it in the same way you d use any inputstream

315668
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
note that the gzipinputstream has its own internal buffer so wrapping the fileinputstream in a bufferedinputstream would probably decrease performance.

315670
daemon	cron
it runs in your rails process or via cron so there are no daemon processes to monitor

315695
cpython	ironpython
at resolver systems we re working on a project called ironclad which will eventually hopefully allow you to use cpython extensions like matplotlib and numpy transparently from ironpython

315698
width	height
but thats what objecthandles do react to events update height width rotation parameter of the shape

315727
yacc	bison	yacc	jflex	bison	jflex
read the introductions to using tools like yacc lex bison or my personal favorite jflex

315744
next	except
if i put the same handle on outlooks onsend event instead of on the itemadd for the sent items folder all works just the same except after the windows form is loaded the first time it will continue to be loaded ie the event fires and is handled perfectly the next time you want it to

315759
width	margin
the resulting margin width is the maximum of the adjoining margin widths

315912
post	put
the odd thing is though if i put an alert after the serialized post it works as expected

315939
codeigniter	cakephp
if your developers are most experienced in php try one of the php frameworks that mimics the architecture of rails -- cakephp or codeigniter

316055
cvs	svn
for someone coming from cvs or svn this is a change since the commit to the central repository now requires two steps

316123
filesystems	ntfs
the filestream feature of sql server 2008 allows storage of and efficient access to blob data using a combination of sql server 2008 and the ntfs filesystems

316164
versioning	upgrade
fldershare is now owned by microsoft and is due to be replaced in december by windows live sync which is essentially an upgrade versioning of foldershare

316193
inherited	properties
i have customform inherited from form which implements a boolean properties named prop

316236
profiling	instrumentation
i have tried profiling my app using the object allocation instrumentation and i can t see any practical difference though i have only tried in the simulator and not on an iphone itself

316285
rss	feed
that was of course until i saw a thing or two in the rss feed for so here

316533
serializable	deserialization
so there is some place for wcf framework related exceptions until then serializable deserialization comes to mind

316536
accessor	properties
you might skip over writing tests for properties accessor but anything that requires any calculations you should write a test first

316536
sin	sqrt
now while that s not all that great you know that your add method will be rock-solid for when you start creating complex math functions that combine your sin method with your sqrt method along with your add method

316604
bufferedreader	printwriter
here s an example using a java program - with bufferedreader printwriter

316604
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
you can also use a bufferedreader and bufferedwriter

int	double
ieee double precision actually can represent all int exactly in the range -2 53 through +2 53

316797
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication

316880
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
and by the way always code by the standards and test in firefox opera or safari first test later in ie

316962
integer	fractions
of course it goes without saying that the currency amounts and potentially even vat rates with a fractions part should be stored as a multiplied integer to avoid binary fractions representation rounding errors creeping in too

316972
post	get
here is a blog post discussing how to get around this and be able to test your code without hitting the database when using entity framework

317015
free	malloc
if this hits malloc s control structures free will freak out once it accesses them and tries to do weird things based on the corrupted structure

317015
free	malloc
if you d really only overwrite object memory with silly stuff there s no way malloc free would know

317022
scons	automake
and scons automake is a pain in .

if you are using firefox or safari and you are on windows vista then you should disable ip version 6 since this messes with vista in combination with webdev and firefox safari.

317223
httphandler	httpmodule
other times you have to use httpmodule or httphandler look here

317237

317256
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up or javascript pop-up

317363
portrait	landscape
i have looked into this before and the only way to force things like portrait landscape etc is to get the user to install an activex control or similar

for both you need a keystore such as jks and a certificate

317418
flac	ogg
ogg and flac are quite good and relatively well supported

317425
coalesce	isnull
you can also use isnull or coalesce function

317425
coalesce	isnull
isnull and coalesce work more or less the same way they return the first non-null argument in the list except isnull only allows 2 arguments and coalesce can take any number.

317436
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
is your view being displayed set a breakpoint in your viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods

317474
mouseover	mouseenter
or if the choice of mouseover vs mouseenter etc matters

317474
mouseleave	mouseenter
according to quirksmode.org mouseenter and mouseleave are ie-specific events but as jimmy pointed out in the comments jquery implements them for other browsers as well

317512
r5rs	r6rs
it s help menu includes both drscheme-specific documentation as well as various scheme specifications r5rs and r6rs

317588
daemons	systemd
to my knowledge dropbox and the like uses a windows service or a daemons on the linux mac side to monitor the file systemd

317589
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
debian ubuntu are good distros for servers with the right packages installed and centos is great too

317640
folder	directory
additionally one would expect a decent host to provide a directory that is not accessible via the web - ours offer a private and a web folder both accessible via ftp but only the contents of the latter via the web

317690
hash	salt
if you implement your own user list with usernames and passwords you might consider only saving the hash getpasswordhash username givenpassword salt and comparing against the saved hash

317720
ienumerable	ilist
the only way to achieve this is by casting it to ienumerable or ilist and then call the count method

317752
stdout	stderr
your second line using 2 1 redirects stderr to stdout and finally stdout into log.txt

317764

317888
bazaar	git
etckeeper is a collection of tools to let etc be stored in a git mercurial darcs or bazaar repository

317906
hash	md5
you can use an md5 hash to provide a fixed-length virtually unique value computed from the lengthy url data and then use that hash as the primary key

317906
hash	md5
if you log 1 million distinct url s per day for 2 000 years the md5 hash of these url s are still less likely to include a collision than your hard disk is to have an uncorrectable bit error

317950
put	get
to get functionality similar to what i was used to i needed to put in the revision that created the branch-head

317984
hash	salt
i d recommend going with the classic salt hash method

317986
hash	salt
this improves security vastly because now your users don t use 5 letter passwords anymore they use 5+len salt size passwords and if the salt is big enough no rainbow database will ever contain your hash

317990
hash	salt
by computing a hash from a visitor-supplied string plus some salt of course i can tell whether the user provided the same password twice without the security risk of allowing my application to be able to decrypt the provided password possibly maliciously

317990
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

317992
hash	salt
i think a salt hash with a proper hash function like sha-256 is the best

318010
hash	salt
also keep with the suggestion of using a salt value whether you hash or encrypt

318021
doc	rtf
this was accomplished by saving the word doc as rtf word s save as html output was much too dirty and converting the rtf to html via a perl script

318027
mouse	keyboard
the mouse and keyboard inputs from the

318044
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
you should always hash the password with a salt md5 is popular but there are superior hashing such as sha and sha-256

318158
opera	firefox
i am able to do it in opera firefox but the code doesn t work in internet explorer

318186
vimeo	flickr
unfortunately it looks like the recently released adobe flash player 10 broke every single free open uploading flash component out there and then some other sites which have their own proprietary versions as well but some other sites such as flickr and vimeo seem to work just fine

318266
int	chars	atoi	strcmp
atoi to convert chars to int will let you test the range of each number and some strcmp s between the . s

i need to start with the first row add the debits subtract the credits and store the value a

318312
width	height
start off by determining the closest power of two that is larger for each of the image dimensions width and height and creating a texture of that size

318339
children	parent
basically what we are doing is delegating the responsibility to the child class instead of having the parent decide what to do with children

318363
sml	prolog	lisp	sml	lisp	prolog
try implementing mergesort in oz sml prolog or lisp

318367
implements	extends
as a workaround you could define another interface foobar that extends foo and bar and have your class implements that

318425
interpreted-language	compiled-language
a compiled-language is always going to require a bigger initial overhead than an interpreted-language

318480
pascal	delphi
i haven t used delphi or kylix but back in the ms-dos days a turbo pascal program would compile almost instantaneously while the equivalent turbo c++ program would just crawl

318550
typedef	struct
note the typedef struct .

318551
put	get
if i put all my functions in the same file as the main it works fine but when i try to split the functions out in different files i cannot get it to compile

318567
int	chars
in the profile i have strings chars for m or f and int

318617
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i used to use sharpziplib until i switched to dotnetzip you may want to check it out as an alternative

318624
gif	png
i would prefer you use one of image png image jpeg or image gif as i can t find the popular image x-icon

318630
opera	firefox
following works with firefox 3 ie7 and opera 9

318630
google-chrome	safari

318639
getter	setter
we will be using getter setter methods

318639
getter	setter
note setter and getter are treated like properties

that second step is something that again programs like yacc and bison and their more modern variants can happily generate code to do

318783
wtl	atl
i have a c++ application using wtl atl begin_msg_map_ex macros for message handling

318796
google-chrome	safari
the root problem is that webkit browsers safari and google-chrome load javascript and css information in parallel

318796
width	height
as far as width and height goes.

318829
jsf	seam
but if you are asking about using jsf managed beans with a jpa framework have a look at seam

318853
ati	nvidia
nvidia s cuda and ati s cal are roughly equivalent in features

318853
ati	nvidia
cuda only works on nvidia gpus and cal only works on ati gpus

318880
mp3	wav
i have a table with a binary column which stores files of a number of different possible filetypes pdf bmp jpeg wav mp3 doc mpeg avi etc. but no columns that store either the name or the type of the original file

318882
ant	maven
it would be worth considering if you were planning to migrate to maven and use additional maven features as well but it s a bit much if all you d use it for is to spin off ant

318988
min	max
you may need to add explicit type casts. max and min appear to work across rows rather than columns

319028
fgets	getchar
the examples of dynamically-growing a buffer can be made to work with either getchar or fgets

319053
width	height
the height and width components of the nssize parameter specify the vertical and horizontal padding amount respectively

319057
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works using position fixed and centering the div in the intuitive way

319094
cassini	iis
apparently iis handles this but cassini doesn t

319127
children	parent
all you need to do is to iterate through all item of the list once and add the current item to its parent s children list

319155
google-chrome	firefox
it works nice and fast in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it is incredibly slow whenever i drop an element

319187
processors	hyperthreading
processors pentium 4 3ghz hyperthreading

319187
centos	linux
os linux - centos 5 +32 bit

319187
centos	linux
os linux - centos 5.2

319189
multiplying	add
i would then take the camera s quaternion and multiplying it by the one we generated for the input and in theory that should simply add the input rotation to the current state of the camera s rotation and things would be all fat and happy

319197
onmouseover	onclick
however if i attempt to change the onmouseover to onclick ve picks up onclick and disables the infobox entirely

319245
kerberos	ntlm
one way i found to test in code that you are using kerberos is that that the http_authorization header for ntlm always starts with the following

319264
hide	show
s with some sort of reference to the element and event that should trigger it to show or hide

319265
accessor	properties
normally the properties would just be foo and the object should have an accessor called isfoo or getfoo

319290
hide	show
i then had a check list of request types at the top of the form which show hide the id element when you checked the item show hide function not show

319311
stdout	stderr
if you need to read from both stdout and stderr it gets tricky with a naã ve implementation there is a risk of deadlock due to buffering etc .

319321
width	height
while the width is not limited as other answers show i ve always found it strange that one can drag and resize the height with the mouse but not the width

319360
vbscript	vb6
this started out as a set of vbscript routines which i have since converted to vb6

319389
versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade our intranet dev server windows server 2003 to the latest and greatest patches including 2k3 sp2 and the latest for each versioning of .net

319415
gif	png
if it has a lot of solid colors and patterns then png or gif are probably your best bet

319433
gif	png
for illustrations that contain large areas of the same color using a lossless compression format like png or gif will be the best approach

319433
gif	png
although not technically correct you can think of png and gif will compress repetitions the same color very well similar to run-length encoding rle

319433
gif	png
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

319454
post	get
sometimes plain old post get and process request code will do just fine

319570
prepare	execute
you should be using mysql_real_escape_string or a prepare execute pair instead of mysql_escape_string and it should be where your sql is being assembled not where you are retrieving values off the url

319591
rss	feed
with .net 3.5 there is a syndicationfeed that will load in a rss feed and allow you to run linq on it

319600
salt	md5
generate the md5 s of the first 10 millions of numbers expressed as strings +some salt

319608
put	get
this means that the array will cease to exist when the current scope ends which to put it simply means when you get to the enclosing close-curly so for example return does it

319613
qmainwindow	qwidget	toolbar	docking
a qmainwindow is just a qwidget which provides a menu bar toolbar status bar and docking framework

319613
toolbar	tabs
the window with the tabs would not need to be a qmainwindow unless you want to also want add a toolbar to that window as well

319618
ubuntu	debian
the line of code was removed because of the warning anyway and that s why debian and ubuntu users had to update their ssl keys last may after the line was added back in hopefully with a more strongly-worded comment

319625
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i m using asp.net-mvc and the html.actionlink outputs # if i don t use urlencode but if i do it outputs 2523 which is 23 encoded..

319645
post	get
alternatively you could disable viewstate on the page remove any other hidden fields via javascript and also use javascript to modify the form method from post to get

319696
int	boolean
but i don t understand how boolean algebra works with int in c# at the least

319707
int	boolean
the key is that the cpu is doing 32 boolean operations in parallel one for each bit position of the input int assuming 32 bit int of course

319750
width	height
you use the width variable i as the first index but usually the first index should be the slowest changing that is the height

319755
valgrind	callgrind
valgrind callgrind with kcachegrind as a viewer is a good choice as strager said

319796
maven	pom.xml
you don t have to replace your existing build process with maven but you will have to at least maintain a pom.xml with the dependencies for your project

319820
ant	maven
a final note the dichotomy between ant and maven is somewhat false

319826
min	max
thanks to marc gravell for ponting out that the max in random.next min max is exclusive

319847
pow	math.h
now i have to calculate cube of each digit by using pow method of math.h as follows

319884
implements	extends
if it implements an interface or extends an existing class you can access the members defined in the interface or base class

319887
getter	setter
the best way would be to add getter setter methods to your interface and then use those to get your value

319902
hash	md5
you can always use a hashing function md5 or sha1 for your data and then compare the hash

319919
put	get
in fact when and if you choose to get your application symbian signed you may or may not be required to put such a confirmation box during installation

319993
integer	unsigned
in c# this requires the use of an unsigned integer uint because it interprets this to be 4278190080 instead of -16777216

320007
children	parent
in fact it s 1 parent and 6 children currently

320008
anjuta	kdevelop
if you are looking for a programming environment more like visual studio there are many good graphical ide s you can use such as netbeans eclipse code blocks kdevelop anjuta etc

320058
filesystems	fat
edit wow the filesystems isn t fat i was wrong

320077
int	boolean
the columns i m using are pretty standard columns mainly text int and boolean type columns

320077
int	boolean
the columns i m using are pretty standard columns mainly text int and boolean type columns

320085
trac	bugzilla
it does this by making tasks a first class part of eclipse and integrating rich and offline editing for repositories such as bugzilla trac and jira

320115
trac	bugzilla
if you want to track a todo-list among a couple of developer you really want to use a issue-tracking system such as bugzilla trac or jira

320130
django	turbogears	django	web2py	turbogears	web2py
well php has a builtin deadend and the whole infrastructure is still quite poor but i did not want to go back to perl so i checked python and the python web frameworks like django turbogears pylon and web2py

320130
django	turbogears	django	web2py	turbogears	web2py
just look at the comparison on web2py site - i was wondering why python frameworks like django or turbogears had to introduce such redundance and complicated syntax in their code - web2py shows that it is in fact possible to keep your syntax clean and easy

320140
folder	directory
this creates a .git hidden folder in the current directory

320161
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up confirming the lock release

320196
padding	overlapping
if in the so example you want to stop it overlapping the padding you d probably have to create another div inside the padding to hold your content

320197
opera	firefox
unfortunately the tag doesn t work in all browsers only firefox and internet explorer and opera with a css trick

320204
put	get
you need to place listeners and update messages but i don t have a clue where to put these how to get access from one panel to the other and maybe if necessary to introduce a datamodel class

320231
google-chrome	firefox
browsers and search engines are smart enough to ignore this character when searching text and google-chrome and firefox haven t tested others ignore it when copying text to clipboard

320231
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
fyi there s also css hyphens auto supported by latest ie firefox and safari but currently not google-chrome

320250
min	max
i am using the min and max functions to do this within the select but i m having lots of problems

320262
comparator	comparable
for instance the following sample code finds the biggest number instance in a collection using comparator from the comparable interface

320329
for-loop	loops
also when the for-loop terminates the while loops in your original example will also terminate because there s no change to the empty stack after the for-loop

320389
rss	feed
rss readers poll for changes to feed

320389
rss	feed
sometimes there simply isn t any way to get asynchronous notifications for example to replace rss with a push system the server would have to know about everyone who reads the feed and have a way of contacting them

320406
firefox	safari
as of december 2011 we now have another option with the emerging support of these tags in firefox and safari

320451
getter	setter
now you can use getter and setter to read and write the long identifier

320454
hide	show
when someone clicks on athumbnail change the class on the corresponding div to show the correct image and hide all the others

320498
children	parent
we have so called builders which will build the parent panel out of the children

320499
getter	setter
the compiler seems to generate a class called bindableproperty for each class which contains the getter and setter

320499
getter	setter
in question 3 i asked about binding to static functions but i actually meant static getter and setter functions

320508
rss	feed
i d be really surprised if they weren t available as an rss or atom feed for downloading

320515
put	get
the result is that any arraylist you try to copy into the array would get sliced only the initial part of its representation is put in the array

320531
ready	each
each new request is made as soon as it is ready - there is little to no delay between getting a response and making the next request

320538
jquery	jqmodal
suppose i have a page with a listview and i want to select filters for it perhaps with multiple selection from a list so i make a different aspx and open it using jquery actually jqmodal via ajax the user selects the filters and accepts

320576
multiplying	division
if so then one could simplify a division by making the second argument into its reciprocal and then multiplying

320576
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

320619
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
for other browsers opera safari galeon... the design under firefox will work fine

320620
post	get
that action will have two implementations -- a post and a get

320695
post	get
we ve done this successfully on our project - i ll see if i can get the developer of the tool to post details.

320715
minimum	max
if setminthreads is first set to the minimum number so in my case 2 then we are able to set the max number of threads to a value less than 8

320726
switching	screens
nvu is pretty nice and lets you quickly switching between html source and view screens

320792
width	height
i should try to reproduce the width and height in as

320802
cvs	svn
we use cvs but looking to migrate to svn

320820
awt	swing
however awt and swing objects allocate some amount of native resources that need to be freed

320834
ironruby	ironpython
there are other .net languages which are amenable to scripting - there are the dynamic languages such as ironruby and ironpython and also boo mostly static but with duck-typing where you want it

320838
lisp	scheme
common lisp and scheme are not purely functional

320854
doc	rtf
you can chain converters as you wish to convert from one format to another to do a conversion docx - rtf - doc

320878
put	get
i don t like these answers where you google for like 5 seconds and then just suggest a solution the real challenge is to put all the pieces together and not have to waste your time with tons of sample-less msdn pages or other coding forums in order to get your answer

320928
ant	maven
is to have a base folder of common files and then another instance folder of additional files and overwrites and our build script in ant maven should be fine too will first copy the base folders and then based upon a parameter supplied select which instance s files to copy across as well

320944
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
its very easy to write multithreaded code in f# haskell erlang ocaml etc because data structures and values in these languages are immutable meaning that you can t modify a variable once it has been assigned

320987
ant	maven

int	double
i have only tested it for double floats and int

321441
ant	maven
ant or maven are great little build tools

321479
try-catch	exception-handling
don t waste your time coding low-level exception-handling management use an higher-level api like spring-jdbc or a custom wrapper around connection statement rs objects to hide the messy try-catch ridden code

321506
min	max
you have to test for max min values termination sequences etc

321520
jquery	scriptaculous
but look at mootools scriptaculous jquery and yui animation

321552
redmine	trac
redmine is another good pick - i don t love it quite as well as trac but it s much easier to set up on the shared host where i keep my project management tools

321571
post	get
i d love it if i could get this into jquery - but i m having trouble with the call see my other post below

321585
post	get
i want to avoid doing a double post to get the summary to update any thoughts are helpful

321587
hash	md5
the php md5 function returns a hexadecimal string i.e a476c3... which you are chopping down to the key size while evp_bytestokey is a fairly complicated hash routine that return a raw byte string

321587
hash	md5
it might with the parameters supplied simplify down to a raw md5 hash but i can t really tell

321587
hash	md5
if you change the php to md5 thisismykey true that will give you a raw md5 hash

321619
serializable	deserialization
i m building a distributed c++ application that needs to do lots of serializable and deserialization of simple data structures that s being passed between different processes and computers

321628
innodb	myisam
depending on your usage patterns and schema you can get fragmented pages in innodb and i think in myisam also

321628
innodb	myisam
see the mysql docs on optimize table for some good info on both myisam and innodb

321628
innodb	myisam
i m not as familiar with myisam intricacies but with innodb it is true that statistics can get out of date

321671
jobs	cron
when your database gets too large you can truncate your log tables via cron jobs

321680
children	parent
i m needing to create a function that can go through and find all of the children for the parent could be a few levels and have it replace manual entries like this

321721
uninstall	upgrade
the real trick to this is the installed and not upgradingproductcode condition on the custom action with out that your action will get run on every upgrade since an upgrade is really an uninstall then reinstall

321736
graphics2d	bufferedimage
i m using a bufferedimage with a graphics2d object to draw the image then imageio.write to save the image

321807
getter	setter
the compiler will pick up the bindable metadata tag and will create a getter and setter for each property you marked as bindable

321807
getter	setter
the same as for instance properties basically only now a static getter and setter are created

321814
gridview	rowdatabound
if you use a gridview to create the table you can inject this in the rowdatabound event

321826
post	get
it has the value xmlhttprequest when a get or post request is sent

321863
cpython	ironpython
5 jython ironpython cpython are incompatible

i have tried forcing iis to use kerberos authentication ntlm authentication and both at the same time

321966
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr and files

322057
icmp	tcp
the icmp checksum doesn t include the tcp headers only the icmp type code checksum and data fields

322057
icmp	tcp
a tcp checksum failure doesn t necessarily mean the icmp contents aren t intact it could just mean that the tcp headers were messed with by a broken nat perhaps

322071
getter	setter
we re using nhibernate and traced some issues with lazy loading to properties that were only half overridable - virtual getter but private setter

322083
grass	ogr	gdal	ogr	gdal	grass	gdal	arcgis	arcgis	ogr
the tools i work with most often are arcgis and gdal ogr with some dabbling in qgis and grass

322144
maven	pom.xml
i have recently started exploring maven but i feel a bit overwhelmed of all xml configuration in all the pom.xml files

322166
swt	swing	awt	swing
gecko is not written in java nor embedded in awt swing swt at least without using jni

322183
google-chrome	firefox
it was then stated that this advantage only applies to ie because ie interprets javascript which is inefficient when compared to that of other browsers such as google-chrome and firefox which compile javascript to machine code before execution and as such perform as well as silverlight

322237
udp	tcp
a server can listen on tcp or udp sockets with some restrictions

322237
ftp	telnet
sending 100 bytes can be done using a lot of available protocols echo telnet ftp http to name a few

322241
udp	tcp
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours

322254
mouse	keyboard
update to clarify the question above it s a machine with multiple users but who use it sequentially via the plugged in keyboard mouse

322264

this needs to behave exactly the same way modal dialog behave in the win forms world meaning not just simulating a pop-up but halting code execution and returning to the code when the modal dialog is closed

322277
nlb	iis
we have set up a 2 cluster nlb on windows server 2003 with iis 6

322285
icmp	tcp
the icmp checksum doesn t include the tcp headers only the icmp type code checksum and data fields

322315
profiler	aqtime
i ve been testing out the performance and memory profiler aqtime to see if it s worthwhile spending those big for it for my delphi application

322330
prepare	execute
the scenario in which you would get benefit from a prepare query is when you prepare it and execute it many times during the same php request

322354
mouse	keyboard
i just recently wrote a delphi class to calculate the difference rectangles of two images and was quite suprised by how fast it ran - fast enough to run in a short timer and after mouse keyboard messages for recording screen activity

322367
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re using v8 google-chrome or the upcoming safari and firefox i seriously doubt it

322368
google-chrome	firefox
at that with resent developments in javascript implemented in google-chrome and in the yet to be fully released firefox 3.1 one may want do do some benchmarking of their own

322397
folder	directory
support for renaming a file or moving it to a new folder directory is terrible and painful if using the visual studio p4 plug-in integration

322446
firefox	safari
my company makes its money off of a great user experience using ie6 7 firefox and safari

322516
postgresql	mysql
if you have many reads over writes you may want to try mysql assuming that the problem is with postgresql but your problem is a write problem

322614
int	chars
one is a single chars typically s or b and the other is an int actually a cross-database foreign key if you like

322630
mouseup	mousedown
i d advise using some method for cross-browser event attachment - setting the mousedown and mouseup properties explicitly was done to simplify the example

322645
hide	show
there are so many options for chart type and then even more on subtype i wouldn t want to have to render them all and then show or hide the right one

322694
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
a lighttpd configuration would be likeso though apache nginx etc

322735
post	get
the httpservlet.service method gets called for all request types and what you are seeing is a head request and then a get or post request

322773
folder	directory
while you may perceive the file system as a hierarchy of folder containing folder it is actually a doubly linked tree 1 with directory being nodes and files being leafs

322797
g++	gcc
according to the article an introduction to gcc - for the gnu compilers gcc and g++ the problem is that gcc in x86_64 assumes fpmath sse while x86 assumes fpmath 387

322797
atan2	sin	cos	sin	cos	atan2
i can force -mfpmath 387 when compiling my own code and all my operations work correctly but whenever i call some library function sin cos atan2 etc. the results are wrong again

322827
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
incidentally ie has a feature useful in your case when other browsers send button only for mouse button events onclick onmousedown and onmouseup ie sends it with onmousemove too

322835
ant	maven	maven	cargo
i would like to call another maven plug-in in particular the cargo maven2 plug-in immediately after the custom ant plug-in successfully completes

322853
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
or as others have said if your values are like money in the sense that they re all a multiple of 0.01 or 0.001 or something then multiplying everything by a fixed power of 10 and use int or long addition and subtraction are trivial watch out for multiplication

322875
int	chars
the byte chars int long types are fixed-point numbers which are exact representions of numbers

322885
freemarker	velocity
for advanced features like loops you may want to use apache velocity or freemarker

322896
getter	setter
as we know data members should not directly be accessed but rather with a getter setter

322896
getter	setter
this if you find yourself in a situation that you have added lots of getter and setter you are probably doing something wrong anyway and shouldn t be using an anonymous class

322929
opera	firefox
another problem is that zooming in firefox and opera can easily break this

322929
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
word-wrap break-word - it s now part of css3 working draft but it s not supported by either firefox opera or safari yet

322991
firefox	safari
word-wrap browser support isn t terrible all things considered safari internet explorer and firefox 3.1 alpha build all support it src so we may not be all that far off

322996
inherited	properties
the inherited path is different for menuitem and button there is no shared inherited tag properties

322996
inherited	properties
menuitem inherited from menu which declares a tag properties button inherited from control which also implements a tag properties

323000
lisp	scheme
learning lisp scheme may not give you any increased application space but it will help you get a better sense of functional programming its rules and its exceptions

323054
subclass	abstract-class
in this subclass checkingaccount we implemented the two abstract-class -- nothing too interesting here

323150
int	chars
as a base case a primitive to extract a single 8-bit int could look like this assuming an 8-bit chars on the host machine you could add a layer of custom types to ensure that too if needed

323206
ssl	https
the entire text of an https session is secured by ssl

323206
post	get
in that respect a post and a get would be exactly the same

323311
swt	styledtext
example i wanted to observe the position of the cursor caret in an swt styledtext

323388
udp	tcp
it would probably be another protocol over tcp but i see no reason why you cannot stream over udp

323429
trac	bugzilla
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla

323471
post	get
you may get some benefit from using the technique described in this blog post to hash large string values such as url s for faster lookup

323480
hide	show
looking from the point of the user a typical user will do just fine with a standard menu whereas a more advanced user won t mind more advanced features like keyboard navigation or possibility to hide show the menu or dock it to the other side of the window

323527
debian	linux	vmware	esx
i ve an linux image debian running on vmware esx 3.1

323538

323542
redmine	trac
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

323559

323675
doxygen	tex
doxygen has a number of features that javadoc does not offer the class diagrams for the hierarchies and the cooperation context more summary pages optional source-code browsing cross-linked with the documentation additional tag support such as todo on a separate page and it can generate output in tex and pdf format.it also allows a lot of visual customization

323736
vb.net	vb6
it can analyze c++ c c# vb.net java delphi visual basic vb6 or html

323747
put	get
note that i tend not to put the factory method on the concrete exception because they showup on derived classes which can get

323748
pull	push
push and pull changes

323748
pull	push
in an simplified way just do git push and git pull

323764
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian or ubuntu

323764
redhat	fedora
on redhat based distributions such as fedora

323764
ubuntu	debian
for example in debian and ubuntu you need to install the build-essential package via apt

323764
sudo	passwd
it will prompt you to enter your passwd for sudo this is so it can write to the usr local directory which can only be accessed by the root user so sudo is required

323781
int	boolean
i often use a int rather than boolean so that the same flag can be set multiple times in one processing

323809
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers

323851
subclass	abstract-class
from a highly obscure security perspective you can t get a pre-existing class to implement the methods by creating a subclass of the pre-existing class and the abstract-class

323857
cos	sin
and theres already an index for cos and sin

323874
hide	show
does anyone know how could i show hide sip keyboard programatically or better what could be done to solve the described problem

323874
switching	screens
once the user minimizes the keyboard it should not appear on the screens on dialog switching

323882
cos	sin
put a composite index on cos and sin on each of the tables

323893
mantis	bugzilla
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

323933
hide	show
you can show hide the sip programmatically using the enabled property

323939
post	get
the webservice receives arguments from post or get and retreives xml in a future maybe i ll use json

323946
hide	show
and use javascript to show or hide the contents

323946
hide	show
that will show a hidden div and hide a show div

323963
ws-trust	ws-federation
there are various standards like ws-trust ws-security ws-federation etc

324009
sudoers	visudo
you should make your edits to a temporary file then use visudo -c -f sudoers.temp to confirm that the changes are valid and then copy it over the top of etc sudoers

324012
sudoers	visudo
visudo is supposed to be the human interface for editing etc sudoers

324021
sudoers	visudo
when you are done exit the script and visudo will take care of modifying the actual sudoers file for you

324025
children	parent
in any case the adjacency lists can be built in time o number of nodes by simply adding each node to the children list of its parent

324030
profiling	debugging
writing a leaky application to test debugging a profiling application with

324070

324080
superclass	subclassing
i m extending the functionality of a class with a subclassing and i m doing some dirty stuff that make superclass methods dangerous app will hang in a loop in the context of the subclassing

324088
post	put
i didnt want to put the sql generated in the first post otherwise it would be too much thing -

324094
superclass	subclassing
if you create the methods in your superclass as private then the subclassing has no possible way of calling them

324129
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera the solution is very easy they have builtin xpath support

324131
post	get
furthermore i found an interesting post that explains how to create get a name value pair which is pretty much what you are expecting as far as i understood

324137
superclass	subclassing
just re-implement the unsafe method in your subclassing and have it do nothing or throw an exception or re-implement it as safe just as long as the new implementation doesn t call the unsafe superclass method

324170
client-side	server-side
only option i can think of is to catch server-side exceptions in client-side code

324210
put	get
get rid of the stackpanel and put a grid with one row and 4 column that will do the trick

324217
nswindow	nspanel
you need to use an nspanel instead of an nswindow to get this choice

324287
udp	tcp
rtsp can use udp and tcp

324287
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
the advantage of using multicast and udp as well as library support may make rtsp rtp very worthwhile for internal applications

324306
rss	feed
i want to take a description of a rss feed located in the_content and cut it off after 2 full sentences or 200 words and then the next full sentence using preg_split

324315
width	height
i want to link both width and height

324333
vbscript	jscript
i don t know if you can do that with .bat files and what few tools windows comes with but you sure can with .js jscript or .vbs vbscript files

324336
spweb	spsite
the object model is also better for performance as long as you dispose your spsite and spweb objects properly

324344
opera	google-chrome
ie opera and google-chrome are all fine with the page

324351
postgresql	mysql
we also store the query results from our database postgresql in memcache and we are using triggers on the tables to invalidate the cache - there are several apis out there pgmemcache i think mysql has something like that too but i don t know for sure

324355
lxml	libxml2
i recommend you to use lxml it s a python binding for the libxml2 library which is really fast

324355
lxml	libxml2
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

324362
hash	salt
if your users are able to find the salt you are adding to your hash then they can likely find a public key in your code change it to a public key they generated themselves and calculate the signature on the modified file with their private key

324372
unix	bsd
further they work on unix linux macos x bsd

324420
versioning	upgrade
the trouble is that if it ceases to be profitable for example because the code is so stable that people buy it and continue using it without needing upgrade then the users of that software can be stranded with their nice stable product running on increasingly ancient machines until one day the machines crash or must be upgrade to a new versioning of the operating system so that they can run some other system but because the proprietary software is no longer maintained you have to give up on the application

324472
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be printed

324491
octal	decimal	octal	binary
i am working on a calculator that allows you to perform calculations past the decimal point in octal hexadecimal binary and of course decimal

324491
octal	decimal	octal	binary
i am having trouble though finding a way to convert floating point decimal numbers to floating point hexadecimal octal binary and vice versa

324542
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
as a hint convert octal and hex to binary perform the operations convert back to binary

324542
octal	decimal	octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
or you can perform decimal operations and perform the conversions to octal hex binary afterward

324567
addition	multiplication
it also handles multiplication by 0 and 1 and addition of 0

324597
multiplying	division
if you multiplying a unsigned binary number by 2 ti is the same as a bit shift left 1 in c a division by 2 is the same as a bit shit right in c

324597
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction is the same as you would do in elementary school

324608
gmail	hotmail
the html version of the email works great in gmail hotmail etc

324689
getter	setter
and 2 the getter and setter of the member variables were easy to make thread-safe because changing or accessing their values was always done through 2 methods in the base class of all objects

324759
nunit	mstest
nunit is probably the best one some people even prefer it to mstest

324769
opera	firefox
that works in firefox 3 and opera 9 at least

324780
pull	push
the former offers nearly everything mercurial offers including rebase push pull graphical history workspace synchronization etc

324811
folder	directory
whenever i need something from that folder eg jquery.js a css reset i just symlink that directory into my working folder and hey presto

324819
disk	ram
at least throw in all the ram the boards will take and throw out old disk

324867
put	get
so what i think i want to do is have 3 string var s and 1 int and get all those things put into their respective variables

324923
webkit	gecko
i can think of some terminal emulators that can. if anyone has worked inside of webkit or possibly gecko

324928
post	put
actually if you want to put some hair on your chest take what i ve given you above implement it test it and post it back here

324935
innodb	myisam
i ve tried it with the myisam and innodb engine

325193
int	chars
this would work as long as the 0 -string always looks the same and you re not really after the int value 0 only the chars pattern

325273
margin	height
update notes excuse me for not describing the question well i tried css margin padding attribute on div to occupy the whole remining height of a web page successfully but the trick didn t work on iframe

325334
width	height
but width 100 and height 100 works just fine

325336
profiling	instrumentation
you may not be able to use a profiling very well for example if it impacts the behaviour too much in which case instrumentation should be used instead

325419
move	drag
i am a newbie for visual project i have downloaded some of the totorial to testing however i found the object in those project are not able to drag to move or editing anybody know is it have a object lock function in vb if got how can i unlock it

325422
versioning	upgrade
some versioning bumps between eclipse versioning cause a certain amount of upgrade pain for the plugin writers 3.0 to 3.1 was a big jump

325436
configure	libtool
depending on the scope of your project you may want to add configure check for these gnulib recently acquired new macros to tests for warnings flags and libtool can be used to build shared libraries

325469
put	get
for a short project i might put everything in main just to get things up-and-running quickly

325573
jar	war	ant	maven
then when you build ant maven manually for distribution ensure the jar file is included with or within your application jar or war or ear or whatever file and that any startup scripts include it on the classpath using the -classpath command line option for java as vonc has written

325585
pop-up	dialog
but here s another approach instead of using the built-in functionality that pop-up a dialog box asking you to download open or cancel the download you can use your own c# code in your application not the html page to directly open the file or maybe do something else

325591
hash	md5
it provides methods for generate random numbers hash with md2 md4 md5 and sha and some kind of encryption decryption

325614
implements	extends
extends stringbuffer to avoid switching back and forth between string and stringbuffer implements append string offset length parseint int indexof string index replace offset stringbuffer offset length .

325615
outputstream	inputstream
filling and emptying the buffer is done with standard java inputstream and outputstream

325649
hash	md5
this matters because some hash algorithms such as md5 are suitable for some purposes but not others

325769
imperative	declarative
however some systems also implement a petri-net or state change based markup system for workflow which might reasonably be described as declarative but they still have an imperative mode of interaction with the underlying system

325784
kde	gnome
my guess is that the desktop kde or gnome is configured to use a font which doesn t contain umlauts kind of strange today but it happens

325787
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
so you basically use nszonefree instead of free when cleaing up malloc d and calloc d memory

325904
getdate	dateadd
you could put the dateadd d datediff d 0 getdate 0 and dateadd d datediff d 0 getdate 1 into variables and use those instead but i don t think that this will improve performance

325956
post	get
here is a good article that show you how to manipulate the get to change it to post via php

325964
min	max
but to implement min and max you have to code using c ternary for terseness

325975
equals	gethashcode
of course for .contains to work as expected you need to override the equals method as well as gethashcode

326070
gridview	rowdatabound
in case if you just want to redirect to another url then simple use hyperlink web control and push it in the desired cell of gridview row at rowdatabound event

326070
gridview	rowdatabound
1 add linkbutton object at rowdatabound event of gridview

326073
post	get
as you ve already discovered there are exactly two ways to transmit data over the http protocol get or post

326073
post	get
obviously both get and post are easily accessible through the use of a tag

326073
post	get
also keep in mind that an http server doesn t intrinsically know whether a request get or post came from a main browser window or an ajax call

326073
post	get
regardless the web server will read the request will decipher if it s a get or post request look for name-value pairs as appropriate and generate a response

326091
post	get
you can of course always do a get to a page which contains server-side or ajax logic which will create a post request get pagewhichcreatesapost.py

326126
lua	scheme
i d advice lua scheme and python

326138
gmail	hotmail
you can import contacts from gmail hotmail outlook and you can designate subgroups that won t be matched with one another bill and lisa never want to get each other s names

326197
public	protected
in classes you can set some functions as private protected or public

326223
inherited	properties
i have an abstract base class and i want to declare a field or a properties that will have a different value in each class that inherited from this parent class

326223
inherited	properties
use an abstract properties and override it on the inherited classes

326223
public	protected
i can declare a public field or a protected field and explicitly override it in the inherited class

326231
public	protected
of course you then still have the option of making the field private and then depending on the need exposing a protected or public property getter

326233
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview populated from an objectdatasource with two items in its datakeynames field

326274
gridview	objectdatasource
when using the default declarative delete method gridview will pass both values to the objectdatasource

326337
accessor	properties
krosenvald is correct the lock on the objects accessor is released as soon as the properties returns the pointer to the container object.

326374
listview	gridview
i added this column to a gridview along with other columns set the gridview to the view property of a listview and then databound the listview to a collection of custom dataobjects

326379
gmail	hotmail
i m trying to locate and or build an api capable of speaking to hotmail yahoo and gmail in order to retrieve contact lists with the user s consent of course

326394
width	height
coming back to your original question now you can see that width and height are specified simply as styles no special attributes nothing fancy just some intuitive css

326429
cvs	svn
i think central version control cvs or svn is ruled out because our students don t have the administrative privileges needed to make a repository that they can share with one other student

326429
cvs	svn
we are stuck with unix file permissions. also setup on cvs or svn is too hard

326449
cvs	svn
i would say your best bet will be to try to work with your it department to set up a system method for your students to easily create new svn cvs repositories

326480
free	malloc
it is fairly common for heap-based memory managers your basic malloc free to use a single mutex there are fairly good reasons for it a heap memory area is a single coherent data structure

326509
ubuntu	linux
across most platforms windows mac os linux ubuntu in particular

326515
width	height
i believe the problem is that span elements display inline by default - meaning they have no height and width

326529
extjs	qooxdoo
you might also be interested in the unit testing framework that is part of qooxdoo an open source ria framework similar to dojo extjs etc

326582
floating-point	integer
for a strict visual basic approach you can convert the floating-point value to an integer to round to said integer

326602
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
depending on how much stuff is in there you may get better results using mouseenter and mouseleave to avoid triggering mouseover when you cross element boundaries

326612
for-loop	loops
there is a variation on the same theme that uses a for-loop instead of a while loops to limit the scope of the line variable

326624
int	double
i worry less about how it handles nan +-infinity double int than whether one of colleagues decided to change the argument order and goofed

326631
pull	push
understanding the distinction between push pull vs update commit

326661
factors	matrix
this proved to be a bottleneck in our application and we then used pinning+p invoke to call into a c++ version of the matrix multiplication routine and got a factors of 2 improvement

326668
bazaar	git
some version control systems bazaar hg git make this easier than others but it s possible on most

326700
datamapper	activerecord
as for the orm activerecord or datamapper should be the way to go

326702
superclass	subclassing
if you has a person superclass a employee subclassing it would make no sense for the employee class to have no breathe method

326706
hash	salt
you can attack a secure hash by the use of a rainbow table which you can counteract by applying a salt to the hash before storing it

326707
hash	salt
using a unique random salt for each hash password stored makes it much more difficult for an attacker to use this method

326734
min	max
find the max and min of your data series

326832
rss	feed
but dont just subscribe to alot of rss feed and expect to get better

326849
unix	solaris
when i ve written cross-platform product installers coding a unix shell script for linux mac solaris etc

326920
width	height
however it should be mentioned that the overflow hidden method of clearing floats does not work with ie6 unless you have a specified width or height

326920
width	height
or if you don t want to specify a width or height you can use zoom 1

326953
postgresql	mysql
this is trivial in postgresql and impossible in mysql

327004
gmail	hotmail
plaxo has an api widget to import contacts from gmail yahoo aol and hotmail

327016
kde	gnome
i m developing an application to run with either a single-click interface nothing requires a double-click just like the kde interface mode or a double-click interface the default windows interface mode or the regular gnome interface mode

327055
post	get
get and post have two different purposes

327055
post	get
basically you should use get to well get information and post for any actions which alter the state of the server such as adding new records

327094
inherited	properties
paintspecialize will inherited from paint giving this class all of paint s properties and methods

327114
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
nszonefree balances out a call to nszonemalloc just like -release balances a call to -alloc or -copy and cfrelease balances a call to cfretain or or for that matter free balances a call to malloc or calloc

327118
folder	directory
another option is to change the current working directory to the folder containing the dlls with setcurrentdirectory

327132
mouse	keyboard
for example i m currently using an apple keyboard and a logitech mx revolution mouse and i ve been very impressed with both

327133
bazaar	git
bazaar mercurial and git sound appropriate for your case - trivial to create repositories and all the students need to share is read access on the filesystem to each other s repositories

327134
division	modulo
division and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine using this modulo might be faster

327140
sudoers	passwd
set up your etc sudoers file so that managerd can execute the various commands you want it to be able to run as root without a passwd

addition	modulo
it takes a key and does modulo addition to characters to create the encrypted string

327280
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql filemaker insert name of database that is not access here excel custom parsers natural language importers perl just because it is a swiss army knife grep awk sed m4 the old versions of access before the demise of access .

327357
multiplying	add
to get a range for the number of crashes just multiplying the upper and lower limits by population size - sample size and add back the number of crashes in the sample

327376
atomic	interlocked
the interlocked class has all the static methods needed to do simple atomic operations like increment decrement compare swap etc

327393
union	distinct
as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

327418
put	get
this article will get you 90 there all you have to do at the end is to put some simple javascript in place to fire the updates every x seconds

327446
kerberos	ntlm
well negotiate can also be kerberos because it is a wrapper over kerberos and ntlm

327464
min	max
the interface is more or less dict-like with the added bonus for you that .keys .items .iterkeys and .iteritems have two min max optional arguments

327476
keydown	keyup
here is the problem i have written an event loop to detect keydown and keyup events

327476
keydown	keyup
the problem i am running into is that a keydown event is generating a keydown and a keyup event when the key is pressed and held down

327476
post	get
i would post the code but i can t get it to look right

327479
dictionary	map
if your chains map 2 words to the probabilities of the third i d use a dictionary mapping k-tuples to the 3rd-word histogram

327484
vim	textmate
then i read a post by jamis buck on how he switched from textmate back to vim and learned some great tricks

327531
min	max
to that i added some min max position checking

327551
floating-point	fractions	decimal	ieee
the most common storage for floating-point values in programming languages - ieee singles and doubles - does not have exact representations for most decimal fractions

327552
for-loop	loops
using the common for-loop form here will allow the optimizer to unroll these loops if it wants

327555
vim	emacs
there are important features of emacs which are missing in vim such as the comint mode and there are no scripts plugins which can replace them

327555
vim	emacs
there are also benefits of vim over emacs such as modal editing and generally better default shortcuts

327555
vim	emacs
unfortunately no mode can make emacs work as fast as vim

327568
agile	greenhopper
update you can use greenhopper plugin to jira which is a little better to support agile projects

327570
children	parent
that is to say one node can have multiple children and multiple parent

327586
profiling	benchmarking
you have to constantly profiling and benchmarking every change you make to ensure you re actually improving performance

327595
metaphone	soundex
commons codec has an implementation of soundex and metaphone

327608
postgresql	mysql
any free database mysql postgresql

327620
opera	safari
in opera 9.62 mozilla 3.0.4 safari 3.2 for windows it helps if you put some text or at least a whitespace within the same line as the input field

327676
bash	tcsh
under terminal preferences profiles keyboard you can check use option key as meta key. many applications including bash and tcsh treat meta-delete as backward delete word.

327694
fadein	hide
if you hide the content before you append it and chain the fadein method to that you should get the effect that you re looking for

327697
dictionary	map
you ll need to use numbers rather than strings to index into the array but that can be solved by using a single dictionary to map words to numbers

327706
kde	gnome
ps- sorry for not great looking code format but stackoverflow has broken firefox and iceweasel code format support under kde and gnome

327717
post	get
it is a kind of data i would push through post anyway so i m not losing get parameters that would be good for something

327798
many-to-many	many-to-one
edit - the above was assuming a many-to-one relationship between users and rates - where there are many-to-many relationships you need a table for each sort of data and then another table with rows for each user - rate pair

327810
glassfish	geronimo
for example by using the geronimo server which uses tomcat as its container or by taking the jar files from glassfish

327819
direct3d	directx
perhaps things changed but from what i observed i don t find directx and by extrapolation direct3d attractive

327885
implements	extends
after all if this was an interface instead of that abstract class there would be no need to extends a base class in order to create a new actionresult - one would just have to implements iactionresult properly

327923
post	get
you ll have to post that to get a correct answer to your question

327934
heapsort	shellsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	shellsort
those are just two algorithms for sorting a list but there are a lot of other interesting techniques each with its own advantages and disadvantages quicksort radix sort selection sort heapsort shellsort and bucket sort

327955
curry	first-class
the main features of functional programming include functions as first-class curry immutable values etc

327972
innodb	myisam
another thing is that i think you use myisam table engine which locks the entire table on update.i suggest you use innodb instead

327986
mouse	keyboard
disk utility on the mac probably needs a bit too much keyboard or mouse action but might be appescriptable

327995
cakephp	kohana	symfony	kohana
php has many to choose from zend s solar cakephp symfony kohana

327995
profiling	debugging
profiling and debugging tools

327995
profiling	debugging
those two needs are solved by same tool - xdebug which offers improved debugging capabilities and can also generate kcachegrind reports for profiling your application

327995
wordpress	joomla
i ve used wordpress and joomla as blogging platforms html purifier for sanitizing and validating html minify for minifying and concatenating css and javascript among others

327996
post	put
in this sample i m using the default config for a rest singleton service from the wcf rest starter kit with the exception of some changes to the onadditem method to accept updates via a post since silverlight put isn t supported

328041
solaris	aix
the solution needs to run on windows linux solaris aix and hp-ux

328064
dictionary	map
i would expect that the map dictionary hashtable of the non-zero values should be a fast and economical solution

328096
mouseup	mousedown
you need to handle the mousedown and mouseup and set some flag or something to track it later down the road .

328135
put	get
if i put the other control before in the z-order i can not get the mouse message in my control

328146
curry	first-class
first-class curry

328163
rss	feed
additionally its not very scalable if you add comments for rss feed favorite links user status etc then you have intermediate tables for all of those types

328225
superclass	subclassing
in the code above it looks like you re mixing annotations on fields superclass and methods subclassing

328225
getter	setter
in my experience with hibernate it s safer and more flexible to annotate getter setter methods instead of fields anyway so i suggest sticking to that design if you can

328228
int	chars
the value of an int chars

328228
int	chars
for example if int is only 16 bits wide in a particular implementation then jan can t be represented anymore like you intend it chars must be at least 8 bits while a chars literal is always of type int

328236
int	chars
the fact that a four chars constant is equivalent to an particular 32-bit int is a non-standard feature often seen on compilers for ms windows and mac computers and palmos afaicr

328237
int	chars
machine word size issues aside your compiler may promote input i to a negative int which will just set the upper bits of inputint with or operation so i suggest you to be explicit about signedness of chars variables

328354
put	get
jasper includes an imageservlet class that fetches these from the session where the jrhtmlexporter has put them but you have to get the config of both the html exporter and image servlet just right and its hard to tell where you re going wrong

328438
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve always been baffled about the strange coupling in the iphone api -- in particular with the uiviewcontroller which has hard-coded references to a uitabbaritem uitabbarcontroller etc

328438
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so you end up adding a uiviewcontroller to a uitabbarcontroller which in turn queries the uiviewcontroller as to what should be displayed on the uitabbar through the uiviewcontroller s tabbaritem property

328468
width	height
the problem is that i have a set width and height the thumbnails need to be and often times the images are stretched

328473
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the structure.css file would contain rules that only used properties like height width margin padding float position etc

328484
width	height
you ll need to calculate the new width height to keep the image proportionat

328500
width	height
i am able to resize surfaces without any problem by modifying the surfaces width and height but the resulting surface is clipped

328539
perl	tcl
you can embed perl python tcl and ruby

328604
vsts	tfs
so when you re using the full microsoft stack vsts and tfs i d suggest just sticking with msbuild scripts

328797
ienumerable	icollection
icollection n a use ienumerable t or anything that extends it

328797
ienumerable	icollection
this makes the interfaces similar in name only while icollection and ienumerable t differ by very little

328812
identifier	ambiguous
also file could mean i am a file point which is ambiguous filename doesn t state whether or not it has context ie directories fileuri is contextwise unambiguous as it says this is a resource identifier that when observed points to a resource a file

328813
folder	directory
so i would use folder or path to identify the directory that the file is in

328841
valgrind	callgrind
if you are using linux i suggest using callgrind part of valgrind to find out what parts of the execution takes the most time

328936
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
if it is possible i want to get the same id from linux or freebsd or solaris etc.

328936
hash	md5
if there is no other option available i can use mac in combination with something else for example the id can be the md5 hash of the combination of the mac address and something else

328942
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
instead it sends a message to the uitabbarcontroller to switch to the uiviewcontroller as indicated by the selected tab bar item

329009
subtraction	addition
just like in math where you move from addition and subtraction to integration and differentiation these are advanced techniques that will help you solve problems that are out there

329041
translation	localization
this is primarily regarding the ui localization translation part of your app

329045
ienumerable	ienumerator
i m not saying that ienumerable or ienumerator are bad interfaces

329066
serializable	deserialization
xmlserializer works by generating code to do the serializable deserialization and storing this in a temporary assembly

329066
serializable	deserialization
this approach gives good performance for repeated serializable deserialization but traditionally shockingly awful performance for the first run

329073
ienumerable	ienumerator
it is a matter of seperating responsibilities ienumerable is a class that can be iterated over ienumerator is a class that does the iteration

329094
free	malloc
for example if you had used malloc to allocate memory then you should free and if you had used new to allocate then you should use delete

329120
int	chars
edit all that said you could still implement your own key combinations to allow unicode chars to be entered via the keyboard -- such as type ctrl+alt+u and then four hex digits -- your readkey routine could detect the ctrl+alt+u and then grab the next four keystrokes and make an int out of them and convert it into a chars -- but of course this wouldn t allow for pasting

329131
free	malloc
some performance notes about new delete and malloc free

329131
free	malloc
malloc and free do not call the constructor and deconstructor respectively

329131
realloc	malloc
i suggest staying consistent with new malloc usage unless you have a reason realloc

329131
free	malloc
also you won t mess up by free ing something allocated with new or deleting something allocated with malloc

329174
addition	multiplication
one of the most popular answers i got was 1 flop an addition and a multiplication operation

329183
multiplying	subtract
as an example if you take exactly one second for an operation such as adding subtract multiplying or dividing two values and returning the result your performance is simply 1 flops

329185
addition	multiplication
some cpu s can perform addition and multiplication as one operation others can t for example

329195
g++	gcc
if you are using them you have to as other answers already noted link with g++ instead of gcc which will add -lstdc++ for you

329217
vim	emacs
unfortunately no mode can make emacs work as fast as vim

329223
prepare	execute
using a prepare and execute style means that only one place execute needs to know about escaping if escaping is even necessary

329240
georss	kml
no like you have mentioned html in the description is the only way i know that you can control the style of balloons through kml georss feed

329243
addition	multiplication
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop

329243
addition	multiplication
if a processor has a fused multiply-add instruction that does a multiplication and an addition in a single instruction -- generally a + b c -- that counts as 2 operations

329303
jboss	glassfish
the reference implementation is the one included with the glassfish i believe the one used in jboss is the hibernate implementation so you should be able to find the source code there

329334
post	put
remove any largely-encompasing-form-tags you have out there and only put a form tag around input fields that are meant for a specific purpose to post to some sort of action

329388
vim	emacs
this can be used with any decent editor such as vim emacs or many other editors and ide s

329390
superclass	subclassing
the problem is the superclass makes an instance of itself not the subclassing

329455
client-side	server-side
then you only need to define the rules in one place and you don t have to worry about your client-side validation server-side validation and test cases getting out of sync with each other

329481
ubuntu	debian
you would install debian or ubuntu then take a snapshot how-to for vmware and parallels

329487
websphere	ibm
if you plan to develop enterprise-grade java applications the only acceptable choice today is the ibm everyplace websphere micro envinronment previously known as j9 jvm which is not free though the license is pretty inexpensive

329496
curry	first-class
the main features of functional programming include functions as first-class curry immutable values etc

329511
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
i have uinavigationcontroller in each of my tabs and when i restore the uinavigationitem s are still there i can use the back buttons and so on to change them but the view controllers are just gone

329527
unix	bsd
in a unix environment you almost certainly have access to the bsd regular expression tools regcomp regerror regexec regfree which are c-like rather than c++-like but do work

329587
getter	setter
the attributes on a property have little or nothing to do with archiving behavior they only describe how getter and setter work

329665
distance	polygons
so you can dynamically create a polygons that is your zip code extended by a certain distance at every point

329674
implements	extends
you can write your own observer by extends the sentestobserver class and implements the notification listeners

329706
django-cms	pinax
leverage a cms solution such as pinax or django-cms

329713
decimal	ieee
or you can continue to use decimal arithmetic since it will remain accurate and it will get faster once machines are released that support the new ieee 754 decimal arithmetic in hardware

329713
decimal	ieee
information on decimal arithmetic and the new ieee 754 2008 standard at this speleotrove site material previously hosted at ibm

329742
vim	emacs
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

329758
multiplying	addition
no overhead for addition cost of a multiplying or divide doubles

329816
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a wpf tabcontrol with two tabitem

329850
put	get
fwiw i ve frequently put interesting information in error dumps -- i ve found it s easier to get people to report it in bug reports and they re more likely to accurately report something like myrtle as opposed to error #47 or whatever.

329862
filtering	grouping
a bit of a hacky solution is to use in with a grouping by and having filtering

329883
versioning	upgrade
you can then write scripts to check for updated versioning etc to avoid having to mess around with manual upgrade

329906
datamodel	relational-model
in most cases iâ ve designed my datamodel first in a way that takes the existing data and organizes it into relational-model

329915
ienumerator	idisposable
one item that may trip you up is that ienumerator t additionally implements idisposable so curvepointenumerator and rtratepointenumerator will need to have a dispose method added

329995
crypt	salt
it says that since the length of the salt may vary depending on the underlying crypt implementation you should provide the entire crypted password as the salt value when checking passwords

330000
hash	salt
you could randomly generate n characters of per-user salt to be combined with the user s password in a sha-1 hash

330016
hash	salt
so you should add a little randomized salt to all your password hash and just store it in plaintext next to the hash password value

330022
pull	push
i believe you can continue to pull remote changes into your local repository but have changes you never push back

330035
children	parent
so the bug is the parent object with a list of attachment children

330039
crypt	salt
char crypt const char key const char salt

330120
keydown	keyup
you might want to use sdl_getkeystate instead of keeping track of keydown keyup

330133
google-chrome	safari
the color plugin has issues with safari and google-chrome

330177
post	put
there s a blog post from mariya atanasova which shows how you can fake it - basically you have to put the directory on the url

330232
hash	md5
md5 does not create a unique hash value

330267
hash	md5
opens source code for crypto hash implementations md5 and sha can be found at mozilla code

330280
prepare	execute
calling a prepare statement is a lot safer no sql injection possible and doing so in a loop is more efficient as well because only parameter values are sent to the server on execute instead of whole statements

330358
hash	md5
if hash functions such as md5 were reversible then it would have been a watershed event in the history of data compression algorithms

330374
addition	multiplication
addition or multiplication of 2 long long s

330479
width	height
main problem i don t know how to solve is how to set width and height for menu items and context menu

330491
lisp	scheme	erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme
i m mostly interested in programming languages and have been playing with lisp clos scheme erlang python and a bit of ruby

330513
vsto	add-in
i m writing an vsto outlook add-in for which i need to modify these keys

330520
range	max	range	min	min	max
preferably done in a declarative manner screening off invalid inputs before it even reaches the presenter ensure that the text field value is within a-b range by setting the min and max properties

330617
vim	emacs
i m a regular vim user but not an emacs user and haven t used vimpulse to confirm this

330625
pop-up	dialog
we have implemented a pop-up window as a modal dialog using the ie method

330646
put	get
i ve used the rexx one a bit as there s no choice but when i ve coded for notes databases i ve preferred the get put way of doing things

330657
post	get
security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

330806
invokerequired	begininvoke
what you need to do is check invokerequired and begininvoke before setting the controls on your ui so you don t get the error like so

330860
google-chrome	firefox
depending on the browser there may be separations between tabs ie8 and google-chrome uses separate processes whereas firefox and ie7 do not

330883
bazaar	git
in my examples i will be assuming you use subversion for your version control but it works virtually the same with other version control packages such as git or bazaar

330901
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
i haven t looked at this in a while but if i recall correctly both ant and maven still rely on junit 3 for unit tests as of maven 2.09 the default pom.xml file still has junit 3.81

330930
min	max
yes min max and count are supported in hql

330958
richtextbox	linklabel
if that is in windows forms and you really can t use the richtextbox you can create a control with a linklabel inside of textbox

330999
cvs	svn
svn was designed explicitly to be a better cvs

330999
cvs	svn
it makes sense that many of the cvs users would migrate to svn because it fixes nearly all of cvs s faults is easier to use and maintain adds new features and has a really easy migration path

331044
ssl	https
in my case the problem was that https was unable to start correctly because listen 443 was in ifdefine ssl derective but my apache didnt start with -dssl option

331052
width	height
i have a canvas element defined statically in the html with a width and height

331052
width	height
if i attempt to use javascript to resize it dynamically setting a new width and height - either on the attributes of the canvas or via the style properties i get the following error in firefox

331074
implements	extends
i m not sure if c# is implements differently than java but it usually has some default size and if you add more than that it extends the set

331111
client-side	server-side
because it s client-side there is no server-side impact

331159
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
attributes are set by field controls within your window text boxes checkbox and dropdownlistfor rather than menu items toolbar controls or ribbon controls

331186
onmousedown	onmouseup
the whole thing is done as a div with two events onmousedown and onmouseup using document.captureevents event.mousemove for the intermediate movement

331186
google-chrome	safari
edit google-chrome and safari work

331233
post	get
for example items 0 may not be the same between the get and the post

331277
post	get
the web way to deal with this situation is to redirect after a post to get a clean version of the page that can be refreshed without reposting an action to the webserver

331283
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	salt	md5
for some added strength you can get the crypt module to use md5 by using a salt in the format

331283
hash	md5
md5 and now even sha1 may be broken but they are still relatively good for password hash and md5 is still the standard for linux local passwords

331300

in linux ubuntu i have my panel set to be somewhat transparent and when i add a gif with a transparent background the background of the icon shows up all grey and ugly see image green diamond

331423
dictionary	map
a simple-ish bandage for the problem though might be to map the text representations that you place into the combobox or listview to the original objects using a dictionary field member on your form class

331423
ienumerable	icollection
the official defense is likely to be that they wanted to support the standard ienumerable and icollection interfaces

331462
width	height
it is possible to change the size by assigning width and height attributes using numbers

331462
width	height
as you can see it defines 2 attributes width and height and both of them are unsigned long

331511
getter	setter
one option is to just type the value property as a string write a getter and a setter for it and do the parsing there

331511
getter	setter
the below example is the width property getter and setter from mx.core.uicomponent

331527
stateless	stateful
there is a corollary here to server activated objects in .net remoting one of the technologies that is replaced by wcf which have two modes single call stateless and singleton stateful

331564
put	get
the question is should be how get a full name of type in design time i want to put it in web.config

16-bit	64bit	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
long ago i wrote 64bit multiplication and division routines for a computer the z80 that could manage 16-bit addition and subtraction with no hardware multiplication at all

331695
hash	md5
my first thought was to simply use a cryptographic hash function like md5 or sha1 but this seems like overkill security isn t important - doesn t need to be one-way and i d prefer to find something that would produce a shorter id

331716
google-chrome	safari
the quicktime player opens and plays the file correctly in firefox3 safari and google-chrome

331821
stateless	stateful
postbacks are an abstraction on top of web protocols which emulate stateful behavior over a stateless protocol

331872
mouse	keyboard
the opengl utility toolkit glut provides precisely this - you set up a bunch of event handlers for things like keyboard input mouse input redrawing the display and window resizing call the glutmainloop function and you re good to go

331887
versioning	upgrade
heck many businesses are unwilling to even upgrade to new versioning of their existing database

331890
urllib	httplib
i believe the urllib and urllib2 libraries do not support head requests so you ll have to use the lower-level httplib library

331893
public	protected
your finalize methods should be protected rather than public

331956
division	multiplication
1 multiplication and division come

for-loop	loops
i want to either test during the for-loop or after loops completes for where this empty element is and then replace it with the word other

332023
disk	ram
the only alternative i see is to use the hard disk as the memory ram rom as in the old days i guess that is what you re pointing in your else slower less demanding approach

332023
disk	ram
after getting the problem with the second approach if there are some times when you don t know how much ram is going to be consumed but you do know how much you have left you could use a mixed approach ram when you have enough rom disk when you don t

full application servers are jboss from redhat and glassfish from oracle

332079
hash	md5
i m working with some example java code for making md5 hash

332086
public	protected
it also can only go through public inheritance - it will always fail to travel through protected or private inheritance

332090
cvs	svn
svn looked promising but after trying a few projects with it i reverted to cvs

332090
cvs	svn
i wrote a blogpost on this which ends with the sentence the more i think about it svn seems to be a nerdâ s implementation to a theoretical problem whereas cvs is a pragmatic solution to a real life situation.

332093
hash	md5
this what i am using for md5 hash

332103
mouse	keyboard
capturing the screen and controlling the mouse keyboard require hooking into the os in ways that java doesn t do

332125
regasm	gacutil
on my machine i have both the sdk and visual studio running so currently i am utilizing .net sdk tools like gacutil and regasm

332146
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to the most current supported versioning of repository and or dotnetnuke

332146
post	get
you might also post over on dotnetnuke.com as i am not sure how many dotnetnuke people really frequent this site i haven t gotten much response in my attempts to get dnn discussions going here

332162
getter	setter
i have tried this in a few projects on the theory that getter and setter clutter up the code with semantically meaningless cruft and that other languages seem to do just fine with convention-based data-hiding or partitioning of responsibilities python

332162
getter	setter
just about any automated tool in the java world relies on the getter setter convention

332165
versioning	upgrade
if you plan on trying to upgrade from 2.1.1 go from it to the most current versioning of 2 then go to 3 then go to 3.3.7 then go to 4.4.1 then to 4.6.2 then to 4.9.0

such libraries exist for haskell standard ml ocaml f# and scheme

332211
postgresql	mysql
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

332213
postgresql	mysql
i think mysql get that much popular because it s available on many hosting provider and not postgresql

332230
put	get
for beginning i do not want to put excessive effort but rather would love to able to get some basic results

332254
min	max
i can change the field settings on the time data to return grouped values such as count or max but am struggling to see how this can be setup to show max time - min time for each id hence why i m thinking about heading to sql

332254
min	max
after setting the field settings on the time to max on the first and min on the second a formula can be added just outside the pivot table to calculate the differences

332254
min	max
a follow-on problem was that the formula i add is of the form getpivotdata max of time a 4 id 1 -getpivotdata min of time a 4 id 1 whici doesn t then increment when copying and pasting

332270
postgresql	mysql
you should read this interesting comparison between postgresql and mysql that really expands on the important differences

332284
onmouseover	onclick
is searching for javascript within the href and onclick onmouseover etc

332306
postgresql	mysql
postgresql was long considered the primary competitor to mysql since both are open-source

332311
width	height
this makes the figure s width 5 inches and its height 10 inches

332326
int	chars
performance checks between int varchar and chars

332383
int	chars
if the varchar will be 20 chars and the int is 4 then if you use an int your index will have five times as many nodes per page of index space on disk.

332398
vim	textmate
text editors i tried dreamweaver textmate vim

ftp clients i tried transmit mac filezilla linux ubuntu

332410
postgresql	mysql
i work for a web based company that uses mysql as it s primary db but close to a year ago we started working with gis data and decided to use postgresql for that information

332410
postgresql	mysql
i learned postgresql grudgingly and have since come to like it but at the same time it has helped me appreciate mysql even more

332424
swt	swing
this is related to swt vs swing performance issues though the differences are no so big as on java 1.4 days

332429
post	get
it turns out as this post details you can use object.prototype.tostring - the low level and generic implementation of tostring - to get the type for all built-in types

332459
postgresql	mysql
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

332519
strdup	malloc
you are missing error handling for the malloc strdup failing case btw

332566
g++	gcc
gcc g++ command line -lfoo

332602
superclass	subclassing
a in true object-oriented fashion it s possible that the superclass can exist by itself and need not be modeled in any subclassing

332607
getter	setter
i honestly don t know much about reflection but the getter setter should be straight forward

332615
int	chars
of course student_type could just as easily be an int i m just showing it as a chars for illustration purposes

332615
superclass	subclassing
i read your followup about making sure a row exists in some subclassing table for every row in the superclass table

332667
for-loop	loops
while loops instead of a for-loop

332674
postgresql	mysql
another list of reasons why mysql is bad can be found at this excellent comparison versus postgresql

332681
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works great in firefox safari and opera

332697
google-chrome	firefox
the site has been added to the internet explorer trusted sites list and tried in firefox and google-chrome all with the same result

332703
equals	gethashcode
i ve also tried overridding equals and gethashcode to use the id

332703
set	bag
the xml needs to be changed from bag to set for all collections and the entitities themselves were changed to implement icomparable which is a requirement of a set for uniqueness to be established

332731
config	ini
then i load an ini format file with parse_ini_file and use array_merge to map the keys into your class config array

332742
yacc	bison
for many years the de facto tool for generating code to parse a grammar was yacc or its gnu cousin bison

332742
yacc	bison
lately i ve heard there are a couple of new kids on the block but the principle is the same you write a declarative grammar in a format that is more or less in backus-naur form bnf and yacc bison whatever generates some code for you that would be extremely tedious to write by hand

332742
yacc	bison
edit given your followup question about other tools yacc bison of course are best for c c++ projects since they generate c code

332749
yacc	bison
not new code - but were they new they d still use yacc or a close relative bison byacc ...

332823
yacc	bison	yacc	cup	bison	cup
i don t know about yacc bison specifically but i have used antlr cup jlex and javacc

332840
superclass	subclassing
the superclass table has a subclassing code column

332840
superclass	subclassing
each of the subclassing tables has a foreign key constraint as well as one that dictates that the id exist with a subset of the superclass table where code athlete

332840
superclass	subclassing
the only missing part here is that it s possible to model a superclass without a subclassing

332840
superclass	subclassing
that can be fixed by adding a constraint that the superclass s ids exist in a union of the ids in the subclassing tables

332842
bazaar	git
subversion and git did not have issues with this neither did bazaar iirc

332905
strcpy	strcmp	atoi	strcpy	atoi	strcmp
look in the msdn documentation i m assuming you are on windows there are tchar equivalents for atoi and all the basic string functions strcpy strcmp etc.

332911
apache	lighttpd
also you could consider using lighttpd if possible instead of apache

332920
inherited	subclassing
protected - open only to the class and its subclassing inherited

332933
public	protected
so protected is between default and public access

332934
inherited	subclassing
open only to the classes on the same package the class and its subclassing inherited

332936
rss	feed
i want to work with multiple rss feed

332960
postgresql	mysql
this is much less prevalent now mysql postgresql sqlite etc

332975
profiler	aqtime
aqtime is an instrumenting profiler

332975
profiling	instrumentation
instrumenting profiling often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured

332988
post	get
however when you then add a new mapping get post and try to browse to the file you get a 404

332988
post	get
if you remove the mapping and try and post or get to it you get a 405

333000
consistency	acid
databases need to attain all the acid elements atomicity consistency isolation durability and if you re going to ensure that s all done in a flat file especially with concurrent access you ve basically written a full-blown dbms

333000
postgresql	mysql
you ll save yourself the time and money involved with writing and re-writing many times i ll guarantee if you just go with one of the free options sqlite mysql postgresql and so on

333002
post	get
it might be some sort of proxy which creates a get request out of a given post request.

there are actually four levels of access public protected private default also known as package private or package protected

333046
unix	bsd
for unix linux bsd there s pthread library tutorial

333094
trie	tree
in this case it we used a trie data structure as a dictionary a tree of characters where the leaf node contains the value for the string used as key if the key is bounded then its lookup time can be considered o 1 if i define a character field as having at most k characters in length which can be a reasonable assumption for many cases

333128
innodb	myisam
myisam files are okay to take a copy whilst running but innodb files are not really safe to do that and windows mysql defaults to innodb files

333129
integer	unsigned
so in essence they are putting two pieces of information in that single unsigned integer - which square was tapped the low bits and were the touches beginning or ending the high bit

333144
inherited	properties
inherited objects cannot have navigation properties - if you have a person class and then a customer and supplier those customer and suppliers cannont have navigation properties

333144
inherited	properties
these are generally not show-stopper items for navigation properties we just don t use inherited on entity framework for now but might be something of interest to yourself

333147
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i tried gridbaglayout gave up then tried boxlayout then gave up then made my own custom layout which worked

333165
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
i use to go for gridbaglayout for the control but since java1.6 i m going to use grouplayout is awsome

333166
int	boolean
primitives int boolean etc. are special cases in java

333198

in my naive jdbc way i would prepare and execute a statement and then begin to loop through the recordset

333216
getter	setter
with appropriate getter and setter

333305
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
it allows for tcp pings like the standard ruby ping but also udp http and icmp pings

333306
public	protected
if you keep the class constructor public or protected and only use the pattern to create a global not to enforce a single instance you can at least test your singleton class

333322
min	max
right click on each and specify min as the summarization function for one and max for the other

333327
richfaces	tomahawk
maybe you can have a look to tomahawk or richfaces that provide good calendar component.

this code works fine in firefox but safari for some reason doesn t submit the form

333329
firefox	safari
same result works in firefox doesn t work in safari

333334
return-value-optimization	nrvo
depending on the content of the function the compiler will be able to perform nrvo that is named return-value-optimization which means that in the optimal case returning a vector has no overhead it s never copied

333340
post	get
would you create a get form element instead that would post to search.aspx

333381
pop-up	dialog
if this yields true pop-up a directory selection dialog where the user can specify where they want to save their data

333406
ant	maven
both ant and maven can run junit 4 tests just fine

333431
width	height
title lead body columns that are all of type nvarchar while a picture might have something like alttext path width height

333440
activemq	rabbitmq
apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine

333473
getter	setter
the problem with this solution is that it violates dry - for each class creator i would have to write setter getter in thecreator

333499
getter	setter
i know getter and setter are now available in the latest release of all major browsers except ie

333556
post	get
furthermore the secondary workaround - involving the aquisition of data through script tags - is only going to support get requests which you might be able to hack with a soap service but not so much with the post request to a restful service you describe

333571
width	height
the application then resizes changes the width and height of the image

333604
width	height
try graphics.drawimage bmp 0 0 width height

333631
webkit	gecko
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria

333657
post	get
easy just use the head method instead of get or post

333657
onreadystatechange	onload
production code may need more fine-grained callbacks for different result states success failure timeout and may use different event handlers onload onerror and ontimeout rather than onreadystatechange

333723
opera	safari
lets starts with javascript ecmascript today you have to make one version for mozilla opera safari and another version for ie

333723
opera	firefox
both opera and firefox support some css3

pascal	delphi
the newer languages either bypass the linker altogether the interpreted and vm languages or use custom linkers turbo pascal i assume delphi too

334135
superclass	subclassing
also some suggestions on how to move the data that is stored in the database for the future abstract superclass into one of the concrete subclassing

334136
bmp	png
with bmp and png as well

334146
hide	show
one solution could be to wrap the inner text in a span and hide the span when you want the background image of the div to show

334172
temp	tmp
enviroment variablies temp and tmp are

334199
multiplying	add
add your 20 - 25 mb to outlook s 30+ ie s 20+ word s 25+ and excel s 25+ multiplying by the number of terminal users and hopefully you can see where they might be coming from

334201
filtering	grouping
for an extremely simple query like this there s not a big difference in readability but for large queries i find that having my join criteria grouping in with listing out the table makes it much easier to see where i might have issues in my join and let s me keep all my filtering in my where clause

334279
nant	xmlpoke
i m trying to get it for nant xmlpoke task without success

334332
scalapack	mpi
they are usually treated as separate nodes and programmed with stuff like mpi and scalapack to distribute the elements of matrices onto multiple nodes

334335
try-catch	exception-handling
if try-catch blocks are catching very generic exception-handling then i would say it is defensive programming in the same way that never driving out of your neighborhood is defensive driving

334335
try-catch	exception-handling
a try-catch imo should be tailored to specific exception-handling

334338
try-catch	exception-handling
putting code into try-catch blocks when you know the types of exception-handling that can be thrown is one thing

334352
putty	winscp
there are plugins that exist that allow you up open winscp or putty from within eclipse

334357
superclass	subclassing
remember these will only have the columns that are unique to the subclassing columns that are shared will remain in the superclass

334357
superclass	subclassing
then select the rows from the superclass table that belong in each subclassing and move the data

334437
onmouseover	onclick

i ll be synchronizing data about users between ad and a database currently mysql but may turn into sql server or postgresql

334606
opera	safari
safari and opera showed the ugly url

334623
yacc	bison
iirc bnf grammars are just different enough from what yacc bison want as input to be really annoying if you intend to feed these files into a parser generator you may want to look for files in the appropriate format

334626
button	checkbox
in fact if you hold down the mouse click never releasing it after you clicked on the checkbox area the selection remains highlighted until you release the mouse button

334716
post	get
get parameters are cached by the web browser post is not

mxmlc	compc
you can also use this file as an argument to compc or mxmlc if you d like

335104
pascal	delphi
it can do a lot of things but it doesn t even try to produce object pascal code as its output and it hasn t been updated since delphi 6

335244
firefox	safari
the following code will successfully set a cookie in firefox 3 ie 7 and safari pc

335263
octal	hex
it doesn t recognize ip addresses with octal or hex formatting but that s acceptable for my application

335274
isapi	httpmodule
i know i m definitely not interested in writing an isapi filter and i m not really running in the asp.net environment so httpmodule is probably useless to me as well

335308
post	get
ok i m going to try the ajax suggestion but i m not sure how the code is formatted with get and post

335333
submit	submission
a true return value will allow the page to continue submission and a false will stop the postback submit

335366
tostring	icomparable
it would need to implement icomparable and have a tostring that displays the desired text

335379
filesystems	ntfs
in sql server 2008 you can apply the filestream attribute to a varbinary column and sql server then stores the data for that column on the local ntfs filesystems

335394
apache	lighttpd
the images on a filesystem are more easily cached by the web server apache mod_mmap or could be served by leaner web server like lighttpd

335404
cvs	svn
we ve also added a special keyword nocheckin we ve added a commit-hook to our source control system very easy to do with at least cvs or svn where it scans all files and refuses to check in the file if it finds the text nocheckin anywhere

335478
unsigned	short
in visual c++ 6.0 wchar_t is normally a typedef for unsigned short whereas in later versions it is a distinct built-in type

335571
hex	binary
it also discusses sending binary as well as hex data to the serial port

335632
width	height
use a rectangle to surround each player and enemy the height and width of the rectangles should correspond to the object you re surrounding imagine it being in a box only big enough to fit it

335632
width	height
otherwise you can get the x and y co-ordinates of the boxes and using the height width of them detect whether they ve intersected yourself

335641
mouse	trackpad
also my laptop trackpad can cause odd mouse behavior if i bounce my thumb against it

335655
versioning	upgrade
i m not sure how applicable this is to your particular example but i ve personally run into problems where symbols from the stl library i used conflicted with the ones in the third party library when i upgrade to a new versioning

335660
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
take a corner as an anchor point subtract this corner from each point scale it then add it to the point again and multiplying each points x and y by the factor with which the box has gotten bigger

335692
multiplying	add
to get the final coordinate you just multiplying the the now scaled components with their respective vector and add them together

335758
width	height
you can do collision detection by simply comparying the x and y width and height values of the bounding boxes rectangle for each of the objects that could potentially collide

335758
width	height
i don t have the rectangle class infront of me but its most likely something like x y width and finally height

335758
width	height
the width and height are self explanatory i think

335758
width	height
they ll most likely come out from the right of the players location though so if the x and y were bothe at 0 and your width and height were both at 256 you wouldn t see anything because the character would be at the top left outside of the screen

335781
ant	maven
we are in the process of converting our main build process from ant to maven

335781
maven	pom.xml
the problem with this method is that the maven install plugin only uses the version in the pom.xml file not the version passed in on the command line

335796
accurev	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	accurev
but from my experience it just can t beat the commercial alternatives especially accurev but also clearcase perforce etc. which will give you much more than what svn is capabale

335807
for-loop	loops
so i decided to make a single for-loop to replace the first two foreach loops and convert the values in one fell swoop the third loops is quasi-necessary although i m sure with some working i could also put it into the single loops

335830
width	height
your player should have x y width and height variables

335833
width	height
i have an object lets call it mobject that has a number of properties say x and y coordinates height and width

335833
width	height
unfortunately the xml elements are named differently -- x and y height and width note the capitalization

335866
addition	multiplication
and the three new points can be found using scalar multiplication and vector addition

335885
uitableview	uipickerview
i am looking for a way to slide a uipickerview and uidatepickerview up over a view uitableview in particular when a particular button press takes place

335885
uitableview	uipickerview
i understand how to get the events for clicks into the uitableview but there doesn t seem to be a good way to have the uipickerview slide up on top of it.

335888
hash	md5
currently i use the md5 algorithm to hash the users password for storage in the database

335897
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ use setenv malloc_check_ 0 to revisit the old ways. resulting under dec unix in the same memory being allocated to two different objects

335911
hash	md5
it s not necessarily that you shouldn t use md5 as much it s that you shouldn t use just md5 as this leaves you vulnerable to rainbow-table attacks a rainbow table is a table of precomputed hash values - if your password is even remotely common or simple the attacker needs merely to look up the hash and he knows your plaintext password.

335913
hash	md5
it would still take some work to crack a hash made with md5 but it s several times easier than guessing the password by brute-force

335975
integer	unsigned
it darn well should be for numbers as small as 64 million and the cube of that fits in a 64bit unsigned integer barely

336043
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
all the filtering sorting grouping and custom layout stuff you re probably used to plus card layouts amd more

336048
int	chars
int or chars

336080
maven	pom.xml
then in the distributionmanagement section of your pom.xml enable unique versions for the snapshotrepository via see maven s pom.xml reference on this

336089
width	height
main_window window width 500px height 350px

336089
width	height
main_window window width 500px height 350px

336089
width	height
bold true align center x 10px y 10px width 300px height 100px

336089
width	height
my_edit editbox placeholder x 10px y 110px width 300px height 100px

336089
width	height
on_click handler module.file.btn_clicked x 10px y 210px width 300px height 100px

336142
free	malloc
allocating on the heap using new delete or malloc free is very slow

336153
treemap	treeset
afaik the treeset treemap classes don t actually expose any of their internals and merely conform to the set map interface

336301
width	height
sometimes to make it play nice with ie you may have to specify a width or a height

336368
postgresql	mysql
i can take my activerecord model and move it from mysql to postgresql to sqlite thank you very much

336506
bluetooth	usb
this enumeration will contain ethernet cards usb networking devices etc and i need to retrieve the bluetooth network interface in particular

336535
google-chrome	firefox
my main browsers firefox and google-chrome are both configured for a 12 pixel font

336535
google-chrome	firefox
when i view the site in ie 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome 0.4 the font displays as expected and matches the font pickers except in ie where it s a little larger

336672
mouse	keyboard
i need a javascript which monitors keyboard and mouse events to track how much time a user spends on the page

336690
int	boolean
it appears that strings int units boolean are passed by value

336704
disk	ram
if there s any chance you can throw 2 or better 4 more gigabyte of ram into your server you would be very better with leaving that disk reading thing to the os if it has enough ram to load files in some disk cache it will and from them any read on them won t even hit the disk

336704
disk	ram
if you have enough ram to let the os do disk caching and you really want the files to get loaded you could always do a little script program that will go through your hierarchy and read all the files

336750
onmouseover	onclick
theoretically all dom elements can react on events like onclick onmouseover onkeypress etc

336758
disk	ram
that will also keep the directory of all files in ram so you don t have to access the disk to find a file that happens before you can start loading it

336779
hash	md5
as most have already said md5 was designed for variable length data streams to be hash to a fixed length chunk of data so a single hash is shared by many input data streams

336791
ada	pascal
the and or operators in languages like ada visual basic and pascal do not short-circuit

336805
pull	push
basically where requires the interested party to pull data from a source push linq lets you push data through a source and interested parties can subscribe to events corresponding to another element has just gone past and the data has finished

336823
disk	ram
if you are on linux i would give the good old ram disk a try

336823
disk	ram
as you were talking about vfs that also has a ram disk provider but i would still try the native ram disk approach first

336898
versioning	upgrade
it seems to me that after i have upgrade my acrobat reader from versioning 8 to versioning 9 the loadfile method returns true when the file is opened correctly where versioning 8 returned false

336925
firefox	safari
edit it works in safari but not in firefox

336937
voip	sip
i looking for a way to programmatically start a voip call using the sip stack on a s60 symbian mobile phone

336939
width	height
i would suggest giving the div fixed width and height -- either always or when one of the classes that displays an image is used

336939
width	height
use the width and height of your background image if you want the whole thing displayed

337083
squeak	visualworks
the server is connected to the scm of choice like monticello for squeak smalltalk or store for visualworks

337139
opera	safari
edit works fine on opera 9.50 and safari 3.1

337183
post	get
i d like to output html controls using xslt but i need to be able to name the controls so that i can get at them when the form post back

337241
getter	setter
after all there are mainly just generated getter setter

337252
getter	setter
which would create a readonly backing variable a property with only a getter and translate all calls to the setter into direct access to the variable

337253
accessor	properties
when auto-implementing the properties you have to have a set accessor to at least give it a value during construction

337257
getter	setter
so the conclusion is you should not test getter and setter without code those which just assign or read a field without any additional code

337257
getter	setter
the exception is when you manually write those getter setter because you could have made a typo

337257
getter	setter
but even then some code will use these and there should be a test for that code which in turn tests whether the getter setter behave correctly

337362
ienumerable	iqueryable
while still on the server however i would recommend that you leave it as it s default which is not ienumerable but rather iqueryable

337408
javassist	cglib
i don t think you can make hibernate or any external framework call a private constructor on your objects unless it s through some javassist or cglib runtime created subclass

337410
comparator	comparable
apart from the sortedmap you could have a where you supply the comparator to sort the pairs or make your pair class implement comparable and do it there

337411
put	get
well i didn t get a response and figured out how to modify my command so that it put the name in all the fields in the column so i can pull it now via command.personname

337503
int	chars
a short chars x or int or other relatively small numeric type column that can serve as a row identifier column

337519
wordpress	joomla
i moved an ex-site based on joomla to wordpress

337519
post	put
because there is only 50 or so articles i thought will be a good idea to put a rule for each post in .htaccess

337578
ready	each
once your data is ready you can invalidate the control - this will call retrievevirtualitem again for each of the visible items

337636
put	get
if you don t specify override keyword you will get method that hides base type and warning from compiler to put new keyword for the method to explicitly state so

337731
verilog	vhdl
it covers both vhdl and verilog

337750
int	double
in other words how would a function taking int returning a pointer to a function taking bool returning a pointer to a function taking double and returning void would look like

337756
opends	apacheds
so far i ve briefly looked at apacheds and opends which seem to be embeddable

337764
int	chars
for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

337820
hide	show
disable this enable that hide this show that

337990
stdout	stderr
deamon programs close stdin stdout stderr purposedly and use logging instead so that you have to manage this yourself i would suggest to use subprocess.pipe

338006
folder	directory
- should then be added using a virtual directory pointing to their folder

338035
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
for instance if you are using the wcf service to perform mathematics on 2 values you might have 4 members on the service side add x y subtract x y multiplying x y divide x y

338035
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
example peformcalculation obj where obj has x y and action add subtract multiplying divide properties

338037
ubuntu	linux
i tried this in the terminal of both mac os x 10.5 and linux ubuntu gutsy gibbon and it s the same result

338092
wordpress	joomla
since the conversion of your site over to wordpress is relatively new is there anything preventing you from using the old joomla

338153
button	checkbox
if you go on to the validation website and download the whole package that included the demo files you can find the one with example of validating checkbox and radio button

338183
postgresql	mysql
if you can use a wee bit of vendor-specific sql features you can use microsoft sybase top n or mysql postgresql limit

338190
vb.net	vb6
this feature exists because vb.net emulates the vb6 method of being able to refer to a default instance of a form through it s name

338199
httphandler	httpmodule
i don t know for sure - but i d bet that code is buried in one of the sharepoint httpmodule or httphandler that run for every request

338213
postgresql	mysql
but if you re not locked into oracle go with postgresql or mysql

338217
wxpython	textctrl
i have a textctrl in my wxpython program and i d like to set its width to exactly 3 characters

338275
multiplying	add
if you still want to try this the key is to get the width of a character in pixels multiplying it by the number of characters then add some padding for the borders around the characters

338290
stdout	stdio
your problem is that printf and anything else that uses the stdio library to write to stdout standard output is buffered - line buffered if it goes to the console and size buffered if it goes to a file

338290
stdout	fflush
if you do a fflush stdout

338290
stdout	stderr
i m not 100 sure but i think stderr isn t buffered which can cause confusion because you might see output you made to stderr before output you previously made to stdout

338327
post	get
wonderful day i get to post about wicket again

338350
post	get
if you re doing anything else file your solution under ugly hack and use get and or post like you should

338365
switching	screens
i am thinking of writing some code to switching the active display back to the laptop screens when the computer resumes from hibernate

338383
vb.net	vb6
this feature exists because vb.net emulates the vb6 method of being able to refer to a default instance of a form through it s name

338397
hide	show
bcb tends to hide a lot of detailed error info when compiling from the ide - using the command line compiler tends to show the real error

338417
win64	windows
i have just installed the platform sdk for windows server 2008 and .net 3.5 on my new system and for the first time tried to compile a project for win64

338435
integer	unsigned
int or unsigned long int for integer

338476
int	boolean
however objects that belong to the primitive data types which includes boolean number int uint and string have special operators that make them behave as if they were passed by value

338484
dokuwiki	pmwiki
i like dokuwiki but pmwiki might be better for you

338502
onclick	onchange
what is probably happening in your javascript is that the onclick event is called by the javascript engine before the onchange event is called

338523
versioning	upgrade
the best things that i like about the upgrade versioning of vs are

338537
config	ini
i am using zend_config_ini config adapter i prefer ini for base config

338624
chunked	transfer-encoding
i am making an http connection to an iis web server and sending a post request with the data encoded using transfer-encoding chunked

338624
chunked	transfer-encoding
when i try the same thing against apache i get a 411 length required status and a message saying chunked transfer-encoding forbidden

338671
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
the jsp expression language operator or its alias eq performs comparison with the equals method although some coercions are performed if one of the objects is a special type bigdecimal biginteger double float long int short byte chars boolean or string

338694
cpu	processors
even one when a single thread running that thread is yielding cpu time with other threads of other applications assuming a single processors machine to keep the discussion simple

338694
min	max
while setting max for 1 and min for 2 3 it could be like this

338703
post	get
i can tag on-line web links blog post questions on stackoverflow.com and all kinds of web-centric miscellany but this very basic concept still seems to be missing or hideously crippled in the few operating systems i get to use

338762
phong	shading
i am trying to add the fresnel effect to the outer edges of an object combining that effect with phong shading and i think that the angle is the only thing i am missing

338772
int	chars
in java simple data types such as int and chars operate just as in c.

338795
ssl	https
it turns out that the https site was created using a physical copy of the actual site under the ssl port this means there were 2 versions of the site being served under the same domain name one under port 80 and one under port 443

338815
preorder	postorder
however the other posters are right java doesn t expose any of the tree mechanics so a preorder or postorder isn t possible at this view

338821
wordpress	joomla
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though

338821
wordpress	joomla
opensourcecms contains demos for both joomla and wordpress

338821
wordpress	joomla
in my past web development experience i ve used both joomla and wordpress for my clients

338821
wordpress	joomla
joomla typically requires having a sit-down with the client to go over the basic features of how to use the software while wordpress is easy enough for the client to figure out without any assistance

338821
wordpress	joomla
however the wordpress sites i ve worked with that require more than the standard blogging features e-commerce image galleries forums usually involve integrating wordpress with a separate software application while joomla more often than not has those plugins available for it

338821
wordpress	phpbb
the end result is a website with several applications on it installed wordpress coppermine phpbb each with separate logins and admin screens

338872
client-side	server-side
nothing is wrong with combining the server-side generated html with the client-side generated one but if it is a complicated procedure it is better to keep it in one place on the server in your case

338914
caliburn	prism
both caliburn and prism are very nice

338967
put	get	filesystems	fat
if you have hundreds of thousands of files to store on a filesystems and you put them all in a single directory you ll get to a point where the directory inode will grow so fat that it will takes minutes to add remove a file from that directory and you might even get to the point where the inode won t fit in memory and you won t be able to add remove or even touch the directory

339021
implements	extends
what i typically do for a listview is to implements my own adapter by extends the handy baseadapter class

339042
min	max
that is if the min value is say 0.2 and the max value is 0.6 any texel less than 0.2 will become 0 any texel greater than 0.6 will become 1.0 and all values in between will be mapped from 0 to 1.0

339148
put	get
then for each line get the first word put 0 in the accumulator if it does not exist increment it return

339243
width	height
object height 20 width 200

339243
width	height
embed src url to music autostart false loop false height 20 width 200

339298
put	get
you need to get the value from the querystring and put it into a php variable

339312
apache	lighttpd
from a security point of view i d prefer that it would be impossible to find out if i m running php on apache asp.net on iis or even rails on lighttpd

339316
put	get
put this somewhere in your receiving end and you ll get an understanding of whats happening

339326
inherited	properties
if you want this available from within your xaml code-behinds you could inherited from the wpf window class and add two properties for the principal and identity

339381
post	get
with file wrappers you can use file_get_contents to access http resources pretty much just get requests no post

339429
switching	screens
the screens program that allow multiple virtual consoles under a single terminal session for example you can run several apps under a single ssh connection and switching between them as well as other cool things

339455
google-chrome	firefox
i ve seen this in google-chrome ie7 and firefox 3

339461
uielement	xamlreader
when they have edited it use the xamlreader to parse the file and then display the resulting uielement in your window

339469
button	checkbox
what i want to do is create a button that will open up a query in table form simple then have checkbox so an employee can select for example 100 contacts to send an email to out of the 110 in the table and then send a mass email such as a newsletter not so simple

339497
des	aes
while des could be cracked in hours aes requires 150 trillion with year 2001 hardware years to crack aes

339515
sproutcore	cappuccino
i have recently got a lot of inspiration from the work of sproutcore and cappuccino which are both javascript web frameworks inspired by cocoa

339544
vmware	virtualbox
to second eric s comment about virtualbox not only is it free but it doesn t load processes bloat to your host os as vmware does

339650
decimal	ieee
float ieee 754 int etc are pretty ubiquitous here but decimal is bespoke to .net

339663
folder	directory
the virtual folder in the web apps root directory is pointing at a share on a remote server via a unc path

339671
post	get
i seem to agree with him as most new programmers who start with asp.net do not understand web get post and state management

339682
post	get
with mvc you learn both about web get post and state management while at the same time getting the advantage of using your favorite oo language

339715
post	get
the best you ll be able to do is get javascript to read and edit the xml then post that data to a server-side script to write to file

339734
vsts	tfs
if that is the case and you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2008 then using the get latest version on checkout setting of both is probably your answer if you aren t then the checkout and get latest version is what you investigate

339734
vsts	tfs
note if you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2005 you ll need to do the compile yourself see the notes at the bottom of the home page

339747
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
i have a problem now - there are a few pages that have used autoresetevent and manualresetevent for aync and not the standard registerasynctask

339748
perl	tcl
officially perl python and tcl

339775
client-side	server-side
both server-side and client-side validation are performed unless the browser does not support client-side validation or client-side validation is explicitly disabled by setting the enableclientscript property to false

339803
google-chrome	firefox
also note the space between the white line and the box border - that s not there in firefox or google-chrome either only ie

339810
subclass	abstract-class
one way is to write an abstract test case that corresponds to your abstract-class then write concrete test cases that subclass your abstract test case

339810
subclass	abstract-class
do this for each concrete subclass of your original abstract-class your test case hierarchy mirrors your class hierarchy

339819
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
a manualresetevent is a variation on autoresetevent

339850
websphere	ibm

339857
verilog	vhdl
ghdl is a free vhdl simulator which is an alternative to verilog

339857
verilog	vhdl
download the gtkwave waveform viewer for use with verilog and vhdl simulators

339903
qsort	bsearch
example library functions qsort and bsearch

339926
opera	firefox
in opera and firefox i just say in css something like this

339939
width	height
the rectangles all have the same shape for example 2 inches wide x 1 inch tall - let s refer to this size as sw and sh for the width and height

339956
mouse	keyboard
user can use keyboard or mouse

339967
getter	setter
agree with moritzstefaner that you don t need the subtraction stage however for your setter i actually think you should use globaltolocal and use localtoglobal for your getter

339988
folder	directory
add the base folder to the project project properties - configuration properties - c c++ - additional include directory additional include directory

339996
children	parent
in a nutshell you attach your event handler to a parent object instead of the children

339996
children	parent
since the handler is attached to the parent you can add or remove children without worrying about leaks

340015
matlab	simulink
hdl coder is a companion product to matlab simulink to automatically generate your hardware description

340054
width	height

width	height
height + sy width + sx

340054
width	height
num_tiles tiles sx sy rows columns width height i

340069
getter	setter
for your ui you will most likely keep a string form of the number anyway with conversions to and from float in the getter setter

340071
winpcap	libpcap
some oss using winpcap or libpcap

340088
swt	swing
an extremely flexible and easy to use layout manager that works for both swing and swt

340095
freemarker	velocity
if it helps at all - something like java s freemarker or velocity libraries

340107
min	max
in addition to not using decimal as has already been suggested you could santise your max min values somewhere else so that you didn t need all those abs calls all over the place

340107
multiplying	add
i suspect that only part of this you need to do repeatedly is a floating point multiplying followed or proceeded by a floating point add

340109
min	max
for example are you using the same min and max repeatedly

340131
hide	show
i would not reccomend using style to hide something it will show up in browsers without or with disabled css suppor and look strange

340141
min	max
ok it assumes that intervaltop intervalbottom and min max

awt	swing
using the font is lots easier in swing unlike in awt

340782

340805
superclass	subclassing
the type of a single superclass instance can be derived by the presence or absence of foreign keys in the various subclassing tables

340811
int	double
using native types like int double etc

340811
int	double
and void-pointers for a container is nearly always an icky affair because you have either the choice to cast the int for a double this doesn t work to a pointer or you need to allocate extra memory for the data type

340811
int	double
i never needed a hash-table or a map for int or double

340865

341026
mouse	keyboard
if constantly jump between mouse and keyboard you lose this advantage

341049
put	get
believe it or not the validity of a rabbinic divorce document get depends on it being perfectly accurate which means that over the past few hundred years rabbis have standardized which sounds get mapped to which letters but it s often influenced by yiddish and has extra letters put in alephs mostly which modern israelis would find puzzling

341130
vim	emacs
i work in a unix environment with the typical unix tools emacs vim gvim sunstudio etc

otoh if you gripe about symbian s little keyboard quirk take a gander at mouse events in android s mini-chrome.

341950
button	checkbox
each record in the gv had 2 button and one checkbox

341992
cvs	svn
i have done this with our svn setup and have seen it done with cvs as well...it s effective to a certain degree because it forces the developer to submit correct code and keeps your repository tidy

342007
ftp	telnet	nntp	telnet
from codeproject - only links starting with one of the recognized protocols http file mailto ftp https gopher nntp prospero telnet news wais outlook are recognized and reformatted

i ve had problems with security thread.currentprincipal etc on cassini that just disappeared when i started debugging against iis

342163
ssl	https
this certificate must then be imported into the web server to enable https over ssl

342170

stdout	stderr
have a look at processbuilder class it gives you the option to capture the stdout and stderr of the process that it launches

342473
profiling	benchmarking
for keeping track and know everything about what your code does and how much resources it consumes i recommend you to use a profiling for php i the xdebug profiling there are also other options like apd and benchmarking profiling

342491
integer	radix
you can use big integer s tostring radix method like

342521
hex	binary
then open the compiled binary with a hex editior and look for it

342543
pop-up	dialog
seeing how the .net s page progress window that pop-up isn t a dialog the back ground can be selected which then comes to the front in a half drawn locked up manner

342544
children	parent
especially avoiding the dreaded n+1 situation where you do one query for a parent record then an extra query for each of its children

342575
profiling	debugging
2 ways to debugging this either get a real heap profiling that can show you where your runaway class data is referenced or patch the api classes as described here

342696
pascal	delphi
i know delphi pascal supports them and as the inno scripting engine is based on it i m hoping it is supported

342705
ubuntu	debian
as used on debian and ubuntu

342734
trie	tree
a ternary tree trie would be more efficient

342764
getchar	fgetc
it is the value that getchar or fgetc getc returns if the stream is at end-of-file or a read error occurs

342764
int	chars
it is defined by the c standard as being negative whereas getchar returns chars as an unsigned chars converted to int

342775
trie	tree
both of the above are subject to steven a lowe s point that for strings a trie beats a normal tree

342785
put	get
i m assuming that since they are on a private network you re not running your own dns and thus to get at them via protocols that use ip names you need to put entries in hosts manually

342850
openbsd	freebsd
ifstated can be used as a front-end with pf on openbsd and freebsd to redirect traffic to online servers

342945
post	get
in your server-side code you would look into the post or get data for the name of the checkbox

342978
textile	bbcode
markdown bbcode textile mediawiki markup are all basically the same general concept so i would really just lump this into two categories html and plain text markup

343076
int	double
first as mentioned previously you need lf instead of d to display the double otherwise it will just display zero all the time d is for a signed int

343160
lisp	scheme
good sources include lisp in small pieces and marc feeley s scheme in 90 minutes presentation

343161
hide	show
for a solution if you only need to show or hide a div the best way is to do it from javascript client side by changing the style visibility of that div and not by cloning it

343191
superclass	subclassing
superclass receive this message before their subclassing

343196
bazaar	git
here is a comparison table between git hg and bazaar

concave	convex
i found the computational geometry algorithms library in my search for an algorithm to decompose a concave polygon into the minimum number of convex components

343218
onfocus	onblur
i ve encountered this annoying feature before and my solution at the time was to use the onfocus event to record the current value of the text box and then use the onblur event to check whether the current value now matches the value saved during onfocus

343240
wav	aiff
i already know how to record but only to lossless formats such as wav and aiff

343288
post	get
i envision enabling all interaction with the site via post and get which would look something like this

343288

rest requires get post put and delete

343299
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
edit i m currently using system.data.oracleclient but willing to accept solutions using another provider odp.net devart etc..

343309
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
do you use odp.net or the devart provider aka as corelab provider or do you use the microsoft provider for oracle system.data.oracleclient

343356
google-chrome	firefox
i can run firefox or google-chrome and get another session but the app isn t supported in these browsers

343439
pull	push
consider using some ipc that involves only a push or a pull and not both as does the filesystem such as an http post a jms or msmq queue etc

343441
hash	md5
the client uses the md5 hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of the data and password combined and then sends the fingerprint as a response

343466
ilist	icollection
i know about interfaces such as ilist and icollection which do offer a count property but it seems like these interfaces were designed for mutable data structures first and use as a read only interface seems like an afterthought - the presence of an isreadonly field and mutators throwing exceptions when this property is true is imo ample evidence for this

343478
ienumerable	icollection
the key difference between the icollection family and the ienumerable family is the absence of certainty as to the count of items present quite often the items will be generated loaded hydrated as needed - in some cases an enumerable may not ever finish generating results which is why the count is missing

343486
ilist	icollection
ilist or icollection would be the way to go if you want to use the standard interfaces

343551
vmware	virtualbox
between hyperv vmware and virtualbox there are much better alternatives available

343570
libc	newlib
gcc-source configure --target arm-elf --prefix toolchain-prefix --enable-interwork --enable-multilib --with-float soft --enable-languages c c++ --with-newlib --with-headers newlib-source newlib libc include

int	boolean
i would probably create a type adapter for converting a boolean to an int

343794
post	get
if the method attribute is post case insensitive get the action attribute to get the url of the request can be relative

343794
post	get
these names and values must be url encoded in get requests but not in post ones

343797
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools

343951
sum	datepart
select t.taskname sum case when datepart d tt.taskdate 1 tt.taskhours else 0 end as sunday

343951

343995
crypt	hash
i d like to maintain the same user base but the passwords are hash using the php crypt function

343995
crypt	hash
crypt in this case is using the crypt_md5 implementation - the hash all start with 1

343995
crypt	md5
i ve tried phalanger but it doesn t have an md5 implementation of the crypt function

343995
crypt	md5
the c# example of crypt on codeproject uses des not md5

344020
width	height
one rule of thumb i ve found is to never set the actual height or width properties of a control

344080
post	get
for web apps on the other hand the only communication with the server is get and post requests so the user interface is much clunkier

344132
vbscript	jscript
but i prefer using cscript vbscript or even jscript

344263
sorting	filtering
i want to pass the params collection from the controller to the model to parse filtering and sorting conditions

344281
folder	directory
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for

344281
folder	directory
it would then move the selected folder to a specific centralized backup directory - where it would also generate a readme.txt file outlining the backup details

344310
bazaar	git
i quite like bazaar but git is very popular too although i don t know how good its windows support is since it is primarily a nix tool developed for the linux kernel

344419
folder	directory
bonus what if i want to place that folder outside the public directory

344425
googletest	cppunit
i ve had success with both cppunit and googletest

the problem is that nant is invoked from teamcity which runs under the system account on the build server and there is no way that i can find to give the build server system account access to the dmz webserver directories

344670
public	protected
you want propertyofbase to act as public in the context of mytype.mymethod but to be protected in all other situations

344673
children	parent
using a list array will mean doing some index book-keeping to traverse the tree so it might be easiest to use just keep references to the children in the parent

344698
google-chrome	firefox
the usual suspects visual studio sql management studio firefox google-chrome etc..

344761
width	height
a desktop app tends to be built for a minimum height width resolution often 800 600 and tries as hard as it can to fit all the relevant information into a size smaller than that because scroll bars are generally very bad practice for non-tabular list data

344763
nofollow	noindex
chances are the search spiders are already especially google yahoo and msn searching the nofollow pages because they still have to hit those pages to see if they have a noindex

344781
cpu	irq
seriously even if you would have all the specs for all the components usb dma irq your cpu... you will find that a some things are not specified what happens if you send a certain sequence to your usb device and b some things are just bugged and you need to work around them the dozens of bugs in the cpu that are detailed in the cpu errata that both intel and amd publish

344949
folder	directory
i also randomly open a lot of putty sessions to various machines so i like to create a bin directory in my home folder add it to the path and then create a shortcut to putty in it named p among other shortcuts

344964
getter	setter
it s important to make sure the new property has both getter and setter or you ll wind up with really odd behavior

344997
cvs	svn
doesn t always follow cvs svn semantics and isn t organized around files

345001
versioning	upgrade
we have a xcopy versioning and click once deployment of it that allows the user to click on a link in the browser to download and install.when we upgrade the app all we need to do is to publish it on to the server and send an email with a link

my task appears simple at first dial into a terminal over a modem login possibly send some other characters and then receive file s via zmodem or kermit

345027
kermit	zmodem
or send a file via zmodem or kermit

345027
kermit	zmodem
i m curious if anyone knows of a free library for serial communication for windows which supports the zmodem or kermit protocols

345085
cos	sin	cos	sine
if you need the sine or cosine of something you hit the sin or cos button on your calculator and you re set

345132
cos	sin
i m not much of a mathematician but my understanding of where sin cos and tan come from is that they are in a sense observed when you re working with right-angle triangles

345132
cos	sin
if you take measurements of the lengths of sides of a bunch of different right-angle triangles and plot the points on a graph you can get sin cos and tan out of that

345184
late-binding	early-binding
in the first sample code you have provided you are doing an early-binding and in the second one you are doing a late-binding

345203

345334
post	get
the test client acts as a simple web browser and lets you make get and post requests to your django views

345339
winpcap	libpcap
packet capture functionality requires kernel mode support hence you will at the very least need to have your application require or install libpcap winpcap as will dean pointed out

345339
winpcap	libpcap
if you re using windows you re more or less on your own although winpcap programming is extremely similar to libpcap programming unsurprisingly since it s a libpcap port to win32. the sdk can be found here

345403
many-to-many	one-to-many
yes you ll need to understand what a foreign key is and the difference between many-to-many and one-to-many etc. but you should think about your models in terms of django classes

345404
ant	maven
i have used microsoft visual studio projects solutions to organize .net-based systems ant or maven 2 for java-based systems and i have begun using distutils and setuptools easyinstall for python-based systems

345414
iprincipal	iidentity
the web site using forms authentication internally which invokes an authenticatecustomer method on the service that returns a boolean result can add an additional claim to the list of credentials something like joe example.com is logged in as a customer. then somehow a custom iidentity object and iprincipal could be constructed on the service with that claim the wcf service being confident that the web site has properly authenticated the customer it will know that the claim hasn t been tampered with at least because it ll know the web site s certificate ahead of time

345428
folder	directory
file libgadu.h which appeard in include folder i copied to another folder which is marked in vs as including files directory

also i would suggest using the instance method strsplit rather than the combination of indexof and substr

345632
cat	tee

346175
x86	64bit
in 64bit versions of windows 32 bit software is installed in c program files x86

346176
x86	64bit
my solution is to look whether c program files x86 exists if it exists asume this is a 64bit os

346183
getter	setter
rather than marking all instance data public you create getter setter for those that need to be accessed to the outside world

346186
windows	wow64
it will be empty on a 32 bit version of windows and i believe on a wow64 process

346241
subnet	packets

having recently spiked the use of 6 of these windsor unity spring.net autofac ninject structuremap i can offer a quick summary of each our selection criteria and our final choice

346471
inherited	subclassing
overly-complicated inherited trees where the subclassing do very different things and are only tangentially related to one another

346523
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i only have add subtract divide multiplying parameters and and or in my expression tree

346531
wordpress	phpbb
i m migrating my wordpress blog and phpbb forum into a new hosting server

346541
int	chars
on most modern machines a chars is 1 byte and an int is 4 bytes so giving x.b the value c also gives the first byte of x.a that same value

346566
int	double
that union will actually be able to point to an int and a double

346579
int	double
allocates at least sizeof int +sizeof long +sizeof double +sizeof long double bytes in memory for each instance

346579
int	double
so sizeof union foobarbazquux_u â max sizeof int sizeof long sizeof double sizeof long double again with the possibility of some addition for alignments

346666
webkit	blink
mozilla webkit blink v8 rhino and actionscript provide a non-standard __proto__ property which allow changing the prototype of an object after it has been created

346666
inherited	properties
however note that only the properties of an object can be inherited

346671
put	get
once a refrigerator is opened your character can look-in it to get a list of visible contents can remove an object from it put an object in it etc

346692
migrate	staging
i have written a very simple bash script to help me migrate from dev to staging

346711
solaris	aix
be aware if you need to move to a platform such as solaris aix hp-ux

346785
phpunit	simpletest
unit test frameworks for php comprise phpunit and simpletest that have been compared on stackoverflow

346826
hash	hmac
obviously i can t use a one-way hash because i need the original data to create a hmac to send to aws

346863
innodb	myisam
in myisam count is basically free but in innodb it has to physically count the rows

346899
subtract	add
to subtract y from x negate y and add

346926
firefox	safari
problem doesn t occur when i use safari nor when i use firefox with the same site running from localhost

346953
width	margin
by default divs are block elements and take up the entire width of their parent - in this case the entire document propagating through the #outer div so the automatic margin style has no effect

346953
width	margin
for this technique to work you simply have to set the width of the div that has margin auto to anything but auto or inherit either a fixed pixel value or a percentage

346973
mouse	keyboard
it s quite annoying to follow such buttons with mouse if you need to scroll through several pictures so i want to keep mouse position constant relative to clicked button but only if it was clicked by mouse not keyboard

346995
width	height
i m doing some coding in jsp java without any framework or other strange things and i get stuck trying to find a way to check if a remote image by url meets some specifications like some defined height and width

347059
lisp	scheme
here s what i wrote about a year ago in common lisp but it s easily convertible to scheme

347061
boost	stl
also do not forget unlike c c++ has some very capable libraries backing it up stl boost etc

347088
post	get
in a php project i m developing i have a couple of requests that can be either post or get

347100
packets	multicast
if you re using raw udp multicast you re probably doing some sort of protocol sequencing in userspace in order to deal with lost or duplicated packets

347110
post	get
request_method isn t limited to post and get though - you also need to handle head iirc php will terminate the script at the first sign of output when it sees that header and on unlikely setups you might get a few webdav ones

347130
post	get
cookies do override values coming from post and get but all three values are directly controlled by the client making the request

347130
post	get
if you want get and post to have priority over cookies you can set the variable request_order in your php.ini

347130
post	get
which gives post priority over get over cookies

347167
postgresql	mysql
this will work for mysql postgresql oracle and probably any other db

347173
cvs	svn
the project files for each of these ides are perfectly manageable with cvs and svn

347194
migrate	upgrade
i ve upgrade a tfs server from 2005 to 2008 but never migrate projects from one to the other

347202
rss	feed
if you know a certain model won t be generating new data frequently like a model that parses an rss feed you can just have it stuffed somewhere with all the parsed data and have it refreshed every once in a while

347219
pop-up	dialog
i have a modal dialog box that pop-up and requests user input

347292
put	get
any paths defined in files in those directories get appended automatically to path variable -- i mostly use those two directories to put third-party installed applications in the path

347383
eurekalog	madexcept
but if you want a stack trace you could use one of the 3rdparty tools madexcept eurekalog or the open source jcldebug part of the jcl

347388
getter	setter
testing getter and setter

347395
getter	setter
the single exception for this is properties which can make one part the getter or the setter more private than the overall property by specifying an access modifier

347402
int	chars
if you are using regular main int argc chars argv then make sure your app is a console app

347428
rss	feed
additionally put your feed through an rss validator just to see if it checks out

347436
filesystems	fat
if you delete a file on a fat or udf filesystems its directory entry simply gets marked as deleted with most of the dir entry still intact

347439
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have a mouseenter and mouseleave event for a panel control that changes the backcolor when the mouseenter and goes back to white when it leaves

347439
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have label control within this panel as well but when the mouseenter the label control the mouseleave event for the panel fires

347459
getter	setter
it is also questionable if it is worthwhile testing truly trivial functionality such as getter and setter although you never know how long they will be trivial

347504
rss	feed
i want to provide some rss feed s for my site

347505
ussd	smpp
ussd works using a connection oriented smpp

347585
union	distinct
if you don t create any aliased pointers of distinct types in the first place then you don t have to worry what the compiler might do with aliases and neither does the maintenance programmer who sees your multiple static_casts through a union

347630
versioning	upgrade
you don t have to upgrade your sql anywhere versioning 10 database

347644
integer	unsigned
to get a better feel for this you could try creating a signed integer out of your unsigned integer

347644
integer	unsigned
if the msb of your unsigned integer is already 0 then you can read it as signed and get the same result

347644
subtract	add
now you have two signed numbers that you can add or subtract the way you already know

347774
versioning	upgrade
since all teams will based their work on those frameworks they need to upgrade their versioning of framework as soon as possible in order to build their own deliveries

347798
hide	show
also in case there isn t what other method can i use instead of show hide or other effects

347813
boost	stl
i know there is the stl and boost and all kinds of libraries out there but they are not all of a piece they all feel different

347850
mouse	keyboard
further creating a different experience for a mouse user versus a keyboard user also goes against most current wisdom on good ui design

347867
versioning	upgrade
the .net runtime itself has been upgrade with what amounts to a service pack in the 3.5 versioning

347884
children	parent
or if you ve three windows running - parent and two children which i think you might be implying then read write to a hidden field in the parent from the children

347964
hash	salt
add an authentication string to the query that is a salt hash of the access time

348000
hash	md5
he figured that no one would ever think to create a dictionary where they hash inputs with md5 and sha1

348005
min	max
they say that because of the property stated in the above paragraph we can calculate min and max in o 1 amortized time instead of o n time using an envelope algorithm

348109
hash	md5
does it make any difference if you mix md5 and sha1 for example instead of repeating the same hash function

348114
hash	salt
as you have already mentioned salt hash are much better

348114
hash	md5
i m still sticking with my answer that there are smaller number of md5 md5 text type hash than md5 text hash increasing the chance of collision even if still to an unlikely probability and reducing the search space

348124
hash	md5
however there exist large databases of md5 hash which are more likely to contain the password text than the md5 of it

348129
hash	md5
double hashing doesn t really help protect against this since the same collisions will still result in the same first hash which you can then md5 again to get the second hash

348132
post	get
there are different ways to get around this which i ve listed in this blog post of mine where i mainly talk about fcshctl which is my own solution for this but at the bottom of the post i ve also listed other similar solutions to get fcsh integrated into nonstandard build workflows

348140
pbkdf2	hash
a good key derivation algorithm like pbkdf2 injects the password into each round of hashing mitigating concerns about collisions in hash output

348155
tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
usually java is used on server side stuff so try to look into some spring wicket tapestry struts jsp jsf ibatis hibernate or other interesting stuff

348202
opera	firefox
ideally i want to have a message appear not a new window but a message box if possible that warns ie6 users of the issues and reccommends they update to either ie7 firefox 3 or opera 9.5

348236
filtering	grouping
there are several places where the user should be able to sort grouping and filtering results

348236
sorting	filtering
perhaps send json from the server but also include the html snippet as an attribute so the javascript can do the filtering sorting etc

348246
singleton	facade
specifically factory abstract factory singleton facade

348250
mouseleave	mouseenter
a little bit down on this blog scroll down there is an implementation of how to implement mouseenter mouseleave cross browser

348250
hide	show
also your menu hiding showing will mostly work with the above check however if all you want to do is show and hide there exists perfectly valid pure css solutions for that

348293
ubuntu	linux
it receives support from the ubuntu people who make linux for human beings

348294
bazaar	git
for example try bazaar mercurial or git

348298
bazaar	git
git mercurial bazaar svn.

348306
wordpress	phpbb
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems

348310
width	height
measureit - draw out a ruler to get the pixel width and height of any elements on a webpage

348347
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
what you really want is to hash the password with pbkdf2 - a proven method of using a secure hash with salt and iterations

348355
cas	siteminder
popular systems are cas oracle access manager ca siteminder sun sso and ibm tivoli access manager

348358
rss	feed
this service reads given rss feed combines new items into a pdf and e-mails the pdf to given address on schedule

348408
getter	setter
this annotation would generate a simple getter and setter for you

348414
bazaar	git
mercurial git or bazaar is the way to go for a dead simple setup

348436
hash	salt
better is to salt your hash and mix hash together

348449
int	double	hash	salt
instead of doubling the number of times you calculate the hash double the size of your salt or double the number of bits used int the hash or do both

348502
folder	directory
i have created an application that writes some data to the root folder of the directory in which it was installed in program files

348508
versioning	upgrade
you care about your data the plone community cares about their data â and we d like you to be able to upgrade to the new and better versioning even when we re transitioning to a new architecture

348548
post	get
on a side note i found ci to be way too restrictive for one it doesnt allow for get requests and wants all interactions to happen via post

348548
codeigniter	kohana
apparently i am not the only one who thinks that codeigniter is overly restrictive the kohana project is a fork of codeigniter + optimizations namely pure php5 support all oo codeigniter is still php4 compatible at the expense of not being able to take advantage of php5 oo capabilities

348548
codeigniter	kohana
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

348555
put	get
but i would say to put as little as is necessary to get a birds eye view of how your program works

348608
client-side	server-side
there s redundant data now but all the rendering is done server-side and all the interaction is done client-side

348608
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
storing the all_available_data lets you do sorting filtering grouping etc

348704
hash	salt
i want to salt a hash username and password submitted via http post in js on the client-side with a higher-order time value 1 minute resolution to avoid sending the username and password hash as a constant value that could be used for a log-in attempt via post fabrication by an unauthorized user a sniffer

348722
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
their job will become infeasible since you can t use a rainbow table at all if the hash is salt correctly and you can t break md5 in less than a minute by which time the hash is invalidated anyway

348724
gridview	rowdatabound
i can quite easily calculate these values by aggregating information taken from the rowdatabound event but don t know how to go about manually adding the additional two rows to the gridview

348794
autocomplete	multi-select
in my case i want to implement a multi-select autocomplete combobox using html javascript and jsp

348825
ant	maven
the ant builder is kind of a swiss army knife for anything you want to automate in the project build without having to use the big tools like maven

348830
for-loop	loops
i++ loops are nooby but only because the code becomes much clearer if you use a for-loop

348934
factories	presenter
presenter and views that belong together are created by a factories on a separate thread and should get a separate dispatcher

348941
post	get
this should be a post via a form not a href link get

348977
ienumerable	ienumerator
the foreach statement usually uses ienumerable and ienumerator or their generic cousins

348995
margin	font-size
even if you hard-code the font-size in pixel you can still use em for unit to specify margin length etc

349027
urllib	httplib
not having to search though the docs of urllib urllib2 and httplib to find where that functions i need to to encode a file and upload it via a post request

349087
button	checkbox
on click of a button it should be checked that if any checkbox is checked or not

349104
getter	setter
edit project lombok solves exactly the problem of getter and setter generation

349129
folder	directory
if you place your build files in a different directory from your source as i do you don t have the folder in the tree to worry about

349139
jar	manifest.mf
i think you have to set it in the manifest.mf file in the ejb jar

349167
doc	rtf
aspose.words for java supports doc ooxml rtf html and opendocument formats

349172
queue	fifo
we have written once a thread-safe fifo queue class which is very helpful in a multithreaded environment

349207
subtraction	multiplication
the last one could be even faster once it got compiled both have one if and one subtraction but the first one has a multiplication in some cases the last one has not

349248
folder	directory
my csv repo has an empty directory obj in every folder

349259
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems have improved at this in general but i don t know what the current state is with ntfs and fat32

349289
draggable	droppable
jquery has draggable droppable classes to do what you need haven t used them tho

349313
windows	wow64
wow64 is a compatibility environment provided by the operating system that allows a 32-bit application to run on a windows 64-bit operating system

349313
disk	ram
better ram and disk performance will certainly help

349377
versioning	upgrade
do the tests from versioning to versioning for some useful set of upgrade

349421
java.util.date	simpledateformat
allows the formatting of java.util.date instances using the same patterns defined by the simpledateformat class

349440
installation	upgrade
we have one sql script that does both a clean installation and an upgrade

349440
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this way we re guaranteed that the upgrade script will bring even the oldest installation up to the latest versioning

349472
lxml	elementtree
usually i would suggest using elementtree s iterparse or for extra-speed its counterpart from lxml

349492
gtk	motif
wx was designed to do this from the beginning - gtk and motif versions on x11 win32 on windows and iirc an osx version

349501
int	boolean
this can also be extended to weighted edges by using int or another numeric type instead of boolean as the elements of the array

349564
apache	lighttpd
i am using django as web framework and then apache and lighttpd as web server and static media server respectively

349564
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd is running on a different machine from the apache django one

349601
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
somebody always throws in joda-time any time a java.util.date or java.util.calendar question is raised but including yet another library is not always an option

349605
redmine	trac
the major ones i ve looked at so far are activecollab redmine fogbugz and trac right now redmine feels to be the most fitting

349646
int	boolean
the easiest way to do this would be to use a square matrix 2d array either of boolean to show the presence or absence of a connection or int to represent the cost of traversal

349685
post	get
yes but then the client would have to send a request first just to get the token and then another with the actual post request which does not make sense imho

349719
width	margin
what you need to do is get the padding margin and border width-values of that particular div and add them to the result of the width method

349725
width	margin
the every word as a textblock isn t really that bad of a hack and you can get around the issue of linebreaks by separating the linebreaks out into their own textblock and assigning those textblocks a width or margin equal to the width of the wrap panel which would force them to sit on their own line

349805
salt	md5
the time-based salt will not make md5 any easier to break

349805
hash	md5
you re still relying on 1 the user having a good password to defeat brute force calculations and 2 md5 being a decent hash

349805
hash	salt
because of the problems above a better idea is to use a one-time server-assigned salt with the hash since it sounds like you don t want to use ssl

349854
put	get
you can put these things in the classpath if your build tool doesn t get confused

349863
junit	testng
junit can t do that sort of thing -- though testng does have beforesuite and aftersuite annotations

349891
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and obviously google-chrome as well

349900
width	height
i find that trying to set a width height of a number without the units can cause issues

349910
post	put
thanks to this post that hanselman put up the day after i asked the question i downloaded wlw and am now using it

349924
unix	solaris
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers

349924
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a not ready for prime time db for hobbyists and not a competitor for sql server or oracle although postgresql seems to have a reputation for being more robust

349955
unix	solaris
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers

349989
postgresql	mysql
i d prefer to see postgresql or even sqlite take chunks out of the mysql market and i d like to see mono or jsp or cocoon based apps more

350050
postgresql	mysql
but many enterprises tend to use databases like oracle or ibm db2 instead of open source offerings - although there are many enterprises that don t really need the kind of power those systems provide and could get away with mysql or postgresql

350098
post	get
if you get this working please post - i could use it myself

350148
set	bag
the benefits you do get from the gridview include command events and arguments that can be easily consumed or created a datakey property bag that allows you to track critical fields in a large result set as well as many other things

350167
gridview	repeater
if you don t need any of the features of a gridview why not use a repeater

350199
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome

350227
int	double
the only thing i can think of is that it s some odd casting thing but i get the same behaviour taking if the variable to which i m assigning is an int a double or even a string

350251
post	get
if you can bear the self-praising and claims to godness wolfram s book is a good way to get a feel for cellular automata but don t take the book itself too seriously that s a separate issue that can fill several blog post

350272
sorting	filtering
perhaps send json from the server but also include the html snippet as an attribute so the javascript can do the filtering sorting etc

350275
client-side	server-side
if performance is not a big concern i d go with an html parser like beautifulsoup in python if you are doing this server-side or jquery or just plain javascript if you are doing it client-side

350310
button	checkbox
an example of what i might want to do is having a page with records and checkbox next to them the user has the option to check all the records they want to delete and then click on a delete button

350310
post	get
now if the user clicks refresh they get this silly box to confirm if they want to post or not

350381
sudo	nohup
sudo nohup nice foo.bash

350381
sudo	nohup
nohup nice sudo foo.bash

350395
mouse	keyboard
in that case you have to assume after a period of inactivity no mouse or keyboard events that the users attention has left the page

350403
sudo	nohup
the sudo should go last so that nohup and nice aren t running with root privileges

350405
sudo	nohup
sudo first will make it owned by root nohup before sudo will make it owned by your user

350467
boost	stl
diomidis i share your pain and have spent a lot of time switching between different schemes over the years trying to find something that works with the different libraries frameworks that i use mfc and or stl boost

350510
fink	macports	gentoo	linux
if you come have a linux background macports gentoo like or fink apt-get like are indispensable

350551
min	max	min	median	median	max
added for the production log analyzer you don t need any configuration it just parses the production log and gives you a list of most time consuming actions including min max median time

350569
min	max
if you don t use a jagged array and your connections are symmetric consider wrapping with an accessor based on min max macros

350621
children	parent
i also have used an adjacency table with fields ancestor and descendant and distance direct children parent have a distance of 1 grandchildren grandparents have a distance of 2 etc

350621
children	parent
this needs to be maintained but is fairly easy to do for inserts you use a transaction then put the direct link parent child distance 1 into the table then insert ignore a selection of existing parent children by adding distances i can pull up the sql when i have a chance which wants an index on each of the 3 fields for performance

350659
gridview	repeater
i am looking to create an asp.net page that will have a control like gridview or repeater and the data to be displayed in this page can be either unicode or utf-8

350686
hide	show
i built a similar app in winforms that would simply show hide pictures of dip switches

350693
webclient	httpwebrequest
i suspect that webclient or httpwebrequest will do the job fine

350726
postgresql	mysql
i don t recommend the bindings to rdbms components such as postgresql or mysql at least in the 1.x series performance was not acceptable even for prototype applications

350787
integer	unsigned
how can i convert the unhex d value to a unsigned integer

350821
phpunit	simpletest
both simpletest and phpunit can easily be integrated with it although phpunits support is there out-of-the-box

350855
anjuta	gnome
then there are some others where i cannot tell you how they are since i ve not tested them including anjuta for the gnome desktop and code blocks written with wxwidgets it s quite cross-platform

350855
geany	kdevelop
if all you want is a gui for the compiler and a symbol browser you could also use geany which is very fast and includes an embedded terminal like kdevelop

350897
hide	show
if the user has css but not javascript the element will hide and will not be able to be show

350916
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can set the php include_path from an .htaccess assuming you have the correct allowoverride settings in your httpd.conf file

350917
textmate	bbedit
bbedit and textmate - both are great text editors for programmers

350927
centos	linux
provided you don t use a bizarre flavour tip just use rhel or centos which is its free equivalent linux is very well supported

350936
post	get
now what you really have here are two authorization contexts - get all post of a user and get all post and you usually want to set different permissions for both eg

350936
post	get
only admins can get all post and only user it self or an admin can get all post of a user

350949
nsstring	nsdata
a defaultâ s value must be a property list that is an instance of or for collections a combination of instances of nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

350999
system.in	system.out
i d be tempted to redirect the system.in system.out to a jtextpane on the gui that way it would be much easier to change the focus etc

351069
vsto	add-in
i d like to be able to call a function exposed by a vsto add-in from a cell in an excel worksheet

351075
equals	tostring	equals	compareto	tostring	compareto
it can generate equals hashcode tostring and compareto methods based on the apache commons libraries

351158
getter	setter
assert that equals and hashcode are both implemented or neither of them see that the getter actually returns the value you pushed in with the setter check wether all properties have getter and setter

351170
post	get
it doesn t include the headers or the actual http instruction get post etc

351183
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
for details have a look at oledbcommand sqlcommand class in .net which is used to call stored procedures functions

351212
mouse	keyboard
however in general terms on any x11 system keyboard or mouse input is only delivered to the active window unless you call the underlying xgrabmouse xgrabkeyboard etc functions

351212
mouse	keyboard
of course once you ve done that no other window can receive those input events so you have to make very sure that there s a way for your program to release the mouse and or keyboard input once you re done

351240
children	parent
imho it s more usual for parent objects to know about their children than the other way around

351258
firefox	safari
however in firefox and safari it does not upload

351281
cvs	svn
i use the netbeans c++ plugin which is superb and integrates with cvs and svn

351296
hide	show

you ll be interested in the resizeimage function that takes a system.drawing.image the width and the height as the arguments

353224
division	modulo
but i m revisiting this because now i need to use negative numbers and rem gives you the remainder of a division which is not the same as modulo for negative numbers

353248
sequence	permutation
the good thing is that the algorithm works even when you have a sequence with repeated elements with say 232254421 it would find the tail as 54421 swap the 2 and 4 so 232454221 reverse the rest giving 232412245 which is the next permutation

353298
folder	directory
my answer is to move to point to a folder that is underneath the .sln file and adjacent to the class library directory then it can all go in the repo

353485

furthermore some things that are very difficult end up being solved with very little code and some things that are very easy boilerplate code like getter and setter for example can add a lot of lines in very little time

353573
versioning	upgrade
i think the web developers of the world should start a class action lawsuit to force microsoft ether to offer the equivilant of firebug for ie6 and ie7 make sure all ie6 and ie7 instances are upgrade to standards or remove all versioning of ie6 and ie7 from all computers on the internet or bail-out all web developers with a payment of 1m each for their pain and suffering

i ve used upx before to reduce the size of my windows executable but i must admit that i am naive to any negative side effects this could have

353634
executable	upx
i write most of my code in delphi but i ve used upx to compress c c++ executable as well

353634
executable	upx
on a side note i m not running upx in some attempt to protect my exe from disassemblers only to reduce the size of the executable and prevent cursory tampering

353646
mvp	presenter
model view presenter mvp br

353682
executable	upx
some people may be more suspicious of your executable just because it is compressed with upx

353714
int	boolean
i ve not managed to reduce it to 2 boolean and 2 int but i wouldn t be surprised if it was possible

353726
folder	directory
my assumption was that the content or scripts folder would always be at the root of the site as i have no intention to run this site in a virtual directory setting

353748
google-chrome	safari
thanks vatos you gave me a good lead basically i did what you suggested but used jquery to set the html and append the new style to the head since safari google-chrome would stall when doing innerhtml and document.head was undefined

atan2	sin	cos	sin	cos	atan2
if you are averaging angles and have to deal with them crossing the 0 360 then it is safer to sum the sin and cos of each value and then average atan2 sum of sines sum of cosines

353831
sorting	filtering
edit one other caveat is that if necessary you can easily drop a dataview on top of this is you need to do some quick sorting filtering of the user list

353832
yacc	bison
for the most part folks use bison yacc which is a tool that you create a description for your high level language and the tool can parse the user input based on your description and turn it into this middle language if you will

353837
jquery	scriptaculous
you might take a look at some of the javascript frameworks like yahoo yui scriptaculous jquery etc

353849
mbunit	nunit
it s an extension to nunit or mbunit

353855
hide	show
clarrification where i ve got id 1 you should swap in the id of the div you want to show and make a generic class name on the other div s to hide them

353887
profiler	vtune
it depends what you want are tracing but if you are comparing which functions are executed a profiler like vtune might help

353909
vmware	virtualbox
i completely agree with the others on get it in source control asap and use vmware virtualbox etc for a test environment

353918
profiling	debugging
as far as debugging profiling tools i know that symfony comes with a pretty slick set of tools including a little js toolbar that comes up on your pages only in debugging mode with logging profiling information

353933
postgresql	mysql
actually it s using mysql but it could switch to postgresql at a moments notice as web2py is so diverse

353940
mamp	wamp
find a wamp lamp or mamp package to get you started since you re new to this

353947
int	double
the default interpretation of 40.00 will be a double with the value 40.00 just like the default interpretation of 40 is an int

353992
hash	md5
in particular i want to match a 32 character string md5 hash named directory

354000
post	get
user user pass pass would be to use post instead of get to sendt this request if you are passing on from a form that is

354019
base-class	subclassing
it seems to me that the having a book base-class and then two subclassing for publisher and publisher name is the correct choice

354060
svg	vml
for vector drawing libraries like raphael provide a consistent api over svg and vml

354060
svg	vml
for html-only solutions no svg vml canvas you use css and custom border-widths

354089
put	get
however you will get different results in an outer join depending on if you put the join condition in the where vs the on clause

354098
base-class	subclassing
it seems to me that the having a book base-class and then two subclassing for publisher and publisher name is the correct choice

354098
superclass	subclassing
in each case the subclassing represents a specific category within the superclass

354143
hide	show
it ll also let you set up global ajax responders to determine whether to hide or show the busy icon

354146
yacc	bison
yacc or bison or taccle tcl analog of

post	put
put in some kind of isapi or http module that filters request post and querystrings for injection-oriented symbols and fails the request before it even hits the application

354254
disk	ram
the ram drive would synchronize its contents with the hard disk drive in background using only idle resources

354254
disk	ram
ram disk for speed up ide

354254
disk	ram
partly due to my projects being small partly due to the use of ram disk

354266
disk	ram
they are very close to the originally requested ram disk in a sku that you can purchase from newegg or amazon

354302
disk	ram
if you put the macro library and support libraries and your code on a ram disk compiling an application on an 80286 would go from 20 minutes to 30 seconds

354308
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
consider using netbeans full ear and war deployment is possible without the need to write ant yourself for most of the major servers ie tomcat was weblogic glassfish and jboss

354312
pull	push
edit i was under the impression that dedicated remote repos like github where no one will ssh in and work on that code but only pull or push etc didn t and shouldn t have a head because there was basically no working copy

354315
disk	ram
a ram disk might seem faster but that s because you aren t factoring in the copy to ramdisk and copy from ramdisk times

354317
int	chars
according to the documentation it s the number of chars for string and text columns and the number of bytes for binary and int columns

354327
disk	ram
since this is windows i have a hard 3 gb limit for core memory meaning i cannot use too much memory for a ram disk

354327
disk	ram
i let my ide store all its temporary stuff on the solid state ram disk and also the maven repository

354327
disk	ram
the dram ram disk has a battery backup to the flash card

354405
implements	extends
if your helper method commony only exists in abstract base class b all classes which implements interface a will have to also extends base class b in order to take advantage of that implementation of commony

354406
svg	vml
beside the libraries mentioned in the other thread relying on canvas svg vml i saw games made with sprites ie

354407
mvp	presenter
i totally understand the mvp pattern now but i still struggle to see where views and presenter are instantiated

354420
gridview	detailsview	listview	gridview
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

354442
allocator	stl
some kind of stl allocator class would work also but i am trying to avoid any kind of heap even static allocated per-thread heaps although one of those is my second choice

354442
allocator	stl
the reason i hadn t thought of doing it this way myself is that i have always overlooked the allocator object parameter to the stl collection constructors

354471
alloca	malloc
if you have an implementation of alloca you could buld a class allocator using that instead of malloc but your idea of using a statically allocated array is even better it s just as fast on most architectures and you don t risk stack corruption of you mess up

354481
allocator	stl
you can stick with your stl containers but change the second parameter of for example std vector to give it your custom allocator which allocates from a stack-buffer

354485
mvp	presenter
this makes having several views use the same presenter logic easy and shields users of my view from my particular architectural decision to use mvp

354515
nswindow	nscell
view layer nsview nswindow nscell their subclasses and calayer

354553
disk	ram
here is how to create a ram disk in linux

354564
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
nsurlconnection can be used synchronously via its asynchronous delegate methods in a background thread nsthread or nsoperation

354619
disk	ram
whether you end up with a ram disk or just letting the os do its thing this will help

354619
disk	ram
keep your source code on the real physical disk but direct .obj .dll and .exe files to be created on the ram drive

354622
pow	math.h
this functions calls pow from c stdlib s math.h

354635
ivar	subclassing
create an nsview subclassing that holds an nscolor as an ivar

354690
disk	ram
i wonder if you could build something like a software raid 1 where you have a physical disk partition as a member and a chunk of ram as a member

354703
folder	directory
the problem i have is just listing the directory in a folder

354733
gentoo	linux
see speeding up emerge with tmpfs gentoo linux wiki

354733
disk	ram
the gist is that all source and build intermediate file are redirected to a ram disk for compile while final binaries are directed to the hard drive for install

354733
disk	ram
also i recommend exploring maintaining your source on hard drive but git push your latest source changes to a clone respository that resides on the ram disk

354761
margin	text-align
so the layout can be centered by applying text-align center to the body and then margin auto to the left and right of the container div

354799
width	height
when text size increase the height and width change but the image doesn t increase in size

354800
put	get
therefore the perfectly valid phone number 0731602412 would get put into your database as the decimal number 124192010

354805
svg	vml
it uses native graphics svg vml silverlight or canvas mdash

354805
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
whatever is available on the client covering all major browsers ie firefox safari webkit opera

354808
width	height
if your header.png file was included as an img tag then you could set its height and width to be a number of ems and the browser would resize it usually making it look like crap though

354854
swt	swing
i was hoping to use of of the native toolkits not just swing swt

354881
client-side	server-side
if the request takes significant time it is possible that the client-side ajax request is timing out before your server-side code completes

354888
firefox	safari
this image displays perfectly well in safari but not at all in firefox

354936
post	get
i get a 2032 stream error from flash in response to post requests that return 201 created in ie firefox works fine

354949
std	ostream
rather than simply using std cout to print output have the libraries function take an ostream reference that defaults to std cout

354987
equals	compareto
however java does not offer parameter variance so there are situations where you will be overriding pre-generics functions such as equals compareto etc

355026
unix	solaris
as unix solaris or windows servers

355030
put	get
i d like to use posix semaphores to manage atomic get and put from a file representing a queue

355030
put	get
just in case anybody wants the larger context i am building get and put operations for an atomic queue that can be called from shell scripts

355093
serializable	deserialization
i coded around this for json serializable deserialization and found out the hard way

355135
hex	binary
if i compare the bytes of each file with a hex editor or kdiff3 they are binary identically the same

355189
for-loop	loops
the parameter for-loop needed to be set to false as the swf itself had a loops built into it

355220
int	double
in what way does it matter if the value is not a primitive datatype int double etc but a or a struct

355274
inherited	properties
to work around differences when classes don t share the same inherited tree using helpers makes it possible to have have generic count and items properties for example

355277
put	get
i ve seen too many junior programmers get confused when they put in a header file and then wonder why they get a link error for x being defined more than once

355295
post	get
if its a form post you can get the value with request.form control one of the properties will help you do it

355342
hide	show
in it show hide the elements that you want to be printed on paper

355405
folder	directory
for example you would create a new entry for myapplication.com and set its home directory to the proper folder on the server that contains your root files usually c inetpub wwwroot myapplication.com but it could be anywhere you like

355448
post	get
you can try to write a test in another language and see if it s faster or you can try to get the list of filenames through some other method such as described here in another post

355467
onclick	onmouseup
statement at the end of either the onclick or onmouseup event handlers

355469
listview	gridview
i found this when searching for the same question regarding the wpf listview s gridview

355469
post	get
there are a few nits to pick to get this to work really well which are all described in her blog post

355488
jrockit	hprof
jrockit might also not support the hprof format at all because it s not required by the java spec

355530
icmp	tcp	mtu	icmp
too many broken firewalls and middleboxes filter out icmp packet too big messages here is a good way to test a candidate network administrator during an interview ask him her to stop ping and he she will probably block completely icmp. see rfc 2923 tcp problems with path mtu discovery

355581
executable	upx
i m surprised this hasn t been mentioned yet but using upx-packed executable also increases the risk of producing false-positives from heuristic anti-virus software because statistically a lot of malware also uses upx

355628
put	get
i ve put indexes including covering indexes where applicable on all key tables run it through the query analyzer index tuning wizard etc but still cannot get it to perform fast enough

355675
min	max
if it s also got the method then it will also support sort min and max

355729
put	get
you could put the id information in the viewstate if you can t get it repeat without a long search process

355732
super	extends
so i extends file and use a delegate overriding all of file s constructors and methods calling super in all constructors

355755
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
do you reference system.data.oracleclient or do you use odp.net oracle s data provider for connecting .net apps with oracle or do you use devart s formerly known as corelab provider

355768
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
no you have spotted a problem with using inherited - that subclassing get tightly coupled to superclass and their internals so it can be fragile

355790
setinterval	settimeout
well the first thing to say is that if you re calling settimeout but not changing the interval you should be using setinterval

355790
setinterval	clearinterval
edit update from comment you can keep a reference from the closure if used as a class and setinterval clearinterval don t require re-referencing

355797
getter	setter
for me reason is quite simple if something bad happens with _name you can always put some output in getter setter and find out what is causing the trouble

355805
child-process	spawn
note that any child-process that your service spawn will also be in the service s session

355806
put	get
this means you still get the validation and you can easily put breakpoints on the property access

355806
min	max
this doesn t work where you re trying to make a change to two properties which validate against each other - for instance a min and max pair where each has a validation constraint such that at all times

355983
public	protected
guideline #4 a base class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

356005
public	protected
personally we make sure that every public and protected method has xml comments

356008
public	protected
generally i try hard to add meaningful comments to all public protected members which is handy since if you turn on the xml comments during build you get automatic warnings for missing comments

356028
min	max
the use of min max value is very inelegant but i m not aware of a good way around it at the moment

356041
public	protected
i document public classes and the public protected members of those classes

356102
division	exponent
try converting the exponent to a floating number as the default behaviour of in python is integer division

356144
listview	gridview
i want to use the gridview mode of a listview to display a set of data that my program will be receiving from an external source

356239
gif	png
i can either draw a bitmap and save as gif jpg png put it up somewhere on the internet and link to it with an element

356239
mp3	wav
in the music world i can use wav or mp3 files

356245
post	get
when the ajax call is made from the browser you get it to post to the same action

356245
put	get
when you render the page the html for the form and all of the ajax stuff will get put in

356294
udp	tcp
i want to abstract this class to provide two versions one that connects through udp and the other through tcp

356294
udp	tcp
so the end benefit is that the genericness of t is still available but the very different code required to setup a udp or tcp connection has been specialized

356298
extjs	gxt
i am using gwt google web toolkit 1.5.3 et gxt extjs 1.2

356358
stdout	stderr
ideally i think that to avoid deadlock in java you need to spawn separate threads to read the stderr and the stdout

356385
udp	tcp
if you want to have a udp or a tcp connection based for example on a connection string provided the user then polimorphism best fits your needs

356394
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
in my experience redhat centos is very good and apparently debian original not ubuntu

range	min
grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

361681
range	max
grid max value should be a nice value above the max value in the range

361704
min	max
maple min 8 max 74 labels 10 20 .. 60 70 ticks 10 12 14 ..70 72

361704
min	max
matlab min 10 max 80 labels 10 20 .. 60 80

361851
ubuntu	debian
under ubuntu or debian you can view crontab by var spool cron crontabs and then a file for each user is in there

361894
gtk	xlib
gtk qt others are all so far as i know implemented in terms of xlib at their core

361952
post	get
i assume that if a post back occurs you d want to get rid of the message so make sure it s always off

362077
quicksort	mergesort
so for resursive algorithms like quicksort and mergesort we would actually do insertion sort for segments that were very smal say 10 records or so

362118
cpu	processors
furthermore with multiple processors other instructions can be executing on a different cpu core at the very same time

362127
folder	directory
vs looks in the project folder as well as the installation directory that wheelie mentioned

362227
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have a problem only in google-chrome firefox ie netscape safari and opera are okay where a padding property which should be applied to text in a cell is being applied to all empty cells aswell

362284
put	get
you can instead put a timestamp into the sql and use the time to the nearest minute hour day the largest period you can get away with to allow mysql to get some caching benefit

362289
put	get
you can put the complete string in and get the dec value of the hex string back

362390
integer	unsigned
to convert from unsigned byte to a java integer

362429
rss	feed
i ve created a utf8 encoded rss feed which presents news data drawn from a database

362429
rss	feed
so everything should be encoded in utf8 when the rss feed is presented to the browser however i am still getting the weird question mark characters for pound signs

362429
rss	feed
here is my rss feed code cfml

362441
integer	fractions
i have a decimal variable and i need to split it into two separate variables one containing the integer part and one containing the fractions part

362457
subclass	abstract-class
they cannot be instantiated so if you have an abstract-class with concrete methods then it can be subclassed and the subclass can then be instantiated

362480
postgresql	mysql
don t know about mysql but in case of postgresql you can specify whether the sequence is a cycle no cycle

362719
getter	setter
or is it more recommended to set the member variables to private and let the subclasses get or set the varible by getter and setter

362741
getter	setter
setter and getter are somewhat slower than accessing fields directly so if you are doing heavy maths and read write these fields a lot in your subclasses you should go for accessing the fields directly

362741
getter	setter
normally you should mark them as private and go for getter setter

362741
getter	setter
so my answer is direct access for heavily used fields getter setter otherwise

362749
delphi	oxygene
i have found many posts and examples of using linq-syntax in delphi prism oxygene but i have never found anything on linq to sql or entity framework

362765
keydown	keyup
on the project i worked on with that requirement a teller system for bank tellers we had a lot of javascript monitoring key keypress keydown keyup etc. events and such

362767
jboss	weblogic
i have mixed servlets and portlets in a single web application using jboss portal bea weblogic portal and apache jetspeed 2

362770
implements	extends
my question is if an interface that is implements implicitly by extends a class that already implements it should be explicitly implements by the class if the class wants to advertise the fact that it fulfills the contract of that interface

362770
implements	extends
you implements this extends the class java.util.abstractlist that already implements the interface list

362786
implements	extends
if you are extends abstractlist which already implements list you do not need to explicitly implements list

362795
implements	extends
when you extends abstractlist mylist is of type list already so there is no need to explicityly stat or implements the interface

362804
post	get
one of the reasons i m not going to post details is because i m pretty sure i d get it wrong in at least some respects

362837
opera	firefox
it s not a full debugger but my dp_debug extensions provides some i think usful functionality and they work in ie firefox and opera 9+

362869
notepad	scite
maybe that s where scite with its lua scripting ability or programmer s notepad which seems to be scriptable with python has an edge.

362902
width	height
so i tried to set the layout size in report properties as width 18in and height 8.5in

363022
profiler	yourkit
if that doesn t help us a profiler such as yourkit to find the differences

363081
websphere	ibm
we use websphere integrated with several other ibm products to provide secure access to our application which has been working well for us so far

363086
hide	show
then i manage myself the wm_mousehover and wm_mouseleave events to show hide the tooltips

363093
wxpython	pyglet
you can draw simple shapes to a canvas in all of pyglet pygame qt tkinter wxpython and cairo

363155
put	get	post	put	post	get
other than that some nice use of rails routes with conditions to call a different action on get post put etc and a prefix of api v1 and format format.xml format.js etc provides a pretty nice way to build restful apis withought really needing a plugin

363199
width	height
check the width and height property of the report surface carefully and squeeze them as much as possible

363209
folder	directory
what i want to do is for each file in the directory username.com move it to the folder of the same name in mail

363223
stdout	stderr
i want both stdout and stderr redirected to the terminal so that the user can see that the script is working as well as see if there was a problem

363223
stdout	stderr
edit redirecting stderr to stdout and piping the result to tee works but it depends on the users remembering to redirect and pipe the output

363224
put	get	post	put	post	get
i ve checked out django-rest-interface but it is not obvious on how to do anything other than read get create post update put delete delete and couldn t find any related examples

363239
stdout	stderr
depending on the shell you use you first have to redirect stderr to stdout using

363243
stdout	stderr
use the tee program and dup stderr to stdout

363257
stdout	stderr
the to redirect stderr to stdout append this at your command

363268
submit	submission
i am submission form with javascript like jquery form#listing submit so i must remove the validation rules function with javascript

363297
post	get
you can get a list of the post office address for each zip code and geocode each address into a lat long pair

363374
getter	setter
i generally don t make interfaces for data holding beans that is i don t make interfaces for classes with primitive type values and getter setter for them

363386
ienumerator	idisposable
but this isn t particularly efficient if it s actually a generic collection because ienumerator implements idisposable so the compiler has to put in a try finally with a dispose call in the finally block

363395
single-quotes	double-quotes
note that i changed the double-quotes surrounding article_desc to single-quotes as well

363434
ienumerable	icollection
without generics and because icollection implements ienumerable you can do like in example 1

363436
min	max
having e1.date min e2.date or e1.date max e2.date

363443
post	put
i would put the post in a div that would have a fixed width setting overflow to scroll or to hide completely depending on the content

363519
jobs	cron
and since cron jobs don t run under a terminal the combination of expect ssh

363594
inherited	subclassing
say the control class contains basic drawing functions ie paint - well control would become a basiccontroldelegate or similar and the subclassing would be created with a reference to a basiccontroldelegate which would be used for all inherited functionality

363598
put	get
anyway if you are using asp.net then the names get mangled to something like ctl100_table and you need to put this into the jquery instead of table

363600
scatter	graphing
edit charts is the component that allows statistical type graphing scatter plots and other charting stuff

363609
subtract	add
then put a filter search box with the option to select deselect all matching add to subtract from selection

363609
children	parent
still with the checkboxes but you can arrange listboxes next to each other populating children in the next box to the right as users select a parent node to view

363732
range	max	range	min	min	max
in order to get the max value included you need to add 1 to your range parameter max - min and then truncate the decimal part by casting to an int

363740
folder	directory
in the partcover.browser i ve selected the mstest executable i ve pointed the working arguments to my tests.dll and i ve tried pointing my working directory to the testresults folder but i get an error

363833
implements	extends
i have implements a session timeout warning using javascript that simply asks the user if they want to extends their session or logout

363907
wxpython	listctrl
i assume that there s a way to do this with the wxpython toolkit but i can t figure out how to get a listbox or listctrl or any other class to do this short of doing an enormous amount of event-driven programming myself

364022
getter	setter
this is because you re fooling the dependencyproperty system by doing this - remember getter setter of dp properties work differently than regular properties

364093
treeviewitem	menuitem
i think you need to realize that menus and treeviews are itemscontrols but then again so are menuitem and treeviewitem

364098
accessor	properties
if obj1 and obj2 are properties using synthesize-d accessor then method 1 and method 2 are equivalent

364114
maven	pom.xml
however sometimes i want to link to a 3rd party library that doesn t already have a pom.xml file defined so rather than create the pom.xml file for the 3rd party lib by hand and install it and add the dependency to my pom.xml i would just like to tell maven in addition to my defined dependencies include any jars that are in lib too.

364114
maven	pom.xml
short of that if there is a simple way to point maven to a lib directory and easily create a pom.xml with all the enclosed jars mapped to a single dependency which i could then name install and link to in one fell swoop would also suffice

364125
width	height
you should be making the view as big as the superview s -bounds if i get correctly what you want to do usually a rect from 0 0 to width height

364147
udp	tcp
the stack is tcp uses udp uses ipv4 uses ethernet ..

364147
udp	tcp
the stack is tcp uses udp uses ipv6 uses ethernet .

364178
serializable	deserialization
i know how serializable and deserialization works but the example i followed when using binary serializable with java.io.serializable did not work in the same fashion as when i did it with say a simple object

364188
jar	war
note system dependencies are not copied into resulted jar war

364287
put	get
as long as the code wasn t obfuscated then you should be able to use reflector to get viable code if you then put it into vs you should immidiately find errors in the reflected code

364301
punctuation	words
i am trying to get fragments that start on a words character and end on punctuation but for some reason the fragments being returned to me seem to be very inflexible despite that i ve provided a large slop

364327
swt	swing
i want to get myself into programming some serious gui based applications but when i look at things like swing swt from java i can t help but hate programming a gui interface by creating widget objects and populating them and calling methods on them

364361
innodb	myisam
you can use the mysql replication functionality or simply copy and paste the data files if your using myisam tables it s just a straight copy innodb tables are a little more tricky

364389
pop-up	dialog
the dialog are no longer pop-up windows so they work in more browsers

364433
entity-relationship	diagram
1. get an entity-relationship diagram that closely matches your target

364433
entity-relationship	diagram
2. create an sql script from the entity-relationship diagram and create the database

364433
postgresql	mysql
i suggest postgresql as some mysql

364488
int	double
it is possible for two objects of different types to be equal -- for example int and double if first class objects can validily be cast as each other and are comparable mathematically

364539
vim	sublimetext
my ideal editor would be netbeans feature set and easy of use sublimetext s performance and slick looks and a toggle to full vim mode

364584
int	double
4 as user cbo mentioned above double int being equal despite their types being different 4.0 4 and this applies to other types as well

364623
actionscript	haxe
the haxe compiler can produce swf files javascripts and other with a language that resembles actionscript or javascript more or less depending on what language details you care about

364687
put	get
i could change this to put on a background thread but then every component that needs access to this data would continuously have to get notified when this data was ready

364775
nexus	artifactory
we are considering nexus and artifactory

364816
next	except
it is just like a list comprehension except that it returns an iterator instead of the list ie an object with a next method that will yield the next element

364931
haskell	ocaml
bruce s basic idea is to use an explicit knot-tying operator called wrap instead of the implicit knot-tying that is done automatically in haskell ocaml and some other languages

364936
outputstream	inputstream
the underlying need is to have a single object that can be passed to things which need either an inputstream or an outputstream to pipe output from one thread to input for another

364939
outputstream	inputstream
easy way to write contents of a java inputstream to an outputstream

364960
solaris	aix
i used the test program that follows on solaris aix hp-ux macos x linux and cygwin windows xp results below

364960
centos	linux
65536 - suse linux 10 and centos fcntl f_setfl failed

365000
stdout	stderr
that s why you re not able to just redirect its output to see what your app is sending to stdout or stderr

365000
stdout	stderr
you can use console.app to see the output of applications launched in the normal manner because the launch infrastructure specifically sends their stdout and stderr there

365034
outputstream	inputstream
you can t create a class which derives both from inputstream and outputstream because these aren t interfaces and they have common methods and java doesn t allow multiple inheritance the compiler doesn t know whether to call inputstream.close or outputstream.close if you call close on your new object

365059
put	get
of course you need to put in the where clause what categories you want to get

365079
put	get
if you re using master pages put it in the your child page and not the master page because the code in the child pages will execute before the master page and if this is in the codebehind of master page you will still get the error if you re using ajax on the child pages

365110
mouse	keyboard
i m looking for ways to watch mouse and keyboard events on windows linux and mac from python

365149
hash	md5
calculate a hash value using an algorithm with a low probability of a birthday attach md5 sha-1

365180
punctuation	words
this regex will match between 402 and 602 characters where the first is a words character and the last is one of three punctuation characters

365183
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
do i just put an updatepanel around the contentplaceholder in the master page

365207
children	parent
for instance at a child care business at a mall you can require parent to check children in and the same parent to check them out

365207
children	parent
this type of thinking will sometimes lead to realization that part of security has to be in the parent hands you can t confine children in an online system so protecting them from going to the rest of the internet has to be their parent job

365424
dlopen	backtrace
gdb gives me a backtrace into the dlopen system call that appears meaningless

365424
dlsym	dlopen
i had taken a look at apache s guide and am fairly familiar with dlopen and dlsym and dlclose

365517
debian	linux
assuming you are on linux debian based systems have separate configurations for mod_php php cgi and php-cli

365525
rss	feed
the number of entries in the rss feed and the html page is not assumed to be the same

365525
post	get
we can only expect to get only those post that appear in both

365525
rss	feed
there may be a new entry in the html page that does not appear in the rss feed yet

365540
ienumerable	ienumerator
if they can explain deferred execution streaming the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces foreach iterator blocks expression trees for bonus points anyway then they can probably cope with the rest

365571
mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
bug tracking trac not bugzilla mantis fogbuz

365571
ant	maven
if you need build scripts try ant or maven

365586
arp	udp	arp	bgp
everything from arp dns udp icmg bgp and on and on

365615
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
ever since i read that a for-loop works faster than a foreach loops a long time ago i assumed it stood true for all collections generic collections all arrays etc

365630
for-loop	loops
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops

365637
yacc	bison
and bison a hairy yacc yet another compiler compiler

365692
for-loop	arrays
the above is the same no matter what type your collection is whereas in your for-loop the following will not build if you changed mycollection from an arrays to a list

365694
notepad++	scite
finally concerning ides a good text editor such as notepad++ or scite will suffice

365782
boost	stl
there is a number of choices with c++ if you really like boost or stl then the answers below might be preferable but the simplest and probably fastest choice is to use a single dimensional array as in c

365783
sdlc	methodology
our sdlc methodology dictates what documents we need to write

365783
filtering	grouping
rather than create folders in sharepoint we create views to filtering and grouping documents

365802
put	get
or as an old professor of mine put it as you get older you learn to ask who knows something not what book it s in

365804
dlsym	dlopen
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

365817
rss	feed
...and it should be able to produce an rss feed as well

365829
width	height
it is a bit cleaner to have a separate structure where you store the width the height and a pointer to the elements

365834
innodb	myisam
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

365834
innodb	myisam
having only one column that column being a primary key has an important consideration in the different ways that myisam and innodb handle primary key indexes

365834
innodb	myisam	int	double
this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the int once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages

365834
min	max
for either storage engine doing something like min or max should be trivial on an indexed column or just checking the existence of a number in the index

365873
scheme	rebol
i currently have installed on my device pythonce etcl dsforth pocketlogo the documents which comes with it is in german though rebol and pocket scheme

365914
free	malloc
although malloc free and new delete have different behaviors they both do the same thing at a low level manage dynamically allocated memory

365914
free	malloc
the actual implementation of malloc and free can vary a lot since there are many ways to implement memory allocation

365916
pull	push
for this type of scenario and others jon skeet and myself wrote an alternative linq implementation that works as a push rather than a pull allowing you to feed data through multiple parallel processes at once

365926
outputstream	inputstream
if i understand you correctly you want an object that functions like an inputstream in one thread and an outputstream in another to create a means of communicating between the two threads

365938
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop or a while loops with a temporary result and a counter

365945
firefox	safari
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

365945
post	get
i ll post more if i get any wiser

365997
pull	push
the exchanges are performed by both push and pull methods

366003
firefox	safari
make sure that you have the latest version there have been great progress for the javascript engines in the safari and firefox releases in recent time

366029
inherited	properties
array object inherited caller constructor length and name properties from function.prototype

366033
int	chars
each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an

366033
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type

366043
boost	stl
a lot of stl and boost

366050
post	get
if you want to write a program to fetch this information you will probably have to do something a little more complicated and fetch the page with the signature on it first so you can post that value back to the site to get a proper response

366086
firefox	safari	getter	setter	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox opera 9.5+ and safari 3+ google-chrome and ie tested with v11 you can define getter and setter properties

366088
actionscript	mxml
the built-in flex builder will refuse to build the mxml file containing the testrunnerbase component as it is a pure actionscript project no flex allowed

366088
actionscript	mxml
it is impossible to add the mxml file to the actionscript applications list in the project settings

366129
interpreted-language	lolcode
if you want to build an interpreted-language on .net the dlr is the way to go - check out martin maly s lolcode sample at

366133
getter	setter
here s a link to douglas crockford s page on private members in javascript ....it would seem to me these would be read only if only getter methods are supplied and no setter

366134
g++	gcc
gcc g++ complains expected initializer before â â token

366209
trie	tree
you can by discipline use a tree of tuples as a trie but it s only by convention not enforcement

366215
swt	swing
the other advantage for using u++ over something like mfc wpf swing java swt python etc is that your executable do not have any baggage or dependencies

366215
struts	stripes	jsf	stripes
java might says struts jsf stripes but i don t think java has anything that can compete against frameworks from python ruby c# or even php these days

366240
int	double
that s because 1 and 3 are treated as int when you don t specify otherwise so 1 3 evaluates to the int 0 which is then cast to the double 0

366253
int	double
if you have int s that you want to divide using floating-point division you ll have to cast the int to a double

366257
udp	tcp
so i am doing a lot of high performance network programming using boost asio or just asio if you will and have a pretty solid grasp of the essentials of both tcp and udp protocols

366266
apache	lighttpd	opera	firefox
apache iis lighttpd firefox opera webkit etc.

366407
pull	push
i allready finished allmost all git commands i ever use push pull fetch stash branch commit merge format-patch am apply etc so it should be usable pretty soon

366408
post	get
you can use jquery framework its javascript library you can use default image or span or div or anything else even anchor tags to do submit button its easy to use and can post form data by post method or get method through ajax just visit jquery website jquery

366452
klocwork	coverity
there are more expensive commercial tools such as klocwork and coverity

366477
linqdatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
daniel i needed something similar so i derived from a label and bound it directly to the events raised by the various datasourcecontrol derivatives linqdatasource objectdatasource sqldatasource

366627
svg	vml
vml is vector markup language a kind of proprietary ancestor of svg

366627
svg	vml
i searched svg vml library in google and was surprised there are lot of libraries apparently

366658
jvisualvm	jprofiler
so i ran it up under my profiler jprofiler and using jvisualvm and both of them indicate the usual moderate heap and perm-gen usages of around 30m combined even when fully active doing my load-test cycle

366706
subtraction	addition
they both work for addition and the c program works for subtraction as well

366740
folder	directory	actionscript	mxml
i ended up putting the unit test mxml file in the original project creating a new flex project deleting the src directory and replacing it with an eclipse linked folder to the src directory of the actionscript project

366741
inherited	subclassing
some languages like java have a fairly limited set of language features available meaning that subclassing is fairly often used because it s a convenient method for re-use technical inherited

366846
ironruby	ironpython
if you re not beholden to javascript for now i d check out ironpython - the hosting api is identical to what microsoft will release for js and about as easy as it could possibly be and switching between the 3 dlr languages ipy ironruby and managed js is trivial

366854
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that when i close the dialog box and then i click on the link that triggers it it does not pop-up again unless i refresh the page

366927
drwatson	minidump
if you just want to capture crashes then ignore all errors and let drwatson generate a minidump for you

366940
fast-forward	merge
a series of recursive merge would look like this note that the first merge was a fast-forward as i didn t force recursion

366983
kde	gnome
it s simply a lot of little user interface differences making life hard for the newcomer similar to moving from windows to gnome or from gnome to kde

367014
perl	tcl
perl is one of the earliest of the next generation of scripting languages tcl tk can probably claim primacy

367049
i2c	spi
as for sensors all of these support i2c and spi interfaces so the number of peripherals available is well into the thousands

367091
verilog	vhdl
if you decide you want to explore hardware design the nexys 2 board from digilent is an excellent way to learn about hardware design using vhdl or verilog

367096
crossover	mutation
breed new generation through crossover and or mutation genetic

367096
crossover	mutation
the key is the reproduction part which could happen sexually or asexually using genetic operators crossover and mutation

367099
reportlab	pyx
get pyx or reportlab and create a pdf that prints properly

367118
put	get
if you have a breakpoint in a hot spot that gets hit too often before you get to the problem deactivate it and put another one in a place you know will be hit shortly before the problem manifests then activte the one in the hot spot

367155
punctuation	words
i m trying to split a string up into words and punctuation adding the punctuation to the list produced by the split

367155
punctuation	words
so i want the string split at whitespace with the punctuation split from the words

367159
super	implements
to me the best approach was to first implements this super simple example and play with it

367192
getter	setter
i know java and would normally put in getter setter methods

367288
opera	safari
any rendering engine ie firefix opera safari etc will ignore any html comment tag completely regardless which position

367302
bazaar	git
i believe the commands are exactly the same for mercurial with hg instead of git and very similar for bazaar darcs monotone codeville arch and most other dvcss

367303
inline	inlining
the compiler inlining is sophisticated enough to only inline if this will help in the optimization stratergy being used

367335
versioning	upgrade
versioning number is also needed for the users to know if they can upgrade

367387
versioning	upgrade
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system

367396
inherited	subclassing
in a language like java or c++ which conflate subtyping with inherited your use of polymorphism may be restricted to subclassing of a particular class

367409
folder	directory
that way you only have one folder on the main directory and it stays unclutered

367429
post	put
i put some detailed information about it in this post

367461
superclass	subclassing
the problem would still exist if i had answer_b be the superclass - and have answer_a subclassing or compose it

367500
integer	unsigned
most often an rgb color is stored in a structure or unsigned integer with blue occupying the least significant area a byte in 32-bit and 24-bit formats green the second least and red the third least

367503
vb6	vba
any book on excel vba should help as you can copy and paste code from vba to vb6

367503
vb6	vba
also trying to do what you want to do in excel with vba then putting it into your vb6 project will also help

367538
int	double
by the way in this example the amount is an abstraction of a real life concept that could also be represented as a double or an int but maybe we have interestion methods inside that would be better if set in its own class

367563
ienumerable	ilist
linfu.ioc supports ienumerable t and ilist t injection for constructors properties methods and even fields all right out of the box

367607
implements	extends
hey i m extends some wpf controls and need to implements some custom events

367782
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you might also want to look at the viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods that are triggered well it s fairly obvious when

367790
width	text-align
the second suggestion is to remove the float and width from the div and instead rely on the text-align right

367828
inherited	properties
i ve used table-per-hierarchy inherited so i added a new entity for the premium user and map it to the user entity with conditions to ispremiumuser properties

367899
cassini	iis
incidentally this is one of the reasons i habitually run my vs webapp projects through iis not cassini anymore

367959
integer	unsigned	floating-point	integer
states that unsigned integer color components when specified are linearly mapped to floating-point values such that the largest representable value maps to 1.0 full intensity and 0 maps to 0.0 zero intensity .

368176
min	max
i know the max and min values

368201
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch in the main function hides the exception-handling from debugger

368224
pyopengl	pyglet
edit i wasn t aware that the pyglet opengl api is different from the pyopengl one

368291
fadein	fadeout
because chrome can t display well png24 with opacity change i tried to do a fadein fadeout with jquery on a png image and i get an annoying white flash before image animation

368337
post	get
also consider the order gpc get post cookie on which the _request will get filled

368367
vb.net	vb6
if you maintaining a vb6 or vb.net application over the long term i strongly recommend that you minimize the use of 3rd party controls

368415
directx	gdi
wpf uses directx for rendering which is much faster instead of the native windows gdi

368456
post	get
please post as an answer so you can get votes if its helpful

368457
equals	gethashcode
if you have a different but similar-for-the-purposes-of-equality object to compare to then you ll need to implement your own gethashcode equals and ideally

368461
post	get
there is or should be a semantic difference between a get request and a post request

368466
directx	gdi
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

368636
debian	linux
i m mainly concerned with debian linux but deb packages are not an option for the reasons ian bicking outlines here

368653
opera	firefox
copy this code in a jsp page testpage.jsp deploy this file in an existing context of a web application on the server i use apache tomcat then open a browser firefox ie7 or opera using the correct url localhost context1 testpage.jsp type your name in the input and submit the form

368655
client-side	server-side
you should create an api using objects and then create a web service interface around that api for java you would use java2wsdl on your interface and then wsdl2java to create a skeleton server-side implementation or client-side implementation i m sure that an equivalent methodology exists in wcf that all the other systems can query

368700
profiling	debugging
i found that it was much easier for me to develop code in eclipse compile it with ant using etaras rapc ant tasks but they seem to be gone -- blackberry ant tools seem to be a suitable replacement and use the jde for debugging profiling etc

368729
versioning	upgrade
if your shared components are tagged often enough then your colleagues are probably right and it s easier to manage the incremental changes from the most recent tag to the trunk than it is to manage the change from arbitrary versioning x determined at the last build to arbitrary versioning y determined when you choose to upgrade

368738
filesystems	ntfs
it looks like the ntfs filesystems could be improved with a better path caching implementation but clearly the gem tool could implement the caching itself and have its performance not so dependent on the platform

368757
post	get
requests that produce side effects should be post for semantic reasons and also because of basic csrf stuff a false img tag can hit any get endpoint without a user even knowing

368759
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
i prefer the argumentnullexception over the nullreferenceexception that not checking the argument would provide

368768
apache-poi	jxls
if you code for java 1.5 you try jxls what extends apache-poi and use xml xslt technologies

368813
post	get
the only problem is that disabled html form inputs don t get included in the post get data

368822
post	get
to re-enable it before submission so that get post data is included

368842
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested and working in ie 6 7 8b2 firefox 2 3 opera 9.62 safari 3.2.1 for windows and google-chrome

368882
stdout	stderr
the nul 2 1 redirects stdout and stderr to nul so nothing from pslist will be displayed

368888
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
the other potential exceptions that come to mind are argumentexception or argumentnullexception but these have a connotation of being related to parameters that are passed into the method and are not therefore appropriate to my mind

368902
inherited	properties
is there a class i can inherited from that gives me the application properties as in the view so i could to this

368956
post	get
i have forms in my page a get and a post and i want add pager on my get form

368976
free	malloc
i am under the impression that it s not good practice to mix new and delete with malloc and free

368998
post	put
edit you should probably also put the quoted part into the question as it isn t entirely clear from the original post

369003
pop-up	dialog
from the pop-up dialog you can decide what to clear

369009
inherited	properties
one of my favorite approaches is to take one of the built-in methods inherited from the object superclass replace it with a custom function passthrough and attach properties to that function object

369020
cvs	svn
they basically specialize in both cvs and now svn hosting

369026
mousemove	keydown
the context is the main window is a light-box-like system except instead of pictures it shows iframes and each iframe is an interactive page with keydown mousemove handlers

369036
put	get
in order to get something useful accomplished we need to put a real statement in so we get a slice of each pair which removes the single quotes and closing square bracket then further split on that conveniently-placed opening square bracket

369037
swt	swing
i use swt jface instead of swing for the native look and feel primarily.

369076
pull	push
git differentiates between commit and push pull so working offline works great

369101
bazaar	git
you re looking for a distributed revision control system such as git bazaar or mercurial

369102
post	get
i have a modelbinder setup that is able to build a messageobject from get and post parameters but i m not sure how i can reverse the process

369133
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind you need to use mysql 5.1.6 or newer to do this if not time to upgrade there s been some noteworthy speed improvements in the new versioning anyway

369150
rpm	yum
php 4 was built from a source rpm outside of yum s control

369221
ironruby	ironpython

fflush	gets
you should probably test that it gets fflush on exit to be sure

369266
entity-relationship	diagram
i tried using toad to create an entity-relationship diagram but after leaving it running for 48 hours straight it still hadn t produced anything visible and i needed my computer back

369350
postgresql	mysql
ea supports oracle mysql sql server multiple versions postgresql interbase db2 and access in one fell swoop

369354
erd	diagram
a single erd or set of erd s are not sufficient to document a system of this complexity any more than a class diagram would be adequate to document an oo system

369379
entity-relationship	diagram
in my experience entity-relationship or uml diagram aren t the most useful artifact - with a large number of tables diagram especially reverse engineered ones are often a big convoluted mess that nobody learns anything from

369413
min	max
if you really need to exclude null from the result and you can t prevent it from being in your array then maybe you should just iterate through the array with a simple loop and keep track of the min and max in separate variables

369413
min	max
you can still use the compare method on each object to compare it with your current min and max values

369443
yacc	bison
none of them are in python but i should think that starting from xblite might be more helpful than starting from yacc bison ply

369469
folder	directory
unfortunately in my application we do not have a finite or known set of upload target directory -- any share or folder in the network may be accessible

369605
inherited	properties
it doesn t matter where the properties comes from in the inherited chain

369605
inherited	properties
in short don t think of the states properties as mx states because the mx prefix of a properties is merely inherited from the component

369689
folder	directory
when i look at the directory in set working folder it seems to be ok

369741
public	protected
things like making sure that public and protected methods are documented prior to check-in to making sure that no work can be checked in without a corresponding work item

369766
put	get
can you at least get the users to put the company names into multiple text boxes

369779
entity-relationship	diagram
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram where you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

369794
rss	feed
i ve seen a few examples of rss feed in asp.net mvc like this and some samples in projects like oxite but none of them are complete

369834
filtering	grouping
with soundex you can store a pre-calculated soundex in your table and compare sort grouping filtering on that

369837
tunnel	vpn
the problem arises only when i connect to the server through a vpn tunnel

369878
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
a quick test shows that ie 6 reveals 27 items from a 27 item list safari for windows 3.2.1 reveals 22 firefox 2 reveals 20 and opera 9.6.2 reveals 16

369955
integer	unsigned
but a deliberate implementation choice of most vanilla graphics libraries is that they treat colours as unsigned 32-bit integers internally with the three or four as alpha is typically included components packed into the integer

369955
cpu	processors
remember that bitmaps are usually accessed by more parts of the hardware than your processors and the endian that is specified by say conventional display adapters is not necessarily the same as the endian of your cpu

370007
post	get
further to jimmy s post you can also use a hex-ascii translator to get this

370010
fiddler	charles
sure there are many tools such as charles fiddler 2 and firebug that allow you to do this via an interface but i d like to be able to automatically generate reports and the like based on this tool

370014
rss	feed
i am currently using it for atom feed but it is supposed to work for rss as well

370046
rsa	aes
i m looking at using rsa and aes exactly the same way gpg and pgp work

button	checkbox
in general i would name the button differently unless they are part of a radio checkbox set

370143
uiview	subviews
when you want one particular view shown simply add it as a subviews to that previously pushed uiview

370163
g++	gcc
if by understanding memory management in mingw g++ you mean understand how the mingw g++ compiler handles memory internally while it is compiling files such as when it allocates and frees abstract syntax tree nodes etc. then your answer is that as a multi-pass compiler gcc may not know the optimal lifetime for any particular piece of data but it does know that large groups of objects won t be needed from one pass to the other so it uses memory pools when possible and garbage collection elsewhere

370184
disk	ram
depending on the size of the data and the amount of ram available one of the best performance gains will occur by setting sqlite to use an all-in-memory database rather than writing to disk

370199
int	chars
the 4 bytes contain the number of the chars in the unicode tables as a 4-byte int

370283
int	double
however it will happily allow a variation where the double is changed to an int unsigned or any integral type

370293
int	double
i don t know why it would treat a double different from an int

370311
int	double
using g++ with no optimization -o0 it automatically inlines constant int variables but not constant double values

370314

370378
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox i get exception setting a property that only has a getter ie gives error google-chrome gives error but in opera it works if i assign it on the element not the prototype

370378
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you can however add a new function will work in firefox google-chrome and opera but not in ie since ie don t have the constructor property

370392
post	get
the primary most important aspect of this is don t trust that the input to your post get handlers will come from the forms you design

370409
icomparer	comparable
this example does not use the icomparer version of the orderby extension but relies on the fact the doubles are comparable already and returns the calcvalue assumed as double as the key

370515
folder	directory
i saw the biggest performance improvements when i copied the templates folder from the jar to the root web directory for the webapp

370572
mouse	keyboard
i expect it works like you described with a message loop that handles mouse and keyboard messages for the popup menu

370598
sproutcore	cappuccino
i m about to build a web app and i would like to use either sproutcore or cappuccino

370710
post	get
apologies for the long post but i wonder if i could get some more eyeballs on this before i submit a bug report to sun

370754
keydown	keyup
it only supplies the keyup and keydown events containing the keyeventargs structure

370778
vim	emacs
emacs with the psgml module can do it along with vim but both probably more low-lovel

370863
packets	multicast
packets on your multicast port

370863
packets	multicast
multicast packets on that port

370863
packets	multicast
inaddr_any to receive only multicast packets sent to

370881
uninstall	upgrade
the old upgrade was more an uninstall and a reinstall

370933
post	get
for wpf that works because you can t call the method by a get post request.

370933
hide	show
for the web you should make something more sophisticated not just hide show the button.

370937
datatrigger	eventtrigger
it s public because it s used as a base class for the triggers that ship with wpf trigger multitrigger eventtrigger datatrigger etc

370940
uninstall	upgrade
addendum thanks to divo s probing while the simplest hack that could possibly work is to say if install step is called its an upgrade call the uninstall step for the service first i d like a proper officially blessed answer

370948
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
using a simple version control software like svn git or bazaar is not exactly what i want

370970
vim	emacs
with vim or emacs i can put comments in the file that will be vim s settings for that file

371069
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen the same issue with ie 8 the issues does not occur in firefox google-chrome or ie 6

371106
postgresql	mysql
you might want to migrate the data from access to a database backend - mssql if your institution already has a license or mysql or postgresql if you have a budget of zero

371189
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you are writing custom collections anyway you can implement the inotifycollectionchanged or the inotifypropertychanged interfaces

3des	aes	rsa	aes	rsa	3des
i have used openssl in past and found it a great library for crypto apis including aes rsa 3des

371243
csc	vbc
not without rewriting csc or vbc

371257
width	height
i am not sure if this is what you mean but an often seen blur-like effect is created by creating a full height full width div-element with a background-color and opacity property set

371264
folder	directory
for example this should set up a virtual directory called testdir that points to the folder c inetpub wwwroot test

371300
inherited	subclassing
i m using nhibernate 2.0.1 and a table per subclassing inherited mapping strategy.

371348
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method should reflect the equals logic

371348
equals	gethashcode
if two things are equals then they must return the same value for gethashcode

371348
equals	gethashcode
if the gethashcode is equals it is not necessary for them to be the same

371348
equals	gethashcode
oh - for convenience you might also consider providing and operators when overriding equals and gethashcode

371390
post	get
i ve marked this post as community wiki so i won t get any reputation from it

jdom	dom4j
it s a java xpath implementation used for both jdom and dom4j

draggable	droppable
i m using jquery ui s draggable and droppable libraries in a simple asp.net proof of concept application

371468
draggable	droppable
when the page posts back partially updating the updatepanel s content i rebind the draggable and droppable

371470
bash	zsh
i d spend more effort learning posix sh as a start and then head towards bash or zsh

371490
put	get
get the first character after that comma and put it in front of the string

371547
post	get
in the same way as pre-increment it is probably best to implement post increment in terms of pre-increment so that you get the same behavior

371576
rss	feed
i highly recommend subscribing to his rss feed

371640
mouse	keyboard
my wrists only hurt when i m doing stuff that requires me to move my hand off the keyboard and onto the mouse or arrow keys and back constantly

371647
ironruby	ironpython
also no use to you but microsoft are going to be releasing ironruby studio and ironpython studio at some point in the future

371653
children	parent
i have the following class with a list of parent and children to be persisted in a hierarchy table

371668
doc	rtf
then i can determine if they need to be in pdf rtf doc or even converted to html

371703
nullreferenceexception	targetinvocationexception
when i call removeeventhandler with the same arguments as the installeventhandler call the last line throws a targetinvocationexception with an inner exception of nullreferenceexception

371713
folder	directory
this basically says if the url doesn t lead to a directory that exists or a file then go through my index.php also block out the logs library application and config folder because sometimes they are in the document root on some of my projects because of server limitations

371721
apache	lighttpd
a few have suggested using lighttpd over apache

371743
octree	quadtree
the reason to use a quadtree is because you can then split on x- and y-coordinates an octree on x y and z making collision detection trivial

371793
rss	feed
in rss feed for example you should have a guid for each item in the feed

371808
uicontrol	uibutton
interestingly corresponding classes like uibutton uicontrol don t use this idiom

371821
apache	lighttpd
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

371855
put	get
easiest way round it is to put event unsubscriptions in the observer s dispose method and remember to call it when you get rid of the observer

371855
children	parent
the parent observer always knows about its children so can call properties and methods on them directly if it needs to

371855
children	parent
the children publishers should know nothing about their parent

371855
children	parent
communication between children is then routed via a common parent events on the way up method calls on the way down

371868
subnet	packets
in this case the scheme has worked pretty well and even if a manufacturer screws up and issues cards with duplicate mac addresses things will still work ok as long as those cards are not on the same subnet since beyond a subnet only the ip address is used to route packets

371921
post	get
this is a web interface so i already know that i need to check the incoming post get for permissions and handle errors there anyway

371944
cumsum	accumarray
use built-in functions like sum cumsum diff bsxfun and accumarray to operate directly over the image matrix

371947
filtering	grouping
given that i have a valid directoryentry object for both the grouping i want to test and the account i want to check for i need a directorysearcher filtering string that will allow me to confirm that the account is in that grouping even if the account is a foreignsecurityprincipal

371982
accessor	properties
i had 2 problems upgrading from 5.0.15 to 5.0.17 one is that any fields marked as properties must not have any accessor

371982
accessor	properties
if you have an accessor for a properties field you must remove the properties tag and implement both accessor if you need them

372005
cvs	svn
i use this to invoke tortoise cvs svn functions to open a command prompt in the corresponding directory etc

372017
indesign	framemaker
page layout software started with pagemaker and the other main players in this space were its competitor quark xpess and now indesign with which adobe is essentially trying to deprecate and replace it and framemaker

372017
indesign	framemaker
framemaker would be the obvious choice if adobe didn t keep giving off signals that they are trying to deprecate it and move its user base to indesign

372017
indesign	framemaker
framemaker indesign ventura quicksilver arbortext and presumably the madcap products all come with facilities to do pre-press preparation

372049
jax-ws	jax-rs
i think the best thing about it is it s integration with newer technologies like jax-ws and jax-rs jsr 311 restful spec

372121
superclass	subclassing
this uses a kind of abstract superclass with mixins to create concrete subclassing that are disjoint

372152
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp
although you link to the php manual the strspn function comes from c libraries along with strlen strcpy strcmp etc

372198
int	double
i have two processes one will query other for data.there will be huge amount of queries in a limited time 10000 per second and data 100 mb will be transferred per second.type of data will be an integral type double int

372207
boost	allocator
i previously used localhost network programming to do that and used manual shared memory allocator before i knew about boost

i did a little experiment and it turns out that yes javascript is handled specially by ie but definitely not so by firefox safari opera or google-chrome

372291
mbunit	nunit
ok so i keep seeing how vs2008 has this nice unit test display and i can see people running nunit tests within it on dimecasts.net and this article seems to imply that mbunit v3 should have support for using visual studio s test runner

372333
opera	google-chrome
2016 update accessing the filesystem directly is possible via the filesystem api which is only supported by google-chrome and opera and may end up not being implemented by other browsers with the exception of edge

372414
inherited	properties
it shows the equivalence of a function which inherited its prototype but uses this to fill in a new object s properties and a function object that uses a specific prototype

372418
rss	feed
if you know xslt and understand the contents of your rss feed that s about 2-3 hours of work tops

372423
stdout	stderr
useful because you can feed the command input and get back both stderr and stdout separately

372455
moq	typemock
you want to use the interface so as to make the class wrapper swappable during testing using rhino mocks moq or typemock

372537
portrait	landscape
for the life of me i can t figure out how i m supposed to set the uitextfield to display the text vertically landscape mode instead of horizontally portrait mode

372589

i hope somebody can give me some insight or maybe in the future somebody get inspired by this humble post

372647

i m trying to submit a form who is rendered in a simplemodal dialog but my submit is never called when i m using ff3 opera google-chrome safari and ie works

372700
boost	stl
i notice that get set is not the c++ way as far as i can tell by looking at boost stl and even reading the writings of some of the top c++ experts

372700
getter	setter
c++ killed the getter setter

372737
cvs	svn
popular revision control systems like cvs and svn use text-based diff tools behind the scenes

372740
getter	setter
i tend to have getter and setter i just don t tend to call them getx and setx usually i ll do something like this for example

372742
pop-up	dialog
i thought about putting this in a try catch loop but i d rather do a test and then pop-up a dialog saying can t access smtp or something like that

372757
boost	stl
the stl and boost which was influenced by the stl just chose one design -- it s perfectly fine to have a different design for your classes

372760
gridview	sqldatasource
for example in webforms you can embed a sqldatasource with selection logic directly in your mark up and tie it to a gridview

372760
post	get
in webforms one typically sees only get post methods being used

372787
getter	setter
for most objects you will want to have getter and setter but you should always consider how the object will actually be used when you write them

372787
getter	setter	boost	stl
boost and stl are full of getter and setter they just do not use the names get and set instead they use names like length end reserve capacity etc

372787
getter	setter
your getter and setter should do the same

372798
disk	ram
in mid-2007 these machines with 4 or 8gb of ram and 5x 10k or 15k scsi disk cost between â 1 500-â 2 000 to buy

372800
getter	setter
i only use getter setter when there is no alternative

372810
getter	setter
c did t even have the possibility of getter setter so there was a habit of using direct access to members as in a struct

372810
getter	setter
c c++ have always favored speed and if there was any possibility of an old compiler that wouldn t properly inline a getter setter would have a speed penalty

372821
x86	64bit
note that this behavior can t be observed with double values on common processor as most x86 instructions have a version working with 64bit chunks such as movl

372836
post	get
post goes to the service get goes to the documenter and that returns html documentation

372981
ant	maven
i did not find any instances of things i needed to do that i couldn t do with ant and needed maven for

372983
post	get
i d say that soap processing generating query sending it get it processed then getting answer back may be more resource intensive than just a post even multithreaded

372983
profiling	benchmarking
profiling or benchmarking is probably the only way to be sure anyway

372984
put	get
so you could put up a google map allow a click to set drag a marker and then use the webservice to get the timezone offset

373051
equals	gethashcode
if your list contains objects you ve created overriding gethashcode and equals will help you out

373058
post	get
http get is semantically meant to be used to fetch a page while post can be argued that when used you d expect that some kind of state is changed

373058
post	get
for example there s an expectation that using get with the same parameters multiple times yield the same results while using post they may not

373058
post	get
i think the ruby on rails ajax libraries used get instead of post and lead to a lot of data being lost when being touched upon by web spiders

373058
post	get
you should know the purposes of what the page does and decide on how to answer a get request and how to answer a post request

373075
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox would be my first two choices

373099
pem	pkcs#12
i m having trouble figuring out what pem and pkcs#12 and all these things do differently from each other

373099
pem	pkcs#12
in a pem file the certificates and keys are base64 encoded and placed within some text delimiters a pkcs#12 file uses a binary encoding named asn.1 to structure the file - you can think of asn.1 as a binary form of xml

373099
pem	pkcs#12
openssl works best with pem while most browsers and emailapplications will expect pkcs#12 but you can freely convert between the formats

373106
folder	directory
anyway the virtual directory en fr and es are inside their respective country physical folder

373261
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade to the latest 64bit drivers versioning 177.82 release date nov 12 2008 and the result is the exact same

373302
spaces	delimiter
then the following xpath expression in the test attribute of either or evaluates to true exactly when the value of domain is one of the delimiter values in the string we use a spaces for delimiter in this concrete example

373304
cassini	iis
cassini if you can use iis instead of vs s integrated web server aka cassini

373451
mouse	keyboard
if the menus are triggered through keyboard action the accelerators should be shown but if triggered by the mouse the accelerators are intentionally not shown

373615
button	checkbox
view a gmaps ui with markers and polylines plus checkbox and button and vertex details and edge details divs

373615
button	checkbox
js functions that update the model when events on the checkbox and button fire

373669
google-chrome	safari
i have noticed some of the default fonts are smaller on safari then google-chrome also google-chrome uses the v8 javascript engine which has caused some people problems especially if you have a lot of form logic

373672
google-chrome	safari
simply google-chrome and safari have a lot of different features in their implementations and safari is pretty widely used

373674
mouse	keyboard
assuming that the course s software runs on windows there may be some that need to cover the basics of a computer what is a hard drive keyboard mouse monitor cpu motherboard etc

373679
google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed safari handles asian characters better than google-chrome

373679
google-chrome	safari
also google-chrome and safari rely on the same webkit for rendering pages but their javascript engines are totally different so if you use javascript in your pages you need to check both

373682
google-chrome	safari
yes safari and google-chrome even though they are using webkit the two versions of webkit that are being used are significantly different

373684
google-chrome	safari
safari uses mac fonts but google-chrome would use windows fonts

373684
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that there can sometimes be problems where using a font like arial it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome ie but on safari it can cause a line to wrap because the font is slightly bigger

373708
disk	ram
my choice would be probably based on the low write volume and it s a web app to scale up and stuff as much ram as i could in the db server with separate disk paths for the data and log files of the database

373776
google-chrome	firefox
windows firefox or google-chrome all monitor usage statistics and analyze the crash reports are sent to them

373780
freebsd	linux
many versions of sed often provide an option like -r gnu linux and -e freebsd that allows you to use modern-style regular expressions

373805
hash	salt
append the salt to the password and compute its cryptographic hash

373830
getter	setter
in summary each approach has certain perks that may be useful depending on the scenario field access allows readonly getter no need for setter property access works when nothing special is required from your poco and seems to be the defacto approach

373856
onkeyup	onkeydown
i have tried onkeypress onkeydown and onkeyup in the datagridviewcell but they never get called

373923
ada	pascal
this language family includes pascal and its descendants in the modula ada and clu families

373923
haskell	scheme
in languages where lambda is common such as haskell ml caml and scheme a great deal of effort has been expended making allocation blindingly fast

373923
haskell	scheme
especially in ml caml scheme haskell even anonymous functions are dirt cheap ---use lots of them

373935
jdom	xerces	versioning	upgrade
forget about proprietary apis such as jdom or apache ones xerces xmlserializer because will tie you to a specific implementation that can evolve in time or lose backwards compatibility which will make you change your code in the future when you want to upgrade to a new versioning of jdom or whatever parser you use

373972
ssl	https
but you may also want to consider making a constant define if you know this value won t change i sometimes change these values later in a site wide configuration file for example if i have an https ssl certificate for the website

373975
mouse	keyboard
you have the basic building tools right there - you can intercept all mouse events and nearly all keyboard events

373979
bash	tcsh
but the shell tcsh bash will assign that filename including its spaces to a single argument of tar

373983
rtp	sdp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp	rtcp	sdp
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.

373985
pop-up	dialog
i ve set up my server and my certificate successfully but due to me being cheap and not paying a certified ssl signer ie pop-up an annoying dialog about not being a valid certificate

373985
pop-up	dialog
so what i am wondering is how to make it so that ie does not pop-up a dialog saying that my certificate isn t signed by a reliable authority without visiting physically each computer

374010
client-side	server-side
server-side filtering validations is important for security while client-side validation and interactivity is important for usability

374028
versioning	upgrade
i modified the code and put it in the startup of my apps and have it check for versioning difference and upgrade automatically

374189
ssl	https
it s my first time working with smartcards digital certificates activex ssl and https

374189
ssl	https
i ve managed to work with de ssl and https smartcards ok digital certificates ok activex x also ok

374219
client-side	server-side
we are actually building two applications - server-side rails application to handle the data and expose them through json api and a client-side ext application that uses this api

374282
public	protected
i still can t figure out how to cleanly make some of these mixin methods private or protected though only the display and number_of_displays method should be included as public methods

374296
nexus	artifactory
i don t know about artifactory but here are my reasons for using nexus

374296
rss	feed
provides you with rss feed of recently installed broken artifacts and errors

374303
getter	setter
i am rewriting a project so that it uses getter and setter to reference the tixmlelement s

374303
getter	setter
or if you have succesfully implemented getter setter wrappers for tixmlelement s let me know how i can as well

374318
16-bit	64bit	int	double
i need to convert unicode strings in python to other types such as unsigned and signed int 8 bits unsigned and signed int 16-bit unsigned and signed int 32 bits unsigned and signed int 64bit double float string unsigned and signed 8 bit unsigned and signed 16 bit unsigned and signed 32 bit unsigned and signed 64bit

374322
allegro	sdl
i ve been doing c c++ for a long time but never really pegged myself as either win32 mfc directx wxwidgets qt boost sdl allegro etc etc

374343
affinity	processors
if you use threads set their processors affinity

374427
public	protected
create two buckets public protected give out url to the protected bucket s images once you have authorized the user to download them

374528
websphere	ibm
incidentally the two market leaders in this area are ibm with their websphere mq and related products and tibco with their enterprise service bus

374542
rss	feed
see this article for an example creating an rss feed

374565
lxml	elementtree
you should also check for lxml which is compatible with elementtree and has full xpath support

374605
swt	swing
there is jtoaster for swing but i wonder if there isn t any other implementation based on swt

374642
firefox	safari
- it happens in firefox and safari

374687
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
i could replicate the problem with various shells under freebsd gnu linux and solaris

374728
rss	feed
i have used erb on my own to make a script that took an rss feed and output the articles into an html file

374763
getter	setter
in python properties are used instead of the java-style getter setter

374763
getter	setter
but in cases were a property is not appropriate one might still end up with methods that behave like getter or setter

374885
post	get
i m looking into a restful design and would like to use the http methods post get ... and http headers as much as possible

374927
free	malloc
you can set it to check the integrity of the heap on each call to malloc or free

374943
post	get
i posted a reply there but since it s been marked as answered i don t think i ll get a response to my post there

374965
int	boolean
although boolean has only two values it is actually stored using 32 bits like an int

375031
coldfusion	railo
coldfusion 8 added a number of exclusive features that haven t been added to the other engines and vice-versa with railo and openbd

375037
getter	setter
you won t ever loose the chance to make your property behave like a getter setter later by using descriptors

375037
getter	setter
so my advice is to avoid getter setter unless the project you are working on already uses them because you can always change your mind later and make properties read-only write-only or whatever without modifying the interface to your class

375052
midi	osc
when an audio or midi clip is played triggered its name needs to be sent using osc to another application

375143
mouse	keyboard
usually this type of thing starts off pretty simple and gets a bit complex once you start handling caching paging selection mouse and keyboard input and so on

375149
children	parent
this tells the vbox to ignore it s children s measurements when sizing itself and calculate its height instead based on it s own it s parent constraints

375160
getter	setter
if the getter setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x

375165
move	drag
so far i have drag and drop functionality where the item is visually attached to the mouse and can be move to a drop target

375191
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
you have to do it like this for ie opera safari or google-chrome

375242
for-loop	loops
or you could iterate over them with a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

375302
hide	show
you could add some javascript in the usercontrol to test whether window.opener is non-null and on that basis hide or show the close page ui

375310
post	get
edit so i just found out that get methods indeed work but post methods however do not work

375310
apache	nginx
my backend works fine on apache but i had to install a module working with nginx lib-www

375310
post	get
it now works but for some reason post get methods don t work..

375320
firefox	safari
also i am doing my development in firefox i just posted the screenshot from safari

375426
onkeyup	onkeydown
use the onkeydown and onkeyup events to check for key press events in your results div

375472
pop-up	dialog
in a non-layered app you d just pop-up a dialog and get what you need

375484
mvp	presenter
the presenter or the controller depending if you do mvc or mvp should know about it not the domain the domain will assert defensive coding is as all needed values ok or throw an exception not ask for it

375545
pop-up	dialog
you don t pop-up a new dialog

375547
hiawatha	apache
i m trying to set up a light development environment to allow straight cgi in common lisp and i d like to use hiawatha instead of the much larger apache

375547
post	get	hiawatha	apache
i have code that works for both get and post in apache but only get in hiawatha

375555
post	get
the cgi specification only specifies that post data should be sent to a cgi script using the program s stdin as opposed to get which is sent in the environment variable query_string

375569
post	get
i get this error when i try that which i assume is because there s no enctype multipart form-data like i mention not wanting to have to do in my original post

375603
getter	setter
we were constantly writing wrappers in getter setter for date and time either we would store it as joda time and one set of getter setter passed it through and the other would convert on the fly and some classes stored it internally as a java date time and the joda getter setter had to switch it on the fly

375658
boost	stl
as far as boost and the stl i m pretty sure i haven t encountered this situation yet

375661
getter	setter
if i have to use a getter setter i like it this way

375689
button	checkbox
then i do a couple things like replace the radio button with checkbox and then run it through the pd4ml library to render the pdf

375693
memcpy	malloc
you can use memcpy which if i recall can be optimized to perform word copies if possible to copy to an aligned data structure something allocated on the stack or from malloc

375708
x86	64bit
i don t recall seeing an integer division instruction that handles 64bit for x86

375708
multiplying	division
it would multiplying 2 32-bit integers and split the results across 2 registers but not division as far as i recall

375734
relaxng	schematron
additionally it must satisfy a dtd or a schema an xml schema a relaxng schema schematron or other constraints to be valid

375739
superclass	subclassing
the workaround has been that you have to copy the implementation for the get method into the subclassing even if it does nothing differently from the superclass

375765
filtering	grouping
i have an application that uses datatables to perform grouping filtering and aggregation of data

375768
put	get
if i put a dblink in the name of the queue in the dequeue options i get an error

375784
width	height
all my silverlight user controls are set to auto height width

375794
hide	show
in your button click handlers you would need to 1 scroll the viewer and 2 check the new value of the horizontaloffset to see if you need to hide or show either of the button

375799
firefox	safari
about your edit mjpeg is supported by firefox and safari

375805
client-side	server-side
if you re more familiar with php than javascript or server-side scripting than client-side scripting i d also recommend you checkout xajax

375851
width	height
try removing the height and width properties in your control if you ve defined the internal xap s height and width correctly to scale you ve used auto then it should respect what dom boundaries it s contained within on the page

375864
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller too has some special nib-handling code so that it retains all the top-level objects in its nib when it loads so that they ll stick around as long as it does

375868
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie

375887
folder	directory
what i m trying to do is keep the .dll files i want my website to use in a higher level directory then the folder i have set as the web root in iis

375926
implements	sealed
i would make the class sealed possibly implements an interface which just has the value property

375930
vtune	gprof	valgrind	gprof
a few other buzzwords if gprof does not do the job for you valgrind intel vtune sun dtrace

375932
filtering	grouping
you d be better off letting your database handle grouping filtering and aggregation

375948
nlb	iis
iis has convenient pooling via a nlb such as f5 but has the app-pool recycle issue and the lag caused by iis spawning on first demand the app-pool domain etc in the first place

375996
int	double
i have two complex objects with string int double list and other home made data type objects of the same type

375996
equals	icomparable
note the object doesn t implement equals i have no control on that and doesn t implement icomparable

375999
hide	show
i d put the edit form in a user control and show hide it a la lightbox style

376014
try-catch	exception-handling
but steven is correct every root method must have a try-catch block surrounding any code that could throw an exception-handling your service should never have an unhandled exception-handling

376020
equals	icomparable
what i d do is write a class that implements icomparable and has a ctor that takes an object of your desired class and includes your equals function

376065
google-chrome	safari
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari

376069
google-chrome	firefox
test in one major non-ie browser firefox or google-chrome would be my suggestion

376071
folder	directory
my windows service is creating a directory on a shared folder and i am getting a error

376121
hide	show
i wan t to hide show menuitems in a contextmenu using some propery of databound object

376136
stdout	stdio
stdout is defined in stdio

376169
django	turbogears
i m not sure why you are against ror and php but you may also want to take a look at some of the python web frameworks 1 such as turbogears django zope etc

376172
stdout	fflush
you might not fflush the original stdout properly - losing information

376190
opera	firefox
my approach is to code for firefox opera and the other non microsoft browsers

376192
debian	linux
i am running openoffice 2.4 on debian linux

376211
google-chrome	safari
once your page is mostly done verify that it still looks good in safari and google-chrome also both highly-compliant browsers so you shouldn t have too much trouble then start fixing it for ie both 6 and 7

376221
poi-hssf	jexcelapi
i ve looked at xlwt and xlrd for python as well as jexcelapi and poi-hssf for java

376227
free	malloc
is probrably using the new allocated memory but if it isn t malloc could be failing with out you knowing untill it is derefrenced with the free

376316
versioning	upgrade
if it shows 3 then it has been upgrade to 1.5 that s the versioning of the updated fielsystem

376395
portrait	landscape
the game is oriented in landscape mode but when i call to show the alert the alert pops up in portrait mode while two keyboards are displayed one in landscape and one that s the size of the landscape one in portrait mode

376419
awt	swing
this is not true for graphics swing awt however which tend to be unpredictable and not necessarily reproducible across different platforms

376427
getter	setter
ie even if the controller class implements the required functionality of setting up connectivities the users can still access setter getter functions in the the dto directly to set them up themselves.

376440
post	get
works just like a clicked download ie using get not post

376451
disk	ram
video conversion takes a lot of cpu and ram and storage takes a lot of disk space and bandwidth

376462
ienumerable	ienumerator
however with just ienumerable ienumerator there is no way to know for sure wether or not there are more if you use foreach

376486
post	get
you get the method not allowed error because the default http verb for the web service calls is post and when you just type the url in the web browser the verb is get

376486
post	get
to enable get instead of post decorate your operation with the following additional attribute

376531
post	get
what you would need to do is to get your program to send a https post request to that url and then you would need to parse the html that comes back to extract the results you are interested in

376653
lisp	prolog
in paip chapter 11 norvig solves the zebra puzzle using a prolog embedded in lisp

376673
short	base
in short the interface is more valuable than the base class but a base class might save a lot of time and reduce buggy interface implementations

376691
width	margin
make a note of the values for page width left margin right margin

376691
width	margin
to render in pdf correctly body width + left margin + right margin must be less than or equal to page width

376691
width	margin
remember body width + left margin + right margin page width

376695
globalization	localization
this will make other things easier in the future like localization globalization

376716
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s pretty much because people who write and use interpreted-language tend to prefer ducktyping and people who develop and use compiled-language prefer strong explicit typing

376716
vb6	vba
classical visual basic vb6 vba etc. the same program could be written in vb and run with identical results and comparable speed either compiled or interpreted

376725
google-chrome	firefox
i m not encountering this on flock which is a firefox variant nor on google-chrome ie

376788
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
margin padding height and width will be your friends sometimes you need to specify these values to see the same thing on many browsers

376798
inherited	properties
i inherited an application which uses a java properties file to define configuration parameters such as database name

376803
nhibernate	entityspaces
i have looked at nhibernate and entityspaces and they both seem to work differently

376817
min	max
just put a max or min whichever you prefer on it

376858
awk	ksh
i can t live without it and it is gradually displacing my sh ksh awk and perl scripts.

376871
emacs	textmate
custom textmate bundle snippets textmate s bundle editor is superb even though textmate lacks some important vi and emacs capabilities like split buffers

376874
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this is my simple test code which works in firefox and safari but does not work in opera

376901
typedef	struct
any typedef involving distinct struct will work

376925
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
nscopying nsmutablecopying

376964
ami	rightscale
also you can signup for a developer free account on rightscale and you can test some of their ami and free scripts they are pretty impressive

376993
for-loop	arrays
if you want the value arrays to be zero-based change the for-loop to be 0 to n-1

377049
g++	gcc
instead of having xcode use gcc to build .c and .m files tell it to use g++ and your issues will be resolved

377101
min	max
it s also possible to do this in a branch-free way since min and max can be implemented as branch-free operations

377152
plink	prompt	stdout	stderr
one of the problems is that unison expects the password prompt to print to stderr but plink prints it to stdout and causes unison to be confused so i thought well should be simple enough hack my thru plink s code and make it print the prompt to stdout

377153
rowdatabound	onclientclick
in the rowdatabound onclientclick event handler its printing hi when i click on any row

377158
onmousedown	onmouseup
if you set the mouse cursor in the onmousedown and reset it in the onmouseup anything works fine

377221
lisp	smalltalk
or something lisp or smalltalk - was once the next big thing but it probably never will be again but still a language that changed signficantly my approach to programming in other languages

377262
haskell	ocaml	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml
go for a different paradigm functionnal lisp haskell ocaml erlang scala etc

377265
free	malloc
use new and delete over malloc and free

377293
folder	directory
this tells git-daemon to serve up all projects inside the current directory which i assume is the project directory containing the .git folder

377309
ninject	linfu
unlike ninject however linfu doesn t force you to write any binding code to wire up your dependencies together

377476
merb	ruby-on-rails
i ve seen ruby-on-rails and merb running under glassfish

377477
profiling	debugging
with adobe flex builder 3 im trying to do some profiling on swf files but the problem is that i can only do this on debugging swfs

377486
inherited	properties
i ve got a simple class that inherited from collection and adds a couple of properties

377486
ienumerable	icollection
i assume this is because of the special treatment that xmlserializer gives icollection and ienumerable objects

377494
ienumerable	ilist
both during serialization and in data-binding they will be ignored if the item looks like a collection ilist ienumerable etc - depending on the scenario

377506
int	double
for the third invocation of mymethod using objd why is the double overload being used when i am actually passing it an int

377513
jstl	taglib
i m getting the following error when i try to use the jstl xml taglib

377519
int	double
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority

377533
base-class	subclassing
there is a precedence issue - the overridden method is defined in the base-class so for best method purposes the overload even with an implicit cast is preferable since it is defined in the most-specific type the subclassing

377636
mouseover	mouseout
ive got the problem that i dont know how to stop my function with mouseover and restart it with mouseout

377646
domxpath	domdocument
i would suggest that you use domdocument and domxpath rather than simplexml

377650
versioning	upgrade
my approach to this is to use sql patch files files containing the sql statements to upgrade the db schema data with a versioning number at the start of the filename

377666
versioning	upgrade
my approach to this is to use sql patch files files containing the sql statements to upgrade the db schema data with a versioning number at the start of the filename

377679
fadein	fadeout
i m not sure exactly what you want to happen with regards to your fadein and fadeout effects in your fadeengine however i can give you two pieces of advice

377747
post	get
if you use office 2007 on the client end then you will get some nice buttons like post to my blog etc

377793
public	protected
in order to compile it needs to be able to resolve everything in the public protected api

377794
firefox	safari
it will work fine in safari but not firefox

377794
firefox	safari
however it now stops working on both safari and firefox

377868
converter	multibinding
to provide an object instance to your converter you can use multibinding

377895
for-loop	loops
in both cases the type info for the object o is determined at compile time.in the second instance o is seen as being global to the for-loop and in the first instance the clever java compiler knows that o will have to be available for as long as loops lasts and hence will optimise the code in such a way that there wont be any respecification of o s type in each iteration

377898
versioning	upgrade
see if you can upgrade the driver to a new versioning

377950
integer	unsigned
typecast your signed integer to unsigned to halve the number of branches

377956
width	height
the video size width height ratio is 4 3 so in the case there are some other elements on the screen the video doesn t fill the whole area

377983
button	checkbox
that way if you decide to change to radio button or checkbox or a command-line interface later on only your ui code will change and not the database tables.

378009
vbscript	vb6
since the top answer here is in vb6 i thought i d add one here in vbscript since that s what the question is asking for -

378057
onmousemove	keydown	keydown	keyup
i get events like onmousemove onlbuttondown up dblclk but i don t get events like keyup keydown or mousewheel

378121
int	double
not undefined but an unexpected behavior is how double are rounded when converted to an int

378128
post	put
edit to put on my business hat if you add up the time spent waiting for builds + the time spent trying to speed them up may be enough to warrant upgrading or the vss add-on mentioned in another post already +1 d it

378137
getter	setter
then all getter and setter will access properties age

378155
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all the modern web browsers google-chrome ie safari and firefox come to mind are all ipv6 aware

378161
jlabel	jprogressbar
so to implement this i thought it would be simple to just use a list of jpanels each with a jprogressbar and a jlabel each of which can just accept focus to determine if it and others are selected

378165
g++	gcc
you can view the result in gcc of the preprocessor substitutions with g++ -e -dreport test.cpp

378174
jlabel	jprogressbar	jtable	jprogressbar	jtable	jlabel
how about a jtable which you can set to allow multiple rows to be selected with an internal jpanel occupying the single cell in each row which contains a jprogressbar and a jlabel

378179
jlist	jtable
the standard way of doing this kind of things is to use jtable or jlist as a container

378208
sorting	filtering
in the bigger picture this method is being used by a service class which is then supposed to add filtering sorting and all that - and the point of all this is of course to separate things out a bit but also to allow easy transition to a different database or a different or m later on if that would be the desire

378294
post	get
i understand that some amount of javascript is likely needed to get this done as i do not wish to actually perform the post with that amount of data if possible as asp .net does have an upper limit to the size of the request that it will service though i don t know what that is exactly

378307
versioning	upgrade
the advice i heard from one of the authors is to have a script that will upgrade the database from versioning to versioning rather than building up from scratch each time

378319
folder	directory
i frequently find myself with a folder open in windows wishing to have a command prompt open with the same working directory

378336
hash	salt
you can post all needed information if you include a salt hash field calculated from values of non-editable post fields

378336
hash	md5
the hash could be an md5 of

378356
vb.net	vb6
there were times i fired up vb6 vb.net later to work out some complex interaction and then translated it over to it s win32 equivalent in c++

378386
children	parent
i think the only way to do this is to loop through the parent s children until you find yourself

378406
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
in general this is a main reason why many people choose something like nunit xunit.net or mbunit over mstest

378439
ndepend	fxcop
an alternative to fxcop would be to use the tool ndepend

378457
ndepend	fxcop
an alternative to fxcop would be to use the tool ndepend that lets write code rules over c# linq queries namely cqlinq

378474
ndepend	fxcop
an alternative to fxcop would be to use the tool ndepend that lets write code rules over c# linq queries namely cqlinq

378474
ndepend	fxcop
ndepend overlaps with fxcop on some code rules but proposes plenty of unique code rules

378556
google-chrome	safari
i m having trouble getting this code to show up correctly in webkit browsers google-chrome safari

378757
hide	show
since there are few events to work with in notes developers commonly use the document refresh as the event to cause the field to hide or show

378757
hide	show
then in your hide when formula for the subject field you specify your criteria for when to show or hide that field

378791
opera	firefox
it covers the internet explorer firefox and opera web browsers with focus on the html css dom and ecmascript technologies

378813
setinterval	settimeout
passing strings instead of functions to settimeout or setinterval

378825
int	boolean
public static boolean morethan1bitset int b

378834
rss	feed
it s a bit like trying to keep up with everything in your rss feed or read absolutely everything on a mailing list

378854
ironruby	ironpython
they are very nice features and i m especially looking forward to ironpython and ironruby as well as new tdd features of vs2010

378874
single-quotes	double-quotes
if it could contain both single-quotes and double-quotes you need to sanitize the output on the server using a server-side technology more sophisticated than

378985
hide	show
i am using a panel to determine whether to hide or show the image but am having trouble with the statement

379014
superclass	subclassing
the superclass should not release objects that its subclassing create

379028
gridview	rowdatabound
handle the rowdatabound event in your grid assuming you re using gridview for datagrid it s itemdatabound and then do this

379057
public	protected
which concerns protected fields but what is said there is even more true for public ones

379094
filtering	grouping
then i will start uncommenting the joins select columns grouping order fields filtering to issolate different parts of the query to see what is happening

379131
listboxitem	textbox
the item index in the listbox corresponds to line number in the textbox and the content of the listboxitem is a processed version of the corresponding line in textbox

379158
getter	setter
also you can add debug assertions inside the setter routine and the getter routine though this is less useful to make sure the object is in a valid state when setting the value

379212
apache-poi	jxls
per this so post i found out about jxls which uses apache-poi

379267
mouse	keyboard
the user does something with the keyboard or mouse and that event is sent to the rest of the software

379275
outputstream	inputstream
the problem with your question is that you are mixing outputstream and inputstream

379275
outputstream	inputstream
an inputstream is something you read from and an outputstream is something you write to

379275
outputstream	inputstream
your existing method would be more useful as a generic pipe implementation where you can pipe the data from an inputstream to and outputstream but you don t need it for writing poi objects

379307
children	parent
the one exception to this behavior with one-to-many relationships is when you ve got a list of parent objects that you intend to iterate over and for each parent you want to iterate over its children

379322
inherited	properties
so i guess i could inherited an animal class for common behaviour like walk sleep etc and then have a specialised interface for a lion perhaps which would contain specific behaviour and properties - like the animal is dangerous eats humans etc

379332
websphere	ibm
a few people are pushing hard for using websphere integration developer and websphere process server as the defacto platform for developing future applications...because they feel ibm is a stable vendor the tools are made for the enterprise they drank the business agility bpel kool-aid etc

379338
turbogears	cherrypy
edit the turbogears framework takes the cherrypy web server and bundles other related components such as a template engine data access tools javascript kit etc

379343
implements	extends
it seems to me its very easy to implements an implicit operator versus a typeconverter so i m assuming they aren t equivalent because of the prevalence of typeconverters in the framework see anything that extends frameworkelement

379443
inherited	properties
has-a relationships rather than inherited s is-a relationship. assuming you interface with the api in question via an object maybe you can just keep that object in a properties of your framework main class so you d interact with it like

379449
int	double
fraction double value int

379471
xdebug	xhprof
another option is xhprof which is similar to xdebug but lighter making it suitable for production servers

379472
submit	submission
the link you provided in the question explains that ie6 submit all the buttons with every form submission so your app won t work with ie6 no matter what workaround you use

379494
textmate	bbedit
however textmate bbedit and subethaedit do nicely too

379499
actionscript	haxe
while most other languages are bound to their own platform java to the jvm c# to .net actionscript to the flash player haxe is a multiplatform language

379528
gif	png
this will require a bit more code as what your code is trying to do is to download an already existing image such as a gif png or even another jpeg and converts it to jpeg

379592
implements	extends
one thing you could do is instead of relying on the built-in behavior you could implements a ssoauthorizeattribute which extends the authorizeattribute class and overrides onauthorization

379597
webkit	gecko
if you want to get serious i d start by looking at webkit gecko and oo.org but i guess the algorithms for kerning and size calculation are not trivial

379652
fontfamily	font-size
i would like all of them to have the same fontfamily and font-size

379662
rss	feed
5. rss feed are very valueable in search ranking

379677
for-loop	arrays
from a text file i m trying to store two strings from that file into arrays and then do the same with the next line or until i desire using a for-loop

379695
post	get
the part i m redoing is how i get the information for the last post for the index page

379695
post	get
so i need to grab the latest post_date see which user posted that then see if parentpost is null if it s null then the last post is a new thread so i can get all the info of the title and user there but if it s not then i need to get the info title id of the first post in that thread which can be found by seeing what post_parentpost is looking up that id and getting the title from it

379740
superclass	subclassing
isinstance is preferrable over type because it also evaluates as true when you compare an object instance with it s superclass which basically means you won t ever have to special-case your old code for using it with dict or str subclassing

379749
post	get
for displaying the index page you only have to select data from one table board_forums - this is definitely much faster than selecting a second table to get the last post information even when using a clever join

379798
post	get
get post encrypted obfuscated get - no real difference

379867
put	get
customer x is willing to specify ahead of time what commands she is likely to want to use in windows-speak and then hire the developer to translate those into bash commands and then put them together in a script that allows her to talk windows-speak to bash and get back the list of commands

379907
hide	show
i basically hide and show them so it can go in a loop

379913
puts	gets
but a timer may be a better system or a function that gets them all puts them in an array then pops them off one at a time with a delay in between fading them in one at a time

379953
sorting	grouping
if you re sorting or grouping on the memo fields that could do it because sorting on memo fields is supposed to truncate them to 255 characters though in the test i just ran on a2k3 sp3 with all the latest post-sp3 patches mere sorting doesn t truncate but grouping by does

379970
ccl	ecl
and yes this works in ecl and ccl as well you can use uffi or cffi which simply lets you call c functions which is what other people are talking about

380003
ia-32	x86
if you just need to understand what each instruction does the reference manual for the ia-32 x86 ia64 instruction sets are located here

380008
children	parent
both children and parent have custom drawing routines onpaint

380014
post	get
i have a 100 valid ajax model written in javascript with a few inputs i use being get or post method what page to communicate with what string to send to that page and what element on my own page i might be fiddling with when i receive my response

380014
google-chrome	firefox
the error doesn t come up in firefox or google-chrome as i would exepect as the ajax is asynchronous

380019
dlsym	dlopen
functions dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose

380068
hide	show
we have created our functional faux- to show so we can hide it by class -ing it as replaced adding

380074
innodb	myisam
this effectively copies the entire myisam table to an innodb table then once that succeeds it drops the myisam table and renames the new innodb table to the name of the former myisam table

380074
innodb	myisam
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

380074
innodb	myisam
unless you re running an old unsupported version of mysql 5.0 or earlier you should use innodb as your default storage engine choice and use myisam only if you can demonstrate a specific workload that benefits from myisam

380075
disk	ram
we are forced to use their desktop pcs for development and those workstations are pretty old models with low ram and single-core pentium 4 cpus and cranky disk

380091
integer	unsigned
the foeign key field and the field being referenced must be of the same type i only use integer and after hours of pain they must be unsigned

380092
int	chars
well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

380095
serializable	deserialization
if you want to inject your own custom serializable deserialization logic you can use idatacontractsurrogate which can be applied using datacontractserializeroperationbehavior

380106
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere mq 5 and 6

380111
ienumerable	ilist
where you methods would accept either ilist to access the index or ienumerable to use a foreach loop on the collection

380112
mvp	presenter
this is by the way an adaption of the mvp model view presenter pattern

380149
range	minimum
finally if the operands are all neg the minimum will be found in the upper range and the answer will be neg

380162
mvp	presenter
projectname.ui.presenters a couple of presenter for mvp forms

380171
int	chars
note i had to convert the chars to int and subtract 97 to get the appropriate index for the array

380247
super	abstract
belong to a base super class abstract

380357
stdout	stderr
nohup sends stderr and stdout into files

380387
wan	lan
work home.ps1 and work work.ps1 modify the hosts file to go through lan or wan addresses

380392
mouse	keyboard
a good radio keyboard + laser mouse

380442
int	chars
so for example a chars might be the size of a byte on a system while an int may be 4 bytes

380460
folder	directory
if you just want to know whether this directory is under revision control or not you can look for the folder with all the data in it -- for svn it s called .svn you may have to switch on view hidden directory for darcs its _darcs

380470
folder	directory
and as greg states there is also a .svn folder in each directory under svn

380498
children	parent
you represent a certain focus in the tree plus a context up to parent down to children which gives you the whole tree in a form where it s easily modifiable at the focus and it s easy to move the focus up and down

380558
pyopengl	pyglet
other choices would be pyglet or using pyopengl you can most likely draw to a wx widget too though i ve never done it

380573
debian	linux
in my version of mail debian linux 4.0 the following options work for controlling the source reply addresses

380637
uninstall	upgrade
not a direct answer but the key difference between an upgrade and an uninstall+ a reinstall is that any custom uninstall steps are not called in 2k8 but are in 2k5

380637
versioning	upgrade
the other difference related to this is that in 2k8 the files get upgrade based on the versioning info resource - if your modules dont have newer versioning they dont get replaced

380671
uninstall	upgrade	uninstall	downgrade
as 2008 doesnt do a naive uninstall + install the install step would need to be able to handle both upgrade and downgrade scenarios

380706
notepad++	textpad	notepad	textpad
ordinarily text editors identify this bom correctly notepad does as does notepad++ i m not familiar with textpad

380732
vmware	virtualbox
maybe you can replicate the environment with a vmware disk image or in virtualbox or similar and debug this faster

380750
redmine	trac
trac doesn t have time management support while redmine does

380750
redmine	trac
for these reason in my company we are thinking to switch from trac to redmine

380757
redmine	trac
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

380765
hide	show
you can decide via parameters per-row and show-empty if you want empty cells to show up or if you want to hide them

380781
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
monitor all calls to new delete and malloc calloc realloc free

380781
free	malloc
with this you can identify wrong calls new free or malloc delete or missing

380793
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
overusing libraries for selecting nodes with complex selectors when native methods can be used getelementbyid getelementsbytagname etc.

380813
downcasting	upcasting
upcasting is allowed in java however downcasting gives a compile error

380839
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i work for ibm as a websphere consultant so my thoughts are influenced by that and the ibm product most often suggested as an answer to the above questions websphere service registry and repository

380855
opera	firefox
what is the correct syntax to create objects in javascript that will work across the majority of web browsers by that i mean ie 6+ firefox 2+ opera 9+

380866
3des	aes
sha1 | md5 | 3des | aes

380866
3des	aes	des	aes
auto | des | 3des | aes

380889
coalesce	isnull
i have tried isnull case statements coalesce and dynamic sql with exec and sp_executesql and failed to implement any of these

380932
getter	setter
while the anonymous function gets executed right away the getter setter get executed for the first time when they are called

380937
translation	localization
to use the built in localization resource provider in asp.net can only handle translation strings see getstring key locale with no user defined arguments if i have read the documentation correct

380985
udp	tcp
tcp udp 53 dns

381016
hide	show
i am using a panel to determine whether to hide or show the image but am having trouble with the statement

381025
getter	setter
in the above example i am creating a new object inside of the function and then attaching getter and setter to this newly created object

381063
post	get
i need fire a filter method with all string in get or post value from http request before it was bind into controller action

381082
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
is there a similar mechanism in hdl vhdl or verilog

381088
gridview	repeater
it executes a query using oracle and binds the results to a gridview and repeater webcontrol

381155
onmouseover	onclick
3. any onclick onmouseover etc

381205
disassembly	shellcode
i ve disassembly the shellcode

381214
google-chrome	firefox
i have observed this behavior in google-chrome and firefox

381226
implements	extends
you can extends defaultwidget to create your own nicewidget and implements your own calculateheight to return a nicer size

381235
wtl	atl	boost	stl
this is what i m doing now and i m using all of the nice things like stl atl wtl boost sqlite directx etc

381235
ogre	irrlicht
if you just want to make a game with artists and other people collaborating to create a finished product use one of the existing engines ogre irrlicht nebula torque etc and just add in your game logic and art

381235
boost	stl
as i ve come to realise that other libraries such as stl boost directx etc have an order of magnitude or three more man-hours of development time in them far more than i could ever spend on that portion of the game engine

381349
post	put
see also this stackoverflow post for a discussion on what content to put into functional specs

381368
cpu	processors
the cpu always reads at its word size 4 bytes on a 32-bit processors so when you do an unaligned address access â on a processors that supports it â the processors is going to read multiple words

381385
ienumerable	icollection
the .net 3.5 extension method ienumerable t .count will enumerate behind the scenes if the return value does not implement icollection t which may be undesirable

381385
ilist	icollection
i often return ilist t or icollection t when the result is a collection - internally your method can use a list t and either return it as-is or return list t .asreadonly if you want to protect against modification if you re caching the list internally

381436
pascal	delphi
when i was working with delphi i had to convert code samples from c into object pascal - doable but tedious lots of friction

381452
teamcity	nant
the annoying thing is that nant gui can run the build file without error so i don t see why teamcity should fail since i believe it to be using the same subversion client as nant gui and the same ms .net framework version too

381471
folder	directory
the wildcard option on the getdirectories call will allow you to grab all the directory contained in the windows folder directly that match the pattern sys

381471
folder	directory
for instance say you wanted folder that are contained by folder directly inside the windows directory - i have no idea how you would go about something like that i m afraid...i don t imagine exporting the entire tree structure to xml and using xpath to do it would be so efficient - the xpath would be fabulously simple for parsing out using wildcards - but converting to xml wouldn t be so efficient.

381494
min	max
it s quick and easy to tell if there s overlap in the sets since you only have to compare the min and max values to order them

381494
min	max
in the simple case above set2 max set1 min set4 min set1 max and set1 and set3 have some overlap

381495
int	double
if you are dealing with simple values like int or double it will not matter performance wise if you resize and set or reserve and push_back

381497
put	get
i put it in my root assembly for my application framework and enforce is at the root so it is very easy to get to

381520
width	height
the width of the treeview should drive the width of the other objects and i need the height of the textblock to change to display the full text

381559
hash	md5
if it s a well-known algorithm like md5 and someone can get hold of the hash output then on their own cpu time they can rapidly check against possible passwords and if they find a match then they ve got the password

381632
post	get
i prefer the second one because you can have more option for post get or for cookie

381727
awt	swing
for now anyway gnu java gcj has not implemented a lot of these - most importantly i think that the desktop awt swing has not been done

381873
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview that is using a linqdatasource for it s datasource

381967
range	max
i saw a method for getting scale and precision from the data but my data doesn t necessarily have values in the max range of scale and precision from the xml files

381975
int	boolean
for example consider cases when is false boolean or 0 int

381992
translation	localization
they are generally licensed in two forms one for the developer to generate localization assemblies or resx source code and one for the translator to store translation strings to from an internal database

382063
octal	decimal
if the web service returns 0010 i want the autocomplete extender to also display 0010 and not interpret it as octal and display a decimal equivalent

382083
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i also came across a topic in the apache documentation that suggests putting the configuration in the httpd.conf file instead of .htaccess files

382129
content-disposition	content-type
when you put the object in s3 you need to also include content-type and content-disposition headers and whatever else you may want

382137
getter	setter
i have cursed at the annoyance of making getter and setter myself though so i understand why one would want to make creating those as easy as possible but i d rather see get set and getset annotations than more syntax thingamajiggers to do the job

382171
google-chrome	safari
this works like a charm in most browsers except that it doesn t in webkit browsers like safari and google-chrome

382171
submit	submission
i don t care if the enter key submission is undesireable without javascript on webkit browsers but i can t remove or change the order of the submit buttons

382267
jsf	seam
the move to a newer version of richfaces will also result in never versions of jboss and seam as the current production build of richfaces 3.2.1 requires jsf 1.2

382292
post	get
alternately you could have a textbox with an id of id and a submit button in a form that post to home get

382294
put	get
these control where the to workspace and from workspace blocks get and put their results

382319
implements	extends
i realized that a more elegant approach is indeed to use a router but for that you would need to create a custom one by extends the zend_controller_router_abstract class and implements the route method

382516
public	protected
this mean it could have more than one sections of private public or protected

382518
imperative	declarative
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

382528
3des	aes	3des	dsa	rsa	aes	rsa	3des	rsa	dsa
now this application was never fully finished so i don t support things like dsa key-pairs but i do support rsa key pairs with sha1 md5 using idea aes i think my 3des code does not work correctly but i may have fixed that since

382535
versioning	upgrade
deactivate reactivate feature -- i would wrap the updated dll back into the sharepoint solution file change my code above to reflect the new versioning and use stsadmin to upgrade the solution

382576
uiview	subviews
i have a .xib file containing a uiview and 2 uilabel subviews linked to a class named note with outlets assigned to each label appropriately the definition for this class contains the following

multiplication	modulo
this approach isn t unbreakable but it s a step up from using a constant for the xor-ing - and prngs are very simple to implement typically consisting of one multiplication and modulo for each word

post	get
my previous post did not get formatted correctly

382740
width	height
but then width and height are only supported on all elements starting from version 4.3

382740
width	height
so perhaps the safest way to really make it work on all blackberry firmware versions is to use an image for the warning and use css to set its width and height to zero

382740
width	height
i don t know if setting its width and height to zero would still hide that alt text then

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox opera safari and ie8 beta 2 all do correctly find out the feed and lighten up the relevant address bar button - it s just ie7 that stays greyed out

innodb	myisam
while i agree with the innodb comments i will give a solution to your myisam problem

rss	feed
many people think that rss should be plain text and that css in rss feed is inappropriate

382960
rss	feed
it s probably not appropriate to impose a different font on your rss feed

383102
jobs	cron
django-command-extensions also has commands for automating scripts as cron jobs which is something you mentioned that you d like to do

x509	openpgp
what you need is public-key encryption using either openpgp or x509

x509	openpgp
in both cases you can encrypt the single block of data for multiple recipients using their openpgp keys or x509 respectively

i would like to create a desktop application preferably in c# running on .net or mono that would read write information phone book calendar calls text messages etc. from to my connected usb bluetooth symbian phone se p990i but i don t seem to be able to pick up the right keywords to google for it hence cannot get started

383201
accessor	properties
this properties is not directly accessible with scripts but it is the chain of objects referred to with the internal prototype properties that is used in properties accessor resolution

383201
inherited	properties
the value of this properties is either null or an object and is used for implementing inherited

383221
opera	firefox
i would imagine pipelining as supported in http 1.1 would mitigate the connection limit issue but it is disabled by default in firefox and ie opera has it enabled

383232

every object has a hidden properties which is used for inherited

opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and ie7 has named their functions opera and ie7 tells you that it will not reveal the implementation

383290
opera	google-chrome
i get undefined from opera and ie7 null from google-chrome and object object from ff3

383320

now i have run into another issue that works well in ie7 but not in firefox 3 and safari

vb.net	vb6
while i have no direct experience about vb.net against vb6 old habits i do for c++ against stripped-down c-like c++

383366
inherited	properties
function.prototype is the prototype from which all function objects inherited - it might contain properties like call and apply which are common to all function instances

383366
inherited	properties
objects which are created using function.prototype as constructor would inherited its properties - but as there should be no reason to do something insane like this setting it to null undefined or an empty object is reasonable

383405
put	get
i put together a small test page to isolate the problem but couldn t get it to work at that page either

383502
pull	push
i agree with frankodwyer flip the protocol from a pull model to a push model

383519
udp	tcp
moreover the protocol caters for reliable ip multicasting which in a multi-client environment may give you performance-wise a definite edge against anything implemented using point-to-point tcp or udp connections only

383522
post	get
greasemonkey embedded a local flash file that would fetch the image based on a url in the source of the webpage use actionscript to get the darkest pixel and then send a post request with those coordinates as values

383540
dictionary	map
javascript has no built-in general map type sometimes called associative array or dictionary which allows to access arbitrary values by arbitrary keys

383540
getter	setter
javascript s fundamental data structure is the object a special type of map which only accepts strings as keys and has special semantics like prototypical inheritance getter and setter and some further voodoo

383540
inherited	properties
you might also involuntarily access its inherited properties if you don t check hasownproperty

383563
int	boolean
the boolean values are compiled to int data type in jvm

383579
rss	feed
unfortunately the rss feed are useless since the file names are meaningless

383582
int	chars
since strings in java are unbounded in length and each chars has 16 bits and int have 32 bits you could only produce a unique mapping of strings to int if the strings were up to two chars

383635
opera	firefox
the next step would be to pass the string to javascript and in javascript you could take advantage of the ability to embed base64 images supported in firefox opera not ie

383705
hash	md5
aside from this there are cryptographic hash functions such as md5 and sha where collisions are extremely unlikely though with a lot of effort can be forced

383705
hash	md5
note there are also some theoretical weaknesses in some hash functions md5 but for your purposes that probably doesn t matter and you could just use the most efficient such function - those weaknesses are only relevant if someone is maliciously trying to come up with strings that have the same code as another string

capitalize	capitalization
capitalization of methods tends to be a mixed bag my methods tend to be verbs and are already distingished by parens so i don t capitalize methods

383833
next	except
an alternative would be to access each element and then null their references to the next node but then i d be basically doing it like in c++ except i wouldn t be explicitly using delete

383836
free	malloc
setting pointers to null in java is not the same as in c where setting a malloc ed pointer to null prevents it from being free

383887
versioning	upgrade

383919
pull	push
seems to be there s a push and pull between coordination of data and flexibility of behavior which can be mitigated by putting the singleton around just shared data with the smallest amount of behavior as possible to ensure data integrity

384029
httprequest	httpresponse
if the system had httprequest and httpresponse objects the simplest way to dispatch would be to use a single function that routes to all of the possible choices

384035
min	max
this way the size of the galaxy is only limited by the max and min of the number used to hold the seeds

384038
internationalization	localization
i have always thought that the terms internationalization and localization and their funny abbreviations i18n and l10n were universally accepted and used for talking about software which is aware of language and cultural differences

384051
hide	show
if you mean an overlay element you can use the webbrowser navigating and loadcompleted events to show and hide the element

384057
hide	show
you are going to need to add another function call to hide the other div after the first call to show it

googletest	cppunit
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

384102
tortoisegit	svn
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

rss	feed
i did however finally manage to find the rss feed in the new profile version

384319
inherited	properties
this isn t the good part since you should always edit this part yourself but if you inherited methods and properties from either a base class or as in your case an interface it will copy the documentation automatically

384324
opera	firefox
in firefox opera and ie 7 i see the ocean.png and am able to click it

384343

maybe ie firefox and opera finds it illegal syntax and rewrite the input outside of the select but webkit does not

opera	google-chrome
this code is tested in ff3 ie7 google-chrome 1 and opera 9

filtering	grouping
the types of operations people will want to do with the reports are predictable filtering sort grouping by add or remove columns export to csv etc

384640
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools

384672
integer	unsigned
if you design your software around platform-neutral integer type names probably using the c99 header which when the types are available on the platform provides in signed listed and unsigned not listed

384716
postorder	inorder
taking your question at face value you want to print out the nodes in breadth-first order rather than using one of the standard depth-first orderings inorder or pre-order or postorder

384721
put	get
when i double click on a control in the designer it opens the .h file which i ve understood to be for prototype declarations and if i put all the guts to the functions in there i can get my program to work but i don t like having the code in the .h file

384890
imperative	declarative
for various reasons that i won t go into i want to stay with a declarative language and not some imperative scripting language such as groovy

384896
spaces	delimiter
.as ascii string of bytes - any delimiter except white spaces - whatever started it ended it

384906
public	protected
but ultimately it is the base-classes job to manage the state of those fields via any public protected etc members

384906
base-class	subclassing
the subclassing has to include all the fields from the base-class for it to make sense

384935
x86	64bit
at my company we have a mix of 32-bit x86 and 64bit x64 developer machines

384996
postgresql	mysql
somebody advised me to use php with postgresql or mysql

385040
googletest	gmock
however now i would take a long hard look at googletest and gmock as they would probably complement each other quite well

385087
ubuntu	centos
if you don t have the budget for another machine then use virtualization openvz is cool if your web server is hosted on ubuntu or centos to limit the cpu quota for the parser

385098
firefox	safari
it works fine with and tags but when i use import inside a it doesn t show up in the array - only as a cssrule style is undefined in safari 3 and firefox 3

385147
atan2	sine
any other format is going to rely on another implementation of sine cosine atan2 and square root at a minimum

385187
int	double
if there might be an issue with precision loss when using double or you won t be doing trigonometry i d suggest your solution of mapping to an int range - this will give you the best resolution can easily be converted to whatever display format you re locale will be using and - after choosing an appropriate 0-meridian - can be used to convert to floating point values of high precision

385223
post	get
and in your previous post you were probably voted down by people like me who use php to get things done

385224
memcached	apc
that being said php + memcached apc + beanstalkd goes a long way

385663
gif	png
very low overhead using png gif format

385713
integer	unsigned
assuming you have signed integers in your columns you may need to use cast a b as signed since the result of the operator is an unsigned 64-bit integer in mysql

385747
imperative	declarative
yes it s imperative rather than declarative and repeats the event name - but it s still pretty compact

try-catch	exception-handling
this means that the developer doesn t have to surround an exception-handling throwing clause inside a try-catch block

386070
udp	tcp
the sip communication will use tcp instead of udp because we specified it in the url and your application can look up the account information before you speak with the caller

386101
post	get
if for any reason get or post content-length is not in the header it means there s nothing to read after the blank line crlf

386232
xen	openvz
my other solution was to install xen or openvz and create n different vps per each ip but as you can see is definitely a pita -

actionscript	mxml
i think that i just don t fully understand how data binding works in flex - this is not a problem when using mxml components but when using actionscript classes the binding does not work

386581
width	height
here s a function i wrote that takes a gd image object max width max height and rescales within those parameters

386591
post	get
found some post here and went thru them and couldn t get it to work

386612
folder	directory
or can it be a folder directory on my computer

386629

ninject	spring.net
unless there s a very good reason i wouldn t go reinvent the wheel and implement a ioc container myself specially because there are are a lot of good options like unity ninject or spring.net

386673
awt	swing
as a general tip the painting in awt and swing article describes how you should handle repainting in either awt or swing

386726
cobertura	checkstyle
good amount of useful plugins like integrated checkstyle findbugs cobertura and so on - heck we even put continuous integration game to our hudson

386744
post	get	webclient	httpwebrequest
for c# i prefer to use httpwebrequest over webclient because you can have more option in the future like having get post parameter using cookies etc

386810
cvs	svn
support for lots of version control systems i ve used it with cvs svn and starteam

386826
ati	nvidia
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

versioning	upgrade
the very important thing is to make sure not to let the licenses lapse as the renewals on licenses cost a fraction of the initial cost and also include versioning upgrade

386904
content-disposition	content-type
as explained by alex s link you re probably missing the header content-disposition on top of content-type

386948
matlab	simulink
scilab is a numerical computation system similiar to matlab or simulink

386967
coalesce	isnull
if one of the terms in an expression is null the result of the expression is meaningless - unless the expression explicitly indicates via isnull or coalesce what to do if the term is null

386984
width	height
they allow you to expand the browser window any way you like but only stretch the presentation area so that it fits the smallest of the height or width

386996
innodb	myisam
the fulltext search engine is only available for the myisam engine not innodb which is the most commonly used engine due to its referential integrity and acid compliance

386996
innodb	myisam
basically you would have a table quotes that is an innodb table that rather than having your text field data you have a reference quote_data_id which points to the id on a quote_data table which is a myisam table

386996
innodb	myisam
you can do your fulltext on the myisam table join the ids returned with your innodb tables and voila you have your results

387020
put	get
then use with rcov and you will get some very readable out put that will tell you what files have 0 usage

387060
vim	emacs
same environment will work on solaris as well but this is of course force you to use vim as editor i pretty sure that emacs can work with both ctags and cscope as well

387098
put	get	post	put	post	get
this is obviously a subjective field but get put post delete is a rich enough vocabulary to describe anything

387110
width	height
you can reserve aspect ratio of contents using wpf s viewbox with control with fixed width and height inside

387150
width	height
through experimentation i have seen that the iphone will refuse to draw a frame that is bigger than 2000 pixels in either height or width

387255
bluetooth	usb
will tell you how to programmatically read messages contacts agenda and send them over usb or bluetooth

387267
getter	setter
and if you re coding in c# automatic setter and getter are a boon

387273
hide	show
the way i have accomplished this is by creating a user control with exposed show and hide methods

387291
filtering	grouping
for example if you have 55 000 rows returned for the report and the report server then has to grouping sort and or filtering those rows to render the report then that could take additional time

387291
filtering	grouping
i would have a look at the way the data is being grouping and filtering in the report then review your stored procedure to see if you could offload some of that processing to the sql code maybe using some parameters

387291
filtering	grouping
try and aim to reduce the the amount of rows returned to the report to be the minimum needed to render the report and preferably try to avoid doing the grouping and filtering in the report itself

387309
folder	directory
task under directory home i have various users home folder aaa bbb ccc .

387338
width	margin
grid column width resizes to textbox width + textbox margin

387350
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
since i develop on a mac i m a switcher after 20 years on windows and very happy having done so i test the sites in firefox 3 and safari 3 on my os x machine on a windows xp vm i test firefox 2 ie6 7 and 8 using ietester plus whichever other browser i want such as opera and google-chrome

387352
google-chrome	safari
when the user creates a home screen shortcut for the site it will launch in fullscreen mode separate from the normal mobile safari application and without the url bar or other google-chrome

387367
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
even if you could do true debugging each browser parses html it s own way so even if you could step through firefox to see how a rendering bug occurs that won t help you with ie or safari google-chrome at all because they execute parsing in their own manner

387395
button	checkbox
on the advanced options button there is a checkbox called refresh the data table

387487
google-chrome	firefox
you would have to punch a hole in the firewall to use a new browser like firefox or google-chrome

387534
firefox	safari
for firefox and safari the first condition is true for ie7 the second condition is true but for ie6 it falls to the last condition

387542
client-side	server-side
since you need both client-side for user convenience server-side because we re really very much past trusting the client at this point it seems like quite a decent idea to support both from a single infrastructure

387565
tabcontrol	tabitem
you can use a style applied to tabitem with a datatrigger that will collapse it if the parent tabcontrol has only one item

387581
post	get
i ll post this comment so it doesn t get destroyed before i can finish

387607
getter	setter
if you plan to set and or change these values dynamically during execution then use class variable with getter and setter

387613
javadb	hsqldb
in the java world i prefer using embedded databases such as hsqldb h2 or javadb f.k.a

387654
memcpy	memmove
i have experimented with memmove and memcpy and can t replicate this behavior

387656
des	aes
but remember that block algorithms such as aes and des work with 8 or 16 byte blocks so you will need to pad the array to what the algorithm needs

387669
width	height
allows you to set the width height and scale values

387679
entity-relationship	diagram
i would highly recommend learning how to put together a simple entity-relationship diagram

387702
stdout	stderr
it would have to apply automatically to stdout and probably stderr too

387702
stdout	stderr
if you use any of the features of io handle with your tied stdout or stderr it s basically a crapshoot to get them working reliably - i could not find a way to get the autoflush method of io handle to work on my tied handle

387739
mkdir	chdir
that is _stricmp _chdir _mkdir _getcwd instead of stricmp chdir mkdir getcwd etc.

387768
gif	png
i would really like to use a png instead of gif or jpeg

387773
memcpy	memmove
memmove and memcpy don t work that way because it s not a useful semantic for moving or copying memory

387796
disk	ram
this can be either ram or part of the page file system on the hard disk

387843
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the first argument in a w3c-compliant browser google-chrome firefox safari ie9+

387879
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
now i have found a way to do this in firefox using image tags that executes php scripts on the other domains essentially creating the different cookies on the different domains but this method doesn t work in ie havn t tested opera or safari etc

387885
lisp	scheme	lisp	smalltalk
i recommend everybody to learn lisp scheme or smalltalk

387885
squeak	visualworks
and yes there are more than one free ones squeak dolphin smalltalk x and visualworks non-comercial

387892
width	height
i had expected that you could two-way bind the width to the height using a value converter to maintain aspect ratio

387921
globalization	localization
i have a page that i use with globalization localization and i am redirecting via server not code from www.spanishversion.com to www.englishversion.com but the url is masked to still say www.spanishversion.com

387938
uiview	uiwindow
i ve tried other uiview types uiview uiwindow and see the same behavior so it s not restricted to uiwebview

388049
squeak	visualworks
in multiplatform smalltalk vms go for visualworks or squeak

388049
lisp	scheme	lua	scheme
well there are a lot of more to get your hands on scheme lisp ruby lua bash

388121
int	boolean
i picked miniature_count over owns for the name because owns sounds like a method that should return a boolean instead of an int

388123
width	height
when i try to reuse this on another page the loaded images are shrunken resized - i would like them to match whats defined in the width height but they get scaled depending on how the stage is scaled

388123
width	height
then in html the width height would be set to the width height of the images being loaded

388139
width	height
ideally you can pass in the height width via the attributes of the embed tag have a no resize on the canvas and use the passed in dimensions to set your image dimenions

388146
free	memmove
the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove

388165
memcpy	memmove
finally memcpy memmove aren t what you are looking for those are for making copies of blocks of memory from from area to another memmove allows source and dest to be part of the same buffer

388206
children	parent
however it is possible to alter a field in the parent object which requires persistence and i can determine that none of the children are affected

388223
google-chrome	firefox
and this is how it displays in firefox 3 google-chrome 1.0 and ie7 click for full size

388264
installation	upgrade
for example i ve setup netbeans flexbuilder eclipse textmate vmware fusion openoffice firefox dragged terminal.app to my dock upgrade the ruby installation and related gems and so on.

388264
fink	macports
macports or fink

388269
macvim	emacs	macvim	aquamacs	vim	emacs	vim	aquamacs	emacs	aquamacs
if you re an emacs vim user there s aquamacs and macvim

388276
vmware	virtualbox
you ve already done everything i have except i m using virtualbox instead of vmware

388277
mouse	keyboard
another tip is to get a decent keyboard and mouse

388277
mouse	keyboard
get yourself a real keyboard and a real mouse with multiple buttons

388297
ubuntu	linux
i m a .net developer and been asp programmer for more than 10 years so all i did was microsoft related never ever aparat of installing and playing with ubuntu i had experience in the linux world

388300
serializable	deserialization
hand-written serializable deserialization using binaryreader and binarywriter

388315
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
especially problems where a subclassing does not implement clone but inherited from a superclass that implements cloneable

388359
bazaar	git
but bazaar is really slow and i m thinking of moving to git

388389
mbunit	nunit
it adds to nunit the rowtest feature from mbunit

388398
post	get
if you search for odm or oidadmin you get a few pointers such as this forum post

388422
fink	macports
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from

388439
public	protected
since object.clone is protected rewriting it in the interface would force all implementers to provide a public implementation which class designers might not want to they might opt to keep it protected

388448
public	protected
a better design would be to have something like .net s memberwiseclone as a protected method in object and then a public clone method within the interface itself

388482
int	chars
have a look at org.apache.commons.lang.stringutils#rightpad string str int size chars padchar

388492
gif	png
this is especially lame for creating a web based game using png or gif sprites

388499
opera	safari
i think if you look at safari and opera you ll find they also filter the image

388601
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
according to mozilla opacity has been supported since firefox 0.9 opera 9 and safari 1.2 and filter since ie4

388658
google-chrome	safari
since you are on windows anyway you could try using the inbuilt javascript debugger of google-chrome which is a browser very similar to safari although the javascript engine is different

388742
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can easily create your own extension method on ienumerable or iqueryable

388761
ienumerable	ilist
so it is better to add addxxx removexxx method to the owner of the class and expose list an an ienumerable or which is better in my opinion expose it as an ilist and use observablecollection from windowsbase

388827
cil	ildasm
i ve done a lot of static analysis in .net cil last year and the best way to go is to use ildasm or any disassembler that will give you some quite easy to parse il language text file

388930
freebsd	debian
i can find it on debian and freebsd

388937
width	height
the autosize doesn t work because it will grow in width not in height

389019
put	get
basically the global.asax file doesn t actually get compiled so vs2008 put in a fix to prevent you from modifying it since your modifications will have no effect

389039
inherited	subclassing
the joined subclassing mapping in particular i think you will find helpful assuming wibbleextended inherited from wibble

389050
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i know that microsoft isn t developing it any further and that firefox safari opera and camino all run on mac and from my stats they are most used in that order .

389062
swt	swing
i find that i get things done faster than i did in swing or swt too

389088
lisp	scheme
if you have a chance i would recommand getting a copy of lisp scheme and doing some projects in it

389089
width	height
unless i m misunderstanding you want the page to simply be constant no matter what happens with the browser height width

389098
bids	ssis
codeplex project bids helper helps a lot when editing ssis package

389157
rss	feed
i have a data view web part in sharepoint that is being fed from an rss feed

389157
rss	feed
i have the data source configured properly to read the rss feed and i have added several runtime parameters

389175
debian	linux
debian linux 2.6 webserver

389191
put	get
then select it from your new database this at least ensures you can get back what you put in

389216
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	queue
i ve never needed to use a red-black tree skip-lists double-ended queue circularly linked list priority queue heaps graphs or any of the dozens of exotic data structures that have been researched in the past 50 years

389251
cos	sin
or since a 90â sin a 1 and sin b sin 90â - x cos x

389318
.nettiers	codesmith
codesmith + .nettiers

389321
centos	linux
redhat enterprise linux and centos include ksh93 as the ksh rpm package

389341
mouse	keyboard
i ve tried the keyboardnavigation.directionalnavigation cycle but that doesnt seem to do anything for me and i was grasping at straws since this has nothing to do with the keyboard it s all mouse based

389342
width	height
now i want to know its new height and width on the screen so i can draw accurately on the new scaled image

389352
pthreads	fork	execvp	fork
speaking of platform-dependent recipes on windows use createprocess on pthreads linux mac use fork + execvp

389389
mouseup	mousedown
there are mousedown and mouseup events that you can handle to get a similar effect

389389
keydown	keyup
you ll have to do that with a keydown and keyup event

389389
mouseup	mousedown
also be aware that a mousedown event may not ever be followed by a mouseup event if the user moves the mouse after pressing down to a point where it is no longer over the button

389389
mouseup	mousedown
you can capture the mouse in mousedown to guarantee you get the mouseup event i think

389390
inherited	properties
inherited is done via delegation if an object doesn t have a method or properties it is looked up on its prototype s the object it was cloned from then the prototype s prototypes and so on

389397
mouseup	mousedown
there are mousedown and mouseup attached events available

389409
google-chrome	firefox
if you look in the firefox application directory wherever you installed it on your system you ll see a google-chrome directory with a bunch of .jar files

389424
gridview	rowdatabound
i typically bind this data using the rowdatabound event with the gridview

389438
onmousedown	onmouseup
that didn t work so then i thought maybe it s actually the onmouseup or onmousedown events that trigger the anchor tag so i added a clickswallow method to onmouseup and onmousedown methods

389451
google-chrome	firefox
if a user leaves their browser window open to this page for about 45-60 minutes then attempting to navigate elsewhere will cause ie v7 for sure v6 as well i believe firefox or google-chrome do not have this issue to display the following popup

389451
profiling	debugging
i ve seen that in a similar question someone suggested using ibm page profiling to debugging this issue

389456
post	get
results of sniffing the http traffic on get someform.asp response there s a valid per-session set-cookie header but on post process.asp request there is no cookie header at all

389457
inherited	properties
in addition to triptych s answer hoozit instances will also inherited all instance properties of gizmo not only the ones defined in the prototype

389475
client-side	server-side
you re trying to mix server-side code with client-side code

389475
client-side	server-side
or - if your aim is to raise custom events server-side rather than client-side and handle them in javascript render out calls to the functions

389497
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
you can also sublcass uiscrollviewcontroller and override the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods

389574
gridview	objectdatasource
make sure that you master the gridview and the objectdatasource objects used to fill them

389574
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
if you don t use a business layer then you ll use sqldatasource or linqdatasource objects to access your data directly from the ui

389582
queue	fifo
i ve been searching for information for a common kernel implementation of queue that is fifo data structures

389705
public	protected
rearrange code so private protected and public methods and grouped

389732
queue	fifo
you seem to confusing an abstraction a fifo queue with an implementation a linked list

389744
for-loop	loops
a continue statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost while or do loops and from the update expression of the innermost for-loop

389774
gridview	rowdatabound
then in the rowdatabound event for the gridview you can programmatically call out and get the appropriate lookup information and display that in the column specified

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
.net provides two classes sorteddictionary and sortedlist and both are implemented using a binary tree

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

389824
innodb	myisam
you asked in a comment about whether to use myisam or innodb

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

389866
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
what about other browsers like opera or firefox or google-chrome on windows

389931
chown	chgrp
install user_directory vendor gems hpricot-0.6.164 lib universal-java1.6 hpricot_scan.so chown chgrp operation not permitted

389959
width	height
if i remove the height and width in the controls xaml file i lose the ability to use the designer for my user control

390012
width	height
if i set the grid width and height to auto then everything works fine but i lose the ability to use the designer

390079
width	margin
width 20em and the content divs just have a fixed left margin of 21em or 22em for example

390080
translation	localization
then use a localization resource that you pass in a textual key and the language translation is resolved based on the site s localization pattern

390105
firefox	safari
it works like a charm on safari and firefox except for it s position when dropping down

390111
solaris	irix	irix	linux
systems such as linux solaris irix

390111
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonfly

390111
playstation	wii
playstation 3 wii and gp2x consoles

390127
udp	tcp
i guess the simplest solution would be to just open a tcp stream send a few packets back and forth to determine their running time or even use udp for that then use the results as the guide for my max latency value then simply fire the audio data in its raw form uncompressed 16 bit stereo along with a timing code over the tcp connection

390150
kerberos	ldap
i know that ad uses kerberos but not sure if java s ldap methods do

390153
button	checkbox
the user control will display the question answer appropriately meaning render the answers as a list of checkbox for multiple choice answer or radio button for 1 answer only

390163
free	malloc
for example in a single threaded support library for malloc and free it would not have mutex protection for the heap as an optimization

390169
kerberos	ldap
in that case you could just do plain kerberos and not bother with ldap

390260
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code that netadictos posted seems to work fine in ie7 firefox 3.0.5 safari 3.2.1 and google-chrome but it doesn t work in opera v9.63

390320
serializable	deserialization
for exact serializable and deserialization of exceptions you would have to use a binaryformatter which would work as long as your own exceptions are marked

390334
awt	swing
create a awt or swing frame with a stop button

390387
width	height
now i lack context why do you resize images this way instead of using width and height attributes among other questions so maybe i am missing the point

390450
disk	ram
1 - hibernation mode with ram contents written to disk system totally shut down while â œsleeping â and slower wake up due to reading the contents of ram off the hard drive

390450
disk	ram
ram is powered on while sleeping but ram contents are also written to disk before sleeping

390452
serializable	deserialization
aside from generally using a serializable mechanism that s at least somewhat tolerant of change as dacracot describes i try to set it up so that i can do some per-class tuning of the deserialization process

390496
goto	break
the break smacks more of a goto of sorts

390523
goto	break
the argument i have against using a break to get out of an endless loop is that you re essentially using the break statement as a goto

390554
versioning	upgrade
for more information about upgrade support see the versioning and edition upgrade and hardware and software requirements topics in sql server 2005 setup help or sql server 2005 books online

390554
versioning	upgrade
for more information about edition upgrade see the versioning and edition upgrade topic in sql server 2005 setup help or sql server 2005 books online

390566
goto	break
with no exits break continue or goto in the body that form is preferred because someone can read the code and understand the termination condition just by looking at the header

390566
goto	break
loops with continue are usually harder to understand than loops with break . if you want some evidence or authority to cite look no further than don knuth s famous paper on structured programming with goto statements

390585
free	malloc
remember that c doesn t need the size for free and operator new can just use malloc

390602
pop-up	dialog
for example if i were to mouse-select the file menu to open a file the os-specific gui style file-open dialog pop-up waiting for my input

390630
apache	nginx
for instance we deploy our perl catalyst app on the apache server instances but we serve static content from the nginx front-end servers

390649
put	get
while i realize that i could never possibly get to those limits especially with the cpu usage limits put in place it s nice to be about to have a bunch of pictures up on my website without worrying about running out of space

390649
postgresql	mysql
if the pricing is due to licensing costs why don t you see more host with windows and .net but with alternative databases such as postgresql or mysql available to keep the pricing to a minimum which providing basically the same functionality

390667
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using firefox try ie or google-chrome to check if that s the case

390694
post	get
you can post to modify a resource get a response

390694
put	get	post	put	post	get
then use get post put delete to interact with that instance

390717
post	get
post or get

390717
post	get
if cookies are not enabled it could be passed in a get or post although it s often better not to go there see session.use_trans_sid s note

390730
int	chars
an order could have say 100 products each product having either only a small int or 5000 chars or free text or anything in between unique only to that order

390733
httphandler	httpmodule
and second if you have for instance a web site inside the default web site you will have both web.config but the more specific will override some of the attributes of the web.config from the default web site but the ones that are not override will be there ie httphandler httpmodule the site will try to load those so you will need to add the remove tag inside the httpmodule to remove them

390740
activemq	rabbitmq
i ve been looking at xmpp activemq rabbitmq mule esb etc

390756
goto	break
they are a form of goto along with break continue if switch case while for yield and some other statements and the equivalents in most modern programming languages

390783
post	get
by default these get actions just bundle up the model and route to a corresponding view html file in the view modelname directory note that there are also create update and destroy actions that handle a post and route back to index or show

390890
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
the main idea is to have some basics within a specific realm pinned down not unlike how in elementary school an arabic number system in base 10 with the operations of add subtract multiplying and divide and place value like tens hundreds etc

390982
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
so if you re building a heterogeneous distributed application involving messaging code running on windows unix aix solaris linux or mac os x then tibco ems is the ticket

391024
goto	break
it s not so much the while true part that s bad but the fact that you have to break or goto out of it that is the problem

391024
goto	break
break and goto are not really acceptable methods of flow control

391066
hash	md5
other hash are still unbroken but we have to keep in mind that ressearchers concentrate their efforts on mainstream algorithm that is md5 and sha1 so unbroken hash may be unsecure aswell

391076
versioning	upgrade
however depending on the library you use and its versioning it s quite possible that later on after some upgrade you will be receiving decimal.decimal s and not two-integer tuples anymore

391096
hash	whirlpool
i use the whirlpool hash

391211
rss	feed
rss feed which emit rss-formated xml

well i ve been using c++ for over 10 years now so my answer would be learning strict memory management c++ templates stl then boost

391414
firefox	safari
do you see the same problems in safari and firefox

391544
portrait	landscape
i ended up creating two images- one for landscape and other for the portrait mode

391575
accessor	properties
an abstract properties declaration specifies that the accessor of the properties are virtual but does not provide an actual implementation of the accessor

391589
mouse	keyboard
you need to trick emacs into thinking that the keyboard was not being used which is not as intuitive as tricking it into thinking that the mouse was used

391592
min	max
sounds like min max animations

391648
free	malloc
raii this lets you have automatic memory management you no longer have to remember to free everything you malloc

391648
boost	stl
stl boost this is the c++ class library full of useful utilities and bits

391661
httphandler	httpmodule
after some research on the internet i found that i needed to create either an httpmodule or httphandler to do the routing and then setup a wildcard mapping to the .net v1.1 of aspnet_isapi.dll in iis removing the verify the file exist checkbox

391708
profiler	visualvm
when i am connecting the remote host from visualvm interface running in local machine its getting connected but the profiler tab and threads tab are missing from the interface

391773
webkit	gecko
it supported by at least webkit and gecko

391773
width	height
in webkit the size is limited to the width and height set

391839
put	get
if the reference actually doesn t change then in practice you ll get away with it here the internal synchronization of concurrenthashmap -- and indeed the java.util.concurrentlibrary in general -- guarantees that objects put into the map are safely published to other threads

391982
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you re targeting browsers that support webrtc currently firefox google-chrome and opera

392016
solaris	bsd
oh and all of this has to work on windows linux bsd os x solaris and most other common platforms

392115
int	boolean
edit you can also install the spl type handling extension which gives you wrapper types for strings int floats boolean and enums

392130
accessor	properties
to determine whether a properties is static you must obtain the methodinfo for the get or set accessor by calling the getgetmethod or the getsetmethod method and examine its isstatic properties

392213
profiler	yourkit
otherwise i ve had very good experience with yourkit profiler

392225
mate	puremvc	cairngorm	mate	cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
if you re going to be doing a flex ria app of any degree of sophistication then you ll probably be implementing the mvc pattern - ala cairngorm mate or puremvc

392243
width	height
you might consider using something like jquery to loop through all of your desired objects - outputting the name of the object like the div s id and the height and width of that item

392243
width	height
so for what it s worth i d look at jquery if i was in your position and the height and width methods

392313
pop-up	dialog
as an alternative you could pop-up the diagnostic in a dialog box

392333
multiplying	add
multiplying by a prime and add

392412

why not search for things like width d+ px and height d+ px

392428
post	get
when i m in a hurry to do something real quick and dirty i just do a httpservice send call where i ve composed an http post the data is not visible in the url as it is with a get

392437
inherited	properties
it has classes and interfaces inherited access protection keywords for class members constructors statics plus some nice things that java doesn t have properties events declarative data-binding and closures

392453
width	height
the bitmap int width int height int stride pixelformat format intptr scan0 constructor for the bitmap class might be helpful

392473
folder	directory
instead of creating folder in visual studio i create a directory structure for my project on the file system

392473

392512
wordpress	joomla
modern web applications like wordpress movable type joomla etc. will let you name your tables with a custom prefix

392528
rss	feed
i did some research involving a fair number of rss feed a few months ago and the most common schema we encountered interleaved in the rss tags was dublin core which ali a mentioned

392528
rss	feed
we were most interested in the well-formed web tags for comment rss feed but the dublin core stuff is probably what you re looking for

392529
disk	ram
but then warning gratuitous manhood waving ahead my main dev box has a quad core xeon 3ghz with 12gb ram and a pair of 15k sas disk

392556
uipagecontrol	uitableview
to achieve what you are trying to do the best approach would be to use uitableview with uipagecontrol as explained in the pagecontrol sample

392561
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
to me as well as opera and google-chrome they look like ordinary script tags however to firefox and ie they dont recognize them and will not run the scripts

392586
directx	gdi
opengl allegro windows gdi and directx api support

392599
cpu	processors
the trace cache of the intel processors was conceived to store such ops to optimize the superscalar performance of the processors as the cpu executes uops not the architectural instruction-set available for execution by programs

392620
cvs	svn
using tortoisesvn 1.5.x and tortoisecvs from the testpilot site will give you all the overlays for both svn and cvs working copies

392627
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it shorter development cycles than compiled-language like c and c++ but is higher performance arguable but i ve always been anti-java p than interpreted-language like python and perl and you don t have to work with unofficial implementations like mono that may from time to time not support all of a language s features

392632
vmware	virtualbox
my work vm is currently running inside virtualbox but i have used vmware in the past

392646
gif	png
a png is almost always smaller than the equivalent gif and will not lose quality like a jpeg file

392696
textile	bbcode
it supports html textile wiki syntax markdown bbcode

392718
ant	maven
the build process can very well be managed by maven or any other ant nant tool you want

392724
shadowing	named
i think the main difference is that with shadowing you re essentially reusing the named and just ignoring the superclass use

392777
wav	riff
unfortunately windows mobile lacks a suitable splitter to decode plain .mp3 files but there is a workaround you can add a riff header to your mp3s producing mpeg-compressed wav files

392778
superclass	subclassing
a virtual method is shown to be overridden by a subclassing and calls to that method even on the superclass type or from inside code of the superclass will call the replacement implementation from the subclassing

392778
superclass	subclassing
in this case when the method is called on the superclass type the original implementation is used the new implementation is only available on the subclassing

392795
int	chars
this may cause surprises when slicing strings yields 97 an int representing the ascii code of the first chars in the string

392906
hex	binary
where 308191300b06092a864886f70d01010d03818100 is prefix made from that asn expression up to bit string field including size of bit string pack h converts binary data to hex representation and unpack h converts string in hex back to binary

392911
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
i have ported a few such engines written in c++ and c# for hosts operating on linux freebsd and also solaris on an old ultrasparc iii - yes mono still runs there

392985
atof	strtod
after looking up atof and strtod i should rephrase my statement to there shouldn t be instead of there is not .

392988
atof	strtod
atof and strtod do what you want but are very forgiving

393021
int	double
there is also the question of whether you d want the matrix to hold int double or other numerical values that may play a role in some matrix functions

393056
zlib	libpng
you can find a matrix class in the lydos.matlab library documentation which is distributed as open source project under the zlib libpng license

393062
cpu	processors
assume that each guess takes one cpu cycle and given the fastest processors calculate how long it would take to break a password given a certain number of permutations

i see lot of example opening pop-up with jquery but don t see anything that will let me open new page in pop-up modal dialog box

393186
ncover	testdriven.net
you may need team system to get baked in coverage analysis for vs but there is always ncover comes with testdriven.net

393188
mbunit	nunit
other alternatives are xunit.net nunit and mbunit

393188
mbunit	nunit
again i can t really compare them due to lack of experience with nunit and mbunit but i believe that all three are quite stable and usable

393254
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
if i however i swap hide for fadeout and show for fadein then a is still fading out while b is still fading in and it looks pretty confusing

393258
abstract-class	superclass
considering that the abstract-class number is the superclass of classes

393310
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
it runs on various linux distributions mac os x freebsd netbsd and ms windows

393329
interpolation	splines
most simply that would give you a polygon but interpolation splines should probably also give you nice results

393362
perl	tcl
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

393403
gentoo	linux
actually i have photoshop cs3 working under wine on gentoo linux

393407
post	get
surely it can be designed in binary way just like tcp protocol using flags to represents different kinds of method post get and variables http headers

393419
jdom	jibx
other alternatives could be castor jibx xmlbeans or jdom

393481
mp3	aiff	mp3	ogg	aiff	ogg

393554
put	get
if i put this line of code inside each thread i get an operationalerror telling me that the database file is locked

393554
put	get
if i put this line of code in the main program and pass the connection object conn to each thread i get a programmingerror saying that sqlite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread

393563
bash	zsh
don t forget zsh as an option - your bash knowledge is relevant plus it has got some neat scripting and command-line features

393710
opera	google-chrome
then for the odd site that you have to have flash for use an alternative browser such as opera or google-chrome for which let flash be installed

393719
folder	directory
if you do not normally have the rights to write something into the c program files-folder vista will silently redirect those writes into a secret folder inside your user directory

393725
umbraco	dotnetnuke
edit i have looked at dotnetnuke umbraco my web pages starter kit graffti cms sitefinity.net but as far as i can tell these can t be easily retro fitted

393726
wmd-editor	fckeditor
if you want just a simple wysiwyg editor try using fckeditor .net integration or wmd-editor the one stack overflow uses

393763
post	get
parse the web page that contains the form find out the form submit address and the submit method post or get

393775
lambda	first-class-functions
well it has first-class-functions style primitives with delegates and has gained better syntactic support for the style with anonymous delegates and lambda

393824
pull	push
alternately is there a way i can have git detect whether or not to pull from push to a particular host based on ip address

393860
width	height
removing the height and width is the way to go

393860
width	height
the designer blend has some special designer width and height properties that they can use to design in but won t set the height for runtime

393878
width	height
i m not aware of any width height attributes for the vs designer if that s what you re using

393880
cfstring	nsstring
generally an nsstring constructor does return an object that is actually of type nscfstring which is a thin wrapper around the core foundation cfstring struct

393889
actionscript	mxml
mxml is great for doing declarative layouts much easier to follow than doing everything programmatically in actionscript

393904
put	get	post	put	post	get
you might want to get rid of the extra space after the closing parenthesis this may just be a typo in your post though put in a semi-colon and return false so that it doesn t attempt to follow the link

393914
put	get
you can also name it ls as long as you put bin first in your path and use the full path to bin ls in your script so that you don t get recursive interpretation

393941
min	max
my idea is based on using min and max

393941
min	max
min 0 and max 0

393941
min	max
min 0 and max 0

393941
min	max
min 0 and max 0

393984
informix	firebird	postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
sqlalchemy includes dialects for sqlite postgresql mysql oracle ms-sql firebird maxdb ms access sybase and informix

393989
stdout	stderr
don t try to encode too much meaning into the exit value detailed statuses and error reports should go to stdout stderr as arkadiy suggests

393989
stdout	stderr
any detailed diagnostic information should go to logs or to stdout stderr

394009
nsstring	nsdata
if you want to load the contents of the file into memory many of the cocoa data classes such as nsstring nsdata and even nsdictionary have initwithurl methods which initialize directly with the contents of a web request

394036
folder	directory
i also need the .bat file to execute silently unless a user interaction is required - this script copies 11k+ files to folder on a networked machine and occasionally windows forgets if the destination is a file or directory and asks for the user to tell it what it is this is a whole other issue not for discussion here...needless to say i am annoyed by it

394109
postgresql	mysql
for added bonus if when you realise decide that using sqlite for any concurrent application is going to be a disaster you won t have to change your code to use mysql or postgresql or anything else

394122
int	boolean
the only field types i m using in this dataset are int strings boolean and a few tarrayfields that hold arrays of int fields

394146
inherited	subclassing
one situation that often comes up is that i have a list of objects that inherited from one class and need to be displayed in a list but each subclassing has a slightly different way of being displayed

394168
floating-point	integer
every time the parameter is a whole number integer or float it would work fine whole ints are passed back except when there is a floating-point remainder

394168
floating-point	integer
if you wonder why it breaks note that sum is an integer and a floating-point remainder could be passed back

394245
versioning	upgrade
unless the upgrade looks bad according to the above criteria it s better to go with it and if you have any problems revert to the old versioning

394253
free	malloc
pointers are the most difficult feature of the language to learn especially when you get into malloc and free

394260
inherited	subclassing
what i mean is subclassing can be described as has-a and inherited could be is-a

394282
inherited	subclassing
my understanding is that subclassing is the same as inherited so these are both is-a

394284
for-loop	loops
best way for ascii string traversing in for-loop is to check for null char in loops it self

394344
versioning	upgrade
while you don t want to upgrade just because there s a new versioning there s another consideration which is availability of the old versioning

394346
min	max
rectangle min long -90deg max long +90deg min lat +70deg max lat +80deg

394350
versioning	upgrade
i usually assume that ignoring a new versioning of a library coz it doesn t have any interesting features or improvements is a mistake because one day you ll find out that this versioning is necessary for the migration to the next versioning which you might want to upgrade to

394350
versioning	upgrade
if a lot of testing are required it is best to upgrade to the newer library at the next release major versioning of your software like when moving from v8.0 to v8.5

394376
postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to use activerecord an orm may be a bit complicated for your usage right now you can still use the ruby-mysql library or even better imho is to use the ruby dbi dbd library here which has dbd drivers for mysql postgresql out-of-the-box

394465
post	get
i m using apache + mod_wsgi to host my python application and i d like to get the post content submitted in one of the forms -however neither the environment values nor sys.stdin contains any of this data

394491
pop-up	dialog
what would be nice is if i could use the jquery dialog to pop-up a message asking if the user is sure he wants to cancel the booking

394512
cos	inverse
note that the tj x and tk x in the wolfram article i linked to used the cos and inverse cosine these are polynomials and in practice you use a recurrence formula to get the coefficients

394512
cos	sin
but the real world applications for having to write your own sin or cos functions are rare enough that you d be best off using an efficient implementation to reach a desired accuracy -- which the taylor series is not

394540
folder	dir
however i guess i could just label my root parent dir with a tag like projectnameissourcesafecheckedin and for every folder and only the parent folder i will drill in and count the lines in classes

394563
post	get
this will get passed to the tempjumptoajax.aspx page as post variable called searchtext

394580
post	get
however i recommend that you make this a post instead of a get since a cancel action has side effects and thus doesn t comply with get semantics .

394595
ienumerable	iqueryable
this little awesome project is a backport of linq ienumerable but without iqueryable and its dependencies func action etc to .net 2.0

394653
mouse	keyboard
copilot helps you fix someone s computer problems by letting you connect to their computer see what they see and control their mouse and keyboard to help fix the issue

394673
hash	salt
server checks protocol and then checks sha1 of password + salt usually against existing hash in db

394708
pascal	delphi
delphi or pascal there s nothing delphi-specific here

394710
smallcheck	quickcheck
moreover haskell has more tools for getting complicated code right things like quickcheck smallcheck and the static type system

394711
inline	inlining
a lot of c compilers that implement inline assembly language and a pragma to do inlining of entire functions have for many many years taken advantage of this in their library functions

394723
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning of f# 1.9.6.2 also known as the september ctp

394725
cvs	svn
4 svn knows how to keep deltas for binary files unlike older systems like cvs so keeping everything on your project under svn is worth doing

394763
put	get
and if i just put smallerarray.extractpiece in largerarray.extractarray i still get problems

394774
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction of a integer to a pointer means move the pointer forward backward by n elements

394802
int	chars
printf d d d sizeof chars sizeof int sizeof float

394819
int	chars
the point is sql doesn t force you to use int pseudokeys so use chars and varchar keys where appropriate

394853
ingres	oracle
i ve noticed ingres and oracle developers tend to use the first style whereas microsoft sql server users have tended to use the second but that might just be a coincidence

394906
keydown	keyup
back in the dos-days the same scancodes have been used for games because it has been the only way to detect keyup and keydown events

394940
folder	directory
the sample app has two folder in its root directory lib src

394942
jquery	simplemodal
i am using simplemodal in jquery and i have one confirm dialog

394947
redland	jena	jena	rdflib	rdflib	redland
i ve played with jena sesame boca rdflib redland and one or two others some time ago but each had its problems

394953
pull	push
the view needs your model to create the ui pull from model and to receive updates from it push by model

394966
pop-up	dialog
if you need further interaction based on the results of your initial dialog then i would consider either adding another modal dialog that you pop-up after the current one is closed with your ajax results or insert the ajax results into your main interface and deal with it there

395065
udp	tcp
but my programming question was whether there is a way to send tcp udp packages via php so i can knock via a webclient

395116
width	height
based on the proportions of the chosen font group the input image into rectangular pixel blocks with constant width and height a rectangle 4 pixels wide and 5 pixels high

395120
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works in firefox tested in 3 opera tested in 9.6 and google-chrome tested in 1 but not in msie7 haven t tested in msie8

395150
sorting	filtering
if so then what you call implicit paging will probably be necessary as sorting and filtering over a partially obscured result set is counter-intuitive

395171
octal	decimal
forces it to be parsed as a decimal number otherwise strings beginning with 0 might be parsed as an octal number might depend on the browser used

395172
free	malloc
when managing heap-allocated memory acquired from malloc or new it is usually the responsibility of the programmer to free or delete that memory before the pointer is destroyed

395175
post	get
if you ask this question on comp.lang.javascript you ll get lots of different answers many of which disdain the commonly-used libraries one quote sometimes taken slightly out of context is richard cornford s post on c.l.js in 2007 prototype.js was written by people who don t know javascript for people

395243
rss	feed
i need code in perl for requesting and parsing atom and rss feed

395254
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
and replace timestamp w the current time in msec since 1970 counter a counter that you increment once per download hash md5 hash of concatenate timestamp counter secret salt where secret salt any favorite code you keep secret

395286
client-side	server-side
client-side validation to augment the server-side validation which i would of course retain

395312
hide	show
the usercontrol would pass through most of the properties and events but in response to the .readonly property it would hide the combobox control and show a readonly edit box instead

395317
junit	mockito
i am using junit 4.1 and in the same test i am using mockito

395339
rss	feed
to parse the documents try something with feed rss or atom in the name

395343
many-to-many	many-to-one
edit fixed to be many-to-many instead of many-to-one

395346
width	height
you could assign a width height to the response division - that should help with it drastically changing size when the content is load

395358
opml	xml
the xml in the example is an opml file

395375
firefox	safari
firefox and safari for os x windows by the way

395445
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
gnome kde fluxbox icewm xfce etc

395509
ubuntu	linux
i m very familiar with how to setup the environment on ubuntu linux and the only part i m getting stuck on with os x is how to install mysql autostart it and install the python mysql bindings

395557
pascal	delphi
i know someone who has a one-man company developing applications in delphi and pascal

395577
width	margin
if is a block element set left and right margin to auto and remember to set a width block elements default to take all available horizontal space unless a width is stated explicitly

395649
opera	safari
it is then you know how to write the most compatible style possible in the first place thus saving all the time in degugging and rarely have any problems with any of the major modern browsers ie6 ie7 ff2 ff3 opera 9 safari 3 win mac

395649
opera	safari
other than that ff2 ff3 opera 9 safari win mac ie7 ie8 are relatively similar in the rendering engine at least with much less bugs than it has with ie6

395650
hash	md5
now this can sorta be done with get parameters like an md5 hash token but i m interested in url mapping as a general solution to many problems

395653
post	get
if you get a chance please up vote ima s post

395668
lz77	lzw
if you cannot predict which headers will be used you may need to use lzw or lz77 or another method which looks at the data which has already gone through to find the data it can express in an especially compact form

395669
post	put
i put a step-by-step guide in a blog post that might help installing django with mysql on mac os x

395679
jlabel	jtextpane
i m assuming you re rendering text to an arbitrary component via paintcomponent rather than trying to modify the color of text in a jtextpane jlabel or other pre-existing widget

395688
post	get
you d usually have a single file that would include the header footer and based on some incoming get or post params you d also include some other pages that would generate or display the content

395688
codeigniter	cakephp
two of them codeigniter and cakephp are as frameworks to php as wordpress is to blogging - functional simple and effective

395702
perforce	svn
we have a fairly large svn repository which we are looking to migrate to perforce

395762
perforce	svn
from a usability perspective perforce is much worse than svn

395783
bluecloth	rdiscount
i am using maruku for the markdown processing redcloth is very biased towards textile bluecloth is extremely buggy and i wanted a native-ruby parser which ruled out peg-markdown and rdiscount

395824
trac	bugzilla
trac bugzilla and fogbugz

395860
int	chars
also you are not limited to the using enum byte int short and chars expressions as the trigger for branching

395883
children	parent
if the parent is killed children become children of the init process that has the process id 1 and is launched as the first user process by the kernel

395892
post	get
the reason i ask is i am very confused after sifting through different articles and post expressing a different method and eventually hitting a 650 page document on wcf security best practices i am just uncertain which approach is the best to take and how to get started on implementation given my scenario

395921
subnet	packets
if there are no requirements on what the packets should contain if any arp packets will do then you can obviously send an arp request if you re on an ethernet network simply by trying to send something to any ip on your own subnet ensuring beforehand that the destination ip is not in the arp cache by running an external arp -d tar.get.ip.address command but this will probably not be what you want

395970
pylons	cherrypy
there are several products in php which fill the same space as cherrypy or pylons

395972
pylons	cherrypy
personally i would not describe either pylons or cherrypy as an application server if you want a python application server try zope

395982
metaclass	subclassing
what is the flow of class instantiation subclassing metaclass super type and method invocation

396021
entity-relationship	diagram
this is the partial entity-relationship diagram for identity module in turbogears python

396030
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
i was about to make the same remark as wouter use png modern format which is highly compressed as opposed to bmp lossless as opposed to jpeg and full color and with several level of transparency as opposed to gif

396046
hex	binary
with some experimentation with a very large dictionary i found no word that exceeded a frequency count of 9 for any letter so the signature can be represented as a string of numbers 0..9 the size could be easily halved by packing into bytes as hex and further reduced by binary encoding the number but i didn t bother with any of this so far

396083
versioning	upgrade
however when i install any versioning of sql server 2005 it fails for all the important things like the database engine with the message that i should upgrade my windows installer to a newer versioning

396114
toupper	uppercase	tolower	uppercase	tolower	toupper
it is actually better to convert the string to uppercase toupper as that has been apparently there are further optimizations that the just-in-time compiler can do as when compared to the tolower

396135
switching	screens
older versions of windows had a splash screens for the mmc control panel and the s switching would supress it

396151
int	double
when foldl is used the sum is immediately calculated so applying sum to an infinite list will just run forever and most likely in constant space if youâ re using things like int s double s float s

396165
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
when i tested firefox ie and google-chrome was trying to download the file and asked the user where to store it opera displayed the file

396171
firefox	safari
when logged in try to click one of rows avboka link this is where a dialog is shown in firefox and safari

396184
superclass	subclassing
if you need to access a subclassing from a superclass then there s a good chance that your model is broken it should be one class

396192
superclass	subclassing
it allows a subclassing to defer to it s superclass

396192
superclass	subclassing	super	extends
however in all subclassing situations you ll make use of super to extends a superclass

396243
folder	directory
user settings are stored in an obfuscated directory deep within the user document settings folder

396255
width	height
the div containing the content must have a width and height

396290
tostring	string.format
for reference if you want to do more advanced formatting you d want to use string.format instead of tostring

396346
postgresql	mysql
if you have fast and slow response timed data storage on the frontend server going with a lightweight database storage like mysql or postgresql maybe not that lightweight

396397
opera	safari
for standards-compliant browsers like mozilla opera safari etc

396439
button	checkbox
not only that they mostly relied silently on an estimated height of the radio button checkbox but they also behaved differently in different browsers

396495
vim	emacs
out of all the features in use in modern text editors initial research seems to indicate that this is one feature that both emacs and vim do not actually support

396502
opera	firefox
the following works in firefox and opera sorry i do not have access to other browsers at the moment

396517
vim	emacs
i don t think this feature has a direct analogue in either emacs or vim which is not to say that everything achievable with this feature is not possible in some fashion with the two old-school editors

396517
vim	emacs
and like most things emacs and vim power-users would probably be able to achieve such a task exceedingly quickly even if mere mortals like myself could spend five minutes figuring out the correct grep search and replace with appropriate back-references for example

396569
swt	swing
because i m not very fond of writing webapps i plan to build a gui swing or swt that would only manage pojos do some reporting and invoke methods from the container

396601
ienumerable	ilist
i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

396601
ienumerable	ilist
note that ienumerable does not have count or length property except as an extension method while array and ilist do

396685
getter	setter
somewhat similar to what you ve described for testing the presence of a default constructor i ve used testutil to automatically test getter and setter

396688
jobs	cron
use craken rake centric cron jobs

396717
put	get
i put forth the effort because coding in python is much more enjoyable to me than php and after you get the apache config right once you never really have to mess with it again

396723
put	get
then on my controller i just had to get the parameters and put them in the this- data so my function would continue as usual

396755
wordpress	vbulletin
and after that it s a matter of looking in the footer for tip-offs such as powered by wordpress or vbulletin etc

396764
ienumerable	icollection
i would also return a read-only icollection or ienumerable unless you ve got some specific reason not to.

396773
packets	multicast
one caveat for multicast packets however is if there are any wifi connections the access point will use the slowest possible bit rate for the multicast packets and requires acks from all clients even those who are not part of the multicast group

396782
button	checkbox
yet people who argue that the user s don t read anything will often suggest putting bits of long dry explanatory text to help users who are confused by some random poor design decision like using checkbox for something that should be radio button because you can only select one

396815
put	get	post	put	post	get
if the last option i guess you d have to have some sort of login method or something on the service something that would send an okay you re logged if you pass in this hash value with future requests. but not all rest clients will be expecting to receive cookies just simple get put post delete requests without any state

396830
cvs	svn
i would like to move them to a versioning system cvs svn or any other tool but the catch is i am not their senior so i need a carrot for them to start using this

396838
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

396848
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a for each loop that goes through each control on my msacess form ensures they are either a text box dropdownlistfor or checkbox and determines if the field has been changed

396851
width	height
it is cross-browser and will give you height width and x y offsets among others

396877
google-chrome	firefox
while i m an avid user of firefox or google-chrome and sympathize with the underlying sentiment i think you should be careful about how you describe the problem

396877
google-chrome	firefox
the rest of the time i use firefox - or google-chrome at so.

396899
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
download firefox. messages wether i be using ie8 partner build firefox 3.1 beta 2 or another browser like opera safari

396947
post	get
also the filters are sent down by ajax and it gets hard to debug when you have lots of filters get is limited in size so i use post

396980
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
start with an entity-relationship diagram between entities

pong	minesweeper
if you re interested in game design then you could try cloning pong easy or minesweeper harder

397184
width	height
jcarousel needs you to specify a fixed width for the content all their examples are based upon images that have fixed height and width

397196
versioning	upgrade
all is well right up until somebody installs on the same machine .net3.0sp1 and along with it msvcrt80 versioning 1433 is installed and a policy to automatically upgrade

397210
vsto	add-in
i am trying to use the findcontrol method of the commandbars object in a vsto word add-in to get what else a command bar object

397292
internationalization	localization
if anybody know how to do the internationalization and localization in wpf through only xaml

397333

mvp	presenter
one way is to use model view presenter mvp patterns for winforms app

397427
equals	gethashcode
unfortunately since this has 2 methods gethashcode and equals there is no direct delegate version of this except perhaps or

397443
lisp	scheme
it s good in game ais because of its nice list manipulations at least in lisp and scheme and for mathematical computations because of its syntax

397443
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
scheme lisp and haskell have a syntax that makes mathematical computations easy to read

397522
post	get
have a look at a blog post i wrote if you want to get some more info on what to look out for -

397589
hide	show
show hide text in textbox

397615
sudo	passwd
when ubuntu prompts you for your passwd to do privileged operations that s sudo under the hood

397636
verilog	vhdl
the free model foundry has a large number of models some in vhdl others in verilog that are available now

397796
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox and microsoft and opera and google-chrome would all use different methods my guess is they arrays not associative arrays use something like stl s std vector

397801
punctuation	words
instead of matching foreign language characters there are so many of them in many different ascii ranges you might be better off looking for the characters that delineate your words - spaces quotation marks and other punctuation

397913
boost	stl
use stl or boost library

397933
gmail	hotmail
when you register one of them for example twitter it says why dont you invite your friends from hotmail or yahoo or gmail

397965
ant	cruisecontrol
the best thing you can use is cruisecontrol + ant + phpundercontrol + phpunit + php_codesniffer + xdebug

397973
button	checkbox
when it comes to radio checkbox and submit button it gets a little more complicated but clean semantic html can be displayed the way you want it using css

397997
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for addition subtraction multiplication shift left the logical operations equality

397999
nscolorwell	nsimageview
alternatively you may be able to get away with setting a borderless nsimageview or nscolorwell as the content view but i m not sure that apple means for those to have subviews

398106
ironruby	ironpython
about the monstrous hybrid there s no such thing it s just a very active port like ironruby or ironpython in .net land

398133
freebsd	debian
i d rather move to freebsd or debian in the future.

398135
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works with the latest versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari

398156
post	put
eventually specific business action edit lock etc. could be embedded in the uri if create post or update put alone do not serve the purpose

398192
inherited	properties
your idea of doing removefieldref and fieldref it right back in would be the same as setting the properties required and default value through the interface for the document or inherited content types though your idea would help if we are building custom content types

398221
ubuntu	debian
if you are running debian or ubuntu you will soon find out that you will not be able to live on the bleeding edge like many cpan module authors seem to do

398231
gridview	objectdatasource
i m using an objectdatasource to bind data to a gridview

398257
post	get
if i use safari 3.2.1 i see from the logs that tomcat receives a post followed immediately contemporarily by get and it fails

398257
firefox	safari
trying to debug with eclipse i see that when using safari it is the doget method that is called while when using firefox is dopost

398257
firefox	safari	post	get
practically it seems that safari fires both post and then immediately get while firefox fires only post as it should according to the html form

398285
gdal	grass
grass r gmt gdal postgis mapserver are some of the tools i use on a regular basis

398294
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian or ubuntu try installing the texlive-fonts-recommended package

398305
folder	directory
i originally thought that i could just create a virtual directory to a network share that would be the upload folder however that solution has turned into a permissions nightmare

398336
folder	directory
i use microsoft synctoy 2.0 to synchronize my project directory with a folder on a network share

398357
cvs	rcs
look into the use of rcs cvs and or subversion

398357
cvs	rcs
my understanding is that cvs is based on rcs but more comprehensive

398374
post	get
whenever i see this question i get a little nervous that the asker doesn t quite understand all the implications of causing a post back so i want to cover them briefly

398400
antivirus	norton
he recently got rid of all his norton antivirus

398429
put	get
the real world answer is that people who put their java libraries under lgpl most likely intend for them to be linked to redistributed within commercial java applications so it s extremely unlikely that you will get into any trouble if you simply redistribute those unmodified libraries with your application

398448
folder	directory
a simple dummy task might be to create a directory in the temporary folder

398476
folder	directory
in my template folder i make a directory called html and then inside that a new directory called mod___mainmenu and then a make copy the default.php file from the existing mod_mainmenu folder from the modules directory

398485
width	height
i ve run into the problem of .net controls size height and width are silently limited to a signed 16 bit integer 32 767

398549
cpu	processors
see at some point in the near future processors speed will not be able to increase using the same cpu technology

398579
lisp	scheme
so my recommendation would be to read first the little schemer then its a couple of hours and its worth it if you decide lisp or scheme or whatever dialect is not what you where looking for you will still have a very fun new way of thinking about recursion

398611
lisp	scheme
it uses scheme which is a nice and clean dialect of lisp

398676
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i ve run fiddler and windows network monitor and verified that all links on the page are it works fine on ie 7 8 safari opera and google-chrome

398678
wan	multicast
as for the topic we have not much experience with multicast over wan however my feeling is that pgm + wan + high volume of data would lead to retransmission storms

398706
bmp	png
i tried octave but for some reason it can t even load a png bmp or anything other than 1 specific format

398718
postgresql	mysql
i can say that both mysql and postgresql will work as well as any dbms in most situations

398733
postgresql	mysql
if you have a choice between postgresql and mysql i say go the postgresql route because if you get deep into stored proc and function development postgresql will give you a much more robust feature set to work from

398778
google-chrome	firefox
i have ie 7.0 firefox 3.0 and google-chrome 1.0

398811
trie	tree
and that was wikipedia s comments on the tree not trie

398818
put	get
this bug is rarely put to the test one probable reason it didn t get fixed in vista sp1

398846
int	double
2 the code return math.round n precision precision .tostring does not compile due to an ambiguity between math.round double int and math.round decimal int

398899
memset	malloc
once the pointer actually pointers to something via malloc or by assigning to it the address of a struct my_t then you can properly memset it

398900
lisp	scheme
first of all scheme and common lisp are fairly different in rather deep ways like scoping

398910
unix	aix
i vaguely remember from my unix aix and hpux i ll admit i ve never used shared memory in linux days that deletion simply marks the block as no longer attachable by new clients

398918
versioning	upgrade
what you need to do is make sure all subsequent installers upgrade properly over the previous versioning so that different folders are not required

398959
daemons	systemd
one written in c that makes the interface to the operating systemd and the other in java that provides the daemons api

398976
post	put
once you put the fear of unemployment one the table and i d tell them that you are writing up the failure to communicate for each one then require them to post plans for immediate communication improvement plus detailed timelines for fixing the mess by the end of the week

398996
ienumerable	ienumerator
however the most common meaning of this is something that implements ienumerable returning an ienumerator

399023
post	get
using httpscoop i ve seen that apparently safari fires post followed by get when it gets the response

399023
post	get
i think however that it actually fires both requests at the same time since the date+time of the two responses is the same for both post and get

399023
rss	feed
the response is a rss feed and has the http 1.1 200 ok code

399023
post	get
the second get asks for the same request url of the post but the body is 0 bytes it has of course no get parameters and the answer is wrong because of the missing parameters

399030
16-bit	64bit
in practice pointers will be size 2 on a 16-bit system if you can find one 4 on a 32-bit system and 8 on a 64bit system but there s nothing to be gained in relying on a given size

399031
installation	upgrade
advertise your msi in active directory installation and upgrade does not require administrative privileges

399039
postgresql	mysql
i have used mysql and postgresql for more than five years on and off and both are good

399039
postgresql	mysql
do note however that mysql vs postgresql is one of the holy flamewars like linux vs windows etc

399039
postgresql	mysql
of the two postgresql has for a long time been considered more robust and mysql - faster however both advantages are by now somewhat debatable

399122
int	chars
there have been machines where sizeof int will be one value probably 4 but where sizeof chars is larger

399133
cvs	svn
this seems happen with shared repos imported from svn or cvs

399151
width	height
taking a look at the exported final product the xaml produced is wrapped in a canvas whether or not i select that option in export with hard-coded left top attached properties and width height

399163
int	double
the name long double is likely just down the same tradition as the long int vs

399180
width	height
i have an application where users can upload video files of any size and i d like to be able to determine the the height width of a flash video file flv or f4v from a php script so that i can size the player appropriately

399189
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
finally with linq in c# you now get much better functionality for working with collections aggregates grouping sorting filtering etc that may have given datasets the advantage

399281
postgresql	mysql
bottom line - mysql used to be a good option but consider sql server express and postgresql as better current alternatives

399284
folder	directory
the text of the email is stored in individual files in the respective mailbox folder directory

399339
doc	rtf
i need a doc to rtf converter that will run from the command line and from within a perl script i know i ll need to use system to run the converter

399343
explode	implode
anyway he pointed to article about f# that have two functions for string manipulation explode and implode

399390
post	get
you can get one up and running very easily using post fix enabler or if you don t mind the command line use macports to install postfix

399402
width	height
since you ve got the image view set to aspect fit you can simply take the height and width of the image view along with the height and width of the original image and calculate the height and width of the scaled image

399428
put	get
try to get something put together that works even if its horribly inefficient and clunky then really spend some time looking at how things can be improved

399431
pop-up	dialog
this program creates a form window and immediately creates another non-gui thread which wants to pop-up a modal dialog window on the form s gui thread

399445
minimum	max
minimum coupling and max coherence makes it easy to cut out defective parts

399447
getter	setter
would i still need to create getter and setter methods for each attribute like so

399455
getter	setter
a similar script can readily take a sql table statement and convert it in to a java bean at least the base members that then your ide converts in to a flurry of getter setter

399511
content-disposition	content-type
not precisely but you can do it by hyperlinking to the img file and setting the content-type and content-disposition headers in the server response

399530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
theelements sample code gives a basic idea of how to use uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller but the example does not discuss passing information from child controller to parent

399530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my case i have a uitabbarcontroller one of the tab shows a uinavigationcontroller with + on the top right corner or navigation bar

399616
mouse	keyboard
for a scripting utility i need to be able to record a series of keyboard and mouse events that occur when an application has focus

399669
versioning	upgrade
i m using subversion 1.4.6 and i cannot upgrade to versioning 1.5 right now

399697
draggable	droppable
you may also want to look into jquery ui s draggable droppable and sortable plugins

399715
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for your case these would be the uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

399737
srp	principles
srp the single responsibility principles a class should have only one reason to change

399737
ocp	principles
ocp the open-closed principles software entities classes packages methods etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification

399737
lsp	principles
lsp the liskov substition principles subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

399762
width	height
the child item should fill all available space if no specific width height are set

399762
width	height
alternatively you can set the width and height of the control to stretched however i think using the grid.sharedscopesize is a more elegant way to achieving the same effect

399787
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
all other browsers work perfectly firefox safari and opera on my mac and firefox on pc

399808
debian	linux
a lot of gnu linux packagers make use of this debian rules and others

399815
ubuntu	linux
now i switched to linux ubuntu to see how it works out there and strangely the stars in the table cell are layed out perfectly while the stars on the context menu don t even show up

399850
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ will let you get away with a lot on the default level

399850
g++	gcc
i just wanted to point out that i don t use -werror but i do understand it s utility on gcc g++ because i use

399909
subtraction	addition
you can also do this without addition and subtraction

400012
ubuntu	debian
but os updates usually have little effect on the dev server stack i m using and in any case my deployment environment uses a different os i develop on osx and ubuntu and deploy on debian and solaris

400021
mouse	keyboard
a decent keyboard and mouse are essential

400021
mouse	keyboard
for the last 10 or so years i ve always taken my own mouse and keyboard to work as you typically end up with whatever comes from the pc manufacturer

400031
post	get
probably the only choice is to read it on the client side and transfer it manually to the server get post ajax

400047
xen	openvz
if using debian debootstrap is your friend coupled with qemu xen openvz lguest or a plethora of others

400134
tax	shipping
then at the solution level you have the components and the apis for dealing with user profiling identity management and personalization content authoring versioning and publishing content search product catalogs for tangible and intangible goods product search and guided navigation pricing tax calculation promotions shopping carts gift lists and wish lists payment types shipping methods order tracking customer relationship management etc

400134
pull	push
the v iew in mvc should be populated by the model - it is a push mechanism with the model updating the view not a pull mechanism with the view querying the model

400149
ilist	icollection
you would because defining an ilist or an icollection would open up for other implementations of your interfaces

400149
ilist	icollection
you might want to have an iorderrepository that defines a collection of orders in either a ilist or icollection

400149
ilist	icollection
you could then have different kinds of implementations to provide a list of orders as long as they conform to rules defined by your ilist or icollection

400188
ienumerable	iqueryable
in the standard implementation of linq the operators select and where map to methods that return an ienumerable or iqueryable

400254
post	get
later php will send back private details to flash using get post

400264
integer	unsigned
while it is relatively easy to decide which integer type to use you select smallest enough to hold the value with some added complexity for signed unsigned with floats it is not this easy

400292
post	get
whether you use flash or php you re still using html form technology specificaion to do the get post thus using flash is just as secure or insecure as using php perl cgi etc

400375
put	get
of course the best solution is to use a restful client and use a combination of nsurlconnection to get send the data and the touchxml classes to parse the data though this would require more work to put the data into a dictionary

400377
actionscript	mxml
you write apps using actionscript similar to javascript and mxml markup used primarily for layout view code

400474
ssl	https
.net should handle the creation of the ssl connection without being told what port to use when you use the https protocol

400513
post	get
just to rule out the possibility you aren t actually trying to see the fragment on a get post and actually want to know how to access that part of a uri object you have within your server-side code it is under uri.fragment msdn docs

400565
inherited	properties
my objective is to code something like the example below but this class objects must inherited the httpwebrequest properties and methods

400590
put	get
note you really need to put code in here for the case that totalvisits 0 or you will get a division by 0 answer

400591
javassist	cglib
since hibernate 3.3 the default bytecode provider is now javassist rather than cglib

400697
vmware	virtualbox
with virtualization using virtualpc vmware virtualbox etc it in theory should be possible to support vb6 applications provided you have a host os that can run vb6 correctly that you can virtualize that can run these applications

400710
int	double
inputs current date maturity date coupon payment frequency int coupon amount double

400751
vb.net	vb6
so when microsoft made vb.net incompatible with vb6 this was a big deal for many of us

400764
versioning	upgrade
however i prefer to have a versioning table that can contain multiple rows with fields for the versioning number the time the update occured and the user that performed the upgrade

400764
versioning	upgrade
if you want to be really clever you can put checks in you upgrade scripts so they won t run unless the previous versioning of the database is correct

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
this is the primary use that i ve found for entity-relationship entity-relationship diagram and the entity-relationship model in general

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
in fact entity-relationship diagram don t need foreign keys at all

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
a well built entity-relationship diagram will have very little harmful redundancy in it but that s largely serendipity and not the result of careful planning

400773
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
the entities and relationships in a stakeholder oriented entity-relationship diagram should only include entities that are understood by the subject matter experts and not include entities or relationships that are added in the course of logical database design

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
the beauty of entity-relationship models and diagram is that they can be used to talk about data not only in databases but also as the data appears in forms that users can see

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
it s possible to turn a well built entity-relationship diagram into a moderately well built relational schema by a fairly mechanical process

400773
entity-relationship	diagram
a few technical stakeholders need to understand the relational schema and not merely the entity-relationship diagram

400857
pascal	delphi
you could use 7zip lzma bindings for pascal compatible with delphi

400867
mouse	keyboard
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation

400891
width	height
it is irritating that width 100 works but height 100 does not

400891
width	height
i have tried the kb article that sets the height and width to 100 and the frame custom rules to table-layout auto but this doesn t work

400895
typedef	struct
in a typical c or c++ compiler the question of whether x is a type or not is answerable because the parser communicates such information to the lexer as soon as it processes a typedef or struct declaration

400938
g++	gcc
it has been a while since i ve used anything but gcc g++

400958
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop to loops through the data but the length needs to be know or the data needs to be terminated by a know value eg

400966
min	max
aside from paging any time you want the most or least insert metric here row from a table ordering on whatever metric and limiting to 1 row is ime better than doing a subquery using min max

400989
for-loop	loops
i inserted an alert in the for-loop and the success function and it seems like loops gets executed cities.length times then i get the success function alerts

401014
post	get
only after some hours of searching forum post and experimentation was i able to get it working but i can t say i have it figured out

401036
keyevent	onkeydown
onkeydown keyevent event

401040
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i perform a hit test on the super layer when the touchesbegan and touchesmoved methods are invoked

401042
for-loop	arrays
the index variable cityidx is updated in the closure you create as the for-loop is processed so by the time your function on success is run cityidx will point to the last element in the arrays

401045
invokerequired	begininvoke
every winforms ui element has two members to help you with this invokerequired which returns a boolean if it is being executed on any thread other than the thread the element was created on in which case you must switch threads and begininvoke which automatically switches to the correct thread

401074
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation log profiling and tune the application sps as named database interface components of your system without affecting or re-deploying the application code

401142
post	get
trying using the jquery ajax api - you can use it to send arbitrary data via get or post and you don t need to set up a hidden form or anything

401200
udp	tcp
some solutions can selectively filter traffic for instance by port number tcp or udp etc

401241
post	get
when i go to post start i get the following error

401279
vsto	add-in
vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so

401323
folder	directory
this returns each individual folder in the directory array

401331
bazaar	git
i asked specifically about subversion but i d also like to hear about how bazaar mercurial and git handle this case too.

401335
post	put
assuming you re using the default scaffolding put this line before the map.resources post line in config routes.rb

401421
ubuntu	linux
some information on how it is done in ubuntu and this is a generalized guide for linux unix

401503
width	height
3 - determine the width and height of all captions in pixels and compare that to the control s width height and adjust accordingly

401515
folder	directory
the solution to this problem was to do temporary impersonation with a user account that had access to the share permissions on the folder and permissions on the virtual directory

401523
folder	directory
the answer to this solution for me was to setup temporary impersonation with a user account that had access to the share the folder and the virtual directory

401528
gridgain	terracotta
if i decided that object reuse was important i d do it with products like terracotta tangersol gridgain etc

401627
width	height
define a width and height for

401639
firefox	safari
the browser webkit which is what the iphone uses ie firefox safari doesn t see what happens on the server which is where the asp.net lives

401684
hash	md5
never hash passwords with sha1 or md5 or even sha256

401684
scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	hash
use pbkdf2 if you cannot use either bcrypt or scrypt with sha2 hash

401693
hash	salt
by using a salt any salt you re preventing the use of a generic rainbow table to attack your hash some people have even had success using google as a sort of rainbow table by searching for the hash

401698
hash	salt
but if the string is salt say with the string my_personal_salt the hash for the empty string my_personal_salt becomes aeac2612626724592271634fb14d3ea6 hence non-obvious to backtrace

401698
hash	md5
there are actually websites that do just this - you can feed it a md5 hash and it spits out a known plaintext that generates that particular hash

401720
inherited	subclassing
usually each definition instance is a subclassing of a general class for that definition type wankelengine inherited enginetype

401746
serializable	deserialization
the work is going to be in the serializable and deserialization of the controls when you initialize them to make sure you re capturing what you need the textbox values the isselected etc.

401823
width	height
for a figure already created i believe there is a set_size_inches width height method

401831
width	height
as long as the cards are staying four-square with the sides then you collide with the sides when the distance between the card center and the wall is 1 2 the width or height as appropriate

401844
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
an objectinputstream deserializes primitive data and objects previously written using an objectoutputstream

401892
width	height
you pass it a string and it calculates the width and height of the string using the currently selected font

401894
filesystems	ntfs
using an account that includes system permissions because even as an admin you can t open the master file table kind of an inode table of an ntfs filesystems

401916
intersect	contains
if the circle intersect with two neighboring edges of the rectangle it must contains the corner connecting those two edges

401985
hash	salt
each user has an id a number and a password which is stored as a salt hash

402030
width	height
if the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width and height of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangle

402034
httphandler	httpmodule
for example moving httpmodule and httphandler to their new location within

402051
public	protected
even if your protected variable was public instead of protected you won t have the desired input since this will output the entire object like this

402055
rss	feed
the update of rss feed in a

402060
int	chars
my big worry about having a table full of chars int is you may still find yourself executing large volumes of pointless string comparisons especially if you use word on this new table

402104
hide	show
use jquery to add an onchange handler to your dropdown list and when the value of the dropdown list is other show the textbox otherwise hide it

402121
put	get
if you put in sufficient effort you would find that you get to the point where you can quickly design sites confidently which best illuminate your content

402156
post	get
these are http get and post requests

402156
tapestry	sitemesh
there are much more comprehensive frameworks and libraries in java too for a single web appl you may need to join several of these libraries such as spring webwork tapestry lucene for search sitemesh for page decoration

402296
16-bit	64bit
you ve probably heard processors described as being 16-bit 32-bit 64bit etc

402298
emacs	jedit
in addition i use jedit the only visual editor that i ve seen--besides emacs that allows you total control over highlighting

402329
dwoo	smarty
also checkout a new templating language called dwoo which is similar to smarty but also takes some ideas from django templating

402357
xslt	xquery
net at this date does not implement xpath 2.0 xslt 2.0 or xquery

402379
put	get
so my recommendation is if you can afford it get a job no matter if the pay is bad put your hands on any jsp project as soon as you can

402477
autocomplete	autosuggest
you re definitely looking for autosuggest autocomplete this is rather time-consuming to implement fully if you want to do it in pure javascript but yes you could use the example from strager to get started

402487
getattr	setattr
the basics of this approach is to use django s contibute_to_class method to dynamically add a new field to your model and uses getattr setattr to do the serializing on demand

402493
base	tilde
i think in the long run if you reorganize or restructure the file locations of the web pages the tilde notation will make it much easier for you to refactor since you always know that the base path is referring to the root of the web application

402527
getter	setter
it only initializes the bare minimum and lets users set the rest with getter and setter

402528
getter	setter
you may have getter and setter functions but probably may be avoided from the interface as described here

402550
public	protected
to allow subtypes of non-serializable classes to be serialized the subtype may assume responsibility for saving and restoring the state of the supertype s public protected and if accessible package fields

402550
public	protected
during deserialization the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class

402622
int	chars
if i understand correctly the type conversion will be converting a chars array of size 8192 to a short int array of size half of that which is 4096

402623
unsigned	short
the statement that you show doesn t cast a char to an unsigned short it casts a pointer to a char to a pointer to an unsigned short

402623
unsigned	short
note that sizeof unsigned short is unlikely to be one so that won t necessarily correspond to

402623
unsigned	short
it is more likely - if say sizeof unsigned short is two - to correspond to and

402624
unsigned	short
when you do unsigned short slt unsigned short lookup_ext

402624
unsigned	short
of bytes equivalent to the size of unsigned short are picked up from the location given by lookup_ext and stored at the location pointed to by slt

402624
unsigned	short
since unsigned short would be 2 bytes first two bytes from lookup_ext would be stored in the location given by slt

402629
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql

402635
unsigned	short
that will interpret the bytes making up the array as unsigned short objects when you read from that pointer s target

402635
unsigned	short
strictly speaking the above is undefined behavior because you can t be sure the array is suitable aligned and you would read from a pointer that s not pointing at the type of the original pointed type unsigned char - unsigned short

402635
memcpy	memmove
that s all the structs and simple types that are possible in c too such as short broadly speaking is by using such library functions as memcpy or memmove

402635
unsigned	short
so if you read above you would interpret the first bytes of the array and try to read it as unsigned short that s called type pun

402643
width	height
assumes a div with as you are already specifying height and width adding a background shouldn t be an issue

402655
hide	show
you might like to add events that hide and show the div when the textbox gains or loses focus

402671
thin	webrick
after that both webrick and thin crashes immediately with

402685
rss	feed
update - unfortunately no rss feed

402693
rss	feed
if the other site provides an rss feed for their notices easiest would be to use an rss plugin for joomla to present them

402759
rss	feed
as there isn t yet an rss feed for your target -- you could write one in php which iirc joomla is written in so i ll assume support

402774
disk	ram
plenty of ram assigned to each vm avoids swapping and aids caching meaning less disk i o

402806
trie	tree
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

402816
rss	feed
i agreed with frankodwyer and rowland s answers but one thing to consider is bugging the site owner if it s still actively developed i assume so if there is new news to add an rss feed

402918
ubuntu	linux
let s take a linux os my ubuntu system is already unicode aware

402977
vmware	esx
edit we use vmware here and the reason we can t use real keys is that our esx servers are running more vms than they have real usb ports and sharing is not acceptible

403007
int	chars
int and takes a float and two chars

403122
folder	directory
i put the typed dataset into one of the existing directory as it was in the app_code directory of the previous site but don t see the option to create that asp.net folder in this project

403165
firefox	safari
the problem occurs both in safari and firefox latest version

403233
sorting	filtering
i use them to create dynamic queries whether it be for sorting or filtering the data

403274
put	get
and with svn you can set up ignores for files and folders so the files in your web projects dont get put into svn and the ignore attributes are checked out onto each developer s machine

403397
hash	salt
for example in a project i m working on now i pass an employeedata object over the network that includes most of my l2s employee fields but excludes things like the employee s salt hash password salt

403488
sorting	filtering
finding the exact position of where the item is supposed to go into the list box would be pretty complex based on any sorting filtering rules you have

403583
public	protected
edit a little too late after asking this question i realized i d forgotten to exclude the standard pattern of package protected implementation classes possibly providing implementations of public interfaces

403629
width	height
i ve deconstructed a standard wpf button using blend and have managed to create a nicely styled button but i cannot figure out how to make the path fill the interior of the button space the button width and height

403656
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentexception argumentoutofrangeexception argumentnullexception or similar

403683
weka	orange
use weka or orange

403687
pop-up	dialog
i remember reading somewhere about the concept of switching ok-cancel cancel-ok in certain situations to prevent the user from clicking through information pop-up or dialog boxes without reading their content

403735
rss	feed
i m using jalbum to create my webalbum and since version 8.1 jalbum supports rss feed of the albums

403735
rss	feed
however the rss feed generated by jalbum do not work for albums containing a hierarchy of folders

403735
rss	feed
what they try to do in the rss feed is to include the rss feed of the subfolders by including a element see example below

403735
rss	feed
it is possible to change the rss template used by jalbum to generate the rss feed

403735
rss	feed
i m trying to fix this and other problems but really doubt if it is possible at all to refer from one rss feed to another and have the entries of the sub feed be included in the main feed

403747
ubuntu	linux
cross-platform the application is be coded with cross-platform in mind windows - linux ubuntu - mac osx so the localized text system have to be cross platform too

403769
inherited	subclassing
in the interests of full disclosure i should warn you that i have the toolstrippanel and one of the toolstrips added to a baseclass form and i am trying to add the other toolstrip to a subclassing form that inherited from the baseclass form

403799
disk	ram
using the disk driver again the process might read code from the first sector of the hard drive place it in a know space within ram and then jump to that address

403799
disk	ram
in the modern world with sophisticated peripherals advanced cpu architectures and vast vast resources gbs or ram tb of disk and very fast cpus the operating system can support quite powerful abstractions for the developer multiple processes virtual memory loadable drivers etc.

403800
getter	setter
private access is very often too narrow so a public getter setter must be added

403800
getter	setter
ironically the pattern subverts encapsulation as the whole implementation is essentially nailed down by the getter setter pairs

403849
button	checkbox
and then a checkbox with yes i accept the responsibility for my actions and two button

403849
button	checkbox
yes i want to delete it this button should only be enabled if the checkbox is checked

403868
hide	show
i am using .ajaxstart and .ajaxstop to show and hide a progress indicator

403931
post	get
the asp.net request continues to execute ignorant of the fact that the browser that originally submitted the get post is no longer waiting

403947
postgresql	mysql
i haven t worked with mysql but postgresql so there might slight variation in interpretation of things here

403959
jar	war
pass its name to ant via -d or build.properties and copy the file to your build directory right before you jar or war it up

403994
g++	gcc
both gcc and g++ support the -v verbose flag which makes them output details of the current task

404014
google-chrome	firefox
| setup | | google-chrome usr lib firefox-3.0.5 firefox |

404018
client-side	server-side
i find that in most of my web projects a large majority of my time is spent validating user input both on the client-side and on the server-side

404019
put	get
i can put in the window s opening block and it compiles and shows up in the vs design window fine but during actual runtime i get a parse exception mywindowstyle could not be found

404038
google-chrome	firefox
| setup | | google-chrome usr lib firefox-3.0.5 firefox |

404045
struts	wicket	jsf	wicket
there are literally hundreds now struts jsf spring wicket etc.

404093
getter	setter
saves you time of repeating setter and getter all the time

404118
screens	tablet
when on a tablet pc touching the screens with your pen is interpreted as a click

404118
mouseup	mousedown
the only events that one cares about are mousedown and mouseup

404118
mouseup	mousedown
what i m finding is that my tablet driver on windows is batching the mousedown and mouseup together for strokes that are shorter than a certain time

404135
int	chars
when you need to store state ca tx ny you might as well use a chars 2 natural key instead of an int

404199
pop-up	dialog
everything s fine when i post with valid authentication but if i happen to pass an invalid username or password to the rest api a twitter rest api to be specific an authentication dialog pop-up

404539
public	protected
this scoping is irrelevant to your public protected private friend member-access-control

404542
vmware	esx
i haven t used vmware esx servers so this may not be valid in your case but at least in vmware workstation shared folders appear as network drives

404566
put	get
minor comments i put off to the right indented to column 81 to get them out of the way of the code

404633
mvp	presenter
to answer your question the most common pattern appears to be generalized hacking in my experience however if you want a nice pattern check out the mvp model view presenter pattern from microsoft s patterns and practices group

404634
freemarker	velocity
i actually slightly prefer freemarker to velocity just in case you re open to exploring other options

404634
freemarker	velocity
i also like the ability to render a freemarker or velocity template in any kind of execution environment junit main method without requiring a servlet jsp container as jsp would

404659
cos	sin
if you only need 64 entries in a lut that s 16 4 bytes for sin cos tan use symmetry

404659
cos	sin
compared to a large sin cos tan function

404713
getter	setter
please note that if you use svcutil.exe the generated proxy class will have both public getter and setter for the property which might not be what you are looking for

404720
viewdidload	dealloc
i guess the correct positions to register for notification is viewdidload method and correct position to unregister for same notifications is dealloc method

404721
partition-problem	np-hard
this is very close to partition-problem which is np-hard

404802
try-catch	exception-handling
also since you raised the issue yes the try-catch block does incur some overhead even if the exception-handling is not thrown

404809
innodb	myisam
it seems like i will be needing transaction with mysql and i have no idea how should i manage transactions in mysql with mixed innodb myisam tables it all seems like a huge mess

404823
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
as far as mysql version control put your schema in your source code management system cvs svn perforce whatever

404849
hash	salt
you shouldn t store the pin in clear anywhere salt and hash it like a password however given the short length and limited char set it is always going to be vulnerable to a brute force search given an easy way to verify it

404883
int	boolean
i would say that if you are comparing a true int then never do an implicit conversion to boolean as it implies a different meaning to the variable

404883
int	boolean
boolean or int that is basicaly a boolean

404932
viewdidload	dealloc
in this case you could get the viewdidload message sent a second time after the memory event when your view is brought back on screen by its navigation controller. thus you ll have two registrations of the same object but only one removal in its dealloc

404941
postgresql	mysql
edit i will be using postgresql mysql i haven t decided yet

404945
hash	salt
to generate the pins i would take a high resolution version of the time along with some salt and maybe a pseudo-random number generate a hash and use the first 9 or 12 digits

404972
versioning	upgrade
is easy to push upgrade to both versioning

404976
firefox	safari
it has already been implemented using a nasty browser specific style -moz-border-radius in firefox and safari --

404996
cvs	svn
merging between branches is much easier and safer in svn and it s trivial to convert your entire cvs history to svn - see cvs2svn

405003
cvs	svn
wincvs for cvs tortoisesvn and trac for svn and git-gui for git

405022
innodb	myisam
i think you are overrating the performance difference between myisam and innodb

405022
innodb	myisam
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

405022
innodb	myisam
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

405055
switching	screens
this will allow you to draw on screens using only 2d coordinates if you want 3d later on switching from ortho to perspective view and you have 3d however i don t think it will help you reuse the code since the 2d ortho view is usually done with textures and you cannot transform a texture to a 3d mesh

405070
postgresql	mysql
better yet if your application can work across multiple dbs oracle mysql postgresql sql lite ms sql server then your clients can leverage either a free cheap db or use an existing in house db

405114
filesystems	hfs
i m not aware of any drivers for xp vista that support mac filesystems like hfs

405121
memcpy	memset
the bottom line is don t access classes this way at all if you can avoid it and also don t memset them or memcpy them

405158
post	get
you ll probably need to post specific code samples to get more help it seems like there are a few python misconceptions mixed into this and once those are cleared up you ll have a simpler time

405171
uicontrol	uibutton
it s in the uicontrol class which is the superclass of uibutton

405221
memcached	apc
use a virtual drive in your ram google it for a how to for your distro or if your data is provided by php use apc memcached might work well with mysql

405231
mantis	bugzilla
i ve used bugzilla and mantis and found bugzilla better from a technical point of view but mantis wins if some of your bug reporters are not programmers not programmer minded

405246
daemons	systemd
i m writing a a very small daemons that must remain responsive even when a systemd is under severe stress

405254
userprincipal	directoryentry
if you need to convert a userprincipal object to a directoryentry object to work with legacy code you can do this

405265
lisp	scheme
if you are looking at some example written in scheme or say lisp perhaps even perl

405310
lisp	smalltalk
but ruby is very nearly a clone of smalltalk and i hope will grow more like smalltalk as the perlish cruft is deprecated and smalltalk like lisp is a language that takes one idea to extremes

405310
lisp	smalltalk
based on your desire to do cool hacks on the language level i d go with ruby as it inherits a lot of the metaprogramming mindset from smalltalk and that mindset is connected to the lisp tradition

405315
floating-point	integer
lots of developers use floating-point math along with the sluggish performance and large libraries memory usage when simple scaled integer math will suffice

405361
superclass	subclassing
the author of the subclassing makes assumptions about the superclass

405361
superclass	subclassing
the superclass changes and the subclassing is now broken

405387
postgresql	mysql
brazil is ruby ruby on rails based and supports change deployment to any database that ruby dbi supports mysql odbc oracle postgresql sqlite

405423
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
in addition to phpmyadmin i find that sqlbuddy has a very clean simple interface to work with

405463
union	distinct
lose the distinct clauses as your union vs union all will take care of removing duplicates

405470
post	get
they all have an http post and get interfaces along with the soap interface

405470
post	get
i believe post and get are offered by default when building soap web services in .net visual studio

405529
move	drag
most jquery drag drop libraries have the ability to serialize the elements that are being move into an array that you can save

405538
gridview	repeater
when you say databinding are you speaking of binding a database result set to a gridview or repeater etc

405545
pkcs#12	pfx
pfx files are pkcs#12 personal information exchange syntax standard bundles

405637
post	get
the get operation gives you the board so a post sends a move

405751
uiview	calayer
for iphone game development seems there are very like functions using calayer and uiview we can implement our spirit using calayer or uiview and animations are usable for them too

405751
uiview	calayer
but for coding there are many difference between calayer and uiview like object methods and properties etc

405755
gridview	rowdatabound
first add rowdatabound event to your gridview

405761
haskell	ocaml
in statically typed functional programming languages like standard ml f# ocaml and haskell a function will usually be written with the parameters separated from each other and from the function name simply by whitespace

405780
put	get
i ve thought about simply having the get request block until the move is played-- my client would put the coordinates of my move to

405805
int	boolean
there s no fundamental reason you need tuples in a programming language you can build up tuples in the lambda calculus just as you can boolean and int mdash

405846
unsigned	short
you cannot re-define xmlchar to be an unsigned short

405899
bazaar	git
ciarã n walsh has replaced svnmate with projectplus -- in addition to subverison it handles git mercurial bazaar and svk

405946
profiling	benchmarking
the best way to make sure your code is fast is to benchmarking or profiling it

406013
valgrind	gprof
on the rare occasions when it isn t for c c++ and objective caml i use the venerable gprof and the excellent valgrind with its superb visualizer kcachegrind part of the kde sdk

406028
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort are faster in terms of sorting and should be always used before a bubble sort

406033
put	get
it sounds like you re willing to put up with a little unfaithfulness to a true projection to get simpler calculations

406110
for-loop	arrays
a fairly simple for-loop to iterate through elements in an arrays

406124
udp	tcp
with tcp ip we use mss-clamping to protect against large packet issues but this cannot be applied to any udp transmissions or anything secure protocol that uses an authentication header

406173
versioning	upgrade
at the moment i ve made it a practice to upgrade to the latest versioning as soon as possible

406241
width	height
it would give you back a size with the height increased to accomidate the word-wrapped text set in the label and the width set to whatever the original label width had

406249
post	get
i m also able to get data from the gae service i did it after reading another question written here but now i need to post data so i need to send the authentication token in the header of the post request

406255
maven	buildr
there are examples of this like buildr the drop in-replacement for maven for java that is built on top of rake

406274
int	chars
consider how many folks declare main int argc chars argv vs main int argc chars argv .

406288
getter	setter
i recently started working in java and was introduced to the wild and crazy world of getter and setter for everything

406288
getter	setter
one of the things i am trying to do is avoid the trap of doing getter and setter for everything

406288
getter	setter
however much of the work i do is with entities that are mainly data containers and i am not certain that getter and setter are actually inappropriate in these cases

406288
getter	setter
here is a simple example using private properties and using getter and setter

406288
getter	setter
i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are

406288
getter	setter
i have read several discussions about getter and setter being evil and or an anti-pattern but it really feels like those might not apply to this situation

406303
getter	setter
that being said getter and setter tend to be overused

406323
google-chrome	safari
the other issue i mentioned was the dom - js binding cost -- this can actually play a very significant part in web performance the best example of this is safari 3.1 2 vs google-chrome at the dromaeo benchmark

406323
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is based off of the safari 3.1 2 branch of webkit so it s reasonably safe to assume similar dom performance compiler difference could cause some degree of variance

406323
google-chrome	safari
in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats google-chrome despite having a js engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between jsc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

406342
width	height
unless explicitly specified width and height of child elements are nan

406342
width	height
when height and width properties are

406344
hash	md5
the best option is going to be code signing -- either using a tool supplied by your local friendly os for example if you re targeting windows you probably want to take a look at authenticode where the operating system handles the tampering or by rolling your own option storing md5 hash and comparing

406350
getter	setter
getter setter are evil except for plain data storage objects which itself is just an evangelism of tell don t ask

406350
getter	setter
ideally if a class has getter and setter that s all it should have

406376
accessor	properties
that s why c# has a special properties syntax which allows to concisely specify default accessor

406426
lisp	prolog
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think

406426
lisp	smalltalk
i always confuse common lisp with smalltalk

406426
lisp	prolog
also what i meant by other people that are fond of the basic language is that i don t prefer a language with semantics like lisp for people with no cs background and i find prolog a little bit more intuitive but that s my opinion after i just messed a little bit with both of them

406455
lisp	prolog	lisp	smalltalk
there are several good free some as in speech some as in beer implementations of smalltalk prolog and lisp

406456
vsto	add-in
after applying these fixes it was easy to use com add-in like using vsto and it took me less than an hour to write the actual code

406474
put	get
i don t know if it s better or worse but one way to structure it is to get rid of all smartness from your entity data transfer object product and put everything including create retreive retreiveall save getrelatedproducts etc

406501
children	parent
ie doesn t seem to calculate the height of the parent when all the children are floated

406504
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
which means that officially margin padding width and height properties should be ignored in practice not really

406504
opera	safari
it works just fine in ie7 ff3 opera 9 and safari whatever the current version is

406588
width	margin
officially margin padding width

406634
opera	safari
looks weird but works great on all common browsers ie6 7 ff2 3 opera safari

406649
stdout	stderr
iirc the studio s output window displays not only stdout and stderr but also trace messages

406678
opera	safari
as i mentioned it works in current ie7 ff3 opera 9 and safari

406787
getter	setter
i really dislike when people tell me to use getter and setter instead of making the variable public when you should be able to both get and set the class variable

406807
getter	setter
getter and setter are highly overused

406807
getter	setter
i ve seen millions of people claiming that public fields are evil so they make them private and provide getter and setter for all of them

406807
getter	setter
i m not in favor of public fields but against making a getter setter or property for everyone of them and then claiming that doing that is encapsulation or information hiding .

406807
getter	setter
now creating private fields and then using the ide to automatically generate getter and setter for every one of them is nearly as bad as using public fields

406807
getter	setter
i say automatic or not generation of getter setter pair for your fields effectively goes against the so called encapsulation you are trying to achieve

406825
for-loop	loops
if you can t apply loops invariants to a trivial for-loop you re not worth your salt as a supposed computer scientist

406833
lisp	prolog
but it has to be an easy language i saw there was a prolog in ruby even a lisp but i don t think they are easy to learn languages...

406838
set	bag
i m not sure how you do it with fluent nhibernate but you need to set the cascade option on the bag tripitems

406840
subtract	add
apply dx and dy to the previous point based on horizontal and vertical travel right down - add left up - subtract

406846
post	get
apart from tempfinalquery being unused and an unnecessary map lookup to get the state there doesn t seem to be anything too egregious in the code you post

406879
client-side	server-side
as drawbacks compared to the server-side solution this method moves complexity from the server to client-side javascript and increases the load on the web server

406881
post	get
i ve found that this code works replacing the get by the post verb and using the formcollection as the parameter of the controller method

406913
lisp	scheme
script-fu under gimp is also lisp the scheme dialect

406925
ramaze	camping	ramaze	merb	merb	camping
other frameworks for ruby include merb camping and ramaze

406982
qmainwindow	qdialog
qmainwindow has special behavior for the central widget that a qdialog does not

407038
rpm	yum
but assuming you want to support the most popular distros you can query their package manager for installed software i d suggest as a start to support apt-get rpm and yum and parse the output to look for the packages you recognize

407056
daemons	launchd
it has jsvc launchd which suports starting and stopping java-based daemons services

407070
mouse	keyboard
here is some code that looks for mouse and keyboard activity with the applicatin

407108
gridview	sqldatasource
and i m trying to get the return value using the below code sqldatasource gridview combo in vb .net

407258
post	get
however if you post two post on the same day called foo you get

407258
int	chars
if it s an int or some kind of short guid eg 6-8 chars then it shouldn t be a problem

407280
firefox	safari
only safari so far seems not to be able to set cookies but ie6 and firefox work fine.

407290
kde	gnome
i for instance made the same client app for kde and gnome for the first i used python and for the second c# even when my day job is at a java shop

407328
hide	show
when you get a successful login hide the login div and show the user panel div

407358
awt	swing
you should certainly write swing for desktop java only using awt to the degree that swing demands it

407361
awt	swing
when learning swing you ll find that you will come to know those parts of awt that are still important such as event layoutmanager graphics font color etc

407391
awt	swing
it explains some of the history of awt and swing

407391
awt	swing
swing being a lightweight alternative successor to most of the awt classes

407395
client-side	server-side
faster server-side client-side

407402
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to develop a little c# application with ms visual express and sql server and am having an issue trying to figure out the error dialog that pop-up the event log file is full

407412
hash	salt
that forced us to sit and convert our salt and iteratively hash password storage scheme to a specification and provide some different language implementations for easy integration

407412
hash	salt
fshp is a salt iteratively hash password hashing implementation

407414
hash	salt
that forced us to sit and convert our salt and iteratively hash password storage scheme to a specification and provide some different language implementations for easy integration

407414
hash	salt
fshp is a salt iteratively hash password hashing implementation

407446
factors	mean
maybe specifics of brace position should remain purely religious arguments - but it doesn t mean that all layout styles are equal or that there are no objective factors at all

407449
outputstream	inputstream
if you want to make a streaming api in java you should usually provide inputstream for reading and outputstream for writing

407468
folder	directory
i ve placed this .py file in my my documents directory and placed a shortcut to it in my send to folder the shortcut url is

407474
google-chrome	safari
if it s working fine on safari it will probably work on google-chrome as well

407475
google-chrome	safari
theoretically because google-chrome uses the same engine as safari webkit you ve already tested

407475
google-chrome	firefox
now that gmail suggests people switch from ie to firefox and google-chrome i m guessing we ll see ie lose more and more market share to those browsers

407476
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the webkit rendering engine which is also used in safari and some other small browsers

407476
google-chrome	safari
overall with both google-chrome and safari gaining in market share it is definately a browser to test you only really need to test one

407482
google-chrome	safari
i ve already run across sites that work in safari but don t in google-chrome

407482
google-chrome	safari
i have ie8b2 ff3 safari and google-chrome all installed on my machine

407483
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses the webkit engine which as i recall is the same engine used by safari

407483
google-chrome	safari
so in theory if your site works for safari it should work for google-chrome as well

407485
xslt	xquery
you may try using the saxon xslt xquery processor

407493
swt	swing
in the broader sense i have a number of java applications although i am not too sure if they use swing or swt

407498
spaces	delimiter
regardless of whether your records and fields are fixed-length if the fields are separated by uniform delimiter such as a spaces or comma you can use the split function more easily than unpack

407524
awt	swing
awt and swing are for programming stand-alone applications and to a lesser extent applets

407545
versioning	upgrade
if you re using python 2.5 or newer urllib2_file is both unnecessary and unsupported so check which versioning you re using and perhaps upgrade

407546
next	except
i ve read that the next version of xml schema enables you to say what you meant any tag except important_tag

407554
getter	setter
domain classes in grails try to make sure that every property has a getter and setter during startup

407554
getter	setter
it does this by looking for all the getter and making sure an appropriate setter exists

407559
awt	swing
awt swing are used for desktop java apps or applets

407562
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
however i always try in all modern browsers ie6 7 ff2 3 opera 9.x safari and google-chrome

407604
awt	swing
while swing has a lot to teach you and it is too heavily infused with awt if you re never going to be writing guis you may be better off investing in something else

407662
filtering	grouping
for the first it s generally a good idea to just have a grouping which you can then filtering on if you want

407759
int	chars
there s an example a little less than halfway down of using a heap with a list of int chars tuples as a priority queue

407770
post	put
put each row within it s own form tag then when the update button is clicked it will submit the values for that row only there will also be a hidden field with the rowid and the controller class would take all the post values as parameters to the update method on the controller

407778
put	get
mind you you might get a securityexception so make sure that the runtime gives you the appropriate permissions you might want to put this in a library and make a call and then set the library up in the gac with evidence to give it full trust

407865
weblogic	oc4j
oracle will release a 11g version oc4j but after that oracle weblogic server wls will be the preferred java ee server

408013
public	protected
for instance a mix of public private and protected member variables could be laid out such that each access type is contiguous

408063
awt	swing
the only real similarities to swing and awt are that they are toolkits for creating user interfaces and they use java

408123
int	double
the only time that it doesn t pass a pointer is when you pass a variable with an intrinsic data type like an int or a double into the function

408146
django	turbogears
and then there is django and turbogears etc. which is guided by the same just-the-tools-needed philosophy as rails it can be argued who got there first or who did it better

408147
int	double
i also resorted to sqlite3_bind_text for other simple data types because the api i m working on can translate int double etc into a string

408195
int	double
developers just throw int and double in because they have to write in something

408195
unsigned	short	int	chars	int	double
if you have a day of the month variable it doesn t matter much if it s signed or unsigned or whether it s chars short int long long long float double or long double

408213
free	malloc
if you use from within your overloaded member operator delete new the global operator new delete to get your memory and release it or even malloc free you don t need that size information

408327
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
you should make sure that myobject overrides equals gethashcode and tostring so that the indexof method can find the object properly

408342
firefox	safari
you can see it run fine in firefox and safari but not in ie

408379
put	get
unlike purists i m not really a put the functionality in the class so you can use polymorphism to get around the type switching kinda person

408412
folder	directory
the images are supposed to be stored in the web server where the application runs in a folder called images under the main application directory

408471
folder	directory
if you want to stick with 2 tiers and you have n users as your target population then you should aim for sqrt n folder in the first tier with sqrt n folder in each second tier directory

408489
entity-relationship	diagram
looking for a tool that will automatically create a graphical representation of a mysql db schema from a live database showing tables columns and relationships an entity-relationship diagram

408495
children	parent
just right click the box and select add all children and add all parent

408513
filesystems	xfs
i would look into xfs or another high-performance journaling filesystems

408528
vmware	virtualbox
i ve tried virtualbox vmware server free and virtual pc

408553
versioning	upgrade
what this means is that when you upgrade you have to be careful that both subeclipse and tortoise have released new versioning with the matching underlying subversion updates

408566
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux

408609
inherited	properties
the avm1movie object can use methods and properties inherited from the displayobject class such as x y width and so on

408611
for-loop	loops
the first loops creates a variable i that is a scalar and it iterates it like a c for-loop

408636
getter	setter
the getter setter probably look like this

408660
lisp	smalltalk
assembler c lisp ruby smalltalk

408667
int	double
there aren t many types that are c# keywords int double string .

408756
pylons	turbogears
in fact this is exactly what pylons and turbogears do is provide a reliable predictable stack to build mvc web apps

408776
int	chars
for bigger int you would need to add corresponding items to the thou array and perhaps pass the number in as a string modifying the line to extract the block by using the last 3 chars instead of using modulo as i have here

408828
awt	swing
swing vs awt

408828
awt	swing
basically awt came first and is a set of heavyweight ui components meaning they are wrappers for operating system objects whereas swing built on top of awt with a richer set of lightweight components

408828
awt	swing
any serious java ui work is done in swing not awt which was primarily used for applets

408830
button	checkbox
it uses awt to create an operating system window and then paints pictures of button labels text checkbox etc. into that window and responds to all of your mouse-clicks key entries etc. deciding for itself what to do instead of letting the operating system handle it

408830
awt	swing
because awt uses native gui widgets your os knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your os s point of view

408830
awt	swing
mixing awt and swing is highly unsupported and can lead to ridiculous results such as native buttons that obscure everything else in the dialog box in which they reside because everything else was created with swing

408830
awt	swing
because swing tries to do everything possible in java other than the very raw graphics routines provided by a native gui window it used to incur quite a performance penalty compared to awt

408830
swt	swing	awt	swing
finally you might also want to check out swt the gui toolkit used for eclipse and an alternative to both awt and swing which is somewhat of a return to the awt idea of accessing native widgets through java

408853
vim	gedit
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

408873
mouse	keyboard
generally speaking one primary focus has to be in minimising movement between the mouse and keyboard so put lots of functionality into the mouse or into the keyboard because when you have to move your hands like that there is a real delay in trying to find the right place to put them

408884
awt	swing
another statement which i saw is that swing is mvc based and awt is not

408891
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram are great

408914
g++	gcc
mingw for gcc g++ and added gdb maybe msys when i get around to it

408931
post	get
three post to get you started

408970
freebsd	linux
i know the win32 api supplies us with createiocompletionport freebsd has kqueue and linux in general can use dev epoll that works somewhat similarly.

408981
pyopengl	pyglet
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl

408990
agile	sprint
every agile methodology puts emphasis on delivering working software read meeting part of the requirements each sprint

409017
apache	nginx
the author of nginx mod_wsgi explains some differences to apache mod_wsgi in this mailing list message

409034
bazaar	git
modern distributed version control systems like git mercurial or bazaar are the best tool in a situation like this

409041
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
according to the documentation itext supports the following image formats jpeg gif png tiff bmp wmf and eps

409042
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you like how things look in the other browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome then i d say you ve got 99 of your bases covered

409171
int	double
first never use floats or double if you want to represent decimal values exactly - use either int types int long etc or decimal which is just an int type with a scaling factor

409211
pop-up	dialog
if anything takes longer than that then a progress dialog should pop-up or a progress bar should appear in the status bar or somewhere else in the interface

409225
memcached	apc
caching in php userland means using a separate programmable system along the lines of memcached or the apc to handle the details of memory management for you

409287
firefox	safari
i would much prefer something like firefox or safari that doesn t clutter my screen real estate with a useless window

409302
int	double
using floats not double or int

409313
pop-up	dialog
on the other hand if you just don t like the pop-up dialog i think you re sol for now

409346
post	get
edit i missed that the body of the first post was in the topic table so post with no replies would get missed by the above query

409348
integer	unsigned
which generates warning comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions

409367
agile	sprint
a scrum master in the agile world would take care of fire-fighting and be the voice of the sprint team

409442
sorting	filtering
if you ll be doing a lot of sorting and filtering you may like some helper functions

409472
google-chrome	safari
also the resource inspector in webkit browsers like safari or google-chrome will do the same for you

409478
sorting	filtering
then you can use sql statements to do all this sorting and filtering without having to reinvent the wheel

409491
putty	winscp
method install a free command-line sftp application such as putty and winscp and execute it either by running a batch file or operating system process task

409495
getter	setter
this question is language agnostic but i am a c# guy so i use the term poco to mean an object that only preforms data storage usually using getter and setter fields

409563
int	boolean
returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one

409581
nfa	dfa
fsa including dfa and nfa are very important for computer science and they are use in many fields including many fields

409610
ready	each
another useful thing my team has found is using a stacked line chart with one line for each of to do in progress ready for qa and validated

409629
put	get
free to develop on free to put apps on your own phone 25 to get a license

409638
rtp	rtcp
the other two are essentially always rtp and rtcp -- real time protocol and real time control protocol and those are better p2p because you want fast transmission with no intermediate bottleneck

409727
postgresql	mysql
since i am using postgresql instead of mysql i decided to load all these dumps into my db using pipeline shell commands

409771
pascal	delphi
a pascal string the delphi shortstring has an extra byte for the length

409786
public	protected
sth_to_objects is supposed to be a public actually protected method

409823
accessor	properties
there is no name properties on an asp.net control and even when i try to set it using the attributes accessor properties by saying control.attributes name price

409838
typedef	struct
second when using template code it s sometimes easier to rely on pairs than to add yet another typedef for the struct type

409866
delphi	oxygene
a delphi prism oxygene one would be great too

409901
pascal	delphi
see also looking for a complete delphi object pascal syntax

409933
put	get
i ve always had the impression that one important difference between java and .net was that the microsoft suite required that you or your employer had put up some coin to get access to the tools

409933
postgresql	mysql
a java person has the advantage of being able to download a jvm eclipse or netbeans tomcat or glassfish mysql or postgresql and they re in business

409999
client-side	server-side
i am using javascript for client-side scripting php for server-side scripting and mysql for the database

410010
implements	extends
you can extends your application framework to help with this strategy but please don t implements such a policy in a library good libraries do not make global decisions without an applications consent

410039
websphere	ibm
keep in mind that i haven t used posix message queues before i did use ibm websphere mq a while back but that s rather different

410052
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a paying versioning if it s

410056
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
it replaces the annoying project drawer with a project panel adds support for svn git mercurial bazaar and svk and adds lots of other small stuff

410056
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
support for svn git mercurial bazaar and svk

410095
queue	fifo
system v message queue and fifo named pipes are both absolutely fine

410141
gif	png
i haven t yet locked in sizes so i didn t want to generate image files png gif jpg directly in case i change my mind after i get further along with layout and ui to see what works and what doesn t

410149
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
currently the library supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

410161
mouse	keyboard
however it s worth noting that in recent versions of windows directinput for mouse keyboard input is just a wrapper around the win32 windows messages

410176
photoshop	fireworks
the ones i use are adobe illustrator adobe fireworks photoshop

410176
photoshop	fireworks
admittedly fireworks and photoshop are bitmap graphics packages that have vector support

410176
photoshop	fireworks
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill

410176
photoshop	fireworks
i use groups in illustrator or folders fireworks or photoshop to isolate each icon from one another but lets me keep all the individual layers that make up the icon unflattened

410213
ubuntu	linux
i used python 2.5.2 on linux ubuntu 8.10 with a 1.5 ghz pentium m

410245

with regards to ubuntu and linux in general a good book

410253
ssl	https
must be secure https or ssl

410257
organization	naming
naming and organization might get confusing

410278
uiview	calayer
there are methods to transfer a cgpoint from one uiview to another and from one calayer to another

410278
uiview	calayer
i cannot find a way to change a cgpoint from a uiview s coordinate system to a calayer s coordinate system

410336
post	get
check out the very end of the file to see a possible way of handling the get and post verbs

410380
lisp	smalltalk
it borrows all the best features from perl 6 clos lisp smalltalk java beta ocaml ruby and more while still keeping true to its perl 5 roots

410388
ironruby	ironpython
one place where this would be different is with the languages that are run on the dlr ironpython ironruby etc.

410393
post	get
maybe we can get a community wiki post with a list of stuff

410399
min	max
the reason i ask is because every e-mail that i get with a link attached i keep getting platform version 1.9.0.4 not compatible with min version 1.9.0.5 max version 1.9.0.5

410465
profiler	perf
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems

410467
profiling	benchmarking
i didn t need any fancy profiling tools or benchmarking suites to tell me the new version was a significant improvement

410470
zlib	system.io.compression
the gzipstream in system.io.compression uses the deflate algorithm just the same as the zlib library and many other zip tools

410527
put	get
if you want to put a class inside a namespace and that class is going to get declared in a header file well then it should be declared inside the namespace which thus should be in the header file

410554
jquery	jqmodal
jqmodal is another i have used that is based on jquery

410561
postgresql	mysql
one of the disadvantages of postgresql is that it does not seem to support an in memory storage engines as mysql does.

410618
bazaar	git
if you are interested in a distributed vcs then you should be looking at git hg bazaar

410618
bazaar	git
hg and bazaar are ahead of git as far as windows supports

410618
cvs	svn
git supports a hybrid scenario where the server can be cvs svn and individual developers can use git-svn to work locally and manage local branches

410618
cvs	svn
i have been working on an open source project the repository was stored in cvs which then got migrated to svn and then to git

410645
bazaar	git
at work we ve been evaluating three different dvcs s namely git mercurial hg and bazaar and had a full packed evening presenting them for the rest of the company

410645
bazaar	git
find someone who can present some alternative to git such as mercurial or bazaar and do a presentation together on dvcs at your company

410662
vbscript	jscript
if you want to play with an application vbscript or jscript give you a quick way to experiment

410680
int	chars
if the value p being boxed is true false a byte a chars in the range u0000 to u007f or an int or short number between -128 and 127 then let r1 and r2 be the results of any two boxing conversions of p

410681
converter	multibinding
by using a multibinding and using self as the first binding we can then lookup resources in our converter

410690
min	max
either the ui constrains user input eg the use of a slider that bounds min max values and you can now assert certain conditions - no error handling required

410750
getter	setter
if ilist can or cannot be modified it should ve been broken down into two one for the unmodifiable part getter lookup etc. and one for the modifiable part setter add remove etc.

410782
int	chars	int	double
const can hold only integral type sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars float double decimal bool or string an enumeration or a reference to null not classes or structures because they are initialized at runtime with the new keyword whereas readonly can hold complex types structures or classes by using the new keyword at initialization but cannot hold enumerations

410814
binutils	glibc
also the newest versions of glibc or uclibc gcc and binutils arenâ t always compatible as they re developed independently

410820
post	put
i want to give bloggers a button like digg-it which they can put on their blogs for the readers to click to thumb-up the post if they like it

410872
rss	feed
there are organised cracking groups that feed off download.com s rss channel etc and crack each app that appears

410892
photoshop	fireworks
and as always if you can fake the 3d look using 2d vectors in illustrator flash photoshop or my favourite fireworks you ll have a much less steep learning curve

410896
strstr	substr
typically the way to do this would be to use strchr or strstr one or more times to find a pointer to where you want to extract the substr from say p and a pointer to the character after the last character that you need to extract say q if the buffer is a temporary buffer that you don t mind destroying then you can just do and p will be a pointer to the required string

410995
centos	linux
i have been searching the internet for away to setup our linux server running centos 5 so that there is a daemon listening on port 443 that depending on the client protocol forwards the request to the correct internal port ssh 22 or https moved to a differentport_

411012
try-catch	exception-handling
i just finished reading this article on the advantages and disadvantages of exception-handling and i agree with the sentiment that try-catch blocks should not be used for normal control-flow management don t use them like a goto

411026
try-catch	exception-handling
the bad thing about using try-catch block everywhere is that in consuming the exception-handling you potentially conceal bad code

411034
integer	unsigned
for integer division otoh unsigned integers are a tad faster on the arm

411060
getter	setter
property access will be fractionally slower as it will call the getter setter

411067

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
there is a push to make truetype opentype font files just work on the web which may show up in firefox 3.1 opera 10 and safari

411260
equals	gethashcode
note that if you override the equals operator you ll also want to override gethashcode so that the hash codes for equivalent objects are the same

411261
int	double
any time you re trying to convert floats double to int you want to think carefully about which operator you want to use -- truncating rounding down rounding up or rounding-to-nearest

411317
swt	swing
besides really good apps like intellij idea and netbeans there are lots of swing like frameworks swt eclipse gwt etc. which you can learn faster with swing knowledge.

haskell	scheme
there s a strong core of support for teaching intro programming using scheme and haskell also enjoys some support there but there s very little in the way of teaching advanced technique for functional programmer

411774
put	get
people don t do that necessarily to be able to put the product in a box at any day sure there may be routines that have to be done before release but the idea is that any developer can get the latest code in the server and it will build in their machines

411779
ant	cruisecontrol
on my current gig we do at least a daily build of our java ee app using cruisecontrol an ivy repo ant clearcase

411800
ant	maven
it means that you have a script which does your build or ant or maven or whatever and you use that script to do the tests aswel

on most redhat derivatives redhat fedora centos it s enough to run

411962
getter	setter

411976
postgresql	mysql
my goal is to utilize an open source relational database for the data storage portion and i m aware of two solid databases that are widely supported mysql and postgresql

411982
width	height
my picture class overrides public int getbaseline int width int height so that i can define a correct baseline for it

411986
firefox	safari
building in ie first and then tweaking for firefox safari has brought my ie support up to par

411993
postgresql	mysql
once you make that decision the subtle differences between mysql and postgresql go away

411994
postgresql	mysql
with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysql second as your database of choice

411996
ingres	firebird	ingres	postgresql	ingres	mysql	postgresql	mysql
there are four main open-source relational database management systems of note that might be appropriate to this sort of application postgresql mysql firebird and ingres

411996
postgresql	greenplum
several commercial variants of postgresql have been built over the years such as illustra greenplum and enterprisedb

411996
postgresql	informix
illustra was a commercial release of postgresql which was subsequently bought by informix

411996
postgresql	mysql
mysql 5.x has a feature set that supports a reasonable cross section of capabilities but it is not as feature-rich as postgresql

411996
interbase	firebird
firebird is an open-source version of interbase

412015
postgresql	mysql
to answer your stated question more directly i don t think there s a significant difference between postgresql and mysql that is relevant to your project

412043
haskell	ocaml
just for funsies i learned a functional programming language i chose ocaml over haskell and lisp and it completely changed how i thought about programming

postgresql	mysql
anything from sqlite to mysql to postgresql would probably work just fine

412083
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have 1 uinavigationcontroller and 2 subclasses of uiviewcontroller

412091
postgresql	mysql
mysql has improved a lot with its later versions but postgresql still beats it in every category

412098
uiview	calayer
my assertion that the calayer associated with a uiview shares the same coordinate system could in fact be entirely erroneous

412098
uiview	calayer
i just performed this test myself and it appears calayers actually use the same coordinate system as uiview so my assertion that calayer s flip the y axis is definitely wrong

412098
uiview	calayer
however if you do drawing with coregraphics directly be aware that coregraphics does use a flipped y axis though when drawing in a uiview subclass or i assume a calayer delegate the coregraphics context has already been flipped to match the uiview s or calayer s coordinate system

412098
uiview	calayer
so the short answer if you made it this far is the coordinate system for calayer should match the coordinate system for its corresponding uiview

412132
lisp	scheme
when i was in college at boston university 98- 02 we spent a semester learning scheme which is a close cousin of lisp

412136

412396
ienumerable	ilist
it s kind of simple-minded but when i plan to delete items from an ienumerable ilist i usually just make a copy

412611

i have the following use case a struct with some boolean and int variables

412678
bazaar	git

problem i have a custom wsh script that creates a new directory in a similar manner to the standard new folder action in the windows desktop

412765
free	malloc
second the suggested automatic free cannot work malloc does not initialize the allocated memory

412765
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
i would use calloc instead or add a memset after malloc

412779
calloc	malloc
also i use calloc instead of malloc because it will set all the pointers to null and integers to 0

412787
multiplying	division	multiplying	modulo	division	modulo
for your 12-digit bcd number provided there won t be any overflow assume that b 5 through b 0 holds your bytes from most significant to least significant and that mod is the modulo remainder operation and div is integer division the following pseudo-code would multiplying by 10

412790
int	chars
in case you don t have a decimal point your number is an int you can concat zeros if x 0 or delete the last -x chars if x 0

412865
boost	stl
that s one of my beefs with boost and stl

412866
stateless	stateful
contrast with java and .net frameworks that need to resort to horribly ugly hacks like viewstate and session keys to maintain application state and maintain the occasionally quite leaky abstraction of a stateful imperative language on an essentially stateless functional platform like the web

412882
lodash	underscore.js
underscore.js or lodash

412884
serializable	deserialization
it comes with xml serializable deserialization of graphs for wcf and also its own binary serializable for remoting much faster than the default binary formatter and also much more compact

is there a way to detect when a specific device is plugged into a usb port what i would like to happen is when i plug my laptop into my docking station it run up several apps to account for my different keyboard mouse and monitors

412923
disk	ram
if you want to improve your database performance i tend to throw more hardware at it in the form of more ram and faster disk

412946
serializable	deserialization
if you cache data from your database in asp.net session then you will speed up subsequent requests for that data note depending on the serializable deserialization cost of the data concerned at the expense of memory load in iis

412947
merb	ruby-on-rails
if you followed the news you have read that merb and ruby-on-rails will merge

converting from binary to hex notation should often not be called ascii... as ascii is a 7-bit format

412997
getattr	setattr
look at built-in functions getattr and setattr

413036
pull	push
unfortunately this will likely also require manual intervention since you probably don t have a way to make the application programmatically pull from push to the clipboard

413060
direct3d	directx
it can grab the vista windows desktop manager directx direct3d shared surface and use it as a visual brush in wpf

413079
nunit	mstest
this second place animosity isn t old news to be honest i don t know why ms don t spend more time supporting solutions already in place we ve seen this all before with nant - msbuild and nunit - mstest it would save everyone a lot of time and effort if they just accepted one of the better and mature solutions and endeavoured to support that as opposed to brewing their own all the time

413093
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode - not all classes are comparable or hashable should be moved to an interface

413125
prepare	execute
the advantages of a prepare statement over an execute string are many -

413125
prepare	execute
the statement is parsed and an access plan determind only once when the prepare statement is execute

413125
int	chars
a setint call take an int value as is the for the equvalent sql string you must convert to chars then the dbms has to convert it back to an int

413136
cvs	svn
look at svn cvs and other repositories that manage deltas work

413160
versioning	upgrade
the problematic moodle was upgrade from 1.8 versioning earlier

413205
for-loop	loops
if you want to know how many loops you ve gone through you need to use a for-loop or keep track of the count yourself

413240
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
now which language could be the next step that is the hard stuff but i believe could be haskell f# clojure ocaml or erlang

413250
gif	png
push this along with all the media files aspx gif png etc. out and your source should be hidden from less-than-diligent people

413278
gif	png
maybe not the ideal solution but you could always extract the gif animation frames to a png formatted sprite sheet and then use the sprite class to handle the animation

413281
put	get
any new tests get put in there with the rest of them and whatever package name you have it doesn t matter

413344
folder	directory
maybe i m wrong but i m not convinced that iis will serve any files from the bin folder it doesn t for me anyway and i assume this is by design in the same way that you cannot donwload web.config - it also won t even list the directory contents

413391
for-loop	arrays
the code could appear to run through a for-loop over an entire arrays collection whatever but maybe it uses obj.length instead of obj.length-1

413423
vsts	tfs
we use tfs and are looking at using vsts database edition gdr

413462
stateless	stateful
there is also obvious confusion when you used the term stateless and transaction in the same discussion as transactions are inherently stateful

width	height
check firebug s layout tab of the html tab to check the div has a height width

413473

erlang	scheme
my macbook s default name jamess-macbook does not play well with erlang s node-naming scheme due to the dash

413750
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i don t have any experience in this but if you really need to load big files i suggest you do some kind of lazy loading with jtextpane jeditorpane

413750
jtextpane	jeditorpane
define a limit that jtextpane jeditorpane can handle well like 500kb or 1mb

413750
jtextpane	jeditorpane
the text on the jtextpane jeditorpane must not change when loading chunks or else the user feels like is in another position of the file

413752
ant	maven
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

413761
hmac	md5
if you are looking to verify message integrity and authenticity with hashing - you might want to look at hmac - there are plenty of implementations in php using both sha1 and md5

413855
ssl	https
it does not support ssl https

413855
apache	nginx
you ll have to run it using apache nginx or some other web server that supports ssl in order to test

413862
parallels	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
i generally install with bootcamp because that lets you boot into native windows if you need more umph or if you want to game and the more recent versions of vmware and parallels both allow booting the vm directly from the bootcamp partition

413863
tinyxml	xerces
there are currently plugins for tinyxml expat libxml and xerces

413863
tinyxml	xerces
so my problem cannot be solved by requiring the use of a c++ parser tinyxml or xerces

413864
getter	setter
going beyond what casperone has said including the bit about checking that this is the bottleneck you may find it very helpful to convert the getter setter into delegates a and an for the getter and setter respectively using delegate.createdelegate

413867
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have an uitableview with about 30 custom cells each containing an uisegmentedcontrol

414022
tinyxml	xerces
restrict the parser plugins that my application can use on os x to the tinyxml and xerces plugins

414116
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails was definitely the best windows rails ide a couple of years ago but has fallen behind the times in my opinion

414136
vb.net	vb6
you could use that in anything that can use activex c++ vb6 vb.net etc... to create a parser as well to follow-up on what berek said

414137

414149
put	get
in any case if you get out of the top-level loop and put things into a separate file with an explicit type signature it all works fine

414151
mouse	keyboard
it would be extremely natural to use and much more lightweight than having to deal with a keyboard and mouse

414170
prepare	execute
generally it s more efficient to prepare the statement before your loop and execute the statement handle during the loop supplying the parameter at that time

414208
slideup	slidedown
it has also got a slideup and slidedown effect

414231
migrate	upgrade
as an addendum to harms answer i would note that like the windows registry os x preferences are deliberately not deleted when the app is removed but unlike the windows registry preferences can migrate from machine to machine as you upgrade your mac and use the user migration facility

414247
hide	show
for other kinds of apps on cds say a slide show or something like that the developer generally uses hidden folders to hide support data to ensure that the only thing the user will see when they open the cd is the single icon they re supposed to double click to start the app

414289
vim	emacs
there is also a minority class of person that thinks vim or emacs is the best thing since sliced bread

414289
mouse	keyboard
especially avoid forcing the user to change their position in front of the computer moving one hand between the mouse and keyboard

414289
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

414353
mockito	easymock
some mocking frameworks like easymock require a repository interface while others like mockito dont

414384
post	get
i m also not sure they support post request types so the amount of data you can send is limited to the size of a get request url

414388
pop-up	dialog
the error message is a small undecorated non-modal non-focusable dialog that pop-up underneath the cell being edited

414396

after i have upgrade to the latest versioning of java mail the reason of the error became clear it was a javax.net.ssl.sslhandshakeexception which was not thrown up in the old versioning of the lib

414409
put	get
i put both details in the same file so users dont have to download multiple files to get their map working it could become time consuming and seem complex

subtraction	modulo
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

414780
public	protected
visibility determined by access modifiers private protected public

414803
getter	setter
the reason for using a setfield method approach rather than properties with getter and setter is so that it is easier for code to actually set these fields in a generic way without resorting to reflection or switch statements

414838
ssl	https
i think the value with be https for location.protocol if you are on ssl

414919
wordpress	joomla
there are also various modules plugins for various cmss drupal plone joomla wordpress etc. that you can use to add socnet functionality to a site

414934
innodb	myisam
this gives you back a lot of raw performance that you would otherwise lose when moving tables from myisam to innodb

414934
innodb	myisam
likewise if you have some tables that are near 100 write you may benefit from insert delayed but that is only supported in myisam the delayed clause is ignored for an innodb table

414968
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
try bufferedreader and bufferedwriter to speed up processing

415064
stdout	stderr
when it runs it creates three pipes to redirect the console s stdin stdout and stderr

415064
stdout	stderr
it then finds its own name usually devenv.com replaces the .com with .exe and launches the new app devenv.exe using the read end of the stdin pipe and the write ends of the stdout and stderr pipes as the standard handles

415091
multiplying	add
now you have a custom operation pressing the program key or which one you ve assigned to it will run the sequence without your further assistance and will multiplying the content of the display with 2 and will add 1 - this is a program

415142
udp	tcp
if that happens look up the port numbers one udp outgoing and one tcp incomming and unblock them

it creates an empty dictionary in map and an empty array in list

415639
mbunit	nunit
mbunit is totally compatible with nunit so you could still use tests you ve already written with nunit

post	get
for example you could serialize both forms and then concatenate them and send the result to the server via post or get

415735
submit	submission
i can t test if the concept work right now but i believe that you could use jquery to achieve that its submit function will intercept all form submission on any tab something along these lines

415740
ant	maven
there are ant tasks to use maven features from ant

415740
ant	maven
and you can call ant from maven

416053
button	checkbox
originally it was intended to group together a very small set of related components usually checkbox or radio button

416114
ant	maven
i have no experience with maven but we ve managed to get ant to do everything we ve wanted on multiple platforms just by virtue of the fact that you can extend it with any java program to do special tasks not included with the ant application itself

416146
feedback	review
if your developers experience of unit testing is low then they need feedback on how they should be doing it whether that is in the form of a code review or some other mechanism

416148

width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the main difference between quirks and standards compliance mode is a different box model which results in different ways of calculating sizes based on width height padding margin and border settings

416318
width	height
in standard compliance mode the effective width and height of a box is calculated by adding all these parameters please search the web for more details

416318
width	margin
then do the math to determine the correct width settings so that the sum of all widths includung padding border and margin

416340
keydown	keyup
by the time keyup or keypress is triggered the default for keydown has already happened

416365
post	get
post is not cached by default but get often is as it should be idempotent

416395
fiddler	charles
addition to other tools mentioned here i often find great help in having a proper debugging proxy - fiddler free windows only and charles commercial cross-platform are great ones

416484
put	get
for large binaries in addition to the version number i tend to put a record count and crc the reason being that large binaries are much more prone to get truncated and or corrupted over time or during transfer than smaller ones

416492
goto	break
you can t jump out of two loops with a single break instruction but you could use a goto to jump from the inner loop right outside

416595
versioning	upgrade
our average project will grab source from svn add the revision number to the versioning and build grab the database scripts and upgrade or rebuild the database and deploy to either a webserver zip it up for emailing or even create an iso for it

416625
aggregate-functions	sum
99 of the time the group by clause is an exact copy of the select clause minus the aggregate-functions max sum etc.

416673
try-catch	exception-handling
if you really want to catch exception-handling and die slightly nicer you can put a try-catch block around the application.run call and work from there

416681
try-catch	exception-handling
maybe whoever came up with the requirement doesn t understand that you can still catch all exception-handling at the top without putting a try-catch in every single function

416743
kde	gnome
you might want to look what desktops like gnome and kde give you

416798
websphere	ibm
a possible path for linux systems is opt ibm websphere appserver lib wsanttasks.jar

416898
goto	break
goto break_iterate_rows is just a visible version of break iterate_rows

416917
boost	allocator
if you used the boost containers with a custom allocator you d suddenly have to deal with the possibility that the pool the container is allocator from could go empty thus eliminating the purpose of the allocate at startup rule

416947
awt	swing
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components

416981
maven	pom.xml
if you allow omitting of both the version of the parent and of this pom.xml iff maven is able to access the parent pom.xml by the relative path you are done

416984
websphere	ibm
high-end messaging buses like ibm s websphere mq do purport to offer exactly once delivery

417006
icomparable	compareto
using existing sorting constructs icomparable won t work well because you need more information than is available to the compareto method

417007
vb.net	vb6
this contains vb6 compatibility functions the my namespace features as well as some compiler helper functions and is commonly referred to as the vb.net runtime

417012
awt	swing
the evolution of the swing paint system section from the painting in awt and swing article explains the difference between lightweight and heavyweight

417012
jlist	jtable	awt	swing
the advantage of swing is that it has many more components available such as jtable and jlist which are more graphical and extensible than the components provided in awt allowing for more graphics-rich applications to be developed

417017
letter-spacing	word-spacing
edit ok so the css letter-spacing property as well as the word-spacing property will allow me to control the space between letters words

417039
int	double
the types being generics instead of int would be perfect floats double ushorts etc and making it easy to expand to n number of keys is important too

417095
awt	swing
just a suggestion elaborating on what bruno advised one pattern for taking advantage of the excellent java 1.5+ concurrency utilities without breaking swing is to have your executorservice do all the heavy lifting as bruno said but once that is done the executorservice thread should hand off the interaction with the actual ui components to the awt thread in a runnable using one of

417119
profiling	instrumentation
i m not familiar with dottrace but i have used the visual studio 2008 instrumentation and profiling tools in the context of visual studio and i believe they are distributed with .net 3.5 sdk

417139
min	max
however once given a function you can possibly devise a sorting method for that for a b above order the list thusly without applying the function to any items â œmax min next max next min

417141
letter-spacing	word-spacing	letter-spacing	font-size
or some combination of letter-spacing word-spacing and font-size

417207
testcase	fixture
also you have a setup method in a testcase that allows you to create a fixture that is used by all tests

417214
versioning	upgrade
since we ve upgrade versioning of the ajaxcontroltoolkit it seems to render differently

417220
gridview	detailsview
i tried to google on setting trigger that is inside detailsview and gridview but i haven t come across any post regarding how to do it

417224
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
if you really want to try and use reflection sqlconnection has a sqlinternalconnection this in turn has a property of availableinternaltransaction which returns an sqlinternaltransaction this has a property of parent which returns the sqltransaction you d need

417262
uiview	subviews
i also tried to add the openglview as a subviews of a basic uiview previously added to the navigationbar but i received the same error

417276
gif	png
i have a situation where i m loading some content using a urlloader but the content could either be a video flv or swf an image jpg or png or gif or a swf

417342
multiplying	subtract
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

417372
post	get
however i do have a way to get to the second tab - just a small variation on the eval statement from my original post

417409
superclass	subclassing
three separate tables with some common columns usually copy-and-paste of the superclass columns among all subclassing tables

417418
equals	gethashcode
to make these useful in a hashtable or dictionary you will likely want to provide overloads for gethashcode and equals

417448
pop-up	dialog
for example if you try to send some data and the data transport class throws a connectionbrokenexception you can pop-up a reconnect dialog and try to reconnect

417450
serializable	deserialization
one advantage i particularly appreciate is the seamless object serializable and deserialization

417454
tostring	gethashcode
they also implement gethashcode and tostring and so forth and lots of smallish helper methods

417506
serializable	deserialization
it sounds like you want a c++ version of java s serializable deserialization

417509
unsigned	short
note however if you are using this for serialization the unsigned short int pointer is not going to point at anything useful when you deserialize it unless you are very careful to use some sort of method to convert pointers into offsets and then back again

417640
pull	push
the action controllers are pretty boring - they pull values out of forms and urls call a few methods on model classes to actually perform the action and push the results out into the view

417643
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
what changes in quirks mode depends on the browser firefox opera safari and google-chrome implement a limited set of quirks like removing the space for text descenders in code like solution

417684
inherited	subclassing
if you only need to point to any product not any model then the solution is to have a product model that all products inherited from television and camcorder are both subclassing of product and give your offer model a foreignkey to product

417703
int	chars
for example i have a file with whitespace-separated data of which i only know that there are x int then y chars and then z more int

417708
width	height
the latter takes a height and width and setting each to zero.

417710
hide	show
show the throbber before the code is run and hide it after

417742
int	double
an object consisting of only a 32-bit int and a 64-bit double -- 96 bits of data -- will require two words for the object header one word for the int two words for the double

417742
int	chars	int	double
this is because sun is relying on a relatively simple tactic for memory alignment issues on an imaginary processor a chars may be allowed to exist at any memory location an int at any location that is divisible by 4 and a double may need to be allocated only on memory locations that are divisible by 32 -- but the most restrictive alignment requirement also satisfies every other alignment requirement so sun is aligning everything according to the most restrictive location

417795
firefox	safari
works beautifully in firefox safari etc

417806
vb.net	vb6
i was a straight vb6 developer when i started transitioning to vb.net

417806
vb.net	vb6
re-did a couple of small applications that i d previously written in vb6 and vb.net in c# and just went on from there

417876
unix	aix
i am on a aix unix box so i am using vac compilers - no gnu compilers

417966
getter	setter
just recently i also thought about handling getter and setter the way you suggested the second approach was my favorite the private props array but i discarded it for it wouldn t have worked out in my app

417968
versioning	upgrade
it will be a major upgrade to the current ctp 2.0 versioning and will basically give you the same functionality to automate firefox and ie as versioning 1.3.0 offers for automating ie

418030
post	get
this means that in some cases like checking for a get or post parameter using isset is enough to tell if the variable is set because it will either be a string or it won t be set

418146
hazelcast	terracotta
i m planning to implement this idea with hazelcast i love its super-simple api or terracotta which i never used - but i m aware of their sweet spot medium-term data

418148
vb6	vba
vb6 might be a good idea here given it s similarity to vba

418169
trojan	virus
the only service.dll i know of is a trojan virus

418198
submit	submission
if you have multiple forms on a page with all kinds of input elements and a button of type submit then hitting enter upon filling any of it s fields will trigger submission of that form

418214
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
assuming you don t want the superclass itself to represent an entity you can use mappedsuperclass on the superclass to have subclassing inherited the properties for persistence

418219
redmine	trac
trac redmine et al

418236
width	height
using the height and width css attributes or the height and width attributes will scale the image but it ll still download the whole thing

418238
innodb	myisam
well if you have the ability to use innodb tables instead of myisam then you can use transactions

418253
width	height
instead of using css you should do a basic width height check on your server side and if it goes beyond a certain threshold use html javascript to resize the image

418255
firefox	safari
at any point in time i have firefox 3 ie6 ie7 and safari win open on my pc checking all my work

418273
width	height
edit if you want a usercontrol that takes up the entire viewport remove the width and height from the usercontrol tag

418277
int	double
int double etc 0

418297
vmware	esx
vmware esx citrix xenserver and

418297
vmware	esx
vmware r esx server virtual appliance

418302
width	height
if you don t want to go all the way to resizing the actual image file and want to maintain the proportions of the image then you can interrogate the image for its sizes height and width then multiply them by a required factor to fit into your div

418302
width	height
for example if you have a 1024x768 image and want to put it in a div that is 800 wide you know the width will be 800 and the height will be 768 x 800 1024 600

418302
width	height
then when displaying your image you can set the height and width properties as required

418347
gmp	bigint
math bigint gmp 1.24

418347
put	get
this is all in an attempt to get net sftp working to put a file on a remote host

418381
stdout	stderr
it is better not to pollute stdout and direct your debug output to file or to stderr

418434
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
the repeater and listview allow you to control the html the gridview is a total black box in this regard and generates atrocious html while avoiding the tedious server-side code that comes with the control ok new row

418437
rss	feed
pretty much every rss reader - major or minor - will update the feed url when it encounters a 301 redirect

418491
post	get
you can use cgi if you re with passing parameters only via get or post

418532
integer	unsigned
you might use any unsigned integer type you like but you should choose one which is likely to correspond to the word size of your architecture

418577
post	get
if you post which os and web server you are using i m sure someone here will post you a working cgi script within minutes if you get stuck

418599
cruisecontrol	teamcity
the only thing i would add is that you should be hooking up svn with cruisecontrol or teamcity to drive a continuous integration process

418735
profiling	debugging
follow the user scenario what your user will be doing and see how it will touch your code often this means debugging it other times profiling and other times it simply means thinking about the scenario - whatever points in your code get touched by the user those are the highest priority to write tests against

418751
hide	show
you can hide show the main menu bar by pressing ctrl+f11

418795
gridview	repeater
the only problem is clearly that with a simple repeater you must write more code to do the work that gridview does natively

418806
profiler	visualvm
the latest version of the sun jdk includes visualvm which is essentially the netbeans profiler by itself

418899
stdout	stderr
redirects channel 2 stderr standard error into channel 1 stdout standard output such that both is written as stdout

418917
for-loop	arrays
what you need is a double for-loop that check for occurrence of each char in one string in another and copy the non-occurring chars into a third char arrays which is your result

418930
vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6
that looks like vb6 vbscript not vb.net but i might be wrong

418934
int	chars
in c i ve decided it will be a pointer to an array of ascii int which we call chars

418938
interpreted-language	compiled-language
many other compiled-language such as c++ have a lot of simple looking instructions that can turn into much more code than you think it does virtual functions copy constructors etc.. and interpreted-language like java or ruby have another layer of instructions that you never see - the virtual machine or interpreter

418989
inherited	properties
if you only need access to it on the server side you can easily create a server control that inherited the checkbox control and add a properties to it called value which can be set and retrieved from the server side

419025
int	chars
if you re using a dos print routine such as int 21h with ah 9 you can print a carriage return chars ascii 13 without a subsequent newline chars ascii 10 to return the cursor to the beginning of the current line

419041
free	malloc
you have to call free passing it the address you got from malloc manually if the time has come to do so

419088
hash	md5
take a look at the following link the example gets an md5 hash of a supplied image

419088
hash	md5
md5 hash of an image

419094
google-chrome	firefox
the thing is it works fine in ie7 firefox and google-chrome the problem only comes up for ie6

419098
rational-numbers	floating-point
to calculate that you ll have to use the floating-point type mpf_t or the rational-numbers type mpq_t

419153
free	malloc
thus is neither must be managed as with malloc free nor do you have to worry about the address being reused as you would with an auto definition

419157
hide	show
i would like a simple way for the users to hide show some of the timeseries in the displayed chart component

419198
free	malloc
the main difference is that when you call malloc you take your memory from the heap and any memory taken from the heap must be free from the heap

419198
free	malloc
in this case the free is correct because p points to a memory location on the heap which was allocated by malloc

419218
hide	show
the show hide works fine but i can t figure out how to set it so that if the mouse is over the div it wont hide

419221
post	get
the authnrequest is usually compressed encoded and passed as a url parameter in a get while the simplest way to return the response is via the post binding - return an html page with a form whose target is the service provider and which is submitted at page load time via some javascript

419248
client-side	server-side
you would have to use ajax as a client-side script cannot be invoked by server-side code with the results available on server side scope

419327
hash	md5
to interact with an external data feed i need to pass a rolling security key which has been md5 hash every day we need to generate a new md5 hash key

419328
pop-up	dialog
having it pop-up the vista security are you sure dialog would be allright but the process cannot be marked with uiaccess otherwise it won t interact properly with the rest of the system and it will in 98 of cases be run by users without rights to elevate to administrator

419342
getter	setter
all the properties getter setter and common methods are created automatically which really saves time and money

419344
curlpp	libcurl
i ve heard of libcurl curlpp ptypes rolling my own just using the .net api and been told a bunch of times

419346
post	get
if you don t have experience with or need ajax then just stuff your data into a post get and send the data back to your page

419350
getter	setter
oh and using getter and setter as they are used in java in php is considered not a good idea

419392
union	distinct
then i check to see if i m grouping data properly making sure that distinct s and union s without union all don t remove necessary duplicates

419396
hash	md5
my high-end workstation can calculate well over 100k md5 hash of a 10-byte data segment in a second

419444
kde	gnome
for many linux desktop systems gnome kde etc. a freedesktop s systray protocol is implemented

419446
gtk	motif
wx is a cross-platform gui and tools library that supports win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince and more

419466
getter	setter
the first beanwrapperimpl uses the setter getter methods of a java object while the other set the fields directly

419469
pull	push
the basic idea is to reverse the pull model of and turn it into a push model with observers - each part of the pipeline effectively pushes its data past any number of observers using event handlers which typically form new parts of the pipeline

419511
robocopy	xcopy
what about xcopy or robocopy

419532
cfstring	nsstring
so to see how nsstring or nsnumber is implemented under the hood follow the link above and take a look at cfstring and cfnumber respectively you ll need an apple developer account but registration is free

419590
gif	png
the web favors gif jpg and png mostly

419600
gif	png
the png portable network graphics file format was created as the free open-source successor to the gif

419600
gif	png
the png file format supports truecolor 16 million colours while the gif supports only 256 colours

419600
gif	png
gif is good for illustrations when you do not wish to move to png

419602
gif	png
examples of lossless image compression is png and gif

419602
tiff	bmp
tiff and bmp are both wrapper formats as the data inside can depend upon the compression technique that is used

419614
tiff	bmp
bmp and tiff probably are not good candidates for web applications

419617
gif	png
web browsers at the moment only display jpeg png and gif files - so those are the ones that can be shown on web pages

419652
folder	directory
i set up a website and i created a folder names docs in the website as virtual directory with some documents

419668
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort or heapsort and the

419698
post	get
edit can t really get the proper formatting i want for this so post

419717
mbunit	nunit
mbunit also has collection assertions similar to nunit assert.collections.cs

419743
realloc	malloc
otherwise you have to malloc the buffer and store its size which would make it possible to realloc on overflow.

419758
submit	submission
if you want to submit a form on click of button instead of enter then no need to use input type submit instead of this you can use input type button and set a onclick function in this like input type button onclick my_func and in the definiton of this function my_func you can use document.formname.submit for submission the form

419787
ubuntu	linux
download vmware and an ubuntu virtual machine ubuntu is a popular linux distribution from the vmware site

419868
pop-up	dialog
the strange thing is that the window pop-up tries to load show the file dialog and then you hear the sound like a pop-up window has been blocked although pop-up blocker is deactivated

419869
kde	gnome
linux kernel kde perl ruby on rails android wine fedora x.org mediawiki django vlc mono gnome samba cups gnupg emacs elpa.

419885
public	protected
bear in mind that all protected methods become part of the public api so if you change things later you will break other people s code

419890
nant	xmlpoke
instead you could have one master config and using regex xmlpoke nant your-favorite-text-manipulator to massage the file at build deploy time to insert the right values for each environment keeping the settings for all environments in another file but crucially all together

419920
disk	ram
my workstation is a core 2 quad with 8gb ram and raid 0 and raid 1 hard disk running vista x64

419933
width	margin
the same thing happens with the width and a horizontal resize showing a margin to the right

419977
post	get
ok so to post a short update thanks to the two helpful answers i ve managed to get the right format and encoding

420013
move	drag
when i just drag the file from one package to the other all references get updated and the file is move around on the filesystem

420039
cpu	processors
the power of the mainframe lies not in it s cpu grunt the individual processors aren t that powerful but they come in books of 54 cpus with hot backups and you can run many books in a single system z box but in the fact that all the cpu does is process instructions

420103
google-chrome	firefox
however ie firefox and google-chrome all fail to redirect to the new resource

420164
hazelcast	terracotta
again what i want to accomplish is something like described here and i would love to have some more feedback on ideas concerning the actual implementation why use terracotta instead of hazelcast use serialization or deep cloning via reflection or whatever else and also the major drawbacks of an approach like this - eg

420169
free	malloc
you could malloc a to the size you want just remember to free it afterwards

420180
notepad++	bbedit
it s very seldom that i want to edit something on mac win and for that any decent editor is enough bbedit notepad++

420207
post	get
redirect after post or post redirect get is something your application must do to be user friendly

420228
comparator	comparable
comparator is from the comparable interface

420240
treemap	treeset
this is implemented as part of the interface and the typical use is to define one or more small utility classes that implement this to pass to methods such as sort or for use by sorting data structures such as treemap and treeset

420242
comparator	comparable
comparator is a method of the interface comparable so it is used to compare this instance to another one

420251
comparator	comparable
if you are implementing your own classes which you know you want to compare at some stage you may have them implement the comparable interface and implement the comparator method accordingly

420255
comparator	comparable
comparable which has comparator requires the objects to be compared in order to use a treemap or to sort a list to implement that interface

420256
comparator	comparable
the method comparator is a method that you are obligated to implement if you implement the comparable interface

420298
udp	tcp
besides all the others nice and correct answers this article gives a good understanding about the differences between tcp and udp

420433
accessor	properties
i know that this is standard procedure for a struct the backing field for any properties must be assigned directly and not via the properties s set accessor from within the struct s constructor

420485
post	get
i ll give some of the sample linq queries a shot and see if i can integrate them with our code and then get post my results

420488
nsstring	nsdata
nsurlconnection is good if you want to get data from the web service into an nsstring or nsdata

420555
hide	show
this way when we are in dev or qa we show the toolbar but in production we hide it

420566
profiling	debugging
no there isn t - at least not without using a profiling debugging api of some description

420644
post	get
see your web server logs for the exact error message you get then post it here and perhaps we could offer you a better solution

420679
accessor	properties
there are pros and cons to having properties that act as config settings accessor

420722
int	chars
nb this just needs to handle simple chars int decimal fields nothing fancy

420774
for-loop	loops
now i know i could recode this to add a boolean flag variable or traditional for-loop but i am wondering if there s any way to find out if a foreach loops is on the first iteration of its looping

420783
versioning	upgrade
even if i have the old versioning it upgrade it

420791
super	extends
but if it really did belong it would make sense to extends that super class

420792
cpython	ironpython
related question what are some strategies to write python code that works in cpython jython and ironpython

420801
versioning	upgrade
if that doesn t i would upgrade the jdk to use a more recent versioning of 1.6

420830
put	get
we had the budget for tfs and even the hardware to put it on but with our team only being 5 people going through the work to get tfs up and running didn t seem worth it

420843
hash	salt
the reasoning being that the hash now maps not to the original password but a combination of the password and the salt

420843
hash	salt
in the etc shadow the hash passwords are actually stored with the salt

420843
hash	salt
for example a salt of foo and password of bar would hash to this

420843
hash	salt
if a hacker somehow were able to get his hands on this file i don t see what purpose the salt serves since the reverse hash of te5sbm.7c25ffdu6birbx is known to contain foo

420843
hash	salt
to summarize what i understand the salt makes the hash password more complex thus making it much less likely to exist in a precomputed rainbow table

420889
hash	salt
if someone has a list of millions of pre-computed hash they aren t going to be able to look up 1 foo te5sbm.7c25ffdu6birbx1 in their table even though they know the hash and the salt

420893
hash	salt
however if we salt the password and it becomes foolegolas the hash will be different so the dictionary attack will be unsuccessful

421081
hash	salt
as you ve pointed out the attacker has access to both the hash password and the salt so when running the dictionary attack she can simply use the known salt when attempting to crack the password

421081
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
without a salt i could compute md5 attempt 0 and then scan through the file to see if that hash shows up anywhere

421081
salt	md5
if salt are present then i have to compute md5 salt a

421081
salt	md5
attempt 0 compare against entry a then md5 salt b

421145
min	max
the following functions are supported count sum min max avg stdev var

421147
hash	salt
in the etc shadow the hash passwords are actually stored with the salt

421147
hash	salt
you always have to store the salt with the password because in order to validate what the user entered against your password database you have to combine the input with the salt hash it and compare it to the stored hash

421147
hash	salt
without salt she would have to precompute 100 000 hash

421150
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the change did not seem to have any negative side-effects in firefox 2 or 3 opera 9.63 or safari for windows 3.2.1

421211
firefox	safari
ie7 firefox safari anything but ie6

421239
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
and since you asked about languages other than .net in java i would use an illegalargumentexception in the general case - perhaps a good old nullpointerexception if the argument is null

421254
single-sign-on	shibboleth
it has also pretty much been mandated that we use shibboleth single-sign-on to handle the authentication

421260
ienumerable	iqueryable
how linq to objects and linq to xml ienumerable are different from linq to sql iqueryable

421353
pop-up	dialog
i have an asp imagebutton that is supposed to pop-up a save dialog when clicked

421353
pop-up	dialog
when i put it outside the updatepanel it works fine but when i put it inside the updatepanel the dialog does not pop-up

421368
organization	naming
if i m reading unfamiliar code i tend to look for organization patterns naming conventions consistent logic etc

421386
union	distinct
a union can be deceptive with respect to result set ordering because a database will sometimes use a sort method to provide the distinct that is implicit in union which makes it look like the rows are deliberately ordered -- this doesn t apply to union all for which there is no implicit distinct of course

421392
filesystems	ntfs
i don t know if ntfs has similar semantics although i ve heard that it s losely based on bsd s filesystems so maybe it does

421397
width	height
you can use percentages to set width and height also but this is also difficult sometimes

421434
base	fractions
there s a fractions and an exponent where the final value of the float is fractions base exponent

421439
post	get
the hazard is that you may want to signal an error if you receive a get when you expect a post

421439
post	get
typically get is reserved for viewing and post is reserved for making changes create update delete operations

421497
opera	safari
in opera and safari esp

421503
post	get
php will have both the post and get information available to it in the usual ways when the form is submitted

421566
minimum	max
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

421582
pop-up	dialog
to make a link that pop-up the add bookmark dialog in opera 9.x use the following

421604
qtreewidget	qlist
then i remove an item from my qlist items and i try to clear reset the qtreewidget

421618
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu 8.10 or centos

421636
post	get
and of course you can get a pre-configured image with mono here go to the bottom of the post for details on using that

421653
free	malloc
or malloc some memory for the new name and don t forget to free it...

421664
memcpy	strncpy
you could also use memcpy instead of strncpy as you want to just copy some bytes

421666
free	malloc
you need to allocate some memory for it using malloc and remember to free it when you re done or in this case you can probably simply declare it as a character array

421733
post	get
i create two overloaded actions in the controller one to render the input form using an http get and the other to process the form post using an http post

421733
post	get
if it s successful there s a redirect to another action which avoids the duplicate posting warning on browsers if a user refreshes the page - see post redirect get on wikipedia and this blog entry by stephen walther

421803
put	get
then put all known converters into a map and get happy

421848
jquery	scriptaculous
i m surveying a wide array of web frameworks and the majority don t mention security as an issue on their websites eg scriptaculous jquery prototype rico

421864
disk	ram
high cpu can often be solved by more ram and a better disk config

421956
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
once set up this makes it trivial to test on ie6 7 and 8 various firefox flavours konqueror opera safari etc.

422014
maven	pom.xml
we use maven so we only check in the code the tests config files and of course the pom.xml no libs no tools

422019
union	distinct
if you want the distinct list of teams you have to select from the game table twice union the home and the away teams theoretically one team could play all its games on the road or at home if you have logic that prevents that then you could adjust this query

422019
union	distinct
the union operator will make sure you only get distinct elements in the return set unless you use union all

422039
subscript	superscript
on the other hand an i with a hat on top and a subscript d and a superscript is rather confusing.

422060
getter	setter
i ve not worried a whole lot about javabeans but i have found that following basic javabean conventions has been very helpful for me in the past basically using standard getter and setter for properties

422060
getter	setter
bound properties are properties available through standard getter and setter which fire propertychangeevents when they change

422060
getter	setter
be aware also that standard getter and setter can be very non-standard through the use of beaninfo classes to define a javabean s exact interface but i never use that either. the main other javabean convention that i choose to follow or not as appropriate in each situation is a no-argument constructor

422071
ant	maven
if you use java better choice would be ant and maven - they have a lot of code behind them.

422071
ant	maven
but as for me you have to be a little brainf ed to program in xml so i often use rake for many task and invoke it from ant maven like that

422078
mouse	keyboard
selection with the keyboard works perfectly just not with a mouse

422135
folder	directory
you can run crossftp client and choose tools - synchornize directory to compare your local folder and the remote folder

422157
stdout	fflush
edit as swaroop mentioned this doesn t work i m guessing raw_input fflush stdout

422188
sorting	filtering
note that these wouldn t be the entire uris for example the uri to list the movies would support filtering paging and sorting

422208
uiview	subviews
you just need to size this uiview appropriately and add your uilabel as a subviews of it to get the effect you desire

422219
inherited	properties
i have inherited a class in vb.net and when i create the object i am only seeing one of the inherited public properties in intellisense

422220
post	get
although i don t get why using the different http methods is better then just using just the normal get post and using a url structure like

422220
put	get	post	put	post	get
also the amount of operations you can perform on a node is undefined whereas using your current method you can only perform a set amount of methods get put post delete

422220
post	put
if i am missing something have not dealt with rest before then please let me know why it is better to use the http methods thus limiting your operations and not feeling right with defining a difference between put and post over the conventional method

422229
multiplying	multiplication
well your multiplication by scalar is wrong - you should multiplying variance by the square of d

422329
ant	maven
we are a maven shop and previously an ant shop

422343
range	infinity
i ve used symbolic values for positive and negative infinity in dealing with range comparisons to eliminate corner cases that would otherwise require special handling

422343
range	infinity
if you have values for positive and negative infinity that respectively compare greater than and less than all other values you don t need to do any special handling for open-ended range

422372
folder	directory
and obviously the contents of the machine-level config directory get version-controlled in a different repository or a different folder structure from your app

422401
post	get
i ve also looked at this blog post but either i couldn t get it to work or it wasn t meant to solve my problem

422420
kerberos	ntlm
the webserver just needs to be configured to support windows authentication which will be ntlm or - better - kerberos if both client and server are w2k or later

422420
firefox	safari
edit looks like firefox has some support for this too and safari on macos

422440
factories	presenter
but what about using the domain object factories in a presenter layer

422473
kerberos	ntlm
windows uses ntlm or kerberos to authorize the user against a central service typically active directory on the windows platform

422535
getter	setter
for example if you have event handlers or you wanted to simulate private properties with getter setter you might do

422557
width	height
once you know or think you know what the monitor s diagonal size and physical aspect ratio are then you you can calculate it s physical width and height

422557
width	height
this puts the physical width at 13.27 and the physical height at 10.62

422557
width	height
draw a box on the screen and have the user press the up and down arrows to adjust its height and the left and right arrows to adjust its width until the box is exactly one inch or centimeter square according to their ruler

422596
versioning	upgrade
the best versioning of this framework is the one in the colloquy irc client as it has been upgrade to use pcre 6.7

422602
post	put
i forgot that only worked for the first insert - i do have an update trigger as well to update the date fields and put a copy of the updated record in my history table - which i would post .

422650
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the autoreleases you mentioned don t actually make any sense all you re doing is creating a mutable copy nsmutablestring that s properly autoreleased but since you re casting it to an nsstring there s no practical difference then just saying

422690
subtract	add
if it makes sense to add and subtract to from primitive types then you should write a constructor that constructs the object from the primitive type

422691
children	parent
if you have a parent datarow and want to navigate to children in table2 it will be a pluralized method row.gettable2rows

422744
dictionary	map
a rainbow attack is essentially a more efficient dictionary attack it s designed to use the low cost of digital storage to enable creation of a map of a substantial subset of possible passwords to hashes and facilitate the reverse mapping

422744
hash	salt
if you use no password salt at all your hash are vulnerable to pre-computed hash tables someone with access to your hash would thus have access to the passwords for a large percentage of your users however many used vulnerable passwords which would be a substantial percentage

422744
hash	salt
if you use a constant password salt then pre-computed hash tables are no longer valuable so someone would have to spend the time to compute a custom hash table for that salt they could do so incrementally though computing tables which cover ever greater permutations of the problem space

422784
put	get
in the code below i m trying to load some images and put them in the stage as soon as they get individually loaded

422788
fflush	gets
it would help explain lots of performance issues - parser s slow because there s lots of branches and pipeline gets fflush very easily branch predictor cannot compensate for everything

422822
udp	tcp
most networked games don t use tcp but udp for communications

422822
udp	tcp
with tcp there are a number of interactions between the host server to guarantee data in an ordered manner another thing you have to account for using udp the fact that data is not ordered

422826
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
use the avaudioplayer from the avfoundation

422851
udp	tcp
the difference between tcp and udp should not account for 200 ms but a combination of other factors can

422852
post	get
if you tell me how to get xml to display i ll post it. note the passworddecryptionadvisor it only matches the setpassword method

422900
onfocus	onblur
var _2 ondijitclick _onclick onmouseover _onmouseover onmouseout _onmouseout onfocus _onmouseover onblur _onmouseout

422963
folder	directory
i m using the following command to remove every .dummy directory in a folder named test folder

422972
gif	png
if there was a better compression algorithm than jpeg gif png etc

423013
firefox	safari
i have checked this against ie firefox and safari

423058
gif	png
however once you took the new uber-comic-image format and emitted a png jpg or gif the color information would be subject to the rules of the png jpg or gif compression mechanism and you d lose all the benefit of your new image format

423070
actionscript	mxml
i don t like the way it feels different when i am using actionscript vs mxml

423073
put	get
you can put this inline but the doubly-nested function starts to get harder to read

423102
udp	tcp
we regularly use tcp and udp connections to pass info from services to other exes and in some cases msmq

423168
ninject	spring.net
namely autofac mef ninject spring.net structuremap unity and windsor

423214
codeigniter	kohana
the 1 controller to 1 view works well for me in the php mvc frameworks zend codeigniter and kohana

423256
firefox	safari
the gwt debug browser uses the native browser on your machine so ie on windows safari on mac firefox on linux

423263
free	malloc
you need to use delete w new or free w malloc to free the memory on the heap

423284
udp	tcp
i would recommend first working with tcp rather than udp

423284
udp	tcp
udp doesn t automatically redeliver lost packets like tcp so it will add another element to the equation that will probably just confuse you as you re just starting out

423307
min	max
a very simple way to detect the blowing sound might be to just count up all the samples that are at the min max values and if they represent more than 5 of the total or some other threshold assume that blowing is occuring

423362
folder	directory
i have a directory on a windows machine with a large number of files and folder that i need to watch and have the files mirrored synced instantly or as near to as possible to a linux machine over the local network

423399
tostring	gethashcode
have fun implementing isystemobject on all of your classes so that you have access to tostring and gethashcode

423420
free	malloc
the caller would have to know you malloc d it and then call free

423427
coalesce	nvl
you may also have to play with nvl or coalesce to convert nulls into zeroes

423469
firefox	safari
duplicated in firefox 3 and safari

423558
strdup	malloc
strdup char allocates memory the malloc for array i is not necessary

423560
strdup	malloc
also as kauppi has pointed out strdup will allocate memory for you so you don t need to do malloc on each string

423570
free	strdup
as the other have posted - there was unused size and strdup allocates memory by itself and it is nice to free the memory afterwards.

423673
m2e	pom.xml
i ve got m2e plugin installed and there s no problem syncing compile time dependencies that appear in pom.xml

423683
m2e	pom.xml
i have found that any time you update a project s pom.xml it helps to rerun m2e or it will not see the new external dependencies

423688
affinity	processors
the fact the processing is stuck to a single processors shows that the process is doing something that is not multi-core aware or someone has set it s thread affinity to 1

423728
width	height
screenbounds x 808 y 908 width 62 height 29 system.drawing.rectangle

423733
rss	feed
currently generating rss feed of podcasts in the itunes music store does not appear to be supported

423733
rss	feed
you can generate a limited set of rss feed for information in the itunes store but podcasts are not included

423733
rss	feed
you can generate these feed using apple s itunes music store rss generator

423734
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the mouseenter one you will know and can ignore the usercontrol s mouseleave event

423734
mouseleave	mouseenter
then when the child s mouseleave event fires check for the usercontrol s mouseenter again

423760
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can also loop through all the child controls recursive on your control and attach a mouseenter and mouseleave event to them as well

423761
affinity	processors
on a dual quad-core getprocessaffinitymask or the dialog from set affinity in taskman.exe will report eight logical processors

423910
integer	fractions
so in short it does much more than convert a string to an integer applying specific rounding rules to fractions short circuting unecessary conversions etc

423919
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
that works perfectly fine on safari and firefox but when i try to click the link on ie7 and opera it does not even hit the server

423937
pop-up	dialog
visually you can either have it in a new pop-up or integrated into the list but actually it ll be only added to the list on the next try to add or acknowledge the parent dialog

424003
sorting	filtering
a fabricated ado recordset can be a good choice of container object for data as an alternative to a vba type struct collection dictionary etc strongly data typed nullable fields with built-in support for filtering sorting searching output to formatted text xml array paging cloning etc

424016
children	parent
i m pretty certain that the children are being loaded on-demand when i expand the parent going by the response time

424074
client-side	server-side
the problem is not on the server-side but on the client-side

424105
vb.net	vb6
the library must be able to be accessed from a wide range of languages including vb6 c++ vb.net and c#

424141
public	protected
beside #define private public you can also #define private protected and then define some foo class as descendant of wanted class to have access to it s now protected methods via type casting

424296
udp	tcp
tcpview is a windows program that will show you detailed listings of all tcp and udp endpoints on your system including the local and remote addresses and state of tcp connections

424307
translation	localization
however i plan to integrate it a bit into kde in future and here come the problems with localization translation

424308
accessor	properties
if you re not entirely comfortable with that write a properties accessor on the page that acts as a facade to retrieve the value from the viewstate

424309
16-bit	64bit
and if 8 capabilities isn t enough for you it s trivial to change the tinyint 8 bits to a smallint 16-bit capabilities int 32 bits or bigint 64bit which should be more than sufficient for just about any application most of us are likely to write

424356
x86	64bit
c program files xxx on the 32-bit dev enviroment or c program files x86 xxx on the 64bit dev environment

424389
prng	random
edit i really should be correct and refer to this as a pseudo random number generator or prng

424407
google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure what pitfalls there are to avoid and i am not currently able to test implementations in any other browsers than internet explorer 8 google-chrome and mozilla firefox 3

424424
pull	push
it s a pull based parser instead of the push you are currently using

424427
inherited	properties
what you want to do is inherited a class from windowsformsapplicationbase setting the protected issingleinstance properties to true

424547
put	get
so then the only merge i ever need to do is to get a bug fix out of trunk and put it on the latest build branch and re-release that branch

424625
installation	upgrade
software is supposed to require admin rights for installation including update upgrade

424703
accessor	properties
the syntax is straightforward following the same principles as properties accessor

424739
spweb	spsite
i ve looked at spsite and spweb but neither seems able to do quite what i want

424764
sorting	filtering
i thought that would apply the sorting filtering etc

424835
min	max
the naive algorithm is too loop and update min max

424835
min	max
however a recursive solution will require less comparisons than naive algorithm if you want to get min max simultaneously it isn t necessarily faster due to function call overhead

424848
hash	md5
the most reliable way would be to make md5 hash of all the local files you care about and store it in a file

424848
hash	md5
so the file will contain a list of filenames and their md5 hash

424862
rss	feed
i got lucky with a blog post that came through an rss feed referring to a tutorial that lead to the right manual

424889
min	max
the quickest query response to the min max request will always be from a sorted array because as others have mentioned you simply take the first or last element - giving you an o 1 cost

424925
min	max
if you want to find both the min and max at the same time the loop can be modified as follows

424984
cpu	processors
having dual or quad cores is just the beginning there will be systems with a much higher number of processors in the near future currently there are cpu with 256 cores windows 7 will have support for such processors

424991
vsto	add-in
i ve written a vsto add-in for word 2003 which is working correctly

425011
accessor	properties
if i don t need a special accessor and the instance variable isn t used outside the class i ll just refer to it directly rather than declaring a properties

425058
tiff	png
tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs

425058
tiff	png
83k using imagemagick convert to go from original tiff - png - tiff again to double-check that imagemagick is producing both file formats and ensure that my original program didn t do a bad job producing the tiff but only because tiff uses 8bits pixel grayscale and png uses 24bits pixel rgb

425061
x86	64bit
as has been stated the 64bit jit compiler behaves differently to the x86 jit compiler

425062
awt	swing
swing components should always be manipulated on the awt event dispatch thread edt

425124
post	get
if the value has no security concerns pass it via the get or post method

425160
sudoku	crossword
it reminded me of a crossword or sudoku where you know how things are related but you can t definitively assign something until you work out what its dependant parts are

425211
free	malloc
the function free can only be called on memory that was allocated with malloc

425214
free	malloc
you need to have malloc d something for it to be able to be free d

425234
firefox	safari
did not test with firefox safari etc

425251
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
you could try valuememberchanged validating selectedindexchanged or textchanged

425308
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
currently it s showing the value of scrollwidth which is reported as 1540px by ie and 920px by firefox safari opera etc

425350
superclass	subclassing
in the code we d probably make all of these entities subclassing of an entity superclass

425355
width	height
for a cross-browser experience its either scroll width height or offset width height whichever is greater

425357
hide	show
then in my main user control applications rootvisual i just show hide each user control when needed

425361
mouseleave	mouseenter
hooking all the controls mouseenter and mouseleave events then figuring out if it is still inside the form is pretty painful

425429
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome konqueror - all display it properly watchbot can

425443
put	get
that is doing a get delete head or put on a resource more than once is the same as doing it only once

425467
setinterval	settimeout
probably the best way to handle this is to use setinterval instead of settimeout

425467
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
like settimeout setinterval returns an integer which can be passed to clearinterval to cancel the processing

425490
hash	salt
just use ssl and hash passwords using a salt

425583
wan	lan
my suggestion to you is that if there is no performance problem for example when the service provider is on the lan not wan or the data is relatively small it s worth it to send 100 post requests to the server

425630
actionscript	mxml
adobe has an free alpha release of flexbuilder for linux i thought it was quite unstable when editing mxml files but if your doing strict actionscript work you may find it useful

425662
minimum	max
for these you should set a minimum time to your estimate and make it clear you don t know what the max is

425670
chown	chmod
file permission tools are also a must for getting a system working - look into chmod and chown and how those commands work

425682
width	height
this would create two panes windows that take up 50 of the height but span the entire width of window

425748
public	protected
you should never have to test private methods because only the public or protected methods of the same class will ever call private methods

425921
jython	jacl
because oracle has a built in jvm you can develop stored procs in java but also in non-java-languages that use the jvm that means languages like jacl jython scheme and groovy

425925
ironruby	ironpython
.net covers many languages c# vb.net ironpython ironruby delphi.net even on the same solution

425987
try-catch	exception-handling
my idea is throwing an exception-handling but operation is really complex so should i put try-catch to all of my functions or is there a more generic way pattern

425989
google-chrome	safari
here s the easiest way to fix this issue for both google-chrome and safari if you have multiple web apps

425989
google-chrome	safari
now the asp.net menu will render correctly in safari and google-chrome

426138
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
you generally can only optimally have 1 thread per cpu but unless your application has some explicit thread affinity to one processors then yes windows will assign these threads to a free processors

426161
width	height
if you run this the trace statement should display the height and width of the drawn sprite which is randomly generated

426161
width	height
in other words you can get the height and width of the sprite simply by querying its height and width properties

426182
ienumerable	icollection
i ve read a couple of blog post mentioning that for public apis we should always return icollection or ienumerable instead of list

426196
width	height
alertview.frame cgrectmake x y width height

426248
filtering	grouping
use the having clause to filtering grouping

426248
filtering	grouping
in the above query where filtering for rows matching a condition and having filtering for grouping that have at least five count

426248
filtering	grouping
evaluate having conditions against grouping filtering out grouping that don t match

426252
free	malloc
for example you can write a library which implement malloc and free

426252
free	malloc
and by loading these with ld_preload your malloc and free will be executed rather than the standard ones

426255
fast-forward	merge
ideally your local branch should merge fast-forward only no merge commit is generated

426267
maven	pom.xml
maven install plugin has command line usage to install a jar into the local repository pom.xml is optional but you will have to specify the groupid artifactid version and packaging all the pom.xml stuff

426275
inherited	properties
i would have your view specific view models inherited from a common base view model then have a properties on this base view model that gets set in your controllers

426330
mvp	presenter
model view presenter seems to suit wpf quite well if you ve not heard of it before check out the supervisor controller pattern which is a subset of mvp the author has renamed it to supervisor controller and passive view as two different flavours of mvp

426357
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
no need to buy a 3rd party ftp library ftp is built into .net ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse

426384
pop-up	dialog
however the dialog box doesn t pop-up here is the download.php script

426404
unix	aix
lf multics unix and unix-like systems gnu linux aix xenix mac os

426417
post	get
if you want to pass the data using post instead of get you can do it using a combination of php and javascript like this

426456

sorting	filtering
linq s supposed to be used to make filtering sorting aggregating and manipulating data from various sources as intuitive and expressive as possible

426903
for-loop	loops
if the outer for loops are doing nothing but controlling a count then your nested for loops are simply a more complicated way of iterating by a count that could be handled by a single for-loop

427040
multiplying	multiplication
for example you could define an infix multiplication operator as follows where multiplying x y is already defined

427045
codeigniter	cakephp
some frameworks like symfony cakephp akelos codeigniter and others have support for scaffolding

427100

i m relying on memory here but i recall getting this error once after copying settings between different config files and the only problem was that i d overwrite an extra angle bracket when pasting

427101
for-loop	loops
expanding on michael burr s answer if the outer for loops are doing nothing but controlling a count then your nested for loops over n counts are simply a more complicated way of iterating over the product of the counts with a single for-loop

427146

427253
draggable	droppable
have a look at the jquery and more specifically jquery ui since it has draggable droppable sortable and a variety of other complex components

427257
getter	setter
having a trivial getter and setter is very similar to using a public field

427257
getter	setter
the main argument for preferring getter and setter over properties used to be the uniform access principle but since c# has properties is easy to replace a public field with a property and recompile

427274
alloca	malloc
the deprecated alloca routine like malloc but uses the stack

427284
opera	safari

it returns an array where you can get top and left array values. the fix was that i have to trap for ie6 and just subtract some fixed number 12px in my case for top and add that same number on height

427377
min	max
note that soviut s explanation of limit is not quite correct - it s offset number of rows rather than min max

427388
alloca	longjmp	alloca	malloc
the linux man-page for alloca notes that for certain applications its use can improve efficiency compared to the use of malloc and in certain cases it can also simplify memory deallocation in applications that use longjmp or siglongjmp

427397
powerpc	thumb
also if you can choose the architecture of the target device going with something like a modern arm with thumb v2 or a powerpc with vle or mips with mips16 or selecting known-compact targets like infineon tricore or the sh family is a very good option

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
but for safari and opera i tried the linkrel css hack technique and it failed -- firefox was loading and interpreting the opera and safari stylesheets when i thought it might fail on the linkrel tag

430689
opera	safari
so i had to switch it to an inline css and use an import url call but that failed because opera and safari wouldn t interpret the import url call

430689
opera	safari
well the current arrangement in the file below works but it means that the stylesheet for opera and safari is loading with all browsers it s just not interpreted except by opera and safari

430689
opera	safari
i d like to know how to get the linkrel or the import working for opera and safari instead

430697

for most browsers including internet explorer navigator firefox and opera the supported and sanctioned way of doing this is to use dde

430730
post	get
i solved the problem with post redirect get but i believe the tutorial has some merit and perhaps tony marston can elaborate on it

430730
post	get
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

430746
rss	feed
i see you have already gone and made yourself a module so this may no longer help but it is fairly easy to get a view to expose an rss feed which might be an easier way of getting at the content especially if you want to include it on a different site

430810

i have a capistrano deployment recipe i ve been using for some time to deploy my web app and then restart apache nginx using the sudo command

431925
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for

431925
sudo	passwd
the cap shell is just hanging waiting for more output and does not allow me to type my passwd in to complete the remote sudo command

431925
sudo	passwd
i did not want to remove the sudo passwd prompt of my remote user for web restart commands

431963
nant	xmlpoke
nant has xmlpeek and xmlpoke tasks which allow you to update xml files

431990
put	get
get on your clients sponsors good side - delivery a win even if it s a somewhat stable very very small release - and then put in change management control what gets requested

432018
firefox	safari
this works for all the major browsers safari firefox ie

432027
post	get
on the other hand if you can get away with using post json is a really good way to pass this kind of information back and forth

432069
perforce	cvs
xcode only supports subversion perforce and cvs

432069
bazaar	git
however there are also distributed version control systems out there such as mercurial bazaar and git

432079
free	malloc
believe it or not it can be faster than using malloc and free

432083
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
you use key-value coding or if you implement a subclass dot syntax or accessor methods to set those properties

432134
distance	polygons
with it comes a large collection of polygons line and distance calculation tools that can even take into account the curvature of the earth s surface if need be

432137
rss	feed
as an example of what revolutiontrigger said i most often use http auth on rss feed for sites that use form-based auth simply because many rss readers can do http auth but can t do form-based auth

432139
folder	dir
in order to get around this you have to move the build dir to another location so that xcode won t try to import it or manually add the discrete folder of a project one by one

432144
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but it fails in ie on the following line

432158
jquery	scriptaculous
there s jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools dojo and many others

432214
equals	gethashcode
don t forget that if you do override equals you really should override gethashcode also or you may get unexpected results if you are using your objects in a dictionary for example

432303
lisp	scheme
they adopt scheme which is a variant of lisp as the programming language

432306
lisp	scheme
if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme

432309
haskell	ocaml	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml
if you start with common lisp or ocaml or erlang or especially haskell you will most likely get scared and you will feel lost for different reasons

432316
pull	push
for promotion to production we have another script that pull down all the production data and then runs rsync to push up changes

432323
post	get
the easiest solution is sending data using post instead of get

432355
goto	break
you need some statement either break or goto

432366
goto	break
however if you omit the break you must replace it with another other control transfer goto case 1

432380
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you ll need a delegate data-source class for your picker view - something that implements the protocols uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource

432380
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
the class should have three instance variables - an nsarray soundarr to contain the sounds an nstimer timer to provide a delay after selection before the sound plays more on that below and an avaudioplayer audioplayer to play the selected sound for which you ll need to import the avfoundation - it s only available in 2.2 as sound playback used to be a lot more complicated

432463
width	height
currently i do this by rendering the scene to a texture that is twice the width and height of the screen

432567
boost	stl
debugging with gdb any c++ code that uses stl boost is still a nightmare

432567
boost	stl
use checked debug stl boost library such as stlport

432575
erlang	lisp
i hop you chose erlang or lisp

432575
erlang	lisp
where should i go after erlang lisp and forth please leave a comment

432642
lisp	scheme
from what i know scheme is a simplified version of lisp think of it as lisp but with only the bare essentials

432643
lisp	scheme
i would start with lisp specifically scheme because it is simple

432664
easymock	jmock
then use a mocking library like easymock or jmock to assert that your hibernate-veneer layer is correctly called by your application classes

432731
width	height
canvas consists of a drawable region defined in html code with height and width attributes

432739
nginx	lighttpd
software - lighttpd memcache varnish nginx squid pound lvs eaccelerator etc

432749
apache	lighttpd
it is supported by lighttpd and apache with a plugin

432759
hash	salt
well a cryptographic hash shouldn t compromise security as long as it is salt and has reasonable complexity

432796
cfstring	nsstring
everyone has mentioned componentsseparatedbystring but you can also use cfstringtokenizer remember that an nsstring and cfstring are interchangeable which will tokenize natural languages too like chinese japanese which don t split words on spaces

432799
hash	md5
the main difference between this and basic is that digest is a challenge-response authentication whereas the client has to fulfill a challenge on every request and the response is just a md5 hash

432805
folder	directory
if your files are not accessible by the web server because the path is not in your web serving directory htdocs then you can make a symbolic link symlink to that folder in your web serving directory to avoid passing all traffic trough php

432817
opera	google-chrome
it looks like in both opera and google-chrome the browser is treating the area outside the browser s initial viewport as part of the html tag but not part of the body

432841
getter	setter
whenever i make an immutable object it doesn t have any setter or getter only one parametrized constructor and all fields are public like this

432844
int	boolean
the xor operator on two boolean is logical xor unlike on int where it s bitwise

432846
post	get
checkboxes are inputs and will come up like text inputs in your get or post array you re more likely to use post for this

432849
photoshop	fireworks
i m interested in people s opinions on the pros and cons or downright hell no s on designing websites in the browser and moving away from photoshop fireworks etc

432862
google-chrome	firefox
use google-chrome or firefox

432885
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it seems this is specific to firefox -- ie opera and google-chrome all throw exceptions for it

432919
google-chrome	firefox
i find that firefox and google-chrome work faster than ie

432979
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter is spaces so you don t need to change this with a delims arg

433022
accessor	properties
we ve got our basic entity model and we want to add certain business-level semantics to the default data accessor navigation properties etc

433033
textview	imageview
for controls -- like text boxes textview or images imageview -- this will wrap the text or image being shown

433083
apache	lighttpd
what you need to do is configure your web server itself iis apache lighttpd whatever to direct requests to a specific script or resource

433109
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i wouldn t make my own base classes to create a custom argumentexception argumentnullexception or invalidoperationexception

433116
multiplying	add
for each field in your object multiplying the current result by another prime number and add the hash of the field

433163
entity-relationship	diagram
as mentioned in another so question this programs has the capability to generate a simple entity-relationship diagram

433190
multiplying	add	multiplying	multiplication
so for example if say floating point add and multiplying instructions each have a throughput of 2 and a latency of 5 actually for multiplying it s a bit greater i think that means that adding a register to itself or multiplying it by itself will likely take two clock cycles since there are no other dependent values whereas adding it the result of a previous multiplication will take something like or a bit less than 2+5 clock cycles depending where you start finish timing and on all sorts of other things

433190
multiplying	add
during some of those clock cycles another add multiplying operation could be taking place so it s arguable how many cycles you actually attribute to the individual add mutliply instructions anyway...

433203
subtract	add
how do i add subtract etc

433219
boost	stl
note that the difficult to inspect structures are not only stl boost but also from other libraries like qt kde

433254
keydown	keyup
when i was trying to tackle the problem i thought about starting a counter on the keydown and resetting it on keyup

433257
division	multiplication
multiplication and bit-shifing should be faster than division but probably are not precise enough

433263
superclass	subclassing
i couldnt able to mock the protected varibale defined in the superclass.i could able to mock the protected method in superclass but couldnt to mock the protected variable in to the subclassing wherein am writing the testcase for subclassing please if anybody out there has any soluton for it .please reply

433283
profiling	instrumentation
so if you re developing a resource intensive application you should be using profiling tools specific to each os you re targeting like for example instrumentation on os x and of course test the performance in each browser

433371
width	height
maths101 question - does anyone know how to calculate an ellipse width height that will enclose a given rectangle

433371
width	height
it s for a gui so an aesthetically pleasing ratio of height width is what i m looking for

433384
nemerle	boo
languages supported on mono c# java boo nemerle vb.net pythonnet ironpython oberon php object pascal cobra component pascal delta forth dotlisp #smalltalk

433391
profiling	instrumentation
so if you re developing a resource intensive application you should be using profiling tools specific to each os you re targeting like for example instrumentation on os x and of course test the performance in each browser

433394
width	height
2 put a div with a pre-set height and change the width according to the value you want it to display

433408
vcard	vcf
pycocuma appears to have a vcf parser built into it and it ll generate vcard output

433422
onmousemove	onmouseover
it would be expensive to do serious programming on every onmousemove instance so you might find it better to create several zones around the page and poll for a onmouseover event

433426
cos	sqrt
x cos theta sqrt 2 rect.width + x.center

433426
sin	sqrt
y sin theta sqrt 2 rect.height + y.center

433494
profiling	benchmarking
if it s just used to check security once per request and cache various things i can t see how it s likely to be significant - but that s why you should profiling and benchmarking your app

433543
width	height
the site has 2 layout types vertical height width ang horizontal width height

433573
post	get
you can treat it the same as any regular get or post request

433573
post	get
without knowing any of the background i can t give a definitive answer on whether i would choose it but in general there is no reason not to use it just apply the same security you would use for http get and post requests like in regular form submissions

433594
tstringlist	tlist
if your array is no longer static you might want to consider using a tlist a tstringlist or one of the many container classes in the contnrs unit

433606
post	get
it has the same security risks as a regulat get and post it is just another format to send the data back and forth

433626
width	height
if you don t want the text to wrap and you don t want the size of the column to get bigger then set a width and height on the column and set overflow hidden in your stylesheet

433628
min	max
the idea of the program is that i should use functions to read an array of 10 elements then get the average of the elements then get the the max and min

433628
min	max
i ve got the max and min right but the average is showing weird stuff

433642
min	max
also your max and min functions have a loop like this

433651
multiplying	addition
you ve got some problems with counting starting with zero and multiplying before addition rules

433704
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu and anything else that s based on debian you do that like this

433712
calloc	malloc
try setting the nodes child property to null c doesn t automagically zero out memory so it looks like your may have garbage in child or your could use calloc instead of malloc

433715
int	chars
the x format specifier by itself says that the argument is an int and since the number is negative printf requires eight chars to show all four non-zero bytes of the int -sized value

433715
int	chars
now then you re only passing a chars so bare x tells the function to use the full int that got passed instead â due to default argument promotion for .

433722
debian	linux
ideally the tool would run on debian linux but windows os x is fine if necessary

433723
getter	setter
when you put logic in your setter and getter you make it harder to understand whats going on since many people will never look at its implementation

433723
getter	setter
if you disagree i urge you to look at every setter and getter implementation before you use it just to check if its not just a bean

433725
int	chars
what you see is the sign preserving conversion from chars to int

433725
int	chars
promoting such a chars to an int will preserve the sign and the int will be negative too

433725
int	chars
note that even if you don t put a int explicitly the compiler will automatically promote the chars to an int when passing to printf

433733
rpm	yum
source rpms also exist but how to get them depends on the high-level package manager used on top of rpm yum urpmi apt-get4 for rpm ...

433739
getter	setter
you keep the internal values in one measurement system but you convert from all others in the setter and convert back in the getter

433748
metaclass	subclassing
you can create a common base class that using metaclass logic enforces the convention that only variables that are declared when the subclassing is declared can later be set

433776
freebsd	linux
see for example the byteorder 3 manual page on a freebsd or linux system

433788
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
we have a cruisecontrol.net server running various antunit mbunit and nunit tests via ant

433788
mbunit	nunit
this works however mbunit outputs the tests in a different xml format than nunit and antunit

433788
mbunit	nunit
for example nunit seems to use testcase to signify a test result whereas mbunit uses run among other things

433821
superclass	subclassing
while javascript tends to allow anything and maybe such an example could be considered normal i don t really know in python this is mostly a negative byproduct of omission of type declaration which can help speeding up development - if you at some point change your mind on the type of a variable fixing type declarations can take more time than the fixes to actual code in some cases including the renaming of a type but also cases where you use a different type with some similar methods and no superclass subclassing relationship

433829
post	get
in regards to the custom skin there s a blog post from nina meiers that goes into a bit of detail on how to get a legacy skin to work in dnn 5

433895
int	chars
that is it appears that c chars literals are actually int

433915
int	chars
what the code did was to put the read chars into an int then test for eof then convert to a chars if it wasn t

433915
int	chars
i realize this doesn t exactly answer your question but it would make some sense for the rest of the chars literals to be sizeof int if the eof literal was

433925
innodb	myisam
with where the speed will be the same for myisam and innodb

433957
int	chars
which suggests that a chars is 8 bits like you suspect but a chars literal is an int

433959
puts	gets
a deep copy really gets the actuall values and puts them in a new field of the new object whilst a shallow copy only copies the pointers

433965
int	chars
protected.cpp in function â int main int chars â

433988
int	chars
impossible to use a chars value without it being promoted to int first

433988
int	chars
so making chars constant int in the first place eliminated that step

433998
int	chars
i don t know the specific reasons why a chars literal in c is of type int

433998
int	chars
having a chars literal being an int would make that impossible

433998
int	chars
note that in c++ literals having more than one chars still have type int although their value is implementation defined

433998
int	chars
so ab has type int while a has type chars

434012
put	get
thats why i prefer open apps this way you get more open people to whom yo can actually talk ask then questions propose new ideeas that actually gets implemented or at least put on an open todo-list thus you get some kind of evolution

434027
implements	extends
basically you want to use a meta tag here with attribute extends for a common base class or implements for a common base interface

434046
move	drag
drag selection - move text

434047
int	chars
edit just to be sure i checked my copy of expert c programming deep secrets and i confirmed that a chars literal does not start with a type int

434047
int	chars
it is initially of type chars but when it is used in an expression it is promoted to an int

434047
int	chars
chars literals have type int and

434047
int	chars
particular chars and short become int

434060
int	chars
i haven t seen a rationale for it c chars literals being int types but here s something stroustrup had to say about it from design and evolution 11.2.1 - fine-grain resolution

434060
int	chars
in c the type of a chars literal such as a is int

434062
int	chars
this is only tangential to the language spec but in hardware the cpu usually only has one register size -- 32 bits let s say -- and so whenever it actually works on a chars by adding subtracting or comparing it there is an implicit conversion to int when it is loaded into the register

434062
int	chars
the compiler takes care of properly masking and shifting the number after each operation so that if you add say 2 to unsigned chars 254 it ll wrap around to 0 instead of 256 but inside the silicon it is really an int until you save it back to memory

434075
jpql	hql
don t write sql if you can help it use hql or jpql is on java ee whenever possible

434079
erd	diagram	erd	entity-relationship	entity-relationship	diagram
also you should generate entity-relationship diagram which are useful additions to database documentation though erd s don t tell the whole story either

434085
memset	malloc
many of the standard c library fwrite memset malloc functions have direct equivalents in the windows api writefile fillmemory zeromemory globalalloc

434102
ant	maven
well it s much more verbose then ant but pure maven

434171
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
for example if you have a uiviewcontroller and add a uinavigationcontroller as subview you must add this code to the uiviewcontroller if you want viewwillappear animated to be called when uinavigationcontroller.view appears

434203
vsto	add-in
using vsto i could build an add-in which could be used to edit the application where i would convert to and from docx

434277
post	get
here is why suppose you have a model that does handle your requests get or post

434277
post	get
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them

434278
debian-based	linux
pdftk is included in debian-based linux distributions and perhaps others as well

434286
xcodebuild	xcodeproj
i know xcodebuild install -configuration can compile our xcodeproj from terminal without launching from xcode however the compilation files are under ios but not in the iphone simulator

434292
min	max
also remove the border from the window and remove the min max close buttons so you do not have any chrome showing

434351
hide	show
i m not familiar with the flickr method you reference above but generally the approach to these sorts of things is that you show the gif before you make the call and then hide it when the call completes

434377
gif	png
first - go here and create a spinning gif or png -

434413
stdout	stderr	system.in	system.out
i would guess that the reason is to be backwards-compatible with posix c c++ standard i o in which stdin stdout and stderr the c c++ equivalent of system.in system.out and system.err respectively are byte streams

434424
mouseup	mousedown
imagine a custom view where the mousedown mousedrag and mouseup methods are overriden so the user can drag a point nsrect on the screen

434458
actionscript	mxml
there are two different compilers one that is used for compiling actionscript code to avm bytecode and another mxmlc that compiles mxml files into actionscript code which is then in turn compiled by the first compiler

434526
jlabel	jseparator
for this reason it is a good practice check jgoodies on the web for more details in swing guis to not use titledborders but rather separate groups of components in a jpanel by a jlabel followed by a horizontal jseparator

434529
typedef	struct
for example typedef extern and function prototypes are all declarations while things like struct int and function bodies are definitions

434564
division	multiplication
multiplication and division would accumulate that error faster but it would still take quite a while

434565
ironruby	ironpython
i m not sure which is more mature at present between ironpython and ironruby but both are now supported by microsoft people

434584
bazaar	git
a distributed decentralized version control system solution will suit your needs git bazaar mercurial darcs.

434666
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
i don t understand why ilist implements ienumerable taking in consideration that ilist implements icollection that implements ienumerable also

434681
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
basic addition subtraction multiplication and division are the first things that come to mind

434691
ienumerable	ilist
ilist only implements ienumerable by associaton

434691
ienumerable	icollection
it implements ienumerable precisely because it inherits icollection which is ienumerable

434691
ienumerable	ilist
in the same way ilist is ienumerable

434694
google-chrome	firefox
when run it logs hidden on firefox but visible on google-chrome

434697
ienumerable	icollection
i assume you want to know why it declares that it implements icollection as well as ienumerable when the first implies the second

434697
ienumerable	icollection
i suspect the main reason is clarity it means people don t need to look back to icollection to check that that already extends ienumerable

434703
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
on firefox and safari it works properly but just doesn t work at all in ie and opera

434711
websphere	ibm
websphere app server ah ibm bless their little hearts has changed what it does

434740
subtract	add
you may also choose to store tenths of a cent ie 4090 or some other constant fractional precision. you will be able to add and subtract an infinite number of times without losing precision

434753
disk	ram
if you have just hit your ram limit you ll be probably able to hear the disk working and a system activity monitor will tell you that

434771
post	get
this just sets up a get but you can do a post with file_get_contents as well

434786
boost	stl
as others have already suggested life is much easier if you use a container -- especially an stl container -- and smart pointers -- which for now means pointers out of boost

434805
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
if you were to open the code in resharper it would indicate that the ienumerable interface declaration on ilist wasn t required as it is already specified via icollection

434808
ssl	https
for this we use svn over ssl https

434855
mouse	keyboard
touchpad mouse in built in the keyboard

octal	decimal
some other answers suggesting using parseint inside the function to convert the octal value to decimal

434962
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i get security exception when using system.net.webclient to do http requests which is due to the fact that crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml on the target server are either missing or are too restrictive

434983
profiling	debugging
the commercial oxygen xml editor has a feature for profiling and debugging xslt files

435000
put	get
higher values decrease the space overhead but increase the lookup cost reflected in most of the operations of the hashmap class including get and put

435021
cpython	ironpython
however jython instead is even slower than cpython while ironpython is not faster than cpython even if it runs on top of an efficient vm with jit-compilation for instance

435082
folder	dir
added this is how the source control structure looks the deployed app would just have the config dir with no sub folder or course

435098
min	max
i could write a set of classes each representing a single validation regexvalidation with its pattern property lengthvalidation with it s min and max and so on

435098
min	max
they will have a dictionary that maps arguments names to their values so that lengthvalidation will have items with keys max and min and regexvalidation will have items with keys pattern and so on

435128
ready	each
additionally you need each validator object to return the cleaned ready for use by the database value

435131
profiler	gprof
- some profiler if you can get it to work i ve done profiling with netbeans gprof even oprofile but i was never able to make it work with eclipse - it s anyway more complicated to do profiling than in netbeans

435131
ubuntu	linux
- maybe on linux i d like rpms for gcj-compiled versions of eclipse like ubuntu and redhat provide

435182
interpreted-language	forth
if you want a very fast interpreted-language look at forth

435233
innodb	myisam
if you are on myisam switching to innodb if you can - it has no full text indexing opens up more options for this sort of thing as it supports the transactional features and row level locking

435336
cvs	svn
an important reason to use svn rather than cvs is svn supports binary diffs

435382
entity-relationship	diagram
as bill said you certainly need an entity-relationship diagram

435410
button	checkbox
another alternative would be to have a checkbox whose value is the id of the member being approved that the admin can select for each member to be approved and a similar one for reject and one each approve reject button for the entire form

435420
children	parent
i m using an orm sqlalchemy but my question is quite implementation-agnostic to model a many-to-many relationship between a parent class and its children

435427
junit	testng
my advice is simply ditch junit and use testng

435427
junit	testng
once you get used to testng junit looks like stone age

435564
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
in principle you need to configure the sorting at the data source whether its an objectdatasource or a sqldatasource not at the gridview

435579
udp	tcp
they are checking the datagramsocket as well to check if the port is avaliable in udp and tcp

435605
boost	stl
maybe not the sort of tip you were looking for but i have to say that my experience after a few years of moving from c++ stl to c++ boost stl is that i now spend a lot less time in gdb than i used to

435685
nsbezierpath	nsimage
the view s drawrect method draws some content nsimage s nsbezierpath s and nsstring s on the view but leaves parts of it transparent

435685
mouseup	mousedown
clicking on the regions of the view that have been drawn on invokes the usual mouse event handling methods mousedown and mouseup

435685
mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mouseenter
this appears to only add support for mouseenter mouseexited mousemoved and cursorupdate methods not mouseup and mousedown

435719
google-chrome	firefox
edit google-chrome and firefox do not have this issue

435799
min	max
i realize how to put values and expression in the max min and the gridline interval fields although its more of a question what expressions i should put there

435831
vb.net	vb6
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net

435842
vb.net	vb6
in case you were able to migrate it to vb6 you can use the code advisor to see how you can fix your project to be compatible to vb.net then you can migrate to vb.net in case it success you can use this tool to convert it to c# or the reflector

435948
vb.net	vb6
there are applications out there that do a rather good job migrating from vb6 to vb.net

435949
hide	show
first you can use tree.setrootvisible true to show the root node or tree.setrootvisible false to hide it

435954
mbunit	mstest
mbunit and mstest have timeout attribute

435965
nsstring	nsobject
for example cocoa defines things like nsstring and nsobject

435999
folder	directory
your newly created jar should be in your project directory s dist folder

436032
lisp	smalltalk
you can write a complete high performance os in a high level language like lisp or smalltalk with only a few minor parts in c

436064
rss	feed
for example is it possible to update the url of the rss feed in the following snippet

436076
awt	swing
swing or awt which are the java ui toolkits both handle events - check out the official swing event tutorial for examples

436093
rss	feed
different modes of presentation in web apps are increasingly popular these days rss atom feed json or ajax responses wml for handheld devices etc

436094
bash	tcsh	jline	readline
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shells such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

436147
getter	setter
you can still have private variables but if you want methods defined on the prototype to have access to them you should define getter and setter on the this object which the prototype methods along with everything else will have access to

436154
firefox	safari
it works on safari but in firefox i just get an almost-empty page with nothing but the following text

436169
pop-up	dialog
i don t think enabling anonymous access would make sense here since i want access to the website to be password protected pop-up username password dialog when you first navigate to the url

436206
google-chrome	safari
webkit has a few bugs that prevent our software from running in this browser and safari google-chrome etc

436206
google-chrome	safari
most bugs are related to standard compliance so i expect safari and google-chrome to copy the patches once webkit accepts them

436211
int	double
value types int double object

436302
fitnesse	mbunit	mbunit	nunit
it seems like fitnesse is yet another testing framework like nunit or mbunit or any of the others because you define inputs and outputs that you want to see but it seems to be aimed at testing the application as a whole rather than as units

436322
post	get
so if you have 80 blog post that s 1 query to get the list of blog post then 80 queries to get the comments for each of them

436346
post	get
one query to select the post ids you want then another to get all the comments for that list of post ids

436397
free	malloc
allocate with malloc a sufficient buffer which then becomes your problem to free

436400
boost	stl
i am a quite capable gdb user but stl and boost easily crush my debugging skills

436408
fitnesse	mbunit	mbunit	nunit
the difference between nunit mbunit and fitnesse is that nunit mbunit are intended to be used for unit tests while fitnesse is for acceptance tests

436417
firefox	safari
this is currently supported in ie safari and firefox 3.1 alpha

436438
vb.net	vb6
theoretically you could convert vb5 to vb6 and then vb6 to vb.net and then vb.net to c# but that just sounds crazy to me as i type it

436440
vmware	esx
we have both the full blown esx for virtual servers and the vmware workstations for development testing

436442
fink	macports
i wouldn t use macports or fink for any critical apps

436442
fink	macports
perhaps it s just me but i ve had about a 50-50 success rate in installing apps using macports and fink

436494
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
i ve used vmware when the company would pay for it vmware server when the company would not virtualbox because it s free decent and supports snapshots parallels on the mac which i bought and xen

436503
google-chrome	firefox
currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

436513
int	chars
the code below compiles but has different behavior for the chars type than for the int types

436535
division	multiplication
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus

436535
integer	unsigned
the code below assumes that you want to divide an unsigned 32-bit integer by three and that you c compiler knows about 64 bit integer numbers note even on a 32 bit cpu architecture most c compilers can handle 64 bit integers just fine

436535
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

436535
division	multiplication
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

436604
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it could be any number of things but i suggest you start with your viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods as well as viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear

436628
int	chars
while most integral types like short and int default to being signed chars does not have a default signage in c++

436628
int	chars
it s a common mistake that c++ programmers run into when they use chars as an 8 bit int type

436655
mouseover	mouseout
i think the best approach would be to leave the hover behavior as a fall-back for non-javascript users and then use jquery to create mouseover and mouseout event handlers to create a different effect for javascript-enabled users

436666
firefox	safari
while this works like a dream for us in firefox and safari it explodes with delight in ie 6 and ie7 with the error object doesn t support this property or method

436742
implements	extends
given a class bar that extends class foo which implements interface deedum

436742
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
in other words bar doesn t inherited accessor from foo and can t override properties

436747
hide	show
so it can check a condition and then decide to show or hide a section

436758
inherited	subclassing
you are hiding the inherited variables with ones defined in the subclassing

436802
int	chars
the type signed chars was introduced to make available a one-byte signed int type on those systems which implement plain chars as unsigned

436823
punctuation	words
they are used for respectively hyphenation and joining words indicating a range punctuation and a mathematical symbol

436912
paradox	bde
you can change the default location of the .net file if you go into the bde administrator in the control panel and go into configuration - drivers - native - paradox and change the path to somewhere that is writable my documents for example

436942
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are three options

436945
width	margin
on column2 setting a left margin of the width of the image + the amount of separation you want for example 160 should work but you can play with it then making the width of the column2 100 of the remaining width should prevent your overlap

437024
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
it s free and you can install ubuntu or debian linux on the simulated arm core

437050
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i m most comfortable with mbunit for unit testing and cruisecontrol.net for ci so right now they are the front runners

437075
mouseleave	mouseenter
essentially i m going to create the linklabel from a textblock and handle mouseenter mouseleave and mouseleftbuttonup events

437177
queue	fifo
yes if the reader and writer interact with the fifo queue from different threads

437194
width	height
if you are okay with horizontal vertical blinds just append a bunch of divs and animate the width height

437258
hex	binary
looks like it converts the binary source of clr stored procs as some kind of hex encoded text

437265
getter	setter
if adding a setter and getter to a class exposes information not meant to be exposed you should consider friends if you can t find your design being faulty using friend is valid

437265
getter	setter
if you can add a setter and getter without that being destructive to the interface then you should avoid making other classes friends

437296
perforce	svn
version control systems like subversion svn perforce or clearcase are centralized version control systems

437296
bazaar	git
git mercurial bazaar and also darcs monotone and bitkeeper are distributed version control systems

437296
bazaar	git
git has git-svn bazaar has bzr-svn and mercurial has hgsubversion extension

437296
bazaar	git
i know mercurial and bazaar only from their documentation various discussion on irc and mailing lists and blog posts and articles comparing various version control systems some of which are listed on gitcomparison page on git wiki

437301
cvs	rcs
if you have a backup of your repository the actual rcs files on the server on tape you could just restore that folder on the cvs server to the state it was before

437328
versioning	upgrade
it may be that you re using an older versioning of mysql and need to upgrade it

437402
post	get
it s complicated to get right so see the instructions on using manifests from shawnfa s .net security blog for the .net 3.5 beta and post ga .net 3.5

437416
wtl	atl
or is wtl or atl the big thing

437416
wtl	atl
for vs 2008 it s vs + mfc atl wtl qt....confusing for me since i don t know much about them

437426
wtl	atl
you can use wtl atl win32 or any number of libraries to create apps without mfc

437464
adplus	cdb
adplus attaches the cdb debugger to a process in crash mode and will generate crash dumps for most exceptions the process generates

437467
versioning	upgrade
most server platforms iis or not are capable of being installed on a windows box for exactly this reason among others. in fact non-microsoft server platforms are usually less demanding about windows versioning and configuration because they don t have any stake in having the host upgrade to a more expensive license

437475
folder	directory
eclipse sets the working directory to the top-level project folder

437478
for-loop	loops
so for example if you have a loops instead of using a for-loop use a while loops make sure the scope of loops variable is at the form level

437481
hide	show
so you need to show hide it inside every dialog independently

437496
lisp	smalltalk
the upshot of being a library is that code contracts will work for any .net language c# vb.net f# ruby python javascript lisp smalltalk boo you name it

437530
binutils	bfd
bfd library does what you want and the kitchen sink which is the main component of several binutils tools

437580
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
i believe that calling tostring equals and gethashcode result in boxing if the structure does not override the methods

437631
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it displays them in safari os x firefox 3 windows and google-chrome windows ie displays all the divs in a big stack in the corner.

437722
executable	upx
i m not sure how to strip the executable but another thought is to compress it for example using upx which will decompress it and run it in place.

437763
int	chars
note however that if the function takes arguments that are subject to normal promotions in the absence of prototypes for example a function that takes a chars or short - both of which are converted to int

437794
serializable	deserialization
depending on your language of choice this might mean manually writing a serializable deserialization function from scratch

437808
ironruby	ironpython
other options i m looking at are python ironpython ruby ironruby powershell and maybe vb but i m not sure about the ease of implementation with vb

437830
int	chars
on most systems the address of the string will get pushed on the stack and then m as an int assuming it s an int short chars

437859
opera	safari
it also works for opera and safari too

437868
public	protected
further does the scope public protected private etc. of said method change the above answer 1

437874
apache	nginx
i need to do a rewrite with nginx from blah ... 3275 to id 3275 if the second file exists otherwise i want to hand it off to apache

437903
getter	setter
pointless testing testing the same basic case more than one way or testing things so trivial that they really do not need to be tested like auto-generated getter and setter

437912
pivot-table	crosstab
crosstab pivot-table workbench

437918
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions count max min sum avg has to run through all the entries in a column regardless

437927
post	put
on top of that i could really use some help detailing how to take the post data and put it in a cookie in php

437945
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions count max min sum avg has to run through all the entries in a columns being summed regardless.

437960
public	protected
checking parameter validity is clearly more important for all public functions than protected or private

437960
public	protected
i will often dispense with checking for certain private methods although you take the risk that someone maybe you makes then protected or public someday and you also skip the chance to catch a data inconsistency one step closer to the source

438057
mergesort	in-place	quicksort	mergesort
you can usually only get 2 of these at once - quicksort gets you 1 and 3 mergesort gets you 2 and 3 and an in-place mergesort gets you 1 and 2

438096
debian	linux
debian linux has a really awesome tool called pbuilder which creates an image of a freshly installed system and then attempts to build your code

438100
put	get
most of the articles i have read involving the industry suggest that someone with no professional experience looking to get break into gaming should put together a portfolio of small games you have written demonstrating your abilities

438112
jruby	mri
to do this i want to use rails on on mri - not jruby or rbj

438116
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview is bound to a sqldatasource object

438136
width	height
here width alerts fine height alerts fine but offset alerts object object in firefox

438145
client-side	server-side
if you re using asp.net validation controls they have a client-side portion and a server-side portion

438145
client-side	server-side
the gist here is that asp.net validation controls can be set so they don t do anything client-side but they still provide validation server-side

438189
button	checkbox
i ve got a form with a bunch of checkbox on it and i d like to provide a check all link button

438300
gridview	repeater
you will have much more control using a gridview object rather than a repeater and you will never have that kinda of problems because rendering the gridview will always came with the table tags

438320
jobs	cron
this will allow you to schedule jobs in a cron like fashion

438381
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i ve tried doing this in viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear with no success

438454
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
for firefox there is the firebug extension safari webkit has web inspector opera has dragonfly and for the internet explorer there is the internet explorer developer toolbar

438461
versioning	upgrade
to make matters worse because of contractual limitations it is not always possible to upgrade the clients to the latest and greatest so we must branch fix test and release on the versioning they currently have yielding yet another versioning number

438509
post	get
this won t help in the short term but voting on the ms connect post for this issue may get things changed in the future

438526
vmware	virtualbox
i would suggest creating a virtual machine in vmware virtualbox whatever with these specifications in terms of ram and diskspace and then do some experiments

438566
ssl	https
one of the sites has an ssl certificate installed and was running fine on https

438566
ssl	https
the problem i have is that when i publish my app from vs2005 to the site with ssl the https urls stop working and i can only use http

438602
lisp	smalltalk
pps if i had to give up smalltalk lisp or haskell would be my second choice but both do not offer ide s which are anyway near to what i am used to these days

438635
free	malloc
malloc and free and other memory-related functions are weak symbols which means that you can simply reimplement them and your versions will be used

438635
free	malloc
if you compile a shared library with malloc free and friends you re all set

438637
cvs	svn
hundson is easy to install and comes with a trac plugin svn cvs git plugins and a doxygen plugin and others for almost anything you can think of

438689
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
but as a programming excercise and seeing that you work with c++ you will need to override the global new and delete as well as malloc free and realloc

438689
realloc	malloc
you d think that only overriding new and delete would be enough but the std string and other classes are likely to use malloc and especially realloc

438695
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode result in

438704
sorting	filtering
i wanted it to be fairly easy to use in other places and didn t feel like hardcoding the sorting and filtering into query expressions so i looked for a way to build the expressions dynamically and the best way to do this i found was with dynamic linq

438738
icomparable	compareto
or you can inherit schedule_payitem from icomparable and implement compareto and then just call m_equipmentlist.sort

438768
pascal	delphi
.inc - delphi pascal include files

438891
folder	directory
if your host is running apache you can secure folder using .htaccess on iis you can do the same through directory security

438953
width	height
i ll probably use swfobject to render the flash but i need the width and height

438976
fflush	gets
in addition if the output buffer gets too big it will fflush anyway

438986
lisp	smalltalk
1 smalltalk s rpn-like control flow by messages is like lisp - it s regular and cool but weirds people out

439040
openscenegraph	blender
i would start by looking at blender or the viewer tools from ogre openscenegraph and similar tools

439049
button	checkbox
my suggestion is to use a checkbox instead of a button

439076
button	checkbox
thus after the page is reinitialised the first click of the button will enable all checkbox

439076
button	checkbox
if i clicked this button with all checkbox checked i would expect it to behave consistently regardless of how those checkbox got to that state which should be irrelevant

439076
int	boolean
and asides from the fact that we re hopefully getting rid of this variable it ought to be a boolean rather than an int as it only has two states.

439120
pop-up	dialog
with basic authentication ie pop-up the usual pwd dialog but i want to skip this dialog

439125
cvs	svn
we are migrating from cvs to svn and as far as i can see svn does not have checkout hooks

439178
doc	rtf
doc -- pdf html txt rtf

439198
width	height
you can then get height width using

439215
doc	rtf
main goal is to output rtf document but doc would be nice too

439286
jquery	simplemodal
so i ve been able to get greasemonkey and jquery 1.2.6 to work together without issue but now i m wondering how to embed additional jquery plugins into my greasemonkey script such as eric martin s simplemodal plugin

439286
jquery	simplemodal
the following code gets jquery loaded but i m not sure how to get simplemodal loaded properly

439292
inherited	properties
you can add a onfailure option in the option list as the ajax.periodicalupdater inherited the properties of ajax.request

439313
width	height
perhaps you should also give the user the option to manually enter the width and height for each swf as well as the option to auto-detect from swf bytecode

439313
width	height
i mention this because swf files are mostly designed to be embedded in html and the stage size flash lingo for dimension of the swf is not always intended to be the embed size for that piece of content - some swfs are designed to automatically resize their contents to match how they are embedded within html so the actual stage width and height for these swfs might be irrelevant

439373
width	height
probably the simplest in a general sense is to get a reference to the image object and inspect the width and height properties

439492
vmware	virtualbox
i ve never run vmware in vmware but i ve run virtualpc inside virtualbox without problems so there s no fundamental reason it shouldn t work i suppose.

439553
google-chrome	firefox
note it works fine in firefox 3 and google-chrome

439580
xlsx	xlsb
i need to support all excel formats from 97 through the present including the xlsx and xlsb formats

439588
width	height
for instance if you are passing the specification for a rectangle you can pass x y width and height or you could just pass a rectangle object that contains x y width and height

439625
dictionary	map
dictionary is hash based map is a tree based container

439634
getter	setter
this kind of smell since we are talking about refactoring this horrible word seems appropriate... might also be detected for objects that have a lot read any properties or getter setter

439639
hide	show
if what you are really looking for is a show hide effect you could use javascript to show the larger image if the user clicks on the smaller image

439686
children	parent
create my own children collection which will be given a reference back to the instance so it can handle setting the parent on the add

439743
post	get
any thread can post a message with a message-id and a string for parameters to another thread-id and then get on with its work

439744
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
however after trying it out it works successfully in firefox google-chrome and opera but fails in konqueror invalid date safari invalid date and ie nan

439798
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql are more-or-less equivalent from within django

439811
uniq	grep
if you don t have the ability to use uniq and want to preserve order you can use grep to simulate that

439818
postgresql	mysql
i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

439846
primes	square-root
you only ever need to check up to the square-root of the number if you find no factors by then then the number is primes

439858
put	get
you can t because there s no installer redist for the debug runtime and in fact the software license forbids distributing it so you d be breaking the eula even if you did get something put together

439875
rss	feed
my guess is that your best bet on that unless these guys have rss feed would be to scrape the html with a language that supports regular expressions

439877
imperative	declarative
is there an equivalent way that is less imperative and more declarative ie

439897
equals	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	icomparable	gethashcode
i also read at msdn that when you implement icomparable you ll need to override the equals method and gethashcode by extension i presume

439925
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
implementing iequalitycomparer is like implementing icomparer - instead of comparing this object with another one the equals compare method takes two values to compare

439925
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
implementations of iequalitycomparer icomparer rarely override object.gethashcode or object.equals unless they want to allow comparisons of comparers - rarely useful

440029
ssl	https
if ssl isn t configured on your server that would explain why the url above works but the url visual studio is using same but with https wouldn t work

440037
sorting	filtering
i d like to essentially copy the range into some native class that supports filtering and sorting so i don t have to reinvent the wheel and use that class to return a result to calling code

440061
perl	tcl
i m running on a windows platform but i have access to sed awk perl python and tcl in addition to the usual windows tools

440098
postgresql	mysql
just to address the mysql vs postgresql issues - it shouldn t matter

440104
profiling	debugging
second the runtime profiling uses the debugging memory manager when it runs the child processes

440118
postgresql	mysql
as for postgresql versus mysql either works

440168
vbscript	vb6
look in the microsoft.visualbasic namespace to get access to the old vbscript vb6 functions

440204
int	double
for the answer to this question to be yes all int within the range of an int have to be exactly representable as double and floor must always return that exactly represented value

440222
int	double
since double uses 53 bits for mantissa it can store all 32-bit int s exactly

440239
int	double
in a compiler with a 64 bit double and a 64 bit int you ve got more problems of course...

440239
int	double
this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable

440239
int	double
however all 32 bit int are representable as double

440262
put	get
of course i can put in a cast and get the compiler to shut up but i m wondering if i m doing something wrong here

440454
rss	feed
the other answers is absolutely correct i would recommend against giving your feed a title of rss if the format used is actually atom

440454
rss	feed
rss of course refers to an entirely separate format for feed and syndication and there s enough confusion among the general population about what the differences are that i wouldn t suggest feeding the fire

440497
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and i d guess all other debian distros if not all linuces the file var log auth.log records successful and unsuccessful login attempts

440574
filtering	grouping
next we join a new reference to pages in on the section id and filtering by sortorder being the minimum from the section grouping

440584
rar	zip
if the data is still too big you can try using an external library executable to rar or 7zip the data as that will be half the size of the zip d copy

440588
translation	localization
all articles i ve read about localization of a winforms application assume that i already have all the strings translation

440667
png	ico
use this syntax for getting the ico or other items png xaml etc out of the assembly

put	get	post	put	post	get
it really lowers the barrier to entry to the lowest common denominator allowing anything that can use basic http get and post also put and delete for the proper way of doing it to use the api

440778
jlabel	jseparator
another approach would be to create a custom component maybe with a horizontal boxlayout and add a jseparator a jlabel and another jseparator to it then add it to the menu

440802
public	protected
you can test protected methods from unit tests in another package by creating a subclass of the class under test that overrides the methods you want to test as public and having those overridden methods call the original methods with the super keyword

440822
client-side	server-side
telerik s unique advantage is that you can render both client-side and server-side meaning you can support clients that do not have javascript enabled

440855
width	height
i like to have buttons that have a fixed size ie if minimized maximized the button sizes dont change other controls may but not buttons width text in it and height 27 -30 pixels

440855
width	height
my co-worker prefers buttons that are only 20 pixels in height and the width is docked to vary as screen is resized

440874
pkcs#12	pfx
you have your certificate you only need to pack the certificate and the private key inside a pfx or pkcs#12 file that microsoft csp recognizes

440942
csv	tsv
another possiblitly is to export the html tables as a csv or tsv file but you would need to setup the formatting in your code

440945
width	height
i agree that some scenarios where localization of an app is needed requires you to take into consideration the button size.however that still does not call for buttons that stretch to 75 of your screen in width height remaining the same

440964
post	get
first theses post helped me get on the right track

441007
hide	show
i used div tags around the tables i wanted to show and hide like

441007
hide	show
this allows me to show or hide the tables without taking up blank space on the page when they are hidden but still rendering them so they ll work with validation controls that was my ultimate goal while hidden or showing

441057
public	protected
the point here is that junit forces me to make process public or at least protected or to put it in it s own utility class

441060
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
the forms are subclassing of various different classes and i really don t want to do make some kind of intermediate tform descendant which overrides the scaled properties - partly because i tried briefly to do this and discovered that setting the scaled properties to be false after the inherited create made no difference to the form and setting it before the inherited create caused an exception

441095
ssl	https
5 false in order to authenticate the service callers you don t necessarily need to have any transport-level security such as ssl https

441117
folder	dir
the solution i found for word templates is to read the install dir from hklm software microsft windows currentversion app paths winword.exe and install to the startup folder underneath the path contained in that registry key

441165
vbulletin	phpbb
phpbb3 and vbulletin are good choices for php phpbb is open source but vbulletin is a private product unfortunately

441165
wordpress	joomla
some say wordpress is a good thing to look at i disagree but i expect joomla wouldn t be a bad place to look either

441168
postgresql	mysql
we re migrating mysql to postgresql

441190
versioning	upgrade
a complete versioning of visual studio sells for about 200 these day just buy the upgrade edition and it is very very cheap

441193
jsf	seam
yet seam is still a new approach to developing jsf web applications

441213
width	height
using the rectangle class from an earlier answer as an example the constructor which takes parameters for x y height and width could factor x and y out into a point object allowing you to pass three parameters to the rectangle s constructor

441249
width	height
width 100 height 100 you might also want to set the d designwidth 640 and d designheight 480 that way it is easier to do layout in expression blend

441340
put	get
i guess i wasn t anticipating this approach but as long as the pages can get spidered and ranked as more information is put in i m cool with it

441347
width	height
remove the width and height attributes from the root usercontrol

441384
equals	tostring
however i recommend you to both define the tostring as above and also an equals

441394
int	double
as well as this you have to remember when you code that x is an int or that y is a double

441406
vb6	vba
long answer vb6 which is what vba really is is pretty much a dead unsupported language last updated a decade back with an ide from the same period

441455
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the second comparisontype parameter of the indexof method specifies how to search for the value parameter using the current or invariant culture using a case-sensitive or case-insensitive search or using word or ordinal comparison rules see for the full documentation

441476
hash	md5
i think about it and found a solution i ll md5 all books strings and save the hash books strings

441501
spaces	delimiter
if that isn t possible but you know that there s a spaces between the date and the time then you could again import as text and parse the date from the time using the spaces as your delimiter and then process the time field

441526
trie	tree
a suffix tree is a type of trie mentioned by divo

441554
int	boolean	int	double
int double boolean and other primitive types do get allocated on the stack

441554
elf	coff
the c++ standard has some language about a similar technique but the implementation is left up to the binary format elf a.out coff pe etc.

441554
int	double
the standard expects constants that are integral data types bool int long etc. or c-style strings to be actually kept in a constant part of the binary while other constant data double floats classes might be stored as a variable along with a flag saying that the variable is not modifiable it s also acceptable to store them with integral and c-style string constants but many binary formats don t make this an option

441631
google-chrome	firefox
tested it on google-chrome firefox 3 ie 7 and ie 6 and it s working

441642
cvs	svn
one more thing on the off chance it actually works if there is a cvs to svn utility use it i am assuming such a utility would pull deleted files from the cvs attic and if it saves each moment in time as a project level checkpoint since svn does that unlike cvs use svn to fetch the right moment in time

441676
inherited	properties
the inherited form does not honor the anchor properties of the ok and cancel buttons

441676
width	height
4- increase in the designer the second form s height or width

441686
hash	md5
since an md5 digest is 128 bits that means that any given pair of strings has a 1-in-2 128 chance of producing the same hash value

441692
getter	setter
however this leads to a rather anemic domain the user class is nothing but getter setter

441707
getter	setter
however this leads to a rather anemic domain the user class is nothing but getter setter

441752
inherited	properties
make sure that the inherited form isn t overriding some properties in the designer..

441775
post	get
get post or a cookie

441792
google-chrome	firefox
client uas are diverse ie5.5 - 7 firefox 3.0.5 iphone google-chrome

441809
nunit	mstest
mstest is essentially nunit slightly reworked with a few new features such as assembly setup and teardown not just fixture and test level and missing some of the best bits such as the new 2.4 constraint syntax

441816
mouse	keyboard
edit when i specified user interface techniques i left it open to both using existing hardware mouse keyboard and some other things like multi-touch gesture recognition augmented reality see hitlabnz for some great examples

441837
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
for each malloc or calloc there should be exactly one free

441861
getter	setter
i d also advise you to keep the getter and setter as restricted in scope as possible to reduce coupling

441930
mockups	prototyping
pencil is built for the purpose of providing a free and open-source gui prototyping tool that people can easily install and use to create mockups in popular desktop platforms

441935
getter	setter
recently i read about someone who got an assignment to write a bunch of setter and getter -- in a better language this would be a job for its metaprogramming facilities

441936
post	get
i was going to write a blog post about it i may as well get started here

441936
screens	tablet
there are more alternatives than just a mouse or a touch screens or a tablet

441949
codeigniter	cakephp
have been studying testing some php frameworks codeigniter symfony and cakephp

441950
hash	md5
you should verify that your md5 hash is correct by also comparing the string that was used to generate the hash so you don t have any false positives

441950
hash	md5
although an md5 sort of hash is fast the techniques presented in the other answers should be considered as well to find the best benefit cost balance for your circumstance

441996
iboutlet	ibaction
in your controller s header file make sure you are using iboutlet on your controls and ibaction on your methods that you wish to link to link up in interface builder

442151
gridview	repeater
i know that the asp.net repeater doesnt have a client side object model and we are stuck with improving the performance of many pages which have repeater gridview with the functionality of adding rows to them by server-side code

442151
gridview	repeater
we have used updatepanels to ajaxify the functionality adding the rows to the repeater gridview but the time it takes for the server trip and rendering back on the browser is not acceptable

442151
gridview	repeater
is there some way in which this can be done on the clientside to improve the performance of adding rows to the repeater gridview

442179
notepad++	jedit
i use notepad++ on my host for editing recent convert from jedit and with drive mapping in the vm software sun s virtualbox my dev webserver guest machine has no problem serving up the ever-changing source files

442181
postgresql	mysql
in-query variable modification doesn t work in postgresql for instance this will work in mysql but not in postgresql i haven t tested this recently maybe it does work now.

442181
postgresql	mysql
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

442181
postgresql	mysql
the way postgresql stores tables is utterly different than how mysql does

442252
nginx	lighttpd
nginx lighttpd

442298
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a new versioning we decided

442319
stdout	stderr
task will be stuck when you won t read what it is sending on stdout stderr

442343
ubuntu	linux
i have a django app that on the my comp ubuntu linux 8.10 works fine both through runserver and mod-python

442366
awt	swing
swing depends and uses awt as it s basis

442398
versioning	upgrade
the reason i left php is that they alter the api available functions between major versioning upgrade

442413
children	parent
a parent entity can have many children of the same record type

442468
free	malloc
and that allocated using malloc should be deleted using free

442484
hash	salt
you don t need to store the real deal anywhere on the machine just a hash password possibly salt too

442491
hide	show
i found this out by observing the keyboard show hide events

442541
nspersistentdocument	nsdocument
remember nspersistentdocument is a subclass of nsdocument .

442586
folder	directory
since few days it creates a new visual studio 2008 directory in the same folder that my .sln file exists

442647
int	chars
now i had a discussion with someone about what happens when you convert the value -1 of type int to unsigned chars

442699
int	double
__declspec dllexport void __stdcall getdoubles int count double values

442733
superclass	subclassing
i though that a subclassing should be able replace a superclass without any modifications to the subclassing

442748
folder	directory
smarty for example employs this approach by placing the library one directory above the htdocs folder

442897
getter	setter
never put getter and setter for actual business values on your view

442921
putty	winscp
in addition i have jetty server maven winscp putty vim and a several other tools running quite happlily on my desktop

442935
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm not an encryption algorithm in short u cant get back wat u hash u can only compare

442937
versioning	upgrade
since your question title asks if there are any disadvantages to hosting this at google the most obvious answer that springs to mind is they may upgrade their versioning at any time potentially breaking your code or causing unexpected side effects

442941
mouse	keyboard
moreover if i press alt+tab to switch to some other running app and then press alt+tab again to switch back to my app it responds to both mouse and keyboard input

442943
hash	salt
p.s. for security reasons you should consider not to save the password in plaintext but as hash value salt

442982
cassini	iis
for me closing the ide shutting the web site iis or cassini deleting all of my temporary asp.net files launching the ide and doing a full compile does the trick

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
or you could go even further and reverse engineer an entity-relationship model with an accompanying diagram

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram were really useful to me when discussing the data with people who were neither programmers nor database experts

443032
entity-relationship	diagram
sometimes a few manual fixups to the entity-relationship model and entity-relationship diagram were necessary before it was a useful communication tool with stakeholders

443114
versioning	upgrade
contrary to what others have claimed they do not automatically upgrade you to the latest versioning

443209
post	get
get post

443219
post	get
just set post get variables while you are requesting the page

443276
onclick	onsubmit
i tried to attach a javascript function which uses ajax.updater to onsubmit on the form and onclick on the input but the form is still non-ajax submitted after the function ends so the whole page is replaced by the results

443310
superclass	subclassing
i d like for a subclassing of a certain superclass with certain constructor parameters to load an xml file containing information that i d then like to pass to the superconstructor

443361
fileoutputstream	filewriter
use a fileoutputstream rather than a filewriter

443397
cassini	iis
i d imagine the stack is immense though i would expect cassini to replicate iis as closely as possible

443397
cassini	iis
it s surprising that something that runs in vs wouldn t run in iis and i d even consider filing a vs bug with microsoft since it seems that the whole point of cassini is to replicate the functionality of iis and provide an ideal debugging environment since any web projects you write in vs will inherently be deployed against iis

443446
osql	powershell
you can automate script this easily using powershell or just .cmd files with calls to osql

443459
pop-up	dialog
error dialog will pop-up and add a

443503
post	get
manni s suggestion to eliminate post and head was indeed correct because i was looking for negative matches therefore should not restrict to get as when parsing for query strings

443639
inherited	properties
winforms have the autoscalemode properties which can be set to either font dpi inherited or none

443644
serializable	deserialization
even with a wrapper library you ll probably want to customize the serializable deserialization handling

443676
for-loop	loops
compare this to a for-loop or a while loops or an if

443695
put	get	children	parent
right now i m using a foreach loop to fetch the parent objects directly below rot put this means i cannot get the children

443704
strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
it has functions like strdup that malloc the string and expect the programmer to call free on it

443777
width	height
i resize the inherited control increase height or width

443777
inherited	properties
the inherited control does not honor the anchor properties of the ok and cancel buttons

443777
width	height
4 - increase in the designer usercontrol1 s height or width

443828
inherited	properties
when you change the properties and compile that doesn t mean that s the default setting for classes that inherited your control

443846
superclass	subclassing
1 superclass logs with the subclassing s logger

443848
addition	multiplication
this is kind of like implementing multiplication in terms of addition or addition in terms of increment

443878
public	protected
if you do not explicitly write a method s access level public protected or private then it will default to package-private and these methods will probably been shown in content assist

443891
superclass	subclassing
try debugging an error where you see a message generated by the superclass class when the error is really being logged in the subclassing class

443908
superclass	subclassing
the major difference asides from the superclass logging with subclassing name of course is that you ll have one logger object per member of your class

443910
merb	ruby-on-rails
i ve been having a look at several mvc frameworks like ruby-on-rails merb cakephp codeignitier and similars...

443910
sorting	filtering
something like master-detail filtering by example paging sorting and similars

443920
firefox	safari
it looks like safari can t download some of the javascript files necessary to show these widgets strange that firefox can though

443974
put	get
its always a bad idea to put data from a get request directly into sql and there are many easy ways to prevent sql injection

443981
post	get
using the query parameters allows you to use an http get which is bookmarkable rather than a post

443991
rss	feed
i d like to parse rss feed and download podcasts on my readynas which is running 24 7 anyway

444001
hide	show
if the validate parameters function is successful you hide the error panel and show the report panel if not you do the opposite

444002
hash	md5
simple solution - for each file get its md5 hash by

444002
hash	md5
calculate the md5 hash with system.security.cryptography.md5cryptoserviceprovider

444020
getter	setter
here s a good rule of thumb if you have a variable that has nothing but a setter and a getter you have data not code--get it out of your class and place it into a collection or something

444020
getter	setter
having a variable with a setter and a getter just means that either you never do anything with it it s data or the code that manipulates it is in another class terrible oo design move the variable to the other class

444098
equals	tostring
not reflection but i had a look at generating the tostring method along with equals hashcode as a post-compilation step using bytecode manipulation

444189
mouseover	mouseout
look at the slidedown and slidetoggle functions and it would basically require you setting up hidden divs and then on the mouseover event you would slidetoggle your text out and the hidden image div in and on mouseout do the opposite

444217
getter	setter
this property is available to all javascript objects you create and allows you to add properties or functions to the object declaration so you had a object with 2 properties and later on you added 4 functions getter and setter

444217
getter	setter
in the example 2 you inline the declaration of these getter and setter in the object declaration so in the end they are the same

444217
getter	setter
this will give you the same object without getter and setter

444227
vtiger	orangehrm
so my experience has been that the open source web based tools are very good eg orangehrm weberp vtiger very useable and free and they do a perfectly good-enough job

444231
rss	feed
i am using django s rss capabilities to build an rss feed

444231
rss	feed
the of the rss feed items contains html markup

444231
rss	feed
it seems that django autoescapes special characters in rss feed or any xml for that matter no matter what regardless of whether you pass it through the safe filter or not the issue is discussed in this ticket

444260
binutils	newlib
the community and me have been updating the gcc and newlib to the latest stable versions and everything seems to work with the old binutils

444336
children	parent
from there select the node with children but no parent and iteratively build your tree from the top down

444370
subtract	add
i will have to add my viewstate value to the page total and somehow subtract overlapping totals

444422
post	get
can switch between get post easily

444462
stdout	stderr
try making a simple app that just spits out data to stdout and stderr and then make sure the app closes while you are still reading

444486
bmp	png
it works fine with png bmp and jpeg

444563
children	parent
parent and children

444579
pull	push
i am sure if you search the net you will find pull and push based parsers for json

444580
postgresql	mysql
note the interval syntax varies slightly between databases and that s the one for postgresql so you might have to change it slightly for mysql

vmware	virtualbox
if you re running on windows or linux vmware server mentioned by another poster and virtualbox should both do what you want and they re both free

444984

step 1- use a javascript library so you can have the code be as cross browser as possible - otherwise you have to cater to two different event models between internet explorer and gecko webkit based browsers

445001
postgresql	mysql
this is legal sql syntax supported for example by microsoft sql server postgresql and sqlite but not by oracle ibm db2 or mysql

445004
client-side	server-side
generally the best experience i ve had of this was a largish company with very defined groups of developers including the design team who produced the gfx the apps team who did the vast bulk of server-side coding and app architecture and the ue user experience team who sewed the two together producing xslt jsp html markup in general and the css and js for the client-side

445022
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
the problem is that asp.net asp.net-mvc html.actionlink and similar functions generates urls with www.domain.com subfolder

alternately just modify your dashboard.config file to include the mbunit report in addition to the nunit report

445270
strcpy	strncpy
countless mistakes in the c design exist ranging from gets to strcpy to the strncpy api it should have had the strlcpy api since day 1

445283
put	get
it s tough to put a finger on the exact number of concurrent requests that i ll get hit with but i d say that a non-professional setup should be enough to handle them

445330
erlang	lisp
if your cs course didn t touch on it i highly advise spending a bit of time with a more functional style of language like erlang haskell or even lisp

445333
put	get
get a vanilla hard drive for the os and a pair of fast drives wd velociraptors etc and put them in raid 1 for the webserver for redundancy

445348

std ostringstream is not required to be slower but it is generally slower when implemented

445372
google-chrome	safari
it s the browser safari google-chrome etc that expands www.google.com out into so that you can actually visit the site

445373
cout	cin
one reason i know that the printf family of functions are faster than the corresponding c++ functions cout cin and other streams is that the latter do typechecking

445373
cout	cin
in fact in programming competitions it is often recommended that you use printf et al rather than cout cin for precisely this reason

445397
post	get
if you write a contract first web service that consumes and produces xml you can talk to any client that can make an http get or post request in the appropriate format

445497
post	get
there s a blog post here that describes how the behaviour of was changed between .net 3.5 and .net 3.5 sp1 but it still doesn t explain the invalidcastexception which you even get if you rewrite your code thus

445506
public	protected
if you re trying to expose protected methods from an inheritor you can wrap them in public methods

445508
inherited	subclassing
your subclassing will be able to access the protected members of the class you inherited

445607
width	height
in the layout tab you can set the width and height of the window and the width and height of the screen buffer

445653
folder	directory
with that many files i would write a script for my command-line ftp client that goes to the folder in question and performs a directory listing redirecting the output to a file

if the string is only a few chars then it will be nearly as small an an int anyway

445689
padding	right-align
left-align the header to make it stay put you can add padding on the left to fake a centered or right-align header

445703
put	get
i ll put a calculation on a read-only get or a set

445704
put	get
you should only put calculations on get if the value is likely to change every time its queried

445724
typedef	typename
instead of typename you want to use typedef

445739
put	get
if the calculations simple and does not take a long time then put it in the get

445748
for-loop	loops
so you could either find a workaround or just use a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

445810
cvs	svn
eclipse can be sluggish but i ve become attached to integrated svn cvs block indent unindent and run as unittest features

445852
x86	64bit
x64 exception model gets you to the msdn article everything you need to know to start programming 64bit windows systems which contains the quote the downside to table-based exception handling relative to the x86 stack-based model is that looking up function table entries from code addresses takes more time than just walking a linked list

445879
folder	directory
edit strangely enough if i put the jar somewhere else say in a directory inside of my user folder and change the path to it in my build.xml it works

445942
post	get
client-side code submits an object in the post request body or query string if using get method via ajax request to a python cgi script

445947
getter	setter
depending on what you re trying to achieve and what version of .net you re using you could consider using the datacontractserializer which doesn t require things to be public for example you could put a datamemberattribute on a private field or a property with public getter and private setter

445955
opera	firefox
for the specific case of needing a more screen-friendly view of the msdn or on any other site like stackoverflow that makes poor use of screen real estate i would suggest applying a custom stylesheet to the page using a tool like ie7pro ie greasemonkey firefox stylish fireox or the built in stylesheet picker in opera

445979
updatepanel	formview
easiest way is to nest a formview inside the updatepanel

446005
int	double
if k is int then check if the object passed is long short float double ... then convert and compare

446228
launch4j	jsmooth
there are some software for that such as jsmooth or launch4j

446230

vcs like svn git cvs etc

446244
cvs	svn
i have a git repository originally cvs then svn now git containing a rails project that has been deployed on linux for a while now

446325
pull	push
use pull push to sync with another parent repository on an external harddrive for backup

446329

in the end you have to be a bit flexible depending on the project itself and whether you use ant or maven

446330
post	get
in which case get the post first

446336
postgresql	mysql
both of the big oss db s mysql and postgresql can scale to extremely large sites

446352
post	get
if i ve read your question correctly i assume you want to get the single post out then order the comments within that post

446369
width	height
if you need to layout some others components based on the sprite width and height but before actually drawing it you can draw on a flash.display.shape object use this size as a reference and then attach the shape on the sprite

446445
interbase	firebird
i had to use interbase at work so i came to firebird

446501
versioning	upgrade
the fix suggested by them is to upgrade it to versioning 2.2.6

446545
hash	salt
and hash your passwords in your database with a salt

446571
folder	directory
hence all the apache related dlls are located in the application folder s sub directory c program files mywebapp apache2

446585
prepare	execute
it s still possible to screw it up -- for example if your stored procedure just builds a sql string internally and execute it trusting the input -- but prepare statements with parameters mean that no unescaped data will ever get to the db server completely cutting off that attack vector

446626
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
as of jquery 1.5 the returned object is a wrapper for the native xmlhttprequest object called jqxhr

446856

446911
super	extends
let s have two objects foo of class super and bar of class sub which extends super

446918
type-safety	typechecking
moreover gcc provides static typechecking on printf -style function calls so the benefit of type-safety is reduced

447029
webkit	gecko
i don t think you ll be able to do this with any kind of accuracy without embedding gecko webkit trident or essentially recreating them

447101
stdout	stderr
the last line is supposed to return the stderr back to where it was before which i have only supposed is the same as stdout

447137
for-loop	loops
in javascript the for-loop does not have it s own scope - so a var you create inside a loops is not different from one defined outside of it

447214
many-to-one	one-to-many
one-to-many and many-to-one you

447218
put	get
if you put the rev keyword inside a file and enable keyword substitution with the svn keywords property you will not get what you want

447230
hide	show
you can use these to hide navbars ads or show different ads

447271
stdout	stderr
that way the script preserves the separation of stdout and stderr for the script ie

447271
stdout	stderr
the scripts stdout and stderr can be redirected separately

447356
outputstream	inputstream
this is likely to be some object with a keylistener hooked into the view as well as an inputstream and an outputstream to handle communication with the other player it probably also needs to be the one to worry about synchronizing the game state

447359
gridview	formview
it works with a gridview which then displays the data but with this formview it doesn t display the data

447434
udp	tcp
for example it only provides interfaces for tcp and udp networking which is much higher in the network protocol stack that what you are discussing

447500

447610
post	put
modify your uri template to something like task new and put the data of the new task in the body of the post http request

447621
getter	setter
it allows you to have the object be dynamic yet still be able to write some custom code that runs whenever properties are accessed similarly to getter and setter -- see getproperty and setproperty .

447636
updatepanel	scriptmanager
for example any updatepanel in any embedded control in the app would want to know about the existence of that scriptmanager

447644
getter	setter
then i can have methods as well as data setter getter with validation and so on

447666
ati	nvidia
the virtual framebuffer driver is a display driver just like one you d use to connect to an nvidia or ati video card except it s output is a chunk of memory that contains the pixels not an lcd screen

447672
put	get	post	put	post	get
i had a whole long post detailing how you shouldn t expect to be able to get acceptable battery life because wm is not designed to support what you re trying to do but -- you could signal your service on wakeup do your processing then use the methods in this post to put the device back to sleep immediately

447704
google-chrome	firefox
i ve scoured my firefox history my google-chrome history my feeddemon feeds and my google bookmarks to no avail

based on the value of a boolean viewstate variable i would also like to hide show the updatepanels alternatively but

448079
free	malloc
when free ing the piece first goes into a free-list for quick reuse by another malloc if the size fits

448079
free	malloc
when free pieces arrive so that multiple fragments can be joined free usually does this but sometimes fragments remain depending on size and orderof malloc and free

448079
free	malloc
but usually malloc keeps things in its pocket dependig on the allocated free ratio many heuristics and sometimes compile or flag options are often available

448079
free	malloc
notice that there is not one malloc free algotrithm

448176
hash	md5
indy comes with functions for calculating several hash md5 is one of them

448204
implements	extends
i ve messed around trying to extends abstractprocessingfilter and or implements authenticationprovider but i just get caught up understanding how i make them all play nicely

448245
getter	setter
it also is considerably shorter for example 99 of getter setter can just be left out in favor of directly accessing the fields

448246
websphere	ibm
i came across an article on the ibm web site where it says that hibernate s cluster aware caches in conjunction with websphere application server has not been determined yet

448321
ant	maven
i have used both ant and maven tasks to great effect in deploying wars remotely all while being built-in to the build process

448328
post	put
i don t believe that content_location has any defined behaviour in response to a put or post request

448330

448393
cifs	smb
the in smb cifs uris means that the share is hidden and won t be displayed when browsing shared folders

448413
ant	maven
multi module builds are the norm for maven projects and are also easy to set up for other build systems like ant

448422
getter	setter
for the same reason i tend to dislike getter setter functions

448497
post	get
edit i d recommend actually starting to use it instead of trying to find examples and then come back and post questions here if you can t get stuff to work like you d think it should -

448498
post	put
jeremy miller just put up a post on how to create your own conventions.

448572
hide	show
if you re just presenting a lot of static data in a compact space - load it when the page loads and hide show as appropriate

448577
strncmp	strcmp
as far as i know you re absolutely right--there s no reason to use strncmp instead of strcmp

448588

post	get
i m glad this post has been helpful and i m hoping i can get off my arse and finish up my book on the subject by the end of the year early next year

448713

java has swing swt awt etc

448793
profiling	debugging
both of them provides good unit tests debugging profiling etc

448806

448849
mouse	keyboard
mouse click works perfectly but doesnt allow for keyboard selection ie bound fields update but picturebox does not

448859
realloc	malloc
but in addition to that things allocated with malloc and family can be resized using realloc

448860
apache	nginx
you should look into cherrypy as your http request handler which can be configured to run on top of a very light nginx web server or apache if you prefer

448892
mp3	flv
i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need

448975
client-side	server-side
however to use the feature you will have to use word automation on either server-side or client-side

448978
antivirus	norton
i had heinous problems with this until i disabled my norton autoprotect antivirus software

448992
implements	extends
but if you create an interface for your modules and then each class you load unload implements that interface as well as extends the flex module class you can load and unload them cleanly

449104
width	height
edit just realised no javascript so in that case keep the a tag and simply define a style for it in css that way you can give it height width etc

449161
hide	show
i want to fire a toggle event that will show hide the div marked with the class main by clicking on the corresponding clickme text inside its child div tag with clickme class

449162
config	ini
figure out that i need to make a copy of the data dir and merge ini with backup ini file and didn t need to run the config wizard twice

449166
mod-python	mod-wsgi
either through mod-python s wsgi support or maybe better mod-wsgi

449178
width	height
the outer container was specified with fixed height and width and the inner dg was set to 100 height and width

449178
width	height
setting the dg height and width to fixed values a bit smaller than the outer container did the trick

449252
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
there are some very popular cross platform gui toolkits borrowed from c c++ that have a lot of external widgets wxpython pyqt pyfltk pygtk

449356

in the simplest case the dictionary has a key which would map to the primary key of a table - so that when you specify the values of the key you can immediately find the matching data via a simple lookup

449372
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox open with a size including google-chrome of 1024x1000

449428
datalist	repeater
if you really needed to use a datalist for some reason instead of implementing this as a repeater you can try doing something like this

449484
portrait	landscape
i had to do a linear layout and include 3 images that look like real tabs so i can try and mimic the operation of the tabs while rotating the screen to landscape and keep the visuals as portrait

449504
implements	extends
it s far more flexible to implements a common interface than try and force things to extends from a specific base class or sometimes it s impossible

449505
getter	setter
a and b are independent variables so they have simple setter and getter that merely get and set a filed

449514
jobs	cron
if you have shared hosting there s probably some tool they d give you for cron jobs

449516
getdate	datepart
select dow datepart d getdate where 1 sunday 7 saturday

take care to set up the css appropriately to set the width height of the div and the background position where appropriate

449726
apache	lighttpd

449761
csv	tsv
if the file is something like csv tsv similar then csvreader is highly recommended

449779
ironruby	ironpython
you could compile your vb6 functionality and expose it as a com object and connect it to python with ironpython or ironruby which are python and ruby implementations in .net thus allowing you to access .net functionality although im not quite sure if com exposed objects are easily pluggable to those interpreters

449808

449926
opera	firefox
the following should work in at least firefox and opera

449955
inherited	properties
the difference to your solution is that base won t be called and sub.prototype will only inherited the properties of base.prototype - and not the ones set in the constructor

449962
versioning	upgrade
i m new to the project and relatively new to asp.net mvc itself - soon we will be looking to upgrade to either the beta or rc versioning

450005
inherited	properties
this next note doesn t apply to the original days but one interesting point in the current incarnation of asp.net is that the page inherited from the code-behind so the proper-case names would make sense if they were exposed as protected properties

450035
gridview	objectdatasource
the best approach is to have some objectdatasource s in order to the entire process be easier for you or off course you can bind the nasted gridview in the paraent gridview onrowdatabound event it is all up to you

450036
cvs	svn
cvs svn plugins are available

450070
selecteditem	selectedindex

450218
erlang	lisp
it was this one thing that keept popping up in google results when searching for lisp and erlang stuff

450243
jedit	scite
i like scite and there s also jedit

450251
public	protected
part of the recommendations for writing cls-compliant libraries is to not have two public protected entities that differ only by case e.g you should not have

450316
firefox	safari
it works fine in safari but in firefox and ie the stays small in the top-left corner of the browser

450316
width	height
if i use left and width and top and height then everything works fine

width	height
however i don t know what is the width and the height i want them adjusted depending of the size of the browser window

450322
camping	ruby-on-rails	merb	camping	merb	ruby-on-rails
in the ruby world you have the big player ruby-on-rails but you also have much lighter ones like merb sinatra camping and a couple of others

450387
sorting	filtering
if the list offers extra features sorting filtering etc via ibindinglist ibindinglistview etc then more functionality might be available

450400
width	height
theyâ ll use the last vertical and horizontal position specified and need the dimensions to be specified using width and height

450429
hide	show
within that new stylesheet show the container element and hide the old elements and anything else that you do not wish to print

450455
qtcore	qtgui
i think qtcore and qtgui are required

450456
division	modulo
so the definition of modulo will nearly always depend on the definition of integer division

450459
switching	screens
parsing screenshots generated by java.awt.robot is neither platform- nor version- or even configuration-independant and in general i don t think screens is locked is a well-enough defined concept to be used in this sense - on linux there can be more than just one screens x server you can switching to console terminals you can have applications running one or more machines display their guis on another machine over the network.

450508
range	max	range	min	min	max
for one of my charts where there could be a large range of different bars i have this set on the y-axis min and max

450527
comparator	comparable
in 1.4 the signature of comparator could only ever take an object since all kinds of classes implemented comparable and there was no way to know exactly what was needed

450527
comparator	comparable
with generics however you can specify that you are comparable with respect to a particular class and then write a more specific comparator method that only takes that class as a parameter

450607
sorting	filtering
in short adding an index on columns that you regularly use for filtering or for sorting may improve performance

450625
put	get
then after the old database is shut off you can iterate over those keys and get those records from the old database and put them into the new database

450703
cvs	svn
i already do through svn hg git and cvs

450725
bazaar	git
this question sounds like an advert for a distributed vcs like git or bazaar you need developers to be able to commit changes often but on to their own branch which then gets reviewed before being pulled in to the central repository

450728
stdout	stderr
i had to add my own appender for logging to stderr and stdout but that was much easier than creating my own logging framework from scratch

450766
dllmain	getprocaddress
the most obvious condition is that the process calling loadlibrary explicitly gets getprocaddress dllmain and then calls it

sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
or use sudo and edit etc sudoers such that sudo does not ask for a passwd

450814
bazaar	git
generic scm interoperability solution like fast-import exchange standard created in git but supported by bazaar and i think also by mercurial or tools such as tailor but tailor has its limitation

450835
rss	feed
we actually do offer rss feed to allow 3rd party apps to scan our site for product info but not ahead of the main site html

450855
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
but it really looks like you re missing the point of inherited it s that you can only treat subclassing uniformly when using exclusively the superclass methods

450873
jar	war
a delivery unit is a small small as in the fewest number of files as possible set of packaged files jar war and ear are all an example of such packaged files but we also include sources compressed in a zip file javadoc compressed also script to execute this delivery and so on

450875
super	implements
there is a way to implements typesafe heterogenous containers thc using super type tokens but that has its own problems again

450882
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream can do this

450892
hide	show
you can build functions on your page as user controls and dynamically load user controls on your page based on those permissions if you want or you can put content in panels and just show hide panels as needed

450993
pdfsharp	migradoc
we used a set of third party dlls from pdfsharp who in turn use dlls from migradoc

451030
put	get
you can put that in your code to get around it

451054
client-side	server-side
because we re standardizing on flex client-side development amf and blazeds now better coupled to spring thanks to adobe and springsource cooperating on the integration are the most efficient and convenient means we can employ to interact with the server-side

451060
coalesce	isnull
no if statements no case statements no isnull no coalesce

451103
vim	emacs
it never hurts learning vim emacs if you are a nix user

451106
cassini	iis
start up cassini or even proper iis

451130
coalesce	isnull
isnull or coalesce

451206
put	get
however both put and get should use the class literal for safety

451247
pop-up	dialog
i don t want to pop-up the confirmation dialog unless i know the user has made changes

451254
mouse	keyboard
you won t be able to access desktop via flex you ll have to use some server app on the user machine to simulate mouse keyboard events

451293
int	boolean
b int 5 boolean

451294
hash	md5
you could settle for something like an md5 hash

451338
rss	feed
i m working on an application that allows users to add their own rss feed to a simple reader of sorts

451362
versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade to versioning 1.3 of jquery this appears to be causing problems because both libraries define a function named

451379
jmeter	soapui
jmeter is also a great solution as is soapui

451406
pull	push
alternatively have the n worker scripts on other machines that pull requests from the db and call sox and then push the resulting output file to where it needs to be

451426
concave	convex
i have my ideas about pulling a sequence of triangles from the list of points but i know there are a bunch of edge cases regarding convex and concave polygons that i probably won t catch

451438
hash	md5
something like an md5 hash

451465
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade to the latest versioning with relative ease

451468
int	chars
most importantly if you overflow the valid range of a chars by assigning it a too big or small int and chars is signed the resulting value is implementation defined or even some signal in c could be risen as for all signed types

451468
int	chars
if an int will be able to represent all values of chars which it is for most implementations then the chars is being promoted to int before passing to printf

451468
int	chars
however if chars is unsigned then the value is unsigned and promoting to an int will yield a positive int

451497
public	protected
and since i never use protected internal or public fields that s the only time i use fields period. as far as i m concerned if a variable needs to have class scope it s a property of the class

451513
mouse	keyboard
the desktop computer has a ton of buffers for both keyboard and mouse actions

451580
width	height
this script will resize an image somepic.jpg using pil python imaging library to a width of 300 pixels and a height proportional to the new width

451580
width	height
it does this by determining what percentage 300 pixels is of the original width img.size 0 and then multiplying the original height img.size 1 by that percentage

451619
next	except
i m thinking of learning it next currently using erlang and in general happy with it except the records fiasco..

451654
cvs	svn
my company is moving from cvs to svn

451654
cvs	svn
with cvs i made branches for each production release now svn copy and applied limited patches to the branch for critical issues

lisp	scheme
and on top of that there are many implementations of common lisp or scheme

451730
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want to achieve the following using prism composite application library for wpf when one of the buttons is clicked i need to add a new tabitem to the tabcontrol and load and individual instance of the corresponding module application inside this tabitem

451882
profiling	benchmarking
as you progress through the development use benchmarking and profiling to determine the bottlenecks in the code and if needed you can bypass the orm and use manual queries where they are required

451916
gentoo	linux
the way i really learned my way around in linux was to install gentoo

451929
hide	show
thanks a lot dear now i am able to show the div but could t hide others

451929
hide	show
as you said all page disappear i have on container id formcontainer and other divs child of that id div under this id show hide and 1 show that is clicked

451931
hex	binary
hex is a human readable form of the binary the cpu actually uses

451941
entity-relationship	diagram
i ve also used some entity-relationship diagram tools to help me keep track of changes in db versions

451960
hide	show
we do something similar though we have the tab items already created with no content and show hide as appropriate

451967
min	max
i thought that they might be min average and max numbers but line 2 would seem to counter that idea

452037
vmware	esx
we have a mix of vmware esx vms and bare-metal os running app web and db servers and without a doubt the heaviest loaded dbms system is on bare-metal machine quad proc quad core etc.

452063
fish	bash
while sticking with bash might be best while just learning the fish shell might be a little bit easier to use

452109
vmware	virtualbox
i installed it on two machines using both vmware and virtualbox

452123
post	get
would resolve to a url in the get case -- post would work the same way though like this

452149
jobs	cron
for things that can take place out-of-band and have some delay such as report processing or video conversion i have a model called jobs and then use script runner combined with cron to call jobs.process_jobs every few minutes

452205
client-side	server-side
it s all client-side not server-side

452220
verilog	hdl
specifically this time around i am using a hdl language cyclicity cdl which is on sourceforge the documentation needs some help but the examples may get you going and it produces synthesizable verilog so you get an extra win there

452235
folder	directory
i usually just un-check create directory for solution so that it puts the sln file in the same folder and then i delete them by hand the first time i close the project

452260
memcpy	memset
if you use generic c and no libc calls write your own memcpy memset etc this code will run anywhere on the host for development and on the target

452344
hide	show
the show and hide events fire for visibility and this seems to work for the first descendant of a viewstack component but not further down the display tree

452390
put	get
if i put them in baz s onupdate function i m back to the original problem in that i d have to remember to tell baz s onupdate function to call bar s onupdate function otherwise bar s onupdate function wouldn t get called

452401
unsigned	short
the easiest way is to make a stub function that has the signature you want where uint16_t unsigned short we usually make the # of bits explicit

452401
cos	sin
i ve used assembly to optimize some control loop code that got executed frequently or to calculate sin cos and arctan

452450
hide	show
in either case the children of the object will not emit a show or hide event unless the object has specifically written an implementation to do so.

452461
hide	show
it s also true the show and hide events don t bubble by default so if you want to be notified of visibility changes in a descendant of a viewstack container you ll need to listen for them explicitly

452461
hide	show
you ll see the show and hide events for each label fire once their visible properties have been bound to their parent panels

452503
chunked	transfer-encoding
the utl_http package supports http 1.1 chunked transfer-encoding

452503
chunked	transfer-encoding
when the response body is returned in chunked transfer-encoding format as indicated in the response header the package automatically decodes the chunks and returns the response body in de-chunked format.

452527
expression-blend	silverlight
i think that expression-blend is an important tool when starting out with silverlight as the xaml writing doesn t come easy in the beginning and you have to concentrate more on the xaml errors than on the overall system of things and actual visual results

452553
rss	feed
i didn t realize until today that you can t get an rss feed for a stock quote

452564
getter	setter
also be wary of making every property in your domain model have public getter and setter

452601
folder	directory
the coverage_amounts.rb controller class admin coverageamountscontroller admincontroller is in app controllers admin - if i move it out it gives this on the next controller in the admin directory - so it appears to not like controllers in the admin folder

452608
filtering	grouping
at least that s what i d do i d just order by instead of grouping by and loop through the results to handle the grouping as a filtering done in the client language

452667
width	height
get height and width of image

452691
haskell	scheme
ask the long line of people who have tried to compile haskell ml modula-3 scheme and more using this technique

452780
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to either install asp or upgrade your versioning of vista to

452802
int	chars
you could return default k and that means you will return null if k is a reference type or 0 for int 0 for chars and so on.

452830
width	height
try giving the object element some width and height 1px by 1px and make it visible within the viewport when you attempt to communicate with the plugin via javascript

452830
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
safari and opera should work but firefox will definitely require the netscape style embed element and really you should provide both

452939
vim	emacs
if your text is from any half-way known program and is ever logged or stored in a file the text editors vim or emacs can do some very smart highlighting on it

452947
onchange	onkeydown	onchange	onblur	onkeydown	onblur
you ll be better off just using onchange or onblur instead of onkeydown

453059
ocp	principles
and in any case this is a bad design practice as it will break the ocp principles

453071
put	get
for the moment let s leave aside the fact that it derives from java.util.hashtable to start with which means it has get object and put object object despite the fact that properties are always strings.

453103
mouse	keyboard
these displays would provide at most mouse input but no keyboard

453132
wadl	wsdl
i think the main reason why wadl doesn t gain popularity is that it might bring back to life all those problem we had with soap and wsdl

453145
x86	64bit
finally if you re running 64bit windows then the working folder path for the command prompt would be c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 9.0 vc

453151
ssl	https
mongrel does not support ssl https directly

453151
ssl	https
if you really want to test https functionality you have to setup apache or another webserver with ssl https support using mod_ssl and configure it to run your rails application using mod_rails or mod_proxy

453153
folder	directory
remember to rename your zend framework containing folder to zend uppercase z to follow zf naming conversions then put your zend folder in your include directory

453171
int	double
i strongly suggest you avoid bit-manipulation of double using int operations

453171
int	double
on most modern cpus there is no direct means of moving data between double and int registers other than by taking a round trip to the dcache

453205
opera	firefox
if i remember correctly it is possible in the internet explorer maybe the site must be in the trusted zone but not in firefox or opera

453254
inherited	properties
of course consumers of ibar won t be able to get value of offset properties because inherited of ifoo doesn t change semantic of offset properties defined in ibar - compiler warns you for a reason

453254
inherited	properties
however consumers of class inherited from ibar interface will be able to get and set offset properties

453265
getter	setter
what you could do is having the ibar-interface having the getter and the setter there s really no point of not having this

453291
width	height
here for each page we read through each xobject of subtype image and get the width and height values

453300
bazaar	git
i m considering subversion bazaar and git

453305
freebsd	debian
ok so in the example the server runs freebsd and is sparky whereas the machine to be saved is under debian and is replica

453329
bash	zsh
the reason ipython hits the soft spots with me are very much because i generally like command prompts and especially nix-inspired prompts with inspiration from ksh csh yes chs is a monster but as a prompt it sport lots of really good features bash and zsh

453334
fossil	git	bazaar	git	bazaar	fossil	darcs	fossil
as a side effect i ve started myself on a small project to evaluate side by side subversion git bazaar mercurial monotone darcs and fossil though in a more general version management context merges and such

453334
bazaar	git
as to mercurial i didn t include it in my list because i have tried it previously and i felt that i liked bazaar better while git seems at first sight to have a great deal of power which admittedly i may not need

453413
width	height
where 320 width 240 height

453521
public	protected
dangerous attributes and methods of your class ones that might cause data loss should be non-public whether to make them protected or private is influenced by other factors with public methods used to provide a simpler safer interface

453563
int	boolean
in general though it s best to avoid runtime type checking and use as3 s primitives as defined in the docs boolean number int uint string

453595
abc	subclassing
protected the abc probably already has some pure virtual methods and therefore already can t be instantiated except as a subclassing

453601
post	get
even simple query requires two round-trips post then get

453622
ironruby	ironpython
django might be able to take advantage of .net via ironpython i don t know anything about this other than that ironpython exists - while ironruby is only on the way but not here yet

453634
antivirus	norton
i dl norton antivirus and gave my comp a scan no virus came up

453676
stateless	stateful
no guarantee of idempotence -- depends on whether the resource is stateful or stateless not cacheable

453751
kerberos	ntlm
so kerberos and ntlm are not mutually exclusive and ntlm is not obsoleted by kerberos

453751
kerberos	ntlm
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

453751
kerberos	ntlm
note that when mentioning kerberos and ntlm in the same breath i have to also mention spengo and integrated windows authentication iwa

453751
kerberos	ntlm
iwa is a simple term that basically means kerberos or ntlm or spnego to negotiate kerberos or ntlm

453751
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
but until recently implementing kerberos and ntlm have been difficult so using ldap as a make-shift authentication service has persisted

453773
equals	tostring
tostring touint32 p is equals to p and touint32 p is not equals to 2 32 âˆ 1

453783
cvs	svn
its easy to use for anyone who has ever used svn or cvs if you have not you have no business doing business in etc on my production machines

453792
base	fractions	integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
if you store something with an index that is not a nonnegative integer it s alphanumeric negative or a floating-point number with a fractions piece it will fail on the array-index store and default to the object which is array s base class store which then converts the argument to a string and stores by string index -- but these stored properties are not seen by the array class and therefore are not visible to its methods properties length join slice splice push pop etc

453802
hash	md5
what i want to is to genate them to md5 hash

453832
hash	md5
alternatively you could keep an md5 hash of the .proto file the last time protogen was executed and only execute protogen if the .proto file has changed - even less to do on each build

453871
post	get
http protocol get post

453879
inherited	subclassing
i believe the consensus is that for typical application classes winform subclassing one-off utility classes et al there is no need to consider reuse of any kind much less reuse via inherited while for library classes it is critical to consider reuse via inherited in the design

453902
children	parent
the former selects all descendant para elements that are the first para children of their parent

453902
children	parent
will produce two nodes because both bars are first children of their respective parent

453920
inherited	subclassing
if a type is meant to be immutable it shouldn t allow inherited - because a subclassing can easily be mutable

453950
mouse	keyboard
function fnidletime will tell you how many seconds it has been since the user touched the mouse or keyboard

454010
width	height
the following function demonstrates a client that assumes that setting the width of a rectangle leaves the height unchanged

454025
simulink	labview
to answer the simulink portion of your question it is a simulation environment that mainly uses block diagram programming much like labview

454025
matlab	simulink
simulink is an additional package beyond vanilla matlab and can come with all sorts of further additional packages called blocksets that have a library of blocks for a specific simulation area like the signal processing blockset or the aerodynamics blockset

454071
x86	mips
i m interested into delving into x86 assembly and i have heard that is somewhat harder even my mips textbook says this

454121
x86	mips
x86 have more complex instructions than mips

454121
x86	mips
x86 have more exceptions for register usage than mips that you have to keep in mind but nothing worth whining about constantly

454218
ada	pascal
to me inner classes -- at least private inner classes -- look a lot like inner procedures in pascal modula-2 ada they allow to break down a main class in smaller parts in order to ease the understanding

454274
pop-up	dialog
i am creating a matching game for android and when the user gets a match a dialog box should pop-up saying match

454321
put	get
put the code on powerpoint slides looks pretty bad and unless it s an image i can t get syntax highlighting to work

454337
postgresql	mysql
i have been using python with rdbms mysql and postgresql and i have noticed that i really do not understand how to use a cursor

454355

it works perfectly on internet explorer but it doesn t do anything in google-chrome and i get show and hide behavior in firefox

454365
fadein	fadeout
try fadeout from the callback of fadein

454371
fadein	fadeout
second try chaining the fadein and fadeout calls together

454409
minimum	max
you could instead take a max of scrollheight and a minimum height value you have predefined or calculated from textarea.rows

454427
comm	cmp
i see that comm diff cmp all allow to pass either two files or a file and standard input - i guess that s good if i don t want to output two files...but it s still kinda sucks

454443
postgresql	mysql
based on my understanding django would manage both the view and controller pieces and postgresql or mysql would handle the data

454443
postgresql	mysql
basically i d be looking at an architecture of django php python sqlalchemy postgresql mysql

454487
folder	directory
here are two support documents that assist 1. with the setup of virtual directory 1 and 2. how to manage folder permissions in iis 2

454499
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you have lots of range and are really concerned about performance you could create an avl type of tree consisting of the range min max pairs but sorted on the lowest part of the range

454519
ubuntu	debian
for instance the reason debian and its derivatives ubuntu etc. is so good is that you can happily use your system without ever having to install something outside the repositories and that everything on it is thoroughly tested

454551
postgresql	mysql
based on my understanding django would manage both the view and controller pieces and postgresql or mysql would handle the data

454587
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
lots of people point to textmate but the reality is among many in the rails cabal the move has been to abandoning textmate and moving to either emacs or vim

454588
classname	inherited
inherited and classname must point to different classes in the namespace

454588
classname	inherited
if your control inherited from mycompany.web.controls.productshower make your classname be something like that mycompany.web.controls.productshowercontrol that s how we name controls

454598
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails 3 is an attempt to cut down on the magic pull in many parts of merb and clean things up

454697
versioning	upgrade
then if the admin chooses to perform and upgrade your application won t need to know anything other than the url to the xml file and the current versioning number

454706
width	height
so this means not setting the height and width of the

454706
width	height
with a width and height

454733
groupbox	panel
add a groupbox or a panel if you dont create the illusion of there s nothing there

454790
pop-up	dialog
furter to nelson laquet you could put window.print in the onload attribute of the body tag so that the print dialog pop-up at page load

454839
post	get
for the sake of accuracy the above post by russell is correct until you get to 25 days difference then the number becomes too large for the int variable

454914
ubuntu	debian
apt-get install qemu installs qemu on debian ubuntu

454938
firefox	safari
i generally like to have a stylesheet for standards-compliant browsers such as firefox and safari and then use conditional comments to detect internet explorer and serve it an additional css file containing ie-specific fixes and overrides

455097
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
because the spweb and spsite objects keep an internal list that is derived in this way disposing of the object may cause the sharepoint object model to behave unpredictably

455152
liferay	alfresco
you can take a look at bitnami for a number of java applications like alfresco jroller and liferay that have been packaged using bitrock

455163
globalization	localization
read asp.net globalization and localization and asp.net globalization and localization both from msdn

455166
redmine	trac
our bitnami project website provides free one-click installers for a number of open source projects that include integration with subversion and all the dependencies that are needed to run ruby on rails in the case of redmine python in the case of trac and so on

455166
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	trac	mantis
the installers are self-contained they won t touch your system and take literally minutes to install or uninstall so you can easily test-drive redmine mantis trac etc

455176
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian
although some of the other posts mention a number of tools that you could use in your scripts the problem is that every linux distribution is a bit different and simple tasks like adding an user or installer a service are suddenly non-trivial when you need to do them across debian ubuntu mandriva redhat gentoo etc

455180
globalization	localization
globalization and localization demystified in asp.net 2.0

455242
emacs	aquamacs
i tried aquamacs before and it feels too different from the command line emacs for me

pull	push
i have access to a server where i push pull my work to through ssh and this is my main projects repository which is pretty safe with raid 1 and regular backups

455599
width	height
it could still be helpful to know the exact height and width of the string so you can position it exactly where you want it and draw other ui items around it

455619
opera	firefox
unfortunately as far as i know there is no opera internet explorer webkit equivalent - this addon is only available for firefox 3 firefox 2 and firefox 3.1 beta are not supported .

gone through cvs svn before and now i feel it requires less work than it saves me from

455774
opera	firefox
the fact that your media query for opera works could very well mean it ll end up working for firefox too once that supports media queries

455876
spweb	spsite
so in your example you should not dispose either the spweb or spsite object

455876
spweb	spsite
as it has already been said it is a must to dispose instances of spweb and spsite that you create yourself new

455876
spweb	spsite
if you use try finally it is best practice to check for null on your spweb spsite instance and check for spweb first as spsite automatically will dispose your spweb

455884
getter	setter
in this answer to a recent question i was advised to be wary of making every property in your domain model have public getter and setter

455922
notepad++	scite
it is possible i suppose if you re a masochist to just use a text editor like scite notepad++ emacs vi or whatever and code a sharepoint site entirely by hand

455958
hide	show
when a user clicks on a checkbox i want to hide show the corresponding column in the table

455970
free	realloc
you can realloc or free an individual line later while using the array

456000
tabcontrol	tabitem
so i add the contextmenu to tabitem instead of tabcontrol and bind commandtarget to the tabitem

456049
bazaar	svn
i m using svn at work and now i m switching to bazaar bazaar maybe for the wrong reasons

456049
pull	push
bzr was the only distributed vcs able to interact with a subversion server in a bidirectional way pull and push

456049
bazaar	svn
now for my home project i m still using bazaar because it s easier to setup a new repository than with svn

456108
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
when i only bind the checkbox lists when the postbackcontrol is the dropdownlistfor the controls never get bound since everything in the update panel is dropping out of scope

456140
edifact	x12
an example in 2001 i wrote a library in c to translate edifact edi messages into ansi x12 messages

456269
width	height
although the best width may by 1024 you ll have to adjust height for account for various browser settings navigation toolbar bookmark toolbar status toolbar etc and account for taskbar settings

456274
width	height
i just want to change the height width attributes if this is possible

456288
jobs	cron
it handles failover and fine grained repartition of jobs with the same flexibility of cron jobs

456313
spweb	spsite
when working with spsite and spweb however you definitely want to call dispose as soon as you can

456313
spweb	spsite
each spweb and spsite object holds a

456314
int	double
it depends on whether you want to validate that your string contains a double or a int

456322
rss	feed
it s called rsspect written by ryan north of qwantz fame which will detect changes to any website and create an rss feed out of it even if you don t control the page

456325
hash	md5
you could generate a md5 hash of each of them then compare that

456447
powerpc	i386
if you have set your project to be a universal app containing both powerpc and i386 binaries then you will get two errors warnings provided that the error warning applies to both architectures

456455
folder	directory
while it s true that dlls are primarily installed copied into the same folder as the .exe the requirement is to adhere to the loaders loading rules which includes system folder bad idea path current directory see loadlibrary api help documentation for a full description of precedence

456500
freemarker	velocity
i prefer freemarker here over velocity

456500
freemarker	velocity
check out freemarker vs velocity

456500
freemarker	velocity
if you are using spring then you may be interested in using velocity or freemarker with spring framework

456565
pull	push
when you commit you re only committing to your local repo so to get changes collaborations must either a pull from your local repo or b pull from some other accessible repo to which you have pushed your changes using git push

456601
mouse	keyboard
it would also receive a digital packed from the second processor containing the mouse keyboard input sent from the client

456601
mouse	keyboard
it would send the compressed monitor output to the correct clients and also receive the keyboard mouse input which would be dispatched to the second processor

456623
cup	ocamlyacc	bison	ocamlyacc	bison	cup
i ve used bison for c c++ cup for java and ocamlyacc for ocaml and they re all pretty good

456686
put	get	post	put	post	get
this is done by using the http methods post get put delete

456686
post	get
we take these 4 methods and think of them in terms of database interaction as create read update delete but on the web we use post and get because that is what anchor tags support currently

456686
post	get
so treating post and get as our create read update delete crud then we can design routes in our web application that will be able to deduce what action of crud we are achieving

456709
jar	manifest.mf
you can access them in the main method of main-class mentioned in the manifest.mf file of a jar

456756
moq	typemock
checkout mocking frameworks like rhinomock moq or typemock

456776
jtextpane	jeditorpane
you should try to use jeditorpane or jtextpane instead

456811
inline	inlining
you may want to disable inlining too as otherwise i guess there s a possibility that a smart compiler would notice you calling the function without using the return value and inline it to nothing

456819
cpu	affinity
on a multicore system be sure to either spawn the loop like this in multiple threads one for each cpu or execute the process multiple times and to make the scheduling predictable assign thread process affinity explicitly

456820
folder	directory
something like finding the directory of the executable won t work simply because the start-up folder item that starts your program is likely to be a shortcut to it so you won t have that path

456889
cvs	svn
the settings can be saved with the other project files cvs svn git whatever

456918
getter	setter
it s good practice to expose the instance of this class as a singleton and exposing the application variables you re initializing using getter and setter

456919
put	get
edit in your example recursion depth is prevented by the number of lives so that seems ok as this won t get bigger than 1000 or even 100 - this is exactly why i have considered it but now i can see it was a rather stupid idea i wonder who put this in an example program .

456942
int	boolean
i want to make a function that receives this matrix and a point where a zero is stored and that transforms every zero in the same area into a 2 suppose the matrix can store any int even it is initially boolean

457060
innodb	myisam
i have just changed a lot of the tables from myisam to innodb

457065
base-class	subclassing	inherited	base-class	inherited	subclassing
one option would be to use inherited and a protected modifier but having an internal constructor on the base-class so that external code can t subclassing it

457084
for-loop	loops
the enhanced for-loop doesn t do anything to try to release resources at the end of loops

457102
for-loop	loops
i would expect a for-loop to generally have a fixed number of iterations and the only part of the for-loop condition that changes to be loops variable i

457258
cassini	iis
iis and cassini are not the same and not exposing your code to production conditions can cause you problems

457273
lisp	smalltalk
it also grabs ideas from lisp and smalltalk

457306
ubuntu	linux
furthermore a previous incarnation of this project ran slapd on ubuntu linux on a dual-core server

457308
int	boolean
additionally each one only stores two int x and y coordinates and a boolean so they are going to be very small objects in the grand scheme of things

457362
post	get
i have some post actions on my controller that are hit from a pair of get actions

457454
vb.net	vb6
i have inherited a rather large project consisting of an application written in vb6 and several dll s and activex controls written in vb6 vb.net 1.1 and vb.net 2

457454
vb.net	vb6
my main vb6 application i will call it alpha has a configuration file alpha.exe.cnfig which contains settings used by my vb.net 1.1 dll which i will call bravo

457511
post	get
if you want to follow that process you can use firefox live http headers extension or wireshark to view full http headers and actions get post

457596
uilabel	uitextview
on receiving the data i set the values of uilabel and uitextview

457596
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel values appear fine but the uitextview sometimes do not show the value until i move to subview or scroll up and down to revisit the area contaning uitextview

457596
uilabel	uitextview
i m showing uilabel and uitextview objects in uitableviewcell

457596
uilabel	uitextview
i call tableview reloaddata right after setting values in uilabel and uitextview but i do not re-create the uitableviewcell

457614
jsr168	jsr286
this involves lot of portlets and i am inclined to use jsr286 specs rather than jsr168

457696
jexcelapi	jxl
in java with either jexcelapi jxl or apache poi

457728
width	margin
you could also set the first element to float left the third to float right and the second with a margin equal to the width of the first element

457811
stdout	stderr
the exceptions are stdin stdout and stderr which your process did not open

457814
getter	setter
some of my classes have final fields that are populated from the constructor as well as properties that can be assigned from getter and setter

457867
getter	setter
then you can have the normal setter getter based as usual

457927
squash	merge
in fact our workflow is a little different as we tend to do squash merge instead of raw merge

457927
squash	merge	squash	branch
squash merge controversy - as several commenters have pointed out the squash merge will throw away all history on your feature branch

457976
redhat	fedora
if you re familiar with how redhat enterprise linux differs from fedora you can consider the difference to be quite similar

457988
pull	push
avoiding git disasters a gory story about the dangers of git push --force instead of a git pull --rebase for instance

458009
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
for the same reason it is probably a good idea to fflush or possibly to close stdout and stderr if you write to them

458049
http.sys	httplistener
httplistener hooks into http.sys even without iis i believe

458098
datamapper	activerecord
it feels like i am convoluting the activerecord pattern with other stuff like datamapper

458172
int	double
design-wise you should try to avoid converting nsdecimalnumber or nsdecimals to and from int float and double values for the same reasons it s recommended you use nsdecimalnumbers loss of precision and binary floating point representation issues

458172
int	double
if you have to input from an int float or double you could do something like the following

458194
outputstream	inputstream
when calling a web service method which includes a datahandler clients can write to the outputstream and on the server side you can read from the inputstream

458225
superclass	subclassing
ok so i m trying to make a nice superclass for data-access objects that can generate a tsql query to search all of the subclassing s public string properties

458255
post	get
get and post

458285
cvs	svn
quite a few hosting services -- even cheap shared hosts -- have the svn or cvs client installed

458310
getter	setter
i also have getter and setter to deal with this dictionary

458310
getter	setter
my goal then is to provide transparent access inside ironpython to this getter and setter as if they were real properties of a class

458314
post	get
you can t write a one-size-fits-all validation function for get post data

458318
mouse	keyboard
plus if you implement this your computer will have two ip addresses - one to control the video keyboard and mouse and another to say access files etc

458318
mouse	keyboard
this doesn t solve the problem you are thinking of but i think you d be better off implementing a thin client which only connects to a vnc server and processes the keyboard mouse commands then encodes them to vnc compatible ethernet commands and displays the video data on an attached monitor

458335
playstation	wii
motion sensing nintendo wii controller or to a lesser degree sixaxis controller for playstation 3

458360
ilmerge	reflector
short term though you may have to go with ilmerge or reflector + copy code

458379
post	get
when i post this suggestion i nearly always get a complaint about exception performance

458413
opera	safari
the css3 text-shadow is ultimately what i m after but of course only safari opera not yet released ff3.1 out of the major browsers support it

458436
puts	gets
which gets rid of all folders and puts all files in the target folder and its subfolders into a single zip file

458466
hide	show
yes i would like to show hide divs and such

458478
folder	directory
after adding some imports your code runs fine for me how do you call the script maybe you could tell us the folder structure of the .. packed bin directory

458511
hide	show
if you mean you want to show hide divs and such that s much easier using css and javascript

458514
hide	show
what you probably want to do is change css property display of the element to none to hide the element and change it back to block or inline to show it again

458525
boost	stl
edit i can use only stl and not boost old compilers

458558
ubuntu	linux
i m working on linux system ubuntu 7.04 server with a 2.6.20 kernel

458558
terminate	timeout
if i do this while thread1 is blocked in a select with a timeout then the select will not terminate immediately but will eventually timeout properly

458662
chown	sudo
you need to run chown as root directly or through sudo

458715
google-chrome	firefox
i m having a hard time figuring out how firefox and google-chrome determining what fields are for a password and how they autocomplete them on other forms

458715
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on firefox and google-chrome but not in internet explorer

458726
ready	each
for example the following should log the # of ms it took each image to load from the moment the dom was ready

458776
awt	swing
i think a swing awt component must have focus for this to work

458846
put	get
at the moment i have put a property for both in icommand and i get each subclass to implement those properties and just have a return blah blah blah statement in them

458854
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups is a notable exception

458855
versioning	upgrade
which would mean that you have to change your code if you want to upgrade to the final versioning

458869
sse	avx
intel is set to release a new instruction set called avx which includes an extension of sse to 256-bit operation

458973
google-chrome	firefox
seems that changing name and id attributes has no effect on the password managers in firefox and google-chrome all they see is a password_field and the field above it and that is good enough for them

458984
post	get
if you really need to send new custom data every time i would suggest sending it through a get or a post preferably

459061
perforce	cvs
this is roughly equivalent to the workflow in cvs or subversion. you would synchronize your working copy go off and develop and then ask perforce to figure out what you did while it wasn t watching

459096
integer	unsigned
an ipv4 address can be stored as a four-byte unsigned integer an uint in c#

459096
integer	unsigned
an ipv6 address can be an eight-byte unsigned integer an ulong in c#

459185
cvs	rcs
if you have to have subversion cvs or rcs crud in your source file

459217
equinox	knopflerfish
springsource dm server is based on the equinox osgi framework and should not be confused with the spring dm technology included in dm server which can run on equinox apache felix and knopflerfish

459232
folder	directory
in my project bin directory i created the folder nl

459233
free	malloc
but let s say i want to test a dynamic memory structure with a lot off malloc and free

459233
put	get
and it turns out that i can put data in and get correct data back out again

459234
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer an ulong in c#

459252
client-side	server-side
server-side javascript is an interesting idea because of the client-side validation problem you want to do validation client-side to avoid sending needless requests to your server

459302
hide	show
with .show replaced with hide for the show less function

459302
fadein	hide
however if i try to replace the .show hide with fadein .fadeout ie renders it as almost identical to .show hide except it takes a minute for hide to take effect

459306
jquery	scriptaculous
since both jquery and scriptaculous work by changing the underlying css i think it s safe to say that any javascript implementation is going to be computationally expensive

459312
innodb	myisam
i created these tables as myisam but have since changed all three to innodb because i read that myisam doesn t support foreign keys

459323
lisp	scheme
i am looking for a version of scheme or even lisp that i can use to recover some lost lisp development skills

459376
subtract	add
you can also add or subtract date components if you really need to

459378
firefox	safari
this code works in firefox but not in safari

459397
scheme	racket
plt scheme is now known as racket but i haven t experimented with it after the change.

459400
qtabwidget	qtabbar
until then the only way to get close buttons is to subclass qtabwidget or qtabbar and add it manually possible but not trivial

459441
post	get
when you get a doget or dopost call in a servlet you can use getparameterxxx to get either the query string or the post data in one easy place

459441
post	get
if the call was a post you get the post data all parsed out for you

459441
post	get
if you specify a fully qualified or partially qualified url for the action param everything works great if you don t the browser will call the same url as it did on the previous page submit and if there happens to be query string data there you ll get that as well as post data and there s no way to tell them apart

459441
post	get
i m looking through the request object i see where the post data comes from i m just trying to figure out where the get data comes from so i can erase the get data on a post call and erase the post data on a get call before it parses it out if possible

459474
pdcurses	ncurses
you can always use this tutorial for ncurses and change the #include from ncurses.h to curses.h in order to use pdcurses

459481
post	get
the httpservletrequest.getparameterxxx methods don t distinguish between get and post parameters

459481
post	get
if you really need to distinguish between them you ll need to parse them manually using getquerystring for the get parameters and getinputstream getreader for the post data

459485
post	get
i don t know of any clean way to distinguish between get and post parameters but you can access the raw query string using the getquerystring method of httpservletrequest and you can access the raw post data using the getinputstream method of servletrequest

459485
post	get
i m looking at the tomcat api docs specifically here although i think those are both part of the standard servlet api then you could parse the post data and get data separately if you want

459495
vb.net	vb6
it lets you create usercontrols in vb.net which you can then add to vb6

459547
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the javascript engine just isn t anywhere near safari or firefox or google-chrome

459547
width	height
opacity height computed height element width + border + padding screen position are all good places to start

459690
int	boolean
you could convert the boolean to a 1 or 0 using intval or cast it with int or int

459690
int	double
according to mysqli_stmt bind_param s documentation the only types you may bind are int double strings and blobs

459725
free	malloc
malloc free 33 allocs 30 frees 84 109 bytes allocated

459725
free	malloc
malloc free 2 allocs 2 frees 3 200 000 bytes allocated

459757
int	boolean
null is essentially the zero address and is treated as such in comparisons and i believe would be promoted to an int for the boolean check

459806
int	boolean
null means nothing neither true or false or a boolean value or int or string

459826
hash	md5
you can hash your sql query using md5 and use that as a lookup key before going to database

459854
cpu	processors
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processors was booted

459899
width	margin
it adds the margin onto this such that the element has 100 width

459899
width	margin
if you want to get around this add a div or something above the nested table with a margin 3em and you can leave the width of the table at 100

459918
textview	imageview
i have a cocoa app i m writing that has an imageview with a textview as a subview sitting on top of the imageview

459918
textview	imageview
i have two functions one that updates the image in the imageview and one that updates the text in the textview

459953
put	get
you ll need to either hard code a value to put in that column or query the sys.columns catalog view and get the default value for the column you are inserting into and use that value there

460062
ready	each
if have multiple independent developments each group should have there on branch which they should sync with trunc periodically and merge it back to trunk when ready

460133
inherited	properties
given the names i would have expected subtest to inherited from test and thus automatically expose the text properties but thankfully i have forgotten vbscript so i can t remember if it even supports inherited

460168
put	get
if all else fails put it in a while loop and keep generating it until you get one that works

460220
hex	binary
you can use windows calculator to see how integers is presented in different forms hex and binary in your case

460352
versioning	upgrade
as novemberborn himself pointed out i did upgrade sifr to versioning 3 whereas the jquery plugin only supports v2

460360
springsource	grails
i also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib such as jasper report jawr etc and i am glad that now they join with springsource which makes their base solid

460375
jar	manifest.mf
you should have a meta-inf manifest.mf file in your jar

460412
post	get
honestly though the easiest thing to do if you re posting statistical data on a website is get the data into spss or sas or another statistics package format and post those files for download directly

460460
width	height
it doesn t make the window really maximized but makes the browserwindow the maximum height and width

460476
fiddler	charles
it s also worth checking your http traffic using fiddler or charles it might help you get a better idea of what is going on

460479
post	get
i ll post my code when i get back from an inauguration party

460488
implements	extends
or by using interface implements instead of class extends

460592
ubuntu	linux
this one is for ubuntu linux - prints the number of connections to the mysql server

460618
opera	firefox
2 the is firefox extension which you can add to view wml pages with firefox or you can use opera which supports wml natively

460634
mouseover	mouseout
the problem is that when currently sorting when i m currently dragging a list item mouseover mouseout events do not seem to be firing for any object on the page

460669
ubuntu	linux
i happen to have my hands on a ubuntu linux box and a deskjet printer hp5150 but could probably use windows or possibly get another printer if absolutely required

460687
profiler	vtune
this kind of optimization depends on hardware architecture so you better use some kind of platform-specific profiler like intel vtune to detect possible problems with cache

460717
profiling	instrumentation
there are two common profiling strategies for vm-based languages anyway instrumentation and sampling

460717
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation inserts checkpoints and informs the profiling every time a method starts and finished

460729
profiling	debugging
this kind of sampling profiling can work with standard binaries but are more useful if you have debugging symbols to work out lines of code given addresses in the program

460729
profiling	instrumentation
other profiling involve recompiling the program to insert instructions known as instrumentation to count how often each continuous set of instructions basic blocks are executed or maybe even record the sequence in which basic blocks are executed or record the content of variables at certain places

460776
textview	imageview
i m not sure this is the best option since it means doubling the memory usage for a couple of seconds but you could meaning not necessarily should create a new imageview and a new textview each with opacity zero and identical to the originals with the new text and image of course and then fade out the old ones and fade in the new ones

460778
pull	push
every week the project manager might pull changes from each team into his central repository merge them and push them back out to his teams central repositories

460782
content-length	content-type
wrong content-type content-length could freak flash player

460803
width	height
the problem is spans are inline elements and you can t set width or height on inline elements

460823
move	drag
move drag drop is nice but can be hard to program

460847
boost	stl
note i can t use boost only standard stl

460851
ncover	nant
software we used for this was nant cruisecontrol.net a custom code generation system custom app to build an oracle schema and ncover for the code analysis

460871
hide	show
back to proposal 2 build a complete report will all expected data to be displayed then hide show the different sections of the report

460954
kde	gnome
gnome and kde look to be implementing a dbus approach to this problem but in my opinion even if it becomes widespread it isn t yet widespread enough to rely on it in 3rd party code it s not the right approach

461016
wicket	stripes
otherwise i would suggest wicket stripes or spring mvc

461016
wicket	stripes
stripes is probably the simplest of the three spring is a little complicated and wicket is conceptually different from the other two

461050
put	get
alternatively you can just put the text in the html page hidden for example and get it from there.

461112
scrollable	panels
i would also like to make the panels vertically scrollable

461148
modula-2	oberon
even an oberon or modula-2 compiler is similar in complexity to pascal

461166
lua	scheme
python scheme and lua all come to mind

461167
width	height
edit i do not have local access to the image and the image url is in a variable with is output with img src ... i need a way to specify the values of width and height tags

461170
forth	brainfuck
write a brainfuck or forth compiler

461172
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
for example under the bonnet and out of sight code might use things like reflection.emit dynamicmethod delegate.createdelegate to generate dynamic but highly optimized code

461186
opera	safari
cross browser applications can be used by opera and safari as well

461220
pdfsharp	itextsharp
so far i had a quick look at itextsharp and at pdfsharp but it doesn t seem like these are the right tools for the job as they focus most on altering and printing pdfs

461223
width	height
if you have to keep the aspect ratio of the image intact then you should scale it by a factor so that the longer side of the image height or width fits inside the limitations for that side

461270
getter	setter
through any number of levels of getter setter

461297
ubuntu	linux
at least with sun jre 1.6 on linux you get interesting if not always informative error messages peregrino is netbook running 32 bit ubuntu with 2g ram and no swap

461408
width	height
what i found out was that flash will sometimes give a width and height of 0 for a short period of time

consistency	acid
there are explicit and implicit transactions if you do not start a transaction explicit sql server will start an implicit transaction for you this is necessary to make it acid atomicity consistency isolation durability

461422
post	put
if you put your repeater inside an update panel when your delete post back is fired the update panel will only refresh what ever is inside that update panel

461422
post	get
if you get it working without ajax whole page post back and then add the update panel it should work straight out of the box

461448
ant	maven
the ant script that the maven-ant-plugin executes is not really aware of maven as such

461448
ant	maven	maven	cargo
it should also be possible to execute a second instance of maven from inside ant which runs purely the cargo goal but in that case you might encounter problems with locked files and the like

461450
width	height
we are using the stage dimensions to scale the contents to width 0 and height 0 in this case

461452
profiler	vtune	profiler	aqtime
if you re having problems using vtune try aqtime profiler from automatedqa instead

461490
subtract	add
in general though there are plenty of times where it makes sense to add or subtract one

461508
jboss	weblogic
another way of looking at this problem is that you want an application depoyable in both spring dm server and a traditional app server websphere weblogic jboss ...

461541
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
when developing in .net a developer can choose from several unit testing frameworks such as mstest - nunit mbunit xunit etc

461616
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if that s the case can t you solve your problem by using an autoresetevent or manualresetevent depending on what behavior you want

461638
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried numerous browsers ie firefox and google-chrome but they all have the same amount of information

461661
xslt	xquery
burst-mode streaming is available in both xslt and xquery but there

461661
xslt	xquery
is no equivalent in xquery to the xslt iterate construct

461666
ant	maven
take time to put in place a good build process ant maven in the java world

461697
folder	directory
since you mention you don t have access to anything but the code behind and the page the only thing i can think of is actually creating those directory if you have access to do that and using a server.transfer page passing the value to your actual page in the folder above

461738
hash	salt
you could even salt your key before you hash it which would make it virtually unbreakable by making the key unpredictable

461770
google-chrome	firefox
and indeed works as expected at least in windows tested with ie firefox and google-chrome

461797
ant	maven	maven	cargo
cargo is not only a maven plugin it also has a java api and an ant task

461800
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
while i believe crypt is using the md5 algorithm the outputs are not valid md5 hash

461800
crypt	md5
i m pretty sure the crypt function used is using some sort of md5 algorithm

461800
hash	md5
what i m looking to do is convert the ouput that i have into an md5 hash that looks something like the following

461819
client-side	server-side
you could use javascript to create an ajax request to a server-side processing script but allowing js to directly write to disk - either client-side or server-side - would be a massive nasty glaring unforgivable browser security hole

461845
crypt	salt
crypt function and will accept salt

461852
hash	md5
calculates the md5 hash of str using the â rsa data security inc

461852
hash	md5
md5 message-digest algorithm and returns that hash

461862
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	hash	salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
1 indeed means that this is a md5 hash but crypt generates a random salt

461862
hash	salt
the salt is base64 encoded in the output as the hash

461868
post	get
actions that modify resources should be done via post not get

461869
pop-up	dialog
i can avoid most dialog pop-up using the following code

461912
slideup	slidedown
i have two divs and two separate links that triggers slidedown and slideup for the divs

461946
hide	show
one interesting issue i ve found is that i ve had complications with using the visibility property of .net controls when trying to show hide them in this manner

461947
puts	gets
many people believe that synchronizing on puts to a map not a concurrentmap but say a hashmap and not synchronizing on gets is sufficient

462013
textarea	textbox
textbox -- mode multiline is textarea

462024
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
among the reasons sometimes given are that doing so does not require shifting on most keyboards that the words are more readable when they are separated and that camel case may simply not be reliably preserved in case-insensitive or case-folding languages such as common lisp that while technically a case-sensitive language canonicalizes folds identifiers to uppercase by default

462080
idictionary	ilist
without generic ilist or idictionary seem not to work

462089
hide	show
you could possibly find the other divs you d like to hide and put them in a print style sheet so they don t show up when going to print

462117
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
a 1.x panel will render as a div in ie6+ - however in firefox or other downstream browsers - considered downstream because there were no details of it in the machine.config by default it will render as a single cell table - this could be resolved by supplying updated browsercaps for firefox opera safari etc either in the machine.config or web.configs

462128
folder	directory
name of a file directory or folder as it would be displayed in a system file browser

462190
int	chars
is a pointer to a member function of a class fred that returns an int and takes a chars and a float

462207
width	height
as others have mentioned your sprite-bg element needs to have either some content to give it a height width or have those properties specified in the css thusly

462241
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
you use an abstract-class when you want to define some shared behaviour in a superclass - but that class can t stand on its own it needs to be subclassing

462279
width	margin
when you add a margin part of the width is taken up by the margin so part of the tab gets cut off

462329
post	put
this post sums up what s required to implement the permission calculation and should be enough to put you off from doing this

462332
post	get
i wrote a blog post about how to get started embedding lua and c# might be worth to check out

462351
inherited	subclassing
that way anyone who is happy with the default implementation in the abstract-class can quickly subclassing it without rewriting a lot of code but anyone who needs to do something more complex or who needs to inherited from a different base class can still implement the interface and be plug-and-play

462389
bazaar	git
there are ways around this but with git bazaar mercurial this simply doesn t happen - they realize whether the commits have already been merged because they id each commit across the merging paths it takes

462396
do-while	break
can also use an unlabeled break to terminate a for while or do-while

462396
do-while	break
while or do-while statement but a labeled break terminates an outer

i will use a good blog post or 2 to get me going then some trial and error

462486
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

462486
equals	gethashcode
derived classes that override gethashcode must also override equals to guarantee that two objects considered equals have the same hash code

462513
equals	gethashcode
not directly answering your question but - if you use resharper do not forget it has a feature that generates a reasonable gethashcode implementation as well as the equals method for you

462542
exslt	libxslt
the only option i know of is to directly use libxslt which supports xslt 1.0 and some of the exslt extensions

462547
vundle	pathogen
there is also a vundle pathogen plugin that uses the same code but is easier to install and keeps your .vimrc clean

462562
processors	hyperthreading
the only disadvantage of hyperthreading that i can think of is the fact that if the os is not aware of it it might schedule two threads on one physical processors when other physical processors are idle which will degrade performance

462567
equals	gethashcode
on the other hand msdn also states that the return value of gethashcode should be equals for 2 objects if those 2 objects are considered to be equals

462567
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object

462567
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

462572
put	get
if the cost is reasonable they aren t going to put an unreasonable amount of effort into using it anyway so you don t need to get into overly restrictive measures

462581
cpu	hyperthreading
the threads in a hyperthreading cpu share the same cache and as such don t suffer from the cache consistency problems that a multiple cpu architecture can

462611
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading will mainly make a difference in the scheduler behaviour performance when dispatching threads to the same cpu as opposed to different cpu.

462614
nginx	lighttpd
proxy setups using nginx lighttpd etc. and fundamental design decisions are likely going to overwhelm the framework s inherent characteristics pretty quickly

462627
cpu	hyperthreading
so aside from the fact that hyperthreading s extra cores aren t real in the strictly technical sense and don t have the full performance of real cpu cores i can t see that it d be any less reliable

462627
cpu	hyperthreading
of course it depends on what you re running - i suppose some applications might get down dirty with the cpu and hyperthreading might confuse them but that s probably pretty rare

462629
try-catch	exception-handling
client code has to handle this kind of exception-handling enforced in the compiler via try-catch or throws clause

462629
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception all classes that inherit from runtimeexception

462722
textwrangler	bbedit
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler

462727
getter	setter
it s not enough to create object in ib if it s a new entity it has to be connected to a real ivar in file s owner with properly synthetised getter setter

462732
min	max
i would use bsr and bsf to determine the min and max bit set in the number

462735
vsto	add-in
among these items is a word 2003 add-in vsto 2005 se .net 2.0 that reportedly had been working fine in 2007 but our deployment environment calls for 2003

462735
vsto	add-in
created a clean vsto 2005 add-in for word 2003 new add-in name clean slate

462742
client-side	server-side
the help files explain how to profile com dll s isapi dll s and even client-side scripting but not a word on how to profile the server-side script running on the asp pages

462761
intersect	contains
in oracle we can use functions like sdo_geom.relate or sdo_relate to find out the spatial relationship between two objects contains touches intersect etc.

462766
vsto	add-in
a shared add-in or a vsto

462766
vsto	add-in
however even if you use vsto for word the add-in still looks like a classic com add-in which is extending the classic idtextensibility2 interface

462814
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql i d be surprised if they did not behave more like ids than db2

462830
textwrangler	bbedit
my vote would be for bbedit s free little brother textwrangler

462866
opera	firefox
pointed example does work in ie and should work in firefox unfortunately doesn t work in opera

mathml	mathjax
for a web interface you can also use the jsmath javascript or it s successor mathjax library as a latex mathml renderer

462934
webrat	cucumber
webrat has selenium support built in and we ve used selenium before but i m curious if anyone has had good results using watir with cucumber and what the pros and cons are of watir versus selenium

462995
width	height
fillrectangle drawrectangle fillelipse and drawellipse all can take 4 float or single parameters x y width height

463018
children	parent
i ve got a feeling it s because the columns are sized based on children but by sizing the element based on it s parent i ve created a catch 22

463054
min	max
similarly by replacing min with max i can get the oldest

463067
width	height
analyze the height and width of the element

463107

463180
throttling	throttle
what i was wondering basically is if there is any way to do broker rather than consumer side throttling or some other solution whereby the consumer can throttle without ultimately blocking

463223
3des	aes	des	aes
block-ciphers such as des 3des and aes can only operate on blocks of bytes

463223
3des	aes	des	aes
des and 3des operate on block of 8 bytes and aes on blocks of 16 bytes

463227
radix-sort	in-place
i ve never seen an in-place radix sort and from the nature of the radix-sort i doubt that it is much faster than a out of place sort as long as the temporary array fits into memory

463302
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
since extension methods are nothing but static methods you could argue that it should be argumentnullexception but on the other hand they re used like instance methods so it might be more natural to use the nullreferenceexception

463302
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
i think i favor the argumentnullexception that s what i ve use so far but i still think there is at least room to argue for an against the nullreferenceexception since it seems more natural in most places where the method is going to be used

463337
hash	md5
i would also consider saving and comparing an md5 hash of the file to see when it changes

463340
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
in that case i would certainly not except a nullreferenceexception but instead an argumentnullexception

463346
button	checkbox
the only way around this is to use checkbox instead of button and make it one big form â or to use javascript

463379
pop-up	dialog
i guess you could open a pop-up window and call that a dialog box

463397
swt	swing	awt	swing
i m looking for a way to display a vnc viewer in a thick rich java client specifically i m using swt but if i can get it into awt swing i can integrate that specifically. this is not an applet but a real live thick java client

463420
freemarker	velocity
either velocity or freemarker will provide the facility of separating your markup from your code

463420

463842
vim	emacs
there is a netbeans add-in emacs mode and vim syntax highlighting

463847
gridview	sqldatasource
so far the only examples i know of are telerik s grid cost implements sorting and paging in the grid and sqldatasource + gridview implements sorting and paging in the datasource but requires ms-sql to be available

463908
san	fileserver
if you do not perceive dfs as a viable approach you may wish to consider failover clustering of your fileserver tier whereby your files are stored in an external shared storage not an expensive san which i believe is overkill for your case since dfs is already out of your reach connected between active and passive file servers

463919
getter	setter
in that case you really should limit the scope to at most a file global by declaring it static variable and getter setter methods that protect it from multiple access where that could be dangerous

463922
postgresql	mysql
give it a hint that you re on mysql or postgresql and it can add a limit clause to your query or rownum over a subquery for oracle and so on

463952

also available are turbogears pylons cherrypy web.py mod_python fastcgi etc etc

464092
min	max
the ui knows that description is required and that the item count is 0 and 100 in these examples a good ui will rely on the business layer to tell it for example the min and max but the ui is still aware of the relationship

464096
kerberos	ntlm
note that kerberos like ntlm can also be used to implement sso authentication

464096
kerberos	ntlm
when presented with a www-authenticate negotiate header ie and other browsers will send spnego wrapped kerberos and or ntlm tokens

464096
kerberos	ntlm

teamcity	nant
i ve written a console application that has a number of unit tests and i m wanting to include it in my nant build script so that it will be run on our teamcity cis

464262
implements	extends
if i ve been misreading your question and you actually want each database query to execute in its own thread then i d suggest making a class called something like sqlquery which implements runnable or extends thread - actually you could even consider using java.util.concurrent.callable which allows you to return a value from its call method which is like run

the same delay is present when i run rundll32 shell32.dll openas_rundll from a command line

464418
pcm	music
that task reading a file from the disk and sending it via http should not use any significant amount of cpu especially at the bitrates required for music streaming unless you re talking about multi-channel uncompressed pcm or something like that but even then it should be i o-bound and not use a lot of cpu

464432
perforce	cvs
its simpler to install than subversion perforce or cvs and no server component is required

464463
wxpython	pyqt
i am also interested about the possible implications this will have on their bindings with the most common scripting languages pyqt wxpython wxruby

464469
toolchain	binutils
you will need either a cross compilation toolchain or to build your own cross binutils

464488
stdout	stderr
what is a little tricky is passing stdin and reading stderr and stdout at least for non-trivial sizes thereof because you need to start seperate threads to make sure the respective buffers get cleared

464493
mousehover	mouseenter
edit mouseenter or mousehover doesn t catch menu selection via the keyboard

464516
folder	directory
within that database there is a table called moz_bookmarks which contains all the bookmarks tags and folder within the bookmarks directory

when served as a page from a webserver either the built-in cassini server or iis in ie firefox or when you switch to design view in visual studio

464813
int	double
then when i start to get used to the idea that the objects i am using like string know how to perform operations i am used to using external functions to achieve like to upper tolower substring etc they change the rules with numbers numbers don t know how to convert themselves from one numeric type to another for some reason instead you have to invoke convert class static functions to change a double to an int and math class static functions to achieve rounding and truncating

464825
gif	png
i also tried converting the sample gif to png with gimp and using the png as an input for the java code

464835
actionscript	haxe
if you are not interested in haxe you will basically need to write your own compiler that compiles objects down to abc actionscript byte code

i think you should prefer the appdata folder but if you want to combine all the logs in one folder then use all users directory environment.specialfolder.commonapplicationdata and create sub folder inside your app folder for each user

465950
width	height
mainad has a valid height and width however it isn t shown like subad1 subad2

465960
post	get
i may be painting with a wide brush but i find it shocking that most web application developers specifically .net webform developers i have come across have a complete lack of knowledge when it comes to the http model basic things such as post and get are out of their grasp due to the abstractions they have encountered

466009
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
multiplication and division occur before addition and subtraction

466082
gif	png
this works for png to jpg and gif to jpg

466086
int	double
this is a little different than your question because it involves arrays of int rather than arrays of double but should work identically

466090
versioning	upgrade
upgrade from minor versioning number is free

466098
inherited	properties
you have to add the xmlelement attribute to each properties as well setting the namespace properties to an empty string as the namespace is not inherited in your situation

466141
pull	push
certainly these teams could each maintain their own git repository and push pull between each other as necessary which would quickly turn into a nightmare in many situations

466169
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd

actionscript	mxml
you may have to learn actionscript and mxml dtd

466216
multiplying	subtract
to generate the verification digit you must perform some arithmetic operations on the number you have generated for example adding all the digits in the odd positions and multiplying them by some other number then subtract all the digits in the even positions and finally adding all the digits together you must vary the algorithm a little based on the value of certain digits

466224
pull	push
the master repository offers other advantages as well such as ease of continuous integration as the push pull triggers can be configured on the master repository to fire off the unit tests and build system

466290
rss	feed
that is no good to me i need the page to be completely public as it is an rss feed

466456
swt	nebula
if you were to use the jface-type viewers swt table or nebula grid both support this style of mvc architecture as do some others mentioned in this question it should be possible to implement paging in the content provider just by setting some custom offset into your dataset and then refreshing the grid

466456
swt	nebula
nebula is one swt table isn t

466625
serializable	deserialization
i was just wondering how serializable actually works well actually deserialization

466645
getter	setter
if you are using data contract serialization the datacontractserialization then the getter setter will be called if you apply the datamember attribute to the property not to its backing field

466647
super	self
in it you just use super and it does super thisclass self

466695
gridview	repeater

466732
slug	permalinks
processes url requests to recognize slug permalinks and then updates the query step to locate the correct post in the database

466737
post	put
because xmlhttprequest allows you to post with credentials cookies to the destination site and read the data sent back from the site along with sending the persons credentials you could orchestrate some javascript that would submit a series of forms including confirmation forms complete with any random keys generated that were put in place to try to prevent a xsrf

466755
kde	gnome
if i were you i would download the source code for ps or top or the gnome kde version of the same or any number of system monitoring graphing programs which are more likely to have all the necessary unix cross platform bits see what they do and then make the necessary native calls with ctypes

466781
inherited	properties
it s ok in this sample but it might cause problems when you inherited the class and override the properties

466815
profiling	debugging
you d probably find that you can do this if you use the profiling debugging api but i don t believe you can do it from normal .net code

466817
mouse	keyboard
if you are not familiar with windows messaging it is a way for win forms to communicate with the os for things like drawing keyboard events mouse events and everything else

466819
gridview	repeater
i ve found that the tests are very brittle broken not just by code changes that actually change the pages but also by innocuous refactorings such as renaming a control since i need to pass the control s clientid to selenium s click method etc or replacing a gridview with a repeater

466841
bufferedreader	ioexception
bufferedreader actual throws ioexception

466861
singleton	facade
there is a narrow way to think of it basically as a collective name for the oo concepts listed in the gof book singleton facade strategy

466930
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython ironruby are built to work on the .net virtual machine so they are as you say essentially platform specific

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it doesn t appear to be a browser issue as i ve tried in ie 6 7 firefox 2 3 opera safari 3 and the problem does not occur

466967
dictionary	map
if you want to map particular numbers to particular objects consider using a key-value pair structure like a hash table or dictionary instead of a list

466990
addition	multiplication
it starts out with such simple concepts as addition and multiplication but as it explains the concepts it also explains how computers do the calculations

467059
opera	firefox
also works in firefox and opera but with a warning

467077
ilist	iqueryable
i search for a way to only select items from my iqueryable that contain all supplied parameter tags of ilist

put	get
i couldn t get fop.bat to work even running as local system but i could call java so i put the entire fop commandline into my asp script similar to this snippet

467113
put	get
i have a few months of experience with web application development with an mvc framework cakephp so i get the basics but i began to see a theme that made me think i m taking a flawed approach to where i put my logic

467171
gtkmm	glibmm
if you program with gtkmm or use glibmm that should be the first choice it uses utf-8 internally

467173
webkit	gecko
most html email clients use internet explorer bits webkit bits or gecko bits to render the html

467178
put	get
at this point it seems as though the calls to the com object get put on a stack and they get processed on a fifo basis

467239
post	get
aside from catalyst cgi has a standard way to send in parameters via get or post and cgi.pm makes it easy

467268
tiff	png
the story around pdf a is a lot more complex than format conversions like tiff to png

467363
backtracking	greedy
for your code to work spirit would need to recognize that the greedy print_p matched too much and then backtracking to allow matching less

467363
backtracking	greedy
but although spirit will backtracking it won t backtracking to the middle of what a sub-parser would otherwise greedy match

467363
backtracking	greedy
see exhaustive backtracking and greedy rd in the spirit documentation

regexbuddy	rubular
by the way this regex works in regexbuddy in ruby mode but not at the rubular site

i have a datagridview form in my .net application and i d like to be able to show or hide additional columns based on a boolean value at run time

467409
getter	setter
i personaly only access the variable through its getter setter if it has one

467418
int	boolean	int	double
the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

467432
opera	firefox
according to w3schools window.top is supported in ie since v4 firefox v1 and opera v9

467596
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you could create an action-filter that implements onactionexecuting which fires before the controller action is invoked

467618
int	boolean
if you try parse as in the first instance with an invalid int you ll get an exception while in the tryparse it returns a boolean letting you know whether the parse succeeded or not

467629
int	boolean
oh and by the way now i look at your question again perhaps one of the reasons it isn t working is that the line will return a boolean rather than the int you want it to

467657
japplet	jwindow	japplet	jdialog	jwindow	jdialog
swing is lightweight but even it has heavyweight components like jwindow jframe jdialog and japplet

467688
atof	strtod
you can use the atof or strtod functions from c or

467696
vmware	virtualbox
it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

467705
awt	swing
i suppose in theory you could have some sort of framebuffer device and have swing draw directly to that but a as you noted swing is based on awt and awt does not work like that and b it would still be the os that implements the framebuffer device

467706
swt	swing
if you re worried about the performance or bloat of swing check out swt

467739
vim	textmate
i m getting back in touch with my inner g vim due to an unscheduled macbook mother board of a meltdown my emergency backup linux box won t run textmate

467754
ubuntu	debian
the cell sdk is available as well and could potentially provide better integration and packages are available for rhel 5.2 and fedora 9 should be able to use alien to pull these into debian ubuntu but not sure on that

467772
csv	tsv
i would be far more worried about a custom backup restore based on a fragile format like csv tsv failing

467776
udp	tcp
real streaming protocols such as rtsp are a lot more complex and usually use udp instead of tcp

467789
versioning	upgrade
and even in the future if we do upgrade to .net i think most of the tests that i ve written should be helpful in validating the correct behavior and should be upgradable to a .net versioning too i guess

467943
width	height
in that example you have to set the div height width to that of the image

467987
subtract	add
a method i often use for this sort of problem is to iteratively add and subtract code until i can narrow it down to the one thing that caused the problem

468006
composite	command-pattern
actually i d be tempted to turn it into command-pattern along with composite

468033
rss	feed
the twitter atom feed requires your login and password obviously which is nicely supported by ie7 apparently ie7 can t handle rss feed with login pw

468059
ubuntu	linux
however in ubuntu linux when i compile the same java application and resize my window the canvas stays the same size

468140
button	checkbox
one option if you have a checkbox would be to have to take action button on the screen with each having a implied value that you would have used a checkbox for

468140
button	checkbox
for example you could have a button labeled come straight home from work and stop at the grocery on the way home from work instead of a checkbox for the pick up milk option

468140
button	checkbox
by putting the checkbox values on the action button the user has to consider the option and make a conscious choice

468143
folder	directory
if you get the properties of a large directory in explorer the time it takes to give you the folder size is proportional to the number of files sub-directories it contains

468183
opera	firefox
or if you want get firefox or opera go to any site say stackoverflow.com or w3schools.com view the source edit away and then apply the changes

468239
int	boolean
type generally refers to the classification of primitive values - int strings arrays boolean null etc

468357
put	get
you should find this is all transparently handled for you - if you put a into the content of an element it will be stored as and then translated back when you get the content back out again

468358
swt	swing
it s a layout manager not a builder for swing and swt that will make your life easier

468367
implements	extends
an instance of the arraylist class is said to be of type of every superclass it extends and every interface it implements

468385
width	height
then i get the window width and height and use gluortho2d to set up my orthographic projection

468423
try-catch	exception-handling
you said that the exception-handling may be thrown during file process so i put the processfile in a try-catch block

468451
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome come hand in hand as both working off a similar engine which makes them the next logical step for compatibility tests

468451
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is a logical choice because if you get it on safari it will work on google-chrome and it has a pretty strong start in browser stats for being so new

468482
width	height
i have an iframe with width 300 and height 250 and when i change them to 500 and 400 firefox refreshes the content and i want to prevent that

468509
gridview	sqldatasource
i m not sure if you are asking for an alternate to the gridview or the sqldatasource ..

468724
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

468745
pull	push
i have some java clients that push pull a lot of data into c++ servers that are written in mico

468750
getter	setter
instead of going all the way and providing getter setter for every member of every contained object one simpler alteration you can make that offers you some flexibility for future changes is to give objects methods that return their contained objects instead

468756
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i am trying to use the axinom cms with asp ajax and created a page containing scriptmanager updatepanel and timer

468760
versioning	upgrade
it also helps if there is a batch file or similar to append these stored procedures together this will be your upgrade database to latest versioning script

468949
doc	rtf
i had made an application in c# to merge rtf files into one doc iam hopeful it should work for doc and docx files as well

469094
awt	swing
ibm used to have a remote awt long ago before swing iirc

469251
.nettiers	codesmith
i ve used both codesmith with .nettiers and more recently t4

469453
accessor	properties
if it were a simple collection i d say just wrap a framework treeview control in a custom user control and hide the nodes properties exposing only the accessor and mutators you want

469462
sysml	uml
pavel hruby has some nice stencils for uml and sysml on his site

469507
google-chrome	firefox
technically we re an ie shop here but i make sure all my apps function on at least ie and firefox and i m doing more testing in google-chrome as well

469532
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome i tried have no issues what-so-ever

469577
inherited	properties
but if the class is inherited virtual allows the properties get set to be overriden so the behavior is no longer fully encapsulated and controlled so it can break in theory

469577
inherited	properties
it is not wrong to use properties in a constructor if you know you who what is ever going to inherited from the class but it isn t officially best practice

469634
google-chrome	firefox
i think ie and firefox ie especially are designed for standards conformance where as google-chrome might be lenient especially to work great with google apps which themselves are not really w3c spec conformant

469703
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it s not open-source or free but check out chart director - they have a free download no time-limit it s cross-platform windows linux solaris freebsd mac and the charts look better than what i ve seen on cpan

469707
put	get
can these be put into a query so that i just get the 2 columns

469922
getter	setter
if you provide a setter you don t also have to provide a getter

469974
put	get
so every time code gets changed reviewed you need to look for something in quotes and yes you can filter out the empty strings but i tell people it is good practice to never put strings in quotes unless you know it won t get localized

470023
notepad	textpad
vim on cygwin textpad notepad and various ides eclipse ms vs c++ ms vs vb6 etc

470060
int	boolean	int	double
according to the vb6 documentation isnumeric returns true if the data type of expression is boolean byte decimal double int long sbyte short single uinteger ulong or ushort or an object that contains one of those numeric types

470066
uilabel	uitextview
the view contains two uitextfields a couple uilabel and a uitextview

470071
int	double
decimal double int long

470071
int	double
you might try converting it to a double and then to an int

470078
post	put
if you want to use embed or object to inline your pdf you can put a button on your fillable pdf and have that button use submitform with csubmitas set to pdf and curl set to the http you want to post to

470102
google-chrome	firefox
speedwise you re not going to find significant gains choosing one over the other unless you re doing specific tasks that play towards their strengths look at the range in benchmarking for instance some google tests have google-chrome hundreds of times faster where as others have firefox beating google-chrome

470175
children	parent
until i renamed the navigation properties to parent and children respectively

470175
children	parent
the toughest part was figuring out which is which which i did by noting the multiplicity property on the navigationproperty objects 0..1 for parent for children

470255
mp3	ogg
you are no doubt familiar with mp3 and ogg technology though i have a feeling from your question that you are interested in getting back a pcm file with a lower sampling rate

470267
int	double
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable

470279
webkit	gecko
we ve got a couple systems like this where technically they only support one browser but we make really sure they at least function even if they re not pretty across the ie - gecko - webkit universe

470284
int	chars
i should then be able to turn u2122 into u2122 and ae into u00ae relatively easily using chars base-10 int value of uxxxx or xx in a match and replace loop using regular expressions

470294
folder	directory
the gratuitous new names of directory unix folder mac windows etc

470302
gridview	objectdatasource
i can bind objectdatasource with a list of blah to a gridview but i can t make it sortable since the datasource is not datatable

470306
docx	xlsx
even better if you make the zipping intelligent and use no compression when you re zipping large already compressed files mp3 zip docx xlsx jpg gif etc and using high compression when you have simple text files txt xml doc xls etc as they will zip very quickly even with heavy compression

470323
inherited	properties
so i made an object reminder that inherited from the linq to sql object fnrthu_reminderbytaskresult with the properties i wanted

470352
daemon	cron
an important point might be that rather than having a cron job run once every second have a always-running daemon that s automatically restarted on exit - or something like that

470355
pop-up	dialog
setting it to 0 provides a pop-up dialog with the exception otherwise being buried

470377
globalization	localization
you will want to look at the section of the msdn documentation that deals with localization and globalization of asp.net apps

470406
g++	gcc
besides that with msvc++ and gcc you can look at the generated assembly for a file which can give you some hints with gcc it s g++ -s foo.cpp for msvc++ it s fas

470442
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
svn has great tool support including ankhsvn and visualsvn for vs2008 integration and distributed version control systems like mercurial git or bazaar will give you even more options and the price of much more basic tool support

470451
integer	unsigned
that will wrap around because size returns an unsigned integer type

470547
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i try to steer clear of them for this reason horizontalalignment and verticalalignment don t work as expected but i got your code to work with these minor modifications binding the width and height of the control to the canvas s actualwidth actualheight

470572
ati	nvidia
one thing i can tell you for sure as of december of 2008 nvidia and ati did not have managed classes for their gpus

470595
post	get
take a look at which creates a hidden iframe copies the input control and uses the iframe to perform the post to get the file on the server

470595
pop-up	dialog
if you re looking for the behavior where when the user clicks attach file and the file browsing dialog automatically pop-up that can be done via javascript but doesn t work in firefox which has the security precaution of requiring the user to invoke the browse button directly rather than programmatically through script

470600
post	get
2 you need to post picked status to the server and get some response two solutions

470600
post	get
also don t impose ajax to your client the highest part of navigation should be handled with get post at primary level then adding non intrusive ajax to navigate

470631
doc	rtf
i had made an application in c# to merge rtf files into one doc iam hopeful it should work for doc and docx files as well

470647

free	malloc
in games i ve seen calls to malloc free consume as much as 15 of the cpu in poorly written products or with carefully written and optimized block allocators as little as 5

470725
post	get
spam comments at end of this post but the gist is that you can probaby get away with anything if you are working on your own creative product development project

470726
int	double
particularly the new int add and new double add

470726
put	get
i can omit the new but then i just get compiler warnings which amount to i think i m hiding this method you need to rename it method or put new on it

470756
mouseup	mousedown
that is on a mousedown i want the menu to come up and on a mouseup i want the menu to disappear selecting the active item if any

470806
debian	linux
i only have debian linux on hand so please don t offer windows or mac solutions

memcpy	malloc
also iteration may not allocate any heap memory so no new or malloc at any stage and no memcpy

change the oncreate handler of the form to subclass the hidden popuplist window and implement the proper restoration of the window proc in the ondestroy handler

471103
rss	feed
i am trying to take several rss feed and put the content of them into a mysql database using php

471103
rss	feed
after i store this content i will display on my own page and also combine the content into one single rss feed

471103
rss	feed
i haven t dealt with rss feed before so i am wondering the best framework method of doing this is

471159
post	get
for example in rest-ful api post request is equivalent to create update delete and get to read and that might break the offline mode

471165
mp3	wav
these are not mp3 files and do not have any id3 or other meta data but plain wav files

471175
addclass	removeclass	mouseup	mousedown
if so binding the mousedown mouseup envents to addclass removeclass methods should do the trick

471241
width	height
but for some types the variable type is replaced by more helpful information such as x 0.0 y 0.0 width 0.0 height 0.0 for a rectanglef

471259
trac	bugzilla
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

you can create such a function yourself using devexpress free dxcore product the same extensibility framework used to create coderush

471474
multiplying	add
if you don t as time goes on programs tend to suffer the death of a thousand cuts as the effect of functions that are 5-20 slower than they need to be add up and indeed multiplying

471618
versioning	upgrade
when versioning 2 of that code is released i want to be able to upgrade my customised versioning with all of the versioning 2 changes retaining my customisations

471636
opera	firefox
i have a centered ul styled like a table ala cssplay that is having li elements added to it after page render and it seems to work beautifully in everything but firefox and opera

471636
opera	firefox
for whatever reason it seems like firefox 3.05 and opera 9.63 keep the ul at the initial draw width after the third li is added even though there is no width specified anywhere in the css

471637
nant	cruisecontrol
you should be able to create a simple batch file to run qtp which can then be invoked via nant and or cruisecontrol

471651
hudson	bamboo
my suggestion would be to use a continuous integration server like hudson or bamboo

471668
mouseleave	mouseenter
the top div is hidden but slides in to partially cover the bottom div on mouseenter and then out again on mouseleave

also for reasons that i forgot i immediately fork again and then in that child re-open stdin stdout and stderr

471779
ready	each
if they can not think of any possible solutions and possible outcomes of each solution then they are not ready to step up to this problem

471792
pull	push
however both examples listed by you are using ajax to pull information not push it

471804
rss	feed
i have used it for several years to grab rss feed

471881
post	get
i haven t used it very much but i do use its companion command-line utilities get post etc. a bit and they have a useful set of functionality

471889
x86	64bit
for example when a .net application is running in 64bit systems the clr can either be loaded from c windows microsoft.net framework64 v2.0.50727 anycpu x64 compilation targets or from c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 x86 compilation target

472004
equals	compareto
especially know the difference between equals hashcode and compareto and what it takes to implement them correctly

472028
free	alloca
however while using alloca and in-place new ensures that the memory is free on return you give up automatic destructor calling

472036
opera	firefox
i m wondering if you might have found a bug in firefox and opera i guess where the page isn t reflowed properly when things are inserted via javascript

472059
onchange	onblur
suppose i connect logging functions to the filteringselect s events onchange and onblur i get the following play-by-play sequence

472068
mouse	keyboard
you ll never be able to block users from refreshing either with their keyboard or pushing the refresh using their mouse

472133
free	malloc
i know i can manage my own memory by overriding new and delete to use malloc and free but if i did that i d rather the garbage collector not run at all

472146
atomic	interlocked
read and write using atomic interlocked functions example interlockedincrement on windows

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
take a look to sorteddictionary and sortedlist

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

472158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

472166
post	get
one thing that i do is set a value in a hidden field on the page then writing the necessary javascript to extract that value this is nice because i can change that hidden field via javascript and when if the page post back i can get that new value from code behind as well

472174
free	malloc
if you want to use malloc and free use std.c.stdlib

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the issue you have is that objectoutputstream writes a header and objectinputstream reads that header

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
solution always create the objectoutputstream first and flush it before creating the objectinputstream

472189
profiling	debugging
you d have to use the debugging profiling api

472208
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
naudio is an open source .net audio library that can play back wav mp3 wma aac and aiff files making use of acm or media foundation codecs installed on your computer for decompression purposes

472210
try-catch	exception-handling
a basic workaround is to just put the offending statement in a try-catch and discard the exception-handling

472258
for-loop	arrays
for arrays the c# compiler emits largely the same code for foreach as it would for an equivalent for-loop

472259
google-chrome	safari
everything was fine until i tested using google-chrome and safari and found it didn t work

472263
post	get
each of those supports get and post and each of those may or may not be available or work depending on the php version and configuration

472266
folder	directory
the folder you see in visual studio are not normal folder directory

472283
for-loop	loops
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

472312
cpython	ironpython
are always integrated in cpython first and you have to wait until they are implemented in ironpython

472312
cpython	ironpython
extensions one of the strengths of python are the thousands of extensions which are all usable by cpython as you mentioned mathematical problems numpy might be a suitable fast package for you which might not run as expected under ironpython although ironclad

472312
wxpython	pyqt
especially under windows you have a native gui-toolkit with wxpython which also looks great under several other platforms and there are pyqt and a lot of other toolkits

472312
cpython	ironpython
platform independence if this is an issue cpython is ported to really a lot of platforms whereas ironpython can only be used on the major platforms recently read a developer was sad that he couldn t get mono to run under his aix

472312
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is a great work and if i had a special .net library i would have to use ironpython might be the choice but for general purpose problems people seem to suggest using the original cpython unless guido changes his mind

472316
folder	directory
however if i add a file to that directory let s say an test.sqlite file in the app_data folder or say images created by some other program then these files do not appear in my solution explorer even if i click the refresh button

472333
disk	ram
running an application brings its executable and other files from the hard drive into the os s disk cache in ram

472333
disk	ram
ram is much faster than disk

472347
ubuntu	linux
our current automated build consists of 1 master box and 4 core-2-duo pizza boxed at around 2.5ghz with 3 gb memory each all running ubuntu linux

472348
getter	setter
the entire application is extremely simple it contained only code that initialize some of the supporting objects however this particular location type would initialize just fine but on first invocation of property getter setter it would throw the above exception

472355
cpython	ironpython
we are also hosting the ironclad project to run cpython extensions under ironpython and that is going well we plan to release a beta of resolver one numpy soon

472355
vim	emacs
each of us has his editor of choice textpad emacs vim wing and everything works fine

472379
pthreads	fcntl
i have very little experience with windows apis but from what i ve heard they have good pthreads support so you should be able to use fcntl as long as they support posix.1-2001

472396
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql or javadb would all handle this elegantly at little or no cost

472495
allocator	stl
many of the stl templates allow you to define custom allocator as well

472531
nscountedset	nsmutableset
use nsmutableset nscountedset or nsmutablearray instances as dictionary values

472559
folder	directory
it should be possible to just load it from the libs directory inside of our product s source folder

472571
photoshop	paint.net
it s not the best tool for creating artwork anyway you can use paint.net and inkscape for that which are both free or photoshop and illustrator if you have the money

472571
actionscript	mxml
you don t want to use the flex framework so if you re using flexbuilder you ll want to do an actionscript project not an mxml project as someone else noted

472581
vbscript	jscript
there are two approaches you can code in jscript or vbscript which do have the construct or you can fudge it in your code

472634
pull	push
if the contents would need to be dynamically loaded you would then need to use ajax or similar to pull them from the server and push them into the second box

472637
getter	setter
having said all this here are some old style methods for getting getter setter and properties i wrote a long time ago

472646
haskell	sml
this module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from the haskell and sml programming languages

472706
free	malloc
malloc is entirely unmanaged though the runtime libraries are free to use reserved areas of the managed heap to do this

472748
forth	smalltalk
wikipedia mentions the term was used by forth programmers in the 80s fowler also spoke about the smalltalk community

472754
selenium	sahi
it is different than selenium sahi or watir in the way that it controls the browser natively not using javascript and is not affected by many issues other solutions have

472926
bazaar	git
it sounds to me like you could benefit from using a distributed vcs git mercurial bazaar etc.

472951
google-chrome	safari
can someone please help me out with printing the contents of an iframe via a javascript call in safari google-chrome

472951
google-chrome	safari
but i can t get anything to work in safari google-chrome

472973
sorting	filtering
i have two pages a report page where you can pick data do some filtering and sorting etc

473023
boost	stl
generally i ve used boost object_pool or boost pool_alloc as an stl template parameter

473068
jar	war
my war depends on another project packed inside a jar i m working on

473068
jar	war
but when i save a file in this project the jar project jboss tools republish the compiled classes of the war project but does not re deploy the classes changed in the jar project. actually the war project is deployed exploded in the deploy directory but the jar project is deployed as a jar in the web-inf libs directory

473068
jar	war
i would like eclipse and jboss tools to republish the classes from the jar project like they do for the jsps and classes inside the war project..

473087
for-loop	loops
changing the for-loop to a foreach loops resulted in the following benchmark result

473105
bmp	png
also as mfc relies on gdi and it doesn t support natively png at least on xp i didn t try on vista or win7 you will need to convert them to bmp anyway

473119
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in ie6 7 firefox but in google-chrome safari it has big problems with what looks like either margin padding or positioning

473122
for-loop	loops
2 try using a foreach loops instead of a for-loop - it may well be simpler

473150
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

473155
google-chrome	safari
will fix the display issue in webkit-based browsers safari and google-chrome for example

473160
auto-generate	edmx
i need the partial class to implement an interface implements interfaces.iasset but vb.net want to place implements interfaces.iasset.id at the end of the property which of course is in the generated code section of the partial class which i can not do as the edmx file is auto-generate and will change in the future

473321
folder	directory
don t forget that in vista they ve also added a little more security on the program files folder itself so that rogue programs can t mess up other programs in the same general directory area

473356
keyup	mouseup
now for the drop or paste you can rely on the mouseup and keyup events in order to detect that

473367
for-loop	loops
i is check to be in range three time in loops once in the for and once each for the two ca i s which makes a for-loop slower than foreach

473554
metaphone	soundex
metaphone similar to soundex and possibly more effective for you

473557
free	malloc
the gc can be removed and replaced with a simple wrapper around malloc free

473568
puts	gets	rss	feed
so i have a little wpf xaml that gets the titles of my rss feed and puts them in a listbox

473590
rss	feed
there s a lot of different things to learn from the code theming compression how to write an rss feed configuration multi-language support .

473600
post	get
you can use post or get for both xmlhttprequest and normal navigation and form submission well post is always a form submission

473600
post	get
there are also advantages and disadvantages to using get vs post

473722
accessor	properties
create a private accessor for your class in the test project and then use the accessor to set the properties for your test

473740
implements	extends
each class would implements or probably inherit from a user class instead the user interface for the common functionality and then extends with their specific functionality

473826
post	get
i think that in stackoverflow they extract all common english words from the text and then compare this words with the remaining words of other post to get the related post

473870
many-to-many	one-to-many
edit except it s one-to-many not many-to-many

473891
many-to-many	one-to-many
then when i do this it not only does the new one-to-many relationship not work as i get a nomethoderror when calling say result.find 0 .stat but now my previous working many-to-many relationship with games and teams is now broken as well

473915
boost	stl
should i make my own framework by wrapping up the stl classes and or boost libraries so that if i need to change the implementation of the string vectors lists etc

473921
mp3	flv
i extract the audio from a bunch of flv files as an mp3

473941
osql	powershell
from powershell or just about any external scripting language you can use the sql command line osql or sqlcmd

473974
allocator	stl	boost	allocator	boost	stl
as long as you re using standard collection classes an algorihtmns such as stl boost it shouldn t be very hard to plug in a new allocator later on in the cycle to fix the portions of your code base that do need to be fixed

474031
lisp	scheme
the scheme standard requires that implementations be able to do this optimization while the common lisp standard leaves it up to the implementation

474043
int	chars
you can use an unsigned chars to read the float byte by byte into the int array

474088
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if the input is required for the function to operate and the language supports it i throw argument exceptions see .net argumentnullexception argumentexception so that the code doesn t do clean returns in the case of invalid states

474089
put	get
similarly if you execute a sql statement with an invalid variable name sql plus will get the column and line position and put a under the offending character

474093
cakephp	qcodo
try looking at cakephp symfony or qcodo in php or ruby on rails django if you are not bothered about using php

474108
implements	extends
the only exception to this that i ve seen is if you have multiple type that have different class hierachies like winform controls you can make a subclass of each that all implements and interface and then extends that interface thereby giving base functionality to a group of different controls without extends everything like control or object

474117
versioning	upgrade
sandribbon best of all when you buy it upgrade versioning are free and the author constantly updates improves fixes a new release almost weekly and you can contact him directly very smart guy and will accept any feedback

474162
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
other useful tools are wsdl.exe and svcutil.exe for web service development and in rare cases ildasm.exe and tlbimp.exe

474192
google-chrome	firefox
the issue i m having is that both ie and firefox are making 2-3 lines worth of cities while google-chrome keeps it in a nice horizontal line

474215
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
i would try odp.net instead of system.data.oracleclient

474246
client-side	server-side
i think this is a bit cleaner and more readable client-side than it would be in some server-side environments

474291
boost	allocator
not sure if this would help but be aware that boost shared_ptr has constructor overrides which allow the user to include a custom de-allocation and custom allocator if desired

474293
put	get
in general put as little in common as you can get away with

474321
ienumerable	ilist
you could make the handlestatechange method return an ienumerable igameaction ilist igameaction or igameaction

474365
getter	setter
if with properties you mean javabean properties represented bay a getter and or a setter method then you can use a dynamic proxy to intercept the set method

474377
put	get
i wanted to create a powershell script for a sharepoint upgrade so i put 4 or 5 books in my library and had plenty of info to get me started

474378
int	chars
for example int bool chars is the type of a function returning int and taking a bool and a chars

474378
boost	allocator
that said if you want to construct the shared_ptr right away you don t need to store the functor somewhere boost function requires the new operator for that even though for very small functors it will use special tricks to only use stack allocator small buffer optimization

474394
mp3	wav
j2me automatically records to a wav file but i was wondering if i could request it to record to mp3

474528
daemon	cron
this code will run as a daemon and is effectively like calling the python script every minute using a cron but without requiring that to be set up by the user

474535
equals	compareto
the equals method is now consistent with the compareto method

474551
subtract	add
you ll probably also want methods to add subtract etc. and maybe some way to get the representation in various string formats

474552
subtract	add
in constrast with some other comments about adding methods to add subtract etc...since you didn t mention needing them i m assuming you don t

474559
daemon	cron
the main difference between that and cron is that an exception will kill the daemon for good

474567
comparator	comparable
you might consider restructuring to implement comparable or comparator for your class.

474576
equals	tostring
implements the equals tostring and hashcode methods

474579
int	double
implement similar factory methods for converting from int double etc

474579
addition	multiplication
implement addition multiplication etc

474579
int	double
basically take a look at the api for other value classes like double int and do what they do

474580
multiplying	add
it s kinda pointless without arithmetic methods like add and multiplying etc

474580
equals	compareto
think about whether you want 1 2 and 2 4 to be considered the same or not - this has implications for the equals hashcode and compareto methods

474593
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
some python core developers have recently begun putting together a document which illustrates various work flows that compare and contrast working with hg bazaar git and svn

474658
post	put
i put this comment on nickolai s post

474680
getter	setter
only keep parameters that are important when constructing initiating the class in question and do the rest with getter setter methods or properties if you re doing .net

474713
mbunit	nunit
for testing however i would recommend going with a test framework like nunit or mbunit instead of writing your own in a console application

474717
crypt	md5
depending on your system you re either looking for crypt or md5

474717
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
traditionally unix uses des-encrypted passwords thats the crypt function with a 2-character salt two random characters from the set a-za-z0-9. which is prepended to the hash to perturb the algorithm

474725
maven	pom.xml
i ended up generating the pom.xml with a maven archetype as peter and sal suggested and then moving the existing source in

474730
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
also i should note that the md5 version is not a simple md5 sum operation it also uses a salt value to make hash not-precalculatable

474760
equals	compareto
by making the class immutable as suggested you can also take advantage of the double to perform the equals and hashcode and compareto operations

474768
equals	compareto
this might be one of the few cases though where you don t want compareto and equals to be consistent since fractions reducable to each other are not necessarily equals

474809
maven	pom.xml
your existing project probably does not use maven so creating a pom.xml based on it isn t trivial

474833
put	get
a couple of days ago i took the code an put it on my eee pc with linux just to see if i could get it to build

474835
put	get
i dynamically declare an array of pointers to pointers these are what get pushed because i assume priority_queue stores by reference so if i just put a pointer declared in the loop into the queue that pointer goes out of scope

474903
translation	localization
in the latter case there s nothing to translation and therefore no need to worry about localization

474943
width	height
your viewport just needs to be a div with a fixed height width and overflow-x scroll

474984
gridview	onclientclick
i have an gridview that i am adding onclientclick events to a checkbox column via

474984
button	checkbox	updatepanel	onclientclick
everything works fine but when the user clicks the save button on the form which is within the updatepanel suddenly the onclientclick event of the checkbox stops firing

475012
put	get
an alternative is to put an images directory in the root but then you get images at the same level as controllers and views which is pretty horrible

475026
crypt	hash
also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere

475074
post	get
do to the number of views this question continues to get i ve decided to post the simple regex that i ve been using in a c# application for 3 years now with hundreds of thousands of transactions

475076
nlb	iis
my companys uses microsoft nlb to load balance traffic between our iis servers

475132
unix	solaris
a nix operating system unix solaris linux macos cygwin and it s classic set of command line utilities

475154
jsf	seam
to do this work through the seam manual and refactor your code for each seam feature that simplifies the jsf approach

475154
jsf	seam
make your jsf action listener classes into seam components add one annotation

475178
children	parent
my problem is that i want to order the groups of categories in the order listed above parent of 33 first children of 33 second and parent of the root node last

475224
inherited	subclassing
if the operation will need to be overridden by a subclassing for some reason then of course it must be an instance method in which case you ll need to think about all the factors that go into designing a class for inherited

475286
interpreted-language	forth
threaded interpreted-language like forth look up keywords in a dictionary and execute their associated native-code function immediately

475286
prepare	execute
summary the difference really comes down to prepare the code for later execution or execute the code right now

475336
lxml	elementtree
one possibility would be to use objectify or elementtree from the lxml module

475388
globalization	localization
it is especially useful if you care about localization globalization in your application

475402
maven	cargo
i m using the maven cargo plugin to startup a jetty web container for running some integration tests in a separate project module

475402
maven	cargo
the web app works fine when run in an installed tomcat container or standalone jetty run through maven on the command line so i think the problem must be down to something to do with how cargo embeds jetty and then how jetty compiles the app

475429
addition	multiplication
this class includes all of the basic things you expect to be able to do with numbers addition multiplication etc. as well as some complex classes like adrian has mentioned regular expressions finite automata context-free grammars pushdown automata

475459
pull	push
pull instead of push you ll use a threadpool thread when there s something happening instead of always having one active

475483
post	get
get and post are just request methods carrying all sorts of information including in the case of a post request a section known as post data

475483
post	get
so while getpost gets the data from the post data section of a post request getquery retrieves data from the query string of either a get or post request as well as other http request methods

475503
min	max
i don t know about magic but for moving to the top or bottom you could just set the sortorder to min max sortorder + - 1

475535
ienumerable	ilist
i converted it to a list since the docs for the checkedlistbox datasource property indicated that it needs to implement ilist or ilistsource not merely ienumerable

475541
testdriven.net	xunit.net
hkey_local_machine software mutantdesign testdriven.net testrunners xunit.net 4

475541
testdriven.net	xunit.net
anyway i exported the the the xunit.net registry key from hkey_local_machine software wow6432node mutantdesign testdriven.net testrunners xunit.net and edited it removing the wow6432node and then imported it

475550
ant	maven
its one click setup built-in support for ant and maven and works on all platforms with jvm

475601
dlsym	dlopen
after you find a symbol you can use dlopen and dlsym to load it

475620
subtract	add
second rather than comparing the string literals add subtract and such try to use constants final variables or enum s

475658
post	get
if thats the case you can post it back to the same action and in the controller have different sets of code for the get and post to give the functionality that you are looking for

475663
folder	directory
much of the bin directory is required but you can strip out plugins and folder for things you don t need such as visual studio support resharper extensions autocad integration etc

475672
min	max
you d then create a layout with a tabbed pane filling the window and then overlay the min max close buttons on the top right

475673
gif	png
use a gif or png - both support transparent pixels

475691
free	malloc
and yeah your biggest risk is that an initialized buffer is free d without using delete and a subsequent malloc happens to reuse that memory block

475695
g++	gcc
with gcc g++ the situation is a lot better since most of the standard has been implemented there already the standard committee doesn t like adopting features that haven t been implemented and tested in a real compiler and a gcc fork is often used for that

475707
post	get
even on my own site i ve just been using post 6 to reference post by ids even though i still store a slug. instead of post 6 small-rant-on-urls and in some cases they can get even more absurd much more so than is really necessary

475733
put	get	post	put	post	get
it could be that is faster to get the post in a blog by the id than by the slug so put the id for the sql query and the slug for the search engines seo

475762
getter	setter
unnecessary overhead comments that point out the obvious deeply nested classes superfluous getter and setter for private nested class variables and unusually long function variable names can all create syntactic noise within related functions that will ultimately increase their length

475776
put	get
the code is here and if you try to run it you will see that it will some times not be able to get as many workitems as it did put in the list.

475776
interlocked	lockless
edit i have got a lockless list working it was faster than using the lock obj statment but i have a lock object that uses interlocked that was still outpreforming the lockless list im going to try to make a lockless arraylist and se if i get the same results there when im done ill upload the result here

475818
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu version relocates some jars around and eclipse expects the pure version and jar locations

475828
serializable	deserialization
my code tends to be slightly faster than his but both are much much faster than the other serializable deserialization options in the framework

475843
decoder	encoder
the design problem i am facing now is whether the encoder and decoder api should be in one interface or in separate ones

475849
decoder	encoder
only thing is that you usually have one code part that will use the decoder and a separate using the encoder

475881
decoder	encoder
consider not having a separate encoder decoder interface but instead

475884
decoder	encoder
if normally you have an encoder and an decoder in the same binary one interface is fine

475908
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however only webkit safari google-chrome ... and gecko firefox ... have implemented it so far and you ll have to add their respective vendor prefixes -moz-column-width ..

475928
copying	overwrite
when copying files there is already a progress dialog overwrite handling etc

475953
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	ironruby	ironpython
i can t say anything about ironruby but most python implementations like ironpython jython and pypy try to be as true to the cpython implementation as possible

475953
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
the main thing that will encourage developers to write code that s different from what they would write in cpython is the lack of c extension modules like numpy this is a problem in jython and pypy as well

475953
cpython	ironpython
this should eventually mean that you can develop code under cpython using whatever modules you like and it will run unmodified on ironpython

475953
cpython	ironpython
it should be easy enough to write ironpython applications that work on cpython as well but i would probably aim to go the other way around cpython programs that work on ironpython as well

475953
cpython	ironpython
the advantage of ironpython et al existing is that they provide alternative implementations of the language which are sometimes useful for spotting bugs in cpython

476011
collabnet	svn
collabnet svn command line

476029
getter	setter
if you should modify either the getter or setter to take specific actions in the future you ll break your object if you fail to use that path

476031
decoder	encoder
so the implementation is shared but user code sees the encoder and decoder as separate and independent concepts

476071
getter	setter
do not use property getter and setter for expensive operations like reading a file or accessing the network

476110
trojan	virus
it s unlikely to be a generic virus or trojan as such would either have to specifically delete the files on startup before sql server started assuming your database starts automatically or shut down the database then specifically delete the files

476168
post	get
form action same page here method post or get rsaquo

476173
typedef	struct
the solution must work with typedef and struct no limiting to only basic c types

476176
post	get
they get values from post get and then assign the values the user typed to the template

476189
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
i ve used vms with vmware fusion parallels and virtualbox and i have to say i find performance to be pretty much even across all three

476189
virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox also has seamless mode essentially similar to parallels s coherence mode but less integrated into the desktop

476208
codeigniter	cakephp
most frameworks though do all of this for you and in a much better way than the code above i personally suggest cakephp or codeigniter

476272
std	ostream
matrix.cpp 459 error std ostream

476272
std	ostream
math matrix operator std ostream

476359
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up as usual but on the mouse over hint of a recently created file the entire thing crashes with a out of bounds error

476439
post	get
an unchecked checkbox doesn t get sent in the post data

476449
vmware	esx
also i d suggest looking-into vmware s esxi - it s a stripped-down free edition of their full esx product

476461
getter	setter
should you declare the getter setter of the class inside the .h file and then define them in .cpp or do both in .h file

476461
getter	setter
i personally like the latter wherein all of them are in .h and only methods which have logic associated with it other than setter getter in .cpp

476469
inherited	subclassing
subclassing which used the api of the specific hardware to implement the abstract api inherited from the abstract base class

476487
vmware	esx
whether you were to go with vmware esxi the free edition of esx or the full-blown esx is a business and maintainability decision

476508
boost	stl
consider boost as an extension to the stl

476531
northwind	adventureworks
it no longer comes standard with a northwind database but you an download the adventureworks db

476533
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql are both full fledged db s and good for education experimentation

476567
ingres	postgresql
postgresql is also well worth considering as it is also a real relational database having originally started as the much respected ingres rdbms in the 1980s

476589
int	double
this seems weird to me that int double etc are actually not just modifier keywords

476601
int	double
int double etc

476653
put	get
you can fairly easily get down to o n log k time just put the lists in a heap

476653
quicksort	heapsort
this is one of the ways to do i o-efficient sorting you can generalize quicksort and heaps heapsort as well

476717
put	get
therefore small functions that are as simple as get set i often use to put in a separate file as inline-defined functions and then include that file where i use the extension .inl into the .h header file

476718
mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseenter
on first page load with nothing highlighted no ugly orange selection box around any item using down button to select the first item the following events fired in order mouseover mouseenter mousemove domfocusin

476718
mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout	mousemove	mouseout
with an item selected moving to the next item using the down button the following events fired in order mouseout mouseover mousemove domfocusout domfocusin

476718
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
with an item selected clicking the enter button the following events fired in order mousemove mousedown domfocusout mouseup click domactivate

476762
cvs	svn
i also hope to get some information about the ability to move between suggested tools migrate between cvs and svn and even between operating systems if applicable

476770
fileoutputstream	printwriter
it also assumes output is a printwriter or printstream one of which is system.out a fileoutputstream is easily wrapped by a printoutputstream or printwriter new outputstreamwriter

476789
cvs	svn
for issue tracking i suggest you hosted redmine ror app that integrates with cvs svn git mercurial and a few others

476790
cvs	svn
all three have good built-in support for cvs and svn as well as integrated debuggers

476791
cvs	svn
basically the things people are using now are svn cvs or maybe git

476791
cvs	svn
svn for version control -- it is more mature and now seems more in use than cvs

476791
cvs	svn
however in terms of sourceforge i think it still uses cvs though there are other open source hosting that probably use svn

476791
cvs	svn
cvs still good support though many people have been moving to svn

476792
cvs	svn
i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

476821
firefox	safari
it turns out that there are some browser-specific innertext in ie textcontent in firefox safari etc. attributes that when set are required to create a single text node

476902
client-side	server-side
enforced strong password policy server-side with optional client-side javascript validator

476984
fortran	ada
such languages include b event b ada fortran

477036
post	get
if you can t get it to work post your new code and i ll be happy to help you troubleshoot

477048
many-to-many	many-to-one
to start with you never ever have classes which represent many-to-many or many-to-one link tables

477055
stdout	stderr
have been studying the file system related classes of adobe air 1.5 but so far i ve not seen anything that mentions how to interact with stdin stdout stderr

477088
codeigniter	kohana
i was looking into the same thing recently and i found a codeigniter fork called kohana that includes a nice authentication module

477132
pop-up	dialog
otherwise you will need to find some method for specifying the quarter year when the macro runs pop-up a dialog box and ask the user to input it

477139
tunnel	vpn
by secure line i mean ssl vpn tunnel public-key encryption - or a robust challenge-response scheme

477142
put	get
watch the intellisense or put the cursor on transferdata and press f1 to get the help for the transferdatabase method for reference

477157
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the elements are positioned as expected the first and second div s are adjacent to each other and are above the third and fourth div s which are also adjacent to each other

477188
google-chrome	firefox
this makes it look like your google-chrome sample both in firefox and ie 7 browsers i tested

477257
uiview	subviews
and set clip subviews property to true for parent uiview and to false for child uiimageview

477322
getter	setter
this was relevant very recently for us as we recently went through the code and added a lot of runtime assert statements to validate input data for our classes and that required a lot of modification to getter and setter

477325
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview with a uitableview for a subviews

477349
vbscript	jscript
as well as vbscript classic asp pages can use jscript as the underlying script language

477488
accessor	properties
as s-bug said you should implement the accessor and use mutablearrayvalueforkey to mutate the properties

477525
cos	sin	pow	sin
functions are sum ave sin cos tan cot mul div pow log 10 ln mod

477558
yacc	bison
in order to do that you need to describe the full grammar and write a frontend have a look at lex and yacc or flexx and bison

477578
ssl	https
unless the connection is already secure that is tunneled through https using ssl tls your login form values will be sent in cleartext which allows anyone eavesdropping on the line between browser and web server will be able to read logins as they pass through

477578
hash	salt
while it is true that hashing the password can be effective against password disclosure it is vulnerable to replay attacks man-in-the-middle attacks hijackings if an attacker can inject a few bytes into your unsecured html page before it reaches your browser they can simply comment out the hashing in the javascript or brute-force attacks since you are handing the attacker both username salt and hash password

477578
scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	kdf
whenever a new user is created or a password is changed you take the password and run it through a kdf such as bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 turning the cleartext password correcthorsebatterystaple into a long random-looking string which is a lot safer to store in your database

477578
hash	salt
to verify a login you run the same hash function on the entered password this time passing in the salt and compare the resulting hash string to the value stored in your database

477578
scrypt	salt	hash	salt
bcrypt and scrypt store the salt with the hash already

477578
hash	salt
the reason a salt is used is because hashing in itself is not sufficient -- you ll want to add a so-called salt to protect the hash against rainbow tables

477578
hash	salt
a salt effectively prevents two passwords that exactly match from being stored as the same hash value preventing the whole database being scanned in one run if an attacker is executing a password guessing attack

477657
post	get
see this post by me trying to get more specifics on the issue

477691
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the submit button works when the user presses enter and the button doesn t show in firefox ie safari opera and google-chrome

477698
width	height
you could include an image with width height 0 px

477701
put	get
with that kind of specs if you don t actively help the client reshape them what s going to happen is you put the number in the offer that would pay for all the crazy stuff and then yet some and less experienced competitors won t see all the implications and put a lower number in their offer get the gig and it all ends in tears for everybody

477726
hash	md5
note that it expected some md5 hash but instead got back null

477726
hash	md5
if this were a simple file corruption issue i would expect that you would have two different md5 hash for the expected got

477729
getter	setter
until i took a class with brian goetz i didn t realize that the non-synchronized getter of a private field mutated through a synchronized setter is never guaranteed to return the updated value

477747
folder	directory
it is quite common simply to have a documentation folder in the root directory of your solution that is not referenced in any way by the solution project files

477750
int	double
for long float double and int there is no need to cast

477769
int	double
there is a predefined implicit conversion from short to int long float double or decimal

477769
int	chars
chars is the only unsigned int type

477800
awt	swing
if my memory servers me right the swing implementation was pretty bad - so you would need to use awt

477844
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
if the former then use parallels vmware or virtualbox

477855
int	double
and an operation consisting of int logs and double will have a double result

477855
int	double
so in the following example the subexpression 5 4 uses only integral values and is performed using int math even though the overall expression involves a double

477894
concave	convex
how would i go about constructing the contour of 2d polygon which is formed of only triangles and it can have holes and the external contour can be concave convex and the holes can also be concave convex

477898
jexcelapi	jxl
you will probably need a library to manipulate excel files like jexcelapi jxl or poi

477940
vimeo	flickr
there is a new idea called oembed that a few sites support flickr vimeo and a few others that addresses this problem

477986
ubuntu	linux
i have configured my django app to run under apache+fastcgi on linux ubuntu if it matters

477999
getter	setter
i hate languages that require you to make use of code generation or copy paste for simple things like javabeans with all their getter and setter

478012
width	height
by doing this you are telling that td that if it s content is larger than it s max height and width it should have scrollbars

478032
for-loop	loops
he uses a single foreach loops as opposed to your double for-loop

478074
stdout	stderr
data written to stdout or stderr before entering the fastcgi accept loop or via a mechanism that is not fastcgi protocol aware will also be directed to the main server log.

478148

478433
equals	tostring
also do yourself a favor and override equals hashcode and tostring and if possible create a values method

478471
post	get
i ve always thought it would be interesting to write something that will look at a post say a question here and predict how many votes it will get

478502
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
no openfiledialog and savefiledialog are both derived from filedialog which is inherently modal so as far as i know there s no way of creating a non-modal version of either of them

478524
superclass	subclassing
from the standpoint of the object model you re trying to convert a superclass object into one of its subclassing types while not changing the identity of its persisted instance and that s where the conflict is the converted object isn t really supposed to be the same thing

478539
getter	setter
this inflammatory article on why getter and setter are evil challenged how i thought i was doing oop

478555
children	parent
i need to write a simple program there will be a parent and a few programs children started via execl in parent

478566
union	distinct
i m not familiar with the mysql tsql dialect but you would have to first select the row with the highest a value perform a union all no distinct via sorting with the row with the highest b value perform a union all with the row with the highest c value and then a union all with the remaining rows ordered by c and excluding the 3 rows by id already selected

478643
versioning	upgrade
the issue is that when i upgrade foo somehow in visual studio when i go to the object browser it shows me two versioning of foo.dll

478644
put	get
get all of the code and associated data that you have so far and put it somewhere publicly accessible such as github or sourceforge

478648
int	chars
the check for error is very simple if the first unrecognised chars wasn t the x0 that ends the string then the string is considered not to contain a valid int

478674
children	parent
the problem is that odd and even and their css cousins nth-child odd and nth-child even refer to the order in which the elements appear as children of their parent not as children with that particular selector

478678
boost	stl
i don t work with code that uses boost or stl as i don t work with systems that support them particularly well but i have found the following standards useful.

478680
versioning	upgrade
if you pin the versioning and upgrade you have to open your 10 something projects and upgrade the reference - but you are isolated from accidential upgrade

478724
firefox	safari
for dropping firefox uses ondragdrop while ie and others use ondrop while safari doesn t appear to support it

my class implements tablemodel and extends abstracttablemodel so that i can use the method firetablecellupdated rowindex columnindex and i have implements the methods iscelleditable and setvalueat

478732
hash	md5
md5 is just like any other cryptographic hash function which means that a given array of bytes will always produce the same hash

478801
x86	64bit
i found some threads that advised changing the advanced compile configuration to x86 found in the programs properties if you re running a 64bit system

478811
northwind	adventureworks
northwind was a demo database that got replaced by adventureworks

accessor	properties
so far all our debugging in the properties accessor and no-op ivalueconverter s hasn t found a solution -- but if we do i ll post it back here too

478851
int	chars
additionally i would try to avoid reading in single chars and use the various functions and methods for reading data in fields - you can read a whole floating point or int number using the stream extractors

478948
checkbox	dropdownlistfor

479121
equals	compareto
concentrate on things such as equals hashcode compareto methods

if you are using html resize the image in the browser by setting the width and the height of the image make sure you enable the right settings in ie for maximum viewing pleasure

479448
internationalization	localization
edit for user-friendly strings you need to go through a .resource to get internationalization localization done and it would arguably be better to use a fixed key based on the enum key than a decorator attribute on the same
