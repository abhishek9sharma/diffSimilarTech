it s not really a question of the request method get and post can both make changes to persistent state as each can be exploited by various csrf attack vectors

6721613
min	max
you probably want to use the sql server extension methods lat and long combined with max and min

6721613

at first i read this as getting the min max lat long pair and this was my answer i suspect you could determine this by figuring out which point has the largest and smallest distance from 0 0 or whatever location you were concerned about

6721658
width	height
first i disabled stretching on both images stretch none and removed height and width definitions on the images

6722185
mutators	setter	mutators	getter	getter	setter
what you re looking for are accessors and mutators also known as getter and setter but unfortunately they re not cross-browser compatible

6722197
boost	stl
the best way to go about this is not storing raw pointers inside stl containers but using their intelligent cousins smart pointers instead boost shared_ptr check out the boost documentation these pointer cousins are intelligent enough to deallocate themselves when there is no one referring to them and saves you the problems like the one you are facing now

6722225
button	checkbox
if you have some controls with each item in listview like checkbox button etc add this to its layout xml

6722294
post	get
there are well known or common methods the semantics of which are well understood well okay should be well understood - i still encounter people unclear on get post

6722299
folder	directory
just go to the plugins folder located in your wp-content directory and make a new folder

6722302

6722508
getter	setter
if for compatibility reasons you do not wish to use javascript getter setter they are fairly new -- added to the 5th edition of ecma-262 in 2009 then perhaps if your context allows try creating setter functions instead

6722756
httphandler	httpmodule
the article mentioned by craigd is inherently limited in its performance by the fact that it uses an httphandler instead of using an httpmodule - an httphandler cannot pass a request back to iis native code for execution after the resized image is written to disk

6722786
post	get
now i want to get those post with this post_id

6722798
addclass	removeclass
that way the jquery object will be empty if the element doesn t expose the step-dark-left class to begin with so both removeclass and addclass will end up doing nothing in that case

6722801
removeclass	next
so removeclass method if it doesn t find a step-dark-left css-class it just would do nothing and return the jquery object so next method in the chain will work

6722813

6723322
trie	tree
the suffix tree is an improvement over the trie it has suffix links which allow linear error search the suffix tree trims unnecessary branches of the trie therefore it does not require as much space

6723322
trie	tree
the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines

6723323

another way i considered was to have all the getter return new copies of the non-thread-safe object based on the old one meaning that modifications would be irrelevant with the same applying to setter

6723770
integer	unsigned
consider the version of murmur hash v3 which returns a 32-bit unsigned integer

i suggest you in order to define the frustum to call gluperspective 45 float width height 0.001f 1000f

6723987
width	height
45 for 45 degrees of half angle width height for giving the screen ratio 0.001f for giving a near truncating plane 0.001f away from your eye or the screen 1000f for giving a far truncating plane 1000f away from your eye

hash	md5
i know we can use md5 hash for passwords but by doing this we can not reconvert them to normal mode

6724110
mouseup	mousedown
i can t seem to get this event to work so i have subclassed nsslider and implemented mousedown mouseup methods and added a delegate to the nsslider subclass and connected that to my app s controller

6724110
mouseup	mousedown
it sort of works but there is a massive delay on the slider - it slides fine but the video rate doesn t change and only does when i mouseup - basically it seems the mousedown is called on the mouseup

6724113
int	double
for types double and int it will yield double for example

6724139
post	get
it doesn t matter whether it is a get or a post request

6724277
managed	loaderlock
debug + exceptions expand the managed debugging assistants node and untick loaderlock so it stops nagging you

6724293
put	get
assuming that your exceptionresolver is an implementation of handlerexceptionresolver then there s no reason to put your logging logic into exceptionresolverbuilder.getexceptionresolver since the resolver will get passed the current httpservletrequest in the resolveexception method

6724305
bash	zsh
you can in zsh but not in bash ksh or other shells.

6724339

if you use nl2br to add html line breaks to the â œphysicalâ line break sequences and apply htmlspecialchars afterwards youâ re also converting the added into that is then displayed as

6724584
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
do it the other way round first use htmlspecialchars and than nl2br

6724587
children	parent
to make extra sure that this works you can write your own simple sendmessagetochildren function like mfc offers which just walks down through the children of a particular parent recursively and sends each of them the wm_setfont message

6724588
put	get
in the example i just put a comma but if you can t get the release date just leave it and i ll get it another way

using node_load is better solution than passing global variables between modules especially if you use some third-party caching modules apc memcached or other

6724813
xapian	whoosh
i am comparing lucene solr whoosh sphinx and xapian for searching documents in doc docx html and pdf

6724845

note that it s a rect that starts 20 into the x axis and spans 70 of the width at full height

6724941
getter	setter
of course you could do this with getter and setter too but then you would have to do this every time

6724969
getter	setter
there is few difference between getter and setter methods and __set and __get methods

6724969
getter	setter
setter and getter are used to assign or fetch value of defined states

6724980
keydown	keyup
the value of which in a keypress handler does not have the same meaning as that of which in a keydown or keyup handler

6724980
keydown	keyup
thus that s a different 46 in the keypress handler for . than in the keydown and keyup events for del

6724980
keydown	keyup
you probably should use either keydown or keyup and check for the keycode

6724992
getter	setter
i must excoriate anyone who suggests using getter and setter in general at all

6724993
getter	setter
the other reason is that you can add a common behaviour to all your getter setter

6725000
profiling	debugging
visual studio debugging firebug for firefox with firecookie addon ie developer tools and sql profiling for starters

6725116
post	get
view works out whether this is a get or a post

6725123
getter	setter
to me it looks like this setter is actually acting like a getter and transforming the data as it comes back from the database

6725140
post	get
the next part are url paramters that build an array the same as get or post would

6725176
layoutparams	viewgroup
i solved my problem by using a valueanimator and animating the layoutparams of my viewgroup

6725181
width	height
when ever i set the height and width of the rectangle it is always from the bottom left of the screen at point 0 0 but the area i need to render to a sprite is not in that area

i have a preferences screen and a checkbox for calls and another for sms logging and i want that when the user clicks in the checkbox and then saves the preferences clicking a button the logging starts to work depending on whether the checkbox were clicked or not

6725209
button	checkbox
i m trying this to set the state of the submit button on the form based on whether the checkbox is checked or not

6725256
portrait	landscape
the logic for determining landscape or portrait will want to be outside the asynctask and you ll just want to farm out to the task using .execute which ever view is needed

6725281
google-chrome	safari
it works in fifrefox but not in ie cant remember about google-chrome safari

6725484
google-chrome	firefox
look at the following code firefox and google-chrome introduce an horizontal offset between the tspans but there shouldn t be any

6725537
translation	localization
this because we have chosen xml as the original carrier for the localization texts as this project is part of a larger one that is rather heterogenous with regards to technology used and so we went with xml also to aid ourselves in rapid translation

6725564
integer	unsigned
well according to the msdn dword is an unsigned integer with a range of 0 to 4294967295

6725571
integer	unsigned
a dword is by microsoft s definition an unsigned 32-bit integer

6725582
int	boolean
in python explicit type comparisons like this are usually avoided but because boolean are a subclass of int it s the only choice here

here s a comparison between shoes and qtruby

6725637

which just post some data to a specific url however i always get the error message

6725797
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i could not add the onreadystatechange in any browser safari google-chrome firefox

6725820
post	get
this example is for drupal 5 but the basics for 6 and 7 are the same custom js to handle the category level 1 value then post it to some menu_callback on your site which calls the view to get nodes with its ids based on passed argument of category level 1

6725870

in some articles on different sites i read that we only serializable deserialize the state of object.on the deserialization side actual class definition should be present

6725925
mouseup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mousedown
as a workaround i did find this opera article at that emulates drag-and-drop support with mousedown mouseover mousemove mouseout and mouseup events

6725931
innodb	myisam
it may be more important here to choose the right engine like myisam instead of innodb as this is an insert-only table

6725936
put	get
i know its similar to the one posted above but it will be more dynamic as you dont need to put the message in resource file and you can save the error message in db and get that on other page

6725947
ssl	https
there were a lot of things required for wcf and using an ssl certificate https protocol

6725975
width	height
in more custom using css set height and width appr

putty	winscp
my hadoop is running and i am able to connect to the sandbox from my host machine through putty winscp to start hadoop or to transfer files to hdfs

6726027
sum	coalesce
you need to use group by in order to split score s sum over different users further more if you use left join then you ll be sure to get a row for each user instance even if it has no rows in stats table then using coalesce as regilero suggested the sum will be 0

6726040
intraweb	indy
previous indy and intraweb editions used a slightly modified version of openssl

6726040
intraweb	indy
so when somebody used a unmodified set of openssl dlls not the indy openssl dlls together with an older indy or intraweb version he will get the could not load ssl library error because of the missing exports

6726040
intraweb	indy
that is why a current indy version - from svn even with delphi 2007 - together with intraweb works with the dlls from slproweb too which don t include these modifications

6726082
children	parent
so how can i inspect entire object in rails console till children are embeded in my parent like i can do it in mogodb console

6726127

it does have the jcl debugging madexcept features with some additional like customer-side profiling and logging

6726153
gendarme	fxcop	gendarme	ndepend	ndepend	fxcop
instead of new code libraries i d suggest looking into static analysis tools like fxcop aka code analysis gendarme and ndepend

6726173
pull	push
you can use adb pull to get files but there isn t a way for the device to push

6726190
put	get
if you can put anything into them and get a different result it couldn t be a fixed length byte array and it would lose a lot of its usefulness

6726204
int	chars
update found a similar question mysql int comparison ignores trailing alpha chars

6726250
postgresql	mysql
for example the postgresql mysql and sqlite adapters re-open activerecord base and they might include extra modules along the way

6726264
post	get
when you get to the point of rendering the link below the post just make a call to the helper which can do a quick check on the comments count for that post and could simply return the string or full link you are looking for in that situation

6726293
hide	show
i m trying to hide something for a few seconds then show it again in jquery

6726308
portrait	landscape
i would like to print it as landscape instead of portrait

6726347
cpython	pypy
you could try running it in pypy - for some cases it can be significantly faster than cpython

6726350
fontfamily	font-size
i d suggest trying to style the parent element of the input button pairing a fieldset in my example in order to give a common font-size and fontfamily then using em measurements for styling dimensions padding margins for the child elements

6726350
opera	firefox
albeit the above works fine in chromium 12.x and opera 11.5 ubuntu 11.04 firefox seems to show an extra pixel or two in the latter demonstration

6726376
addition	multiplication
multiplication is much harder than addition

6726394
post	get
i want user to get some points for approved submission and then he earns for example 100 points his post would be published instantly

post	get
when i create a post and then assign the tag toy it creates it successfully i then do a new post and add the tag toy and get this validation failed name has already been taken

6726434
gmail	hotmail
send yourself a copy of the document via gmail or hotmail or whatever and keep the copy in your account -- the date timestamp on the email should come from the service provider not from your computer so that would be pretty solid evidence i imagine

6726455
komodo	notepad++
i can open the file modules system html.tpl.php in my other editors komodo or notepad++

6726462
portrait	landscape
i have implemented the mgsplitviewcontroller and have noticed that willrotatetointerfaceorientation duration and didrotatefrominterfaceorientation is called when the ipad simulator and device is in landscape mode but not when in portrait

6726462
portrait	landscape
the log always prints portrait when i have the device in either portrait or landscape

6726474
versioning	upgrade
you aren t providing enough information but from what i see i can suggest to upgrade your jar versioning to newest compatible with each other versioning

6726534
spaces	delimiter
sounds like you are using tabs as delimiter and different editors have different tab spaces

6726564
maven	m2e
i m working on an android project with maven as build tool and been playing around with the configuration of eclipse android adt m2e maven android plugin maven integration for android development tools and subclipse for a while now but can t get it to work acceptable

6726590
int	chars
i presume it s int float and chars n respectively

6726622
pop-up	dialog
facebook only allows you to open the login dialog in a pop-up

6726630
client-side	server-side
if you follow this design pattern then between your client-side and server-side code i m sure you can easily figure out if a message is stale or not

6726650
inline	inlining
note that this doesn t prevent inlining -- the function could still be inline at link time in exactly the same way that a normal non-inline function can still be inline

6726655
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got a client who has to have his site work exactly the same in ie as other browsers that actually work like firefox google-chrome and safari but i can t seem to get ie to play ball

later on in the graphicsscene class i detect when the user clicks on an item and drag it to move it

6726757
put	get	post	get	post	put
the problem i have is that out of get post put and delete only delete requests appear to deliver the data part

6726757
put	get	post	get	post	put
in the four cases above as str get gets a null argument understandable put and post get empty strings and delete gets the data actually sent

6726758
junit	testng
here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

6726783
macvim	taglist
setup - macvim with minibufexplorer plugin window spanning the entire top and taglist plugin window on the right

6726815
post	put
i m not sure if methods marked with put or post should have the request entity automatically passed in like you are expecting

6726851
post	get
didn t get into it simply re-sized them statically for now but when i do get into it again i ll be sure to post the code

6726875
typhoeus	curb
for more robust tasks curb and typhoeus are good because they can handle multiple requests though you ll need to write a bit more code for managing the files and navigating sites

6727057
put	get
i am trying to get the work on this code i would like to know how can i will be able to catch exceptions in jtextfield and i would also like to limit the amount that you can put in the jtextfield

6727107
width	height
you tell it the coordinates within the canvas to grab pixels from and it gives you back an object with height width and pixels

6727107
width	height
thus there are height width 4 pixels in the array

6727111
mouse	keyboard
to differentiate between keyboard and mouse based focus events you could try binding a keydown handler to everything else to detect a tab or shift-tab but that would be a gross hack and probably not reliable

6727171
int	chars
in the file rline.c chars command_generator chars tab_completion const chars text int start int end void initialize_readline

6727230
textview	imageview
the textview and imageview make up the listview item

6727284
try-catch	exception-handling
this is surrounded by a try-catch catching the same exception-handling types

6727300
bitblt	gdi
use gdi by calling bitblt to copy the contents of the source dc to a destination dc which you can then write to a file print etc

6727307
inherited	properties
if you instantiate an object yourself then it s almost empty - it only inherited some properties from its constructor s prototype

6727374
directx	gdi
if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip their painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit

6727406
post	get
in your case the values many be in the collection only checked checkboxes get sent in a post so you could do

6727412
for-loop	arrays
i understand the mechanics of why this is happening the string literal is really an arrays of characters that includes the null character and when the range-based for-loop calls std end on the character arrays it gets a pointer past the end of the arrays

6727419
hide	show
you could set it up to create new pages as drafts and defaulting the public view to show only approved versions but it sounds like you want to hide unapproved versions entirely which would require some extra hacking and as andreas says kind of defeats the point of a wiki in the first place

6727420
hide	show
0 1 2 then set all of the three button s onclick to the same handler and show one of your frames according to the tag of the clicked button and hide the others

6727459
mongodb	bson
now in berkeleydb you needed to define a callback for each type that you stored but mongodb through bson is a little smarter than that

6727493
hide	show
so if you want to show a the page is loading message and hide this when the iframe has finished loading you can do something similar to the example below

6727523
ssl	https
with the release of vs2010sp1 iis express you can now to debug code that uses with https ssl without having to use a full iis server

6727605
pull	push
you need to push or pull commits to move them between repositories

6727635
portrait	landscape
as you can see from the images the uibarbuttonitems look correct in portrait but weirdly squished and off center especially the trash icon in landscape

6727638
int	boolean
some points are important for this the petitions have 3 parameters int int boolean they make changes in the database and are generated by the interaction of the user with the ui so they aren t launched simultaneously

6727668
mkmapview	mkoverlay
i am using a custom mkoverlay to draw weather data over a mkmapview

6727694
google-chrome	firefox
everything works as expected in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

6727694
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox the alert displays whenever an option is clicked but not in google-chrome

6727734
hide	show
if you need more advanced stuff show hide your window decide its size ... you should probably switch to a gui application

6727736
temp	tmp
see tmp pear temp intl configure --with-icu-dir default failed

6727739
hide	show
the first function is to open a panel and the second function to open show hide object inside the panel but somehow when i click the show hide button the panel close itself

6727804
post	get
i think that facebook c# graph api only supports method that get most recently post or messages

6727810
mongoid	mongomapper
i suggest you write a simple app from scratch using your mongodb odm of choice â mongomapper or mongoid â so that you get familiar with the basis of mongodb before attempting to make a migration

6727890
serializable	deserialization
the deserialization process checks this value when deserializing - if it doesn t match an exception is thrown preventing the serializable data from being deserialized into the wrong version of the class

6727922
free	malloc
if you want really low-level control of things you can also use malloc and free instead which will release memory more immediately than calling release will

6727924
margin	text-indent
you may want to use a padding or margin instead of text-indent if you want the indent to affect all lines not just the first

6727926
hash	md5
i am writing a simple tool that allows me to quickly check md5 hash values of downloaded iso files

6727926
hash	md5
my problem is on the 9th line when i try to take the md5 hash of the file

6727980
implements	extends
why don t you have one baseform class where you put the clean_cpf method and then extends that for the other forms and since clean_cpf is in the parent form you shouldn t have to implements it in the child classes

6727996
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have a little problem here this page at firefox opera google-chrome has already center but at ie 9 this page still at left

6728017
try-catch	exception-handling
- or if i want to tolerate the exception-handling i can have a try-catch to suppress the exception-handling and have a graceful exit

6728155
folder	directory
i have a subversion repository and i would like to create a branch but the repository does not have the canonical directory structure of trunk branches and tags - it just has everything that should be in trunk in the root folder

6728162
slug	permalinks
friendly_id 1k+ watchers - rails permalinks slug

6728175
google-chrome	safari
however in both webkit based browsers google-chrome + safari this will not work 100 correctly

6728177
sorting	filtering
this could speed up queries with filtering and sorting

6728202
for-loop	loops
your foreach loops has s which can replace from your for-loop

6728214
realloc	malloc
i got an impression as if the realloc in the allocator function allocates memory which also maps to the memory allocated by malloc in the main

6728233
put	get
i get this and put it into the packet type that i created

6728246
versioning	upgrade
you best bet would be to upgrade to a newer versioning of php

6728284
vsto	add-in
when i wrote this question i knew of another way to solve my problem but it means a lot of extra work changing my existing implementation to upgrade from office 2003 to office 2010 and so i was hoping there would be away to access the ribbon object model outside of a vsto add-in

6728284
vsto	add-in
my solution is to use an ipcchannel to make calls from the vsto add-in to my win-forms application

6728284
vsto	add-in
in the vsto add-in i handle application.documentopen and if the document is owned by my application i open a client channel to my application

6728284
vsto	add-in
i can then make calls back to my win-forms app from the vsto add-in through the use of shared interfaces

6728287
getter	setter
if you need to able to do the former the only ugly workaround that might work is to create a helper object size in the above case which has the proper setter and getter for the individual property and handle the housekeeping of bridging

6728296
dictionary	map
although i would use kvb s suggestion if you re going to roll your own i suggest using dictionary instead of map

6728302
ssl	https
the easiest thing to use is ssl with https

6728328
width	height
second this now does the same thing for the height as the width my previous assumption that the hard-coded widths would just work was no good and this is a more flexible solution anyway

6728372

that will work for both get and post variables

6733944
cvs	svn
question is more about how do you solve multi-user work on svn cvs etc.. and what solution you like most

6734309
mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock	easymock	jmock
mockito easymock jmock all make this dead simple

6734321

6734402
bmp	png
bmp is a very old and not a very efficient format compared with png jpg so they have not bothered to support it

you can t make anything other than a rectangular table and therefore can t represent many-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many relationships in a classier way

6734580

you could make the structure a class with getter and setter for the data members

6734580

the getter and setter are implemented with something like

6734642
onmouseover	onclick
it already works with onmouseover onmouseout but i would prefer onclick

but this onmouseover instead of onclick works again

6734652

this will set #wrapper to the width and height of the browser window

6734723

this is done by setting its top and left positions to 50 and then offsetting these positions with half the images width and height

6734723
width	height
to start there is #wrapper_wrapper bad name i know.. which is an 100 width and height div so it will fill up all of the screen

6734729
versioning	upgrade
so i decided to upgrade my project to the newer versioning

6734730
mouse	keyboard
it works for all kind of child elements in this example just mouse focus which shouldnt be a problem as the keyboard selects the item automatically too...

6734750
toolbar	tabs
there are also classes which handle actions for toolbar menus and so rely on mainwindow for things like localisation bundles switching between tabs etc

6734900
folder	directory
i know it has something to do with the virtual directory because if i create a folder within my app and hardcode the path it works as it should

6734900
folder	directory
as a virtual directory needs a physical path i mapped it to a folder called drive .. learninglounge.com.solar.restricted

6734906
put	get
inside that view you could put an uitextview with editing off and that would contain all your instructions that the user could scroll through and get to quickly easily and intuitively

6734975
pull	push
i have looked at the microsoft sync framework but unsure if this will do whats required also thought about having a web service where the windows form client can pull and push data to

implements	extends
warning library class org.eclipse.swt.accessibility.accessible 10 extends or implements program class org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.comobject

6735189
hash	salt
although a better idea would be to hash each password with an individual salt value rather than encrypting

6735199
google-chrome	safari
instead i d recommend using built-in profiler in safari and google-chrome which enables you to measure even every single function call and network profiler which gives you accurate request times

6735256
dictionary	map
yes downlaod the plist from server use asihttprequest and then copy that plist to documents directory using nsfilemanager and then read the plist file create an array or dictionary using the plist search on stackoverflow or google for this and then create your mkannonations in a loop and show on map

6735298
stdout	stderr
and you might want to deal with stderr just like stdout

6735306
hide	show
i need to be able to show hide the whole accordion item

6735322
range	median
one good example is searching for the median in an unsorted array without modifying it or using additional space by simply performing a binary search on the whole integer.min_value â integer.max_value range

6735335
onresume	onpause
my application is randomly pausing going into the onpause method then resuming going into the onresume method when i m not even touching the screen

6735345
public	protected
in your case if you change your function declaration from protected to public it will work

6735360
for-loop	arrays
splitting them in chunks is easy read them into a byte arrays have a for-loop that copies part of the arrays to a file of size chunk without forgetting to copy the final bytes of the file

6735404
google-chrome	firefox
they also mention a ie7 hack fix but i don t think that is relevant to me because i am experiencing the problem in firefox 3 4 and google-chrome

6735454
google-chrome	firefox
if you need to do this only to find which requests are fired and not to intercept and or act upon them you can use firebug if you use firefox or google-chrome s integrated development tools press f12

6735457
post	get
i know that for security reasons it is better to use post method than get

6735491
post	get
you ll have to post the html output to get a working code but it is something like this

6735496
width	height
i am starting fancy box on page load opening up a iframe 75 width and height

6735504
post	get
there is no security difference between post and get

6735507
post	get
using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get

6735520
post	get
post is not better than get

6735526
next	except
also if you need to edit your hosts entries on another system like linux or mac just google the same concept except add your os name next to the search

6735535
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
an mvvm framework such as caliburn.micro has a windowmanager for taking care of the view location and view viewmodel binding for you

6735569
tabs	tabpanel
when switching between tabs on the main tabpanel s tabbar each sub panel maintains its rendering unless i ve set a listener or controller action to do otherwise

6735573
stagefright	opencore
there is a new playback engine implemented by google comes with android 2.0 i.e stagefright which seems to be quite simple and straightforward compared with the opencore solution

6735619
free	malloc
i obviously understand that linux being written in c has to deal itself with malloc and free

6735730
ubuntu	linux
or on linux etc php5 apache2 php.ini this is the path on ubuntu or etc php5 cli php.ini etc php5 cgi php.ini etc

6735737
free	malloc
the implementation of malloc and free actually brk sbrk since malloc and free are implemented by libc in-process are not magical or special - it s just code just like anything else and there are data structures behind it that describe the mappings

6735777
udp	tcp
udp is message-based not stream-based like tcp

6735777
udp	mtu
maximum size of udp datagram is 64k though all practical applications try to limit packet size to at most the mtu 1500 for ethernet minus 20 bytes of ipv4 header minus 8 bytes of udp header 1472

6735807
implements	extends
i am sure that i won t immediately start working on a bytecode interpreter but something easier to implements but slower thing first so modularity is a must in order to be able to extends later but i guess overdoing it will hamper performance and clearity

6735812
children	parent
in this phase each parent calls layout on all of its children to position them

6735830
google-chrome	firefox
so far i ve been able to do this with google-chrome and ie9 but i can t seem to get anything to work in firefox 5.x

6735857
put	get
i am having a problem where when i put the querying url into a web browser on my mac the api send the data back as i am expecting but when i use the exact same url within my app on android i get the following error

i am trying to create the following layout with divs every of them have a random fixed width and height

6735942
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it worked on safari google-chrome firefox opera internet expl

6735945
google-chrome	firefox
it displays in google-chrome firefox absolutely fine

6735997
ienumerable	icollection
because httpsessionstate only implements icollection and ienumerable i am losing the information about the keys if i want to do it in a generic manner working with interfaces

6736013
folder	directory
one solution that i have thought about is to create folder resources in app directory structure and to place there any resources that plugin classes could use

6736031
many-to-one	one-to-many
however those demos in the articles are all many-to-one or one-to-many

6736034
textview	imageview
then set the textview for description to be toright of your imageview and below tabwidget and the evaluation textview to be below the imageview

6736057
mouseup	mousedown
doing something like mousedown determine the position of all droppable mouseup determine if we are in a droppable position

6736057
mouseup	mousedown
so mousedown determines what is being dragged and mouseup determines where it is dropped

6736068
hash	salt
the simplest way to do this would be to generate a hash based on the username and some kind of salt and then put a link in the email something like that way the email can be used to look up the record in the db easily and the hash can be compared

6736160
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
i understand that unchecked-exception are runtimeexception and that it is not required that the programmer handle them but do not understand why when i explicitly state in my interface that i want the exception handled that it does not force me to handle it

6736171
width	height
so i d like to have the dialog box come up with different height and width specs

6736171
pop-up	dialog
the function that s making the dialog box pop-up is in a php file that creates the html head

6736215
devise	cancan
i ve got devise working but i see cancan frequently mentioned in tutorials alongside devise

6736220
put	get
i was thinking that i could put a parameter with the email record s id in the image url so that when i get a request for that image i can see if it has a for example email_id param and if so mark the corresponding email as having been read

6736238
folder	directory
but to avoid all the hassle of creating another virtual directory you could create a controller action which will directly serve files from this folder

6736250
google-chrome	firefox
it does not exist in the google-chrome nightly firefox nightly nor ie9

6736250
google-chrome	firefox
it still does not exist on google-chrome canary nightly firefox nightly nor ie9

6736290
int	double
all other classes do not support operators at all even primitive wrappers int double etc

6736338

when i tried it through the path me post with param limit 5000 i get all of the post that wrote by the user like i wanted but not before specific date

6736338
post	get
when i tried it through the path me feed with param limit 5000 i get all kind of post from my profile wall even post that not the user wrote and post from start of my facebook 2007

6736338
post	get
i know that sometimes i can get from facebook only mixed post - like when i ask for the path me feed

6736342
addclass	removeclass
if you want to do this using css classes you can use addclass and removeclass

6736357
width	margin
i then gave the div a fixed width and set the margin to margin 0 auto

6736380
inherited	subclassing
since you inherited from a class that conforms to those protocols no you do not need to state that you conform to them in your subclassing

6736413
express	node.js
however because my server is implemented in javascript using node.js and express i haven t been able to find much on jsonp with javascript on the server as most sites i found used php for server-side code

6736437
folder	directory
any time i update library.eds in the parent directory i would like to copy that file into every child directory that contains a folder named lib

6736492
backgrounding	multitasking
applicationwillterminate is called on ios 4.0 when no multitasking backgrounding is available or when uiapplicationexitsonsuspend is set in the info.plist file

6736508
octal	decimal
you could appeand 0 to the start but then you need to add a prefix to indicate that it is a decimal and not an octal number

6736509
hash	md5
hash btw is a variable that starts out as the md5 hash of the page s cookies location the new date .gettime and math.random

6736511
int	chars
also if i try to see the results just for each condition separately it tells me that it canâ t convert the day and month with â â between to an int even though iâ m declaring them as chars

6736517
queue	fifo
i ran across this fifo queue with spill to disk which is kind of interesting and has some of the properties i m looking for

6736548
move	drag
but the code above when i try to drag it move the entire view

6736588
moose	mason
mason - framework only but pure moose plack based

6736597
children	parent
i believe you re trying to get the click event for a parent li anchor tag to not load a page but instead display the children li elements

6736614
gridview	radgrid
in the presentation layer i have a grid let s say telerik radgrid or standard gridview where i need to show a list of products product is my entity

6736633
multiplying	subtract
not sure exactly what you want 30 of but what you can do is just multiplying what you want a percentage of by 0.3 and then subtract that from top

6736639
folder	directory
in that case you can fall back to using the corresponding directory in the user s home folder

6736704
put	get
please note when i put file d tv.jpg in value it works but when i pass it through parameter then i do not get anything

6736722
width	margin
you need to do a have a wrapper around it for positioning and pull the helper back with a margin of half it s width

6736723
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox this blank out will always return the log with the appended information but on google-chrome the console stays blanked out

6736732
children	parent
itâ s possible that the parent process is intentionally leaving the process in a zombie state to ensure that future children that it may create will not receive the same pid

6736732
children	parent
this will cause well-behaving parent to reap their zombie children

6736748
junit	cactus
i thinks it s a late answer but i do my unit tests with a web project using cactus and junit

6736748
easymock	powermockito

6736755
rubygems	rvm
you can adjust any rubygems gem environment and rvm variables on the system level not only user specific

6736790
stdout	stderr
i d like to have something like bash s redirect in haskell that combines stdout and stderr from a process into a single handle

6736790
stdout	stderr
the flexibility offered by createprocess seems promising at first one can specify a handle to use for the standard file descriptors so the same handle could be given for both stdout and stderr

6736820
pop-up	dialog
i turned off the draggable setting on the actual dialog pop-up however the content inside the box is still able to be dragged out of the box s view

6736849
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome fine and i don t know about firefox

6736884
width	height
if you are using jquery to handle the parameters of a div element then you could use the same method to handle the height width of the image

6736884
width	height
if you want to leave a small border subtract a few pixels from both the height and the width and align the image centrally both horizontally and vertically

6736903
google-chrome	firefox
i am looking for a fix for styling a webpage that so that a webpage on google-chrome will look the same as it does on firefox meaning is there some syntax in css to make all of the web browsers look the same

6736904
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome uses a different rendering engine than internet explorer firefox so may display web pages differently

6736904
google-chrome	safari
apple safari uses the same rendering engine as google-chrome webkit and should display pages the same way

6736904
google-chrome	safari
if your site doesn t render properly in google-chrome or apple safari file a bug at webkit.org as described at

6736904
google-chrome	safari
if your site renders properly in apple safari but not in google-chrome please file a bug against google-chrome at

6736905
google-chrome	firefox
in general when i see a difference between firefox and google-chrome it is because google-chrome is doing the proper thing and firefox just happens to be rendering some invalid css fine

6736905
google-chrome	firefox
99 of the time i can fix the css and get firefox and google-chrome to render the same

6736916

6737030
geocoding	geocode
you can inspect current geocoder.java on android source tree here s an older example and decide whether to use geocode class or map reverse geocoding api directly

6737030
geocoding	geocode
i don t know what causes this but it must be about how geocode class queries reverse geocoding api

6737084
google-chrome	firefox
note on the demo version - the controls for each line a label and an edit field display as a single line in google-chrome and on two lines in firefox and ie

6737102
ant	maven
if you re using a build tool such as ant or maven you should be able to use the sdk w different compiler flags to create your release builds from the exact same source base

6737110

in the forthcoming chrome 11 release we plan to reduce cpu consumption even for pages that are using settimeout and setinterval

6737154
setinterval	settimeout
instead of setinterval use settimeout and then just reset the settimeout each time it fires to create your own repeating interval - though in your case it may be jquery s use of timers that are the issue - i don t know

6737169
typedef	struct
in particular using struct mystruct_s after the typedef is not the same as struct struct mystruct_s -- it s simply struct mystruct_s as it reads on the face

6737372
width	height
since that code uses texture2drect and a samplerrect it s using the gl_texture_rectangle_arb texture target that this target uses unnormalized texture coordinates in the range 0 width x 0 height

6737419
width	height
using that function i can determine height and width of resulting text box

gcc and g++ are both just driver programs that don t do anything other than calling other programs so you can use the -v option to see exactly what they do -- what other programs they invoke with what args

6737799
g++	gcc
so you can see exactly what the difference is between linking with gcc and g++ for the specific version and architecture of gcc that you happen to have installed

6737810
int	double
this is a problem because the fields all have different type values including int double etc

6737817

this isn t exactly probablility it s more like you re transforming a number between 0 1 to min max

6737826
post	put
i have a blog post here on how you can put it all in 1 dll without ilmerge

6737879
disk	ram

6737883
google-chrome	safari
when i access the page trough google-chrome or safari i get only the html portion

6737883

put	get
turn the file into a byte array and then i feed that to my http put method to get the file up to sharepoint

6738067

inherited	properties
will sliderquestion inherited the properties contained within question

6738081

6738212
codeigniter	cakephp
you can use a web application framework like codeigniter or cakephp to do uri routing for you

6738230
subtract	add
when you go through your list of items to display them you can check the dictionary subtract one from the value in the first dictionary add one to the value in the second dictionary and concatenate the result to the rd value

6738304
inherited	subclassing
in answer to your question more specifically inherited forces it s subclassing to have a specific method

6738326
int	boolean
my program will use threads but some variables like a collection of links pages information about queries if is updating or none and some others informations boolean fields int fields etc. must be shared by the threads

6738327
hide	show
it show the correct elements and uses display none to hide the others

6738346
many-to-one	one-to-many
i guess on jpa-level the same hack could work as long as i don t have one-to-many or many-to-one relationships to image because they d need a back reference to.

6738370
vb.net	vb6
put a quicktime activex control and a timer on a form in vb.net or c# or vb6 and the following program leaks memory â it increases by about 10k an hour until it dies

6738463
ienumerable	ienumerator
the yield return statement is the point where an iterator gives back an answer to the caller which is almost always a foreach loop implicity using the getenumerator and movenext methods of a collection that implements the ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces

6738481
int	double
by using 2l and 1l instead of 2 and 1 you keep the result as int instead of forcing a coercion to double which is slower and takes more memory

6738494
listview	gridview
i use the listview then provide then provide a gridview as the listview.view

6738504

6738712
punctuation	words
li p pc or p connector_punctuation a punctuation character such as an underscore that connects words

6738724
setattr	subclassing
it s also very very very easy to create a subclassing of object with no public attributes and use setattr on it

6738724
getattr	setattr
it s even pretty easy to override __getitem__ __setitem__ and __delitem__ to invoke __getattribute__ __setattr__ and __delattr__ so that item access just becomes syntactic sugar for getattr setattr etc

6738731
mouseover	mouseout
it is the mouseover and mouseout event on you elements inside your menu that are eventually bubbling up to your menu element

6738745

6738770
cobertura	jenkins
code coverage tools like cobertura and continuous integration tools like jenkins are great too

6738784
stylish	imacros
the description on imacros s firefox add-on page claims that it is extremely versatile and can be combined with other extensions such as greasemonkey web developer firebug stylish download statusbar noscript... although i am not sure how this interaction works

6738792
junit	testng
i used junit and testng

6738874

i have a list of definitions with a jquery show hide effect and readmore button that changes to close once its open

6738884
nsstring	nsdata
conversion between nsdata and nsstring is safe as long as you do the conversion with the original encoding

6738921
implode	ksort
as a bit of a gotcha -- implode will work based on key insertion order so you may want to use ksort first

6738942
hide	show
note it doesn t match specification it s a whole different usecase for your usecase you do not need a separate class after all refer to another answer but show how can you use composition and hide implementation details

6738971
qtcore	qtgui
if you only want to link against qtcore add to your .pro file in qtcreator or otherwise specify removal of the default included qtgui in your linking command line

this has to work with all current versions of the popular browsers google-chrome firefox ie safari br

6739092
linqdatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
the linqdatasource sqldatasource objectdatasource controls in my experience provide little in the way of development time and hinder maintainability

6739100
public	protected
also even if the property had another modifier public internal protected you could add comments to callers that the object is a generic type of isomeinterface where t is a entitybase new

6739102
post	get
i ve run into an interesting scenario where a get request will behave differently than a post request both for an unauthorized user

6739111
rss	feed
i have an rss feed that i need to read but you need to log in with a valid username and password to get the feed

6739124

the post operation works without any problem but the put operation for the same url does not

6739141
folder	directory
also you need an absolute directory if its not in the same folder

or you could have a base object that all your cacheable objects inherited from with the expiry time as a properties that is set at the time you add to cache

6739178
firefox	safari
it looks fine in safari but firefox 5 is not displaying it correctly

6739212

i can find classes that will let me load and play mp3 wav etc files but i need to generate the audio realtime

6739367
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested the example in google-chrome and firefox on a mac and it seems to work ok

6739368
dbcontext	objectcontext
first i was able to fetch the objectcontext by casting my dbcontext eg ctx to an iobjectcontextadapter and then obtaining reference to the objectcontext

6739387
post	get
starting with spring 3 a controller will automatically convert to json if using ajax get post with application type of json .getjson and .postjson in jquery

6739401
width	height
if you want to have more pixels for your canvas use the width height properties of the canvas instead

6739420
filesystems	ntfs
if you use a linux filesystems the file permission of .ssh config must be 600 but on a standard ntfs windows partition these kind of permissions do not exist

6739421
inherited	properties
another is to move the common bits down into a base class and then inherited for the different specifics in state different properties or the different behaviors primary key only id etc

6739425
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but here you have to take care of lower part of each uiviewcontroller under uinavigationcontroller stack

6739461

look at my uploaded image and say me how i can filtering all product categorys with the id_product 45 and my return value is 45-3 45-2 and the row 1 from product grouping

6739510
post	get
magic_quotes_gpc is a separate directive which only applies to get post cookie operations axil

6739519
hide	show
you need to use setvisibility method to show hide views on the same layout

6739559
firefox	safari
however that doesn t explain why firefox is not behaving the same as safari

6739572
persistent	transient
so save-update basically says to nhibernate when saving my entity if any objects associated with the entity are transient not yet persistent then persistent save them. any associated objects that are already persistent will be updated

6739604
put	get
you should just be able to get rid of the surrounding handler and put the handler directly in your javascript so that when the page loads the callback is registered immediately

6739604
put	get	post	get	post	put
also your ajax request probably needs a type post or type put since defaults to get requests

6739614
getter	setter
for simplicity i ignore the getter and setter for all other fields

6739618
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r mysql mysql usr local mysql

6739653
binutils	bionic
specifically i have built the android ndk gcc binutils with d support via gdc had to modify some of libphobos to support bionic better and i would like to use ndk-build to compile that however i m stuck on the makefile part of it

6739696
folder	directory
assuming client.py is in your src folder and util.py is in src dir1 dir2 every directory in this path has a __init__.py remember you would import util from client like so

6739725
firefox	safari
it seems the litte loading-bar with the infomation about the site at the bottom left side blocks the last 17px in firefox 5 and also in safari

6739739
folder	directory
so i am wondering if this strange behaviour has something to do with some permission settings in the active directory of the server or folder

6739746
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as far as html5 - only firefox and google-chrome currently support html5 native drag and drop events that i m aware google-chrome would include some other webkit variants like safari

6739754
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
to add buttons to a uinavigationbar you need to create a uinavigationitem

6739754
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you re using uinavigationbar as part of uinavigationcontroller as is the common case this is done automatically as a standalone view you have to do this yourself

6739755
telerik	componentart
componentart also makes silverlight controls including a datagrid but does not have a coverflow control and is not as well known respected as telerik

6739756
client-side	server-side
i was able to get server-side function but not client-side

6739756
client-side	server-side
at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important

6739759
strstr	substr
since you have a prefix you could use strstr or strpos to search for the object identification each one of them and them get the name of the field using substr

6739804
uiview	subviews
of course you need to have autoresize subviews on the parent uiview enabled for this to work

6739810
google-chrome	safari
however if you want the latter concentric circles this appears to work in safari and google-chrome on the mac

6739854
bmp	png

i have been given a project for a course at university network engineering which involves writing a packet sniffer that can capture and identify ipv4 ipv6 tcp udp ip icmp etc

6740018
youtube	vimeo
that is one way youtube makes money vimeo has done similar things

6740023
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you can add your mousedown mousemove mouseup events to that element or use some placeholder element like a rectangle that serves as a handle to drag for re-sizing

6740051
width	height
i think by setting the height and width to 100 on your object you are telling it to fill up the whole div which is why you don t get scrollbars

6740051
width	height
try setting the actual dimensions for the height and width and then when a video s dimensions are larger then the div you should see the scrollbars

6740053
for-loop	arrays
i tried a for-loop to parse both arrays as one but neither of them are arrays due to the separation.

6740066
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven	maven	pom.xml
typically projects that people are supposed to compile for themselves are distributed with either an ant build script or a maven pom.xml descriptor

6740141
getter	setter
i reckon that as you work through all the edge cases bits of weirdness in mapping database columns to getter setter avoiding loading your entire database at start up etc

6740153
prepare	execute
a few months ago someone recommended me here to write a simple pdo wrapper for this to avoid writing try catch prepare execute etc

6740156
post	get
a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a

6740163
range	max	range	infinity
the values can range from 0 to infinity in reality the max value is about 100 000 000

6740163
range	max
the arrays vary in number of members and in max values so i know if there are a lot of values with different range a lot of those values would take up the same positions on the scale

6740164
maven	m2e
sonatype m2e plugin for maven

6740164
maven	pom.xml
i am still learning maven so i m guessing it has something to do with my pom.xml but i have also noticed that the integration between the gwt and eclipse plugins can be problematic at times

6740167
folder	dir
for example if the following files reside in the dir folder

6740222
rss	feed
there are many ways to set up an rss feed and each one will depend on how your current site is set up

6740235
super	implements
there is also other state machine implementation in boost that you might prefer because it compiles faster since it is not designed for super speed which does not means that it is not fast enough boost.statechart - arbitrarily complex finite state machines can be implements in easily readable and maintainable c++ code

6740269
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in recent versions of firefox google-chrome and android

6740303

6740340
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to be clear firebreath will be an activex control on ie but it is also a npapi plugin that works on other web browsers like google-chrome firefox and safari

6740356
uilabel	uibutton
1 if there is alot of things going on but you know how many they are uilabel uibutton uiviews uiscrollviews etc i would create them in the xib and then iboulets so i could control them in the code

6740498
stdout	stderr
getting your hands on a handle isn t too hard system.io offers constants stdin stdout stderr handle and functions and

6740498
stdout	stderr
alternately you could request new pipes from createprocess and set yourself up as a forwarding service reading from the new stdout and stderr handles of your child and sending both to wherever you like

6740500
for-loop	arrays
assuming you ve ensured all of the arrays all of them not just the first three in your question are exactly the same size and in the right order so all the values will correspond to the right contact objects a for-loop will suffice.

6740520
mouse	keyboard
that will block all mouse interaction with the fields and combined with readonly and tabindex should block all keyboard access too

6740522
hide	show
just show hide the spinner at the proper place

6740586
icomparable	compareto
make class a icomparable and define the logic for compareto

so when the mousedown event is called mouseenter or mouseexited events are no longer called nor is mousedown called when rolling over other buttons until i let go of the initial mousedown

6753729
opera	safari
furthermore making text bold causes mozilla to add internet explorer and opera to add and safari to add a tag

6753742

when user selected an item on listbox click tap event a separate process is launched with launcher window s visibility set to hidden and a small button basically a window with just a button inside and size set to height width of button created on the either corner of the screen with always on top option

6753805
uploadify	plupload
you may consider using an asynchronous uploader such as uploadify or plupload

6753976
google-chrome	firefox
i can t tell you why this makes sense but firefox and google-chrome are right about this behavior

6753990
google-chrome	firefox
i don t think you can generally do this apart from in some of the latest versions of firefox and google-chrome

6754032
bionic	libc
with bionic android libc the android ndk docs detail that this along with pthreads has been integrated

6754070
put	get
if i put more complex objects in there such as list of strings i get the following error

6754146
serializable	deserialization
also if you examine the javadoc for java.io.serializable you ll see that there are number of optional methods you can define in a serializable implementation that will be invoked during the serializable deserialization process

6754178
width	height
i have the li element styled so it has a certain height and fills the entire width of the screen

6754178
margin	height
i try adding pad or margin and it creates a gap between the div and the li but at th expense of increasing the height of the li element if that makes sense

6754214
width	text-align
once your page is formatted correctly you can use text-align center on the parent container or if you have to position them absolutely as they are now then give the parent container a width position it left 50 and give it a negative margin-left of half the width

6754220
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml file is actually maven s equivalent of a build file or a makefile

6754220
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml tells maven what you actually want it to do so it s not going to be able to build or clean without that file

6754258
move	drag
if i remember correctly mouse move events aren t sent during drag and that s probably one reason that you don t get mouseentered and mouseexited messages

6754260
google-chrome	firefox
when i m using firefox and then using the popup opens in my second display above my first one but in google-chrome the popup just opens at

6754283
qdialog	qmessagebox
first of all qmessagebox inherits from qdialog

6754283
qdialog	qmessagebox
since qdialog has a concept of a parent qmessagebox should too for consistency

6754314
width	margin
you can then size the width of wrapper as content + 2 menu and give it margin 0 auto

6754379
post	get
from what you say you re trying to do a get post would be far better

6754384
spannable	charsequence
i was treating a spannable as if it was it s own special class but it extends charsequence which means the underlying data is just normal text

6754405
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
the resizing the jtextarea can be done easily enough via calling setbounds ... on it -- or better on the jscrollpane that holds it but you will need to use a null or similar jlayeredpane layout on the container that holds the jtextarea and will likely need to repaint the container after resizing the jscrollpane

6754434
put	get
get any incoming object from the socket and put it in the input queue

6754460
put	get
anyway to download from the remote side use one of the get methods from channelsftp not put which is for uploading

6754518
put	get
if i put oauth_token as a parameter in the url i get a 400 bad request instead

6754550
ssms	sqlcmd
so the problem is not the difference between sqlcmd or ssms it must be something else

6754557
equals	gethashcode
don t forget to implement equals and gethashcode as well which can be done trivially for this class

6754562
hide	show
each state has to show or hide a different selection of the available input fields

6754562
hide	show
now i can show or hide only the ones i need and i am not repeating any code across all the varying form states

6754593

6754621
width	height
it s actual height and width are 122px.

6754621
width	height
so look at your css again and see where that extra height width is coming from

6754631
for-loop	arrays
although trying to search all possible data on the issue all the examples i ve found regarded the case where the second arrays which holds the strings is allocated step by step in a for-loop and freed afterwards in a for-loop as well

6754657
dictionary	map
extract the properties into a dictionary map

6754688
free	malloc
so when you are nulling the pointers you probably overwrite control data placed past the end of the array by malloc that free is looking for

6754708
mouseup	mousedown
when an nsbutton receives a mousedown event it enters a private tracking loop handling all the mouse events that are posted until it gets a mouseup

6754717
getter	setter
otherwise you have to make them public or create getter and setter

6754727
for-loop	arrays
you are creating a new variable called from within that for-loop and your arrays will never see the scope of that new variable

6754741
uiview	subviews
currently i am using uiview s +transitionwithview method to add an overlay by adding a uiimageview that contains a transparent image as a subviews of my main view

6754743
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this issue appears on mozilla firefox and on internet explorer but not on google-chrome or opera

6754787
opera	google-chrome
this may not be related as google-chrome and opera are working faster but what may be happening is your server is still trying to get the content and is not done processing the html this is what a video application i wrote in php did before i fixed it

6754787
google-chrome	firefox
though i am not sure i think google-chrome may make multiple-requests to the server and thus pulls down the images while waiting while ie and firefox will do one task at a time

6754807
hide	show
i would like to somehow hide these so only the output from my program is show

6754818
nsurlcache	uiwebview
to capture any other sort of network traffic you can use nsurlcache which is basically a cache layer between uiwebview and network

6754836
puts	gets
this gets rid of the unchecked or unsafe warning but it also puts the onus on the calling class to create the array with the correct bounds to begin with which kind of defeats the purpose of your convenience method

6754843
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
now click the disclosure triangle on uinavigationcontroller and change the class of its viewcontroller to be your custom subclass of uiviewcontroller

6754856
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
here is the xaml that binds to my viewmodel again using caliburn.micro

6754856
children	parent
therefore when the user clicked on moveup i would do a lookup on the parent simpleitem and reference it s children directly

6754867
stdout	stderr
2 1 means to redirect stderr to stdout 2 file means to redirect stderr to file and redirecting to dev null essentially ignores the output

6754877
gif	png
if not you could write a back end script program to render a specified page as an image gif png etc. at a particular zoom level

6754883
opera	firefox
tab-size is currently only implemented by firefox and opera using your given vendor prefixes

6754927
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i also recommend using tablelayout over gridbaglayout gridlayout nested boxlayout which is provided in swing

6754927
jwindow	jdialog
if you subclass jframe jwindow or jdialog you can only ever be that

6754929
rsa	dsa
i ve tried rsa and dsa as well as these commands

6754937
pull	push
we have several team members who are light git users comfortable with push pull add commit status etc

6754973
simplecursoradapter	spinner
the data is returned to a cursor from query and the cursor gets passed to spinner s simplecursoradapter

6754973
simplecursoradapter	spinner
for example the spinner is already showing a list of user created templates saved in db but i want to insert new template and empty template on top of the list of templates and it needs to be inserted into cursor simplecursoradapter somehow

6754975
post	get
use getwindowthreadprocessid to get the process id of the window if that id equals your process that means that is a valid window.sorry i can t post an example but i am writing from my mobile

6754976
terminate	timeout
waitforsingleobject allows you to timeout if the object does not trigger process does not terminate and hence take action terminateprocess i presume

qtcore	qtgui
then i added the three frameworks qtscript qtcore qtgui

6755041
int	double
it works with both primitives like int long float double and user defined numeric types that overload the + operator

6755050
factors	mean
dynamic sql is normally taken to mean that the semantics of the statement change based on some external factors

6755061
post	get
if by manually you mean all by www after logging in you can use curl to simulate login session to their website access login page to obtain session cookie then post login data with that session cookie and then with authorized session cookie you can get post whatever you want from their website as authorized user

6755092
width	height
viewport - a float 4 with the viewport x y width height

6755166
screens	mdpi
apparently the 10 screens of the motorola xoom is 160dpi thus mdpi and xlarge see

6755166
mdpi	hdpi
this would explain the behaviour of packagemanager returning me mdpi resouces instead of hdpi resources

6755211
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome parent doesn t receive events until the user mouses up

6755212
width	height
line 1 sets the frame of the textview as a rectangle starting at point x y with whatever width and height you specify

6755234
width	height
besides the width and height methods returns numbers not strings so there is no point to parse them

6755246
try-catch	exception-handling
another thing is the built-in facebook api exception-handling php sdk try-catch

6755327
ubuntu	linux
it compiles without any warning on gcc 4.3.2 in ubuntu even with gcc -wall but segfaults when run on linux

6755357
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to versioning 3 of the php sdk

6755357
versioning	upgrade
versioning 2 will stop working on september 1st so you ll need to upgrade soon anyways

6755393
int	boolean
the condition can be int in basic lacks boolean

6755397

to post as the page you need to get an access token for the page by getting an access token for an admin of the page with the manage_pages and publish_stream permissions

6755466
dlsym	dlopen
if your system is posix-compliant linux macosx solaris ... you can use dlopen dlsym to determine whether the symbol exists

6755470
post	get
to post as the page you need to get an access token for the page by getting an access token for an admin of the page with the manage_pages and publish_stream permissions

6755509
pull	push
if you are working on a project with several people and you push this changeset to a shared repo then their . whatever1 files will be deleted when they pull this changeset

6755515
google-chrome	firefox
when i am using firefox or google-chrome to download it it works fine even if i stopped for few seconds before clicking save or open button on popped up dialog box

6755517
client-side	server-side
the php files operate on server-side firebug works on client-side so you won t be able to see all the php files in use from firebug

6755531
interbase	firebird
mdb2 optional feature ibase available interbase firebird driver for mdb2

6755556
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in google-chrome firefox ie opera all submit fine

hash	hmac
ipsec uses symmetric encription des and hmac message authentication codes using hashing - a mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions

6755583
swt	swing
it does swing and swt amongst other things

6755619
subtract	add
if i subtract zombies the app still running but when i add zombies the app randomly crashes

6755628
cwd	globbing
opendir globbing and copy all can handle the dot cwd directory and relative paths

6755629
subtract	add
redistributed jdk or jre must be complete and unmodified minus a couple sections about things you can add and or subtract

6755632

i can tell that it takes stderr and sends it to stdout

6755633
quicksort	mergesort
...and 3 sorters - insertionsort mergesort and quicksort

6755662
bash	zsh
two things going on here exec with only redirections redirects the shell s own file descriptors and the syntax in bash and zsh creates a pipe and substitutes a reference to its input

6755692
put	get
my first idea was to put the search terms in an array and get the search results for each item in the array and place them into respective search result arrays

6755724
put	get
in your case if would put it on the domain class and sort it in the dao during fetch meaning have two methods or more based on comaprision types on dao one to just get a list of unsorted object getusers and one method for sorted list e.g getsorteduers

6755730
post	get
i think the best way to handle this as soon as i get the data back from the ajax post since that is when it is in purest form meaning before it gets turned into markers

6755737
min	max
distanceapprox x y 1 + 1 4-2 âˆš2 2 min 1 âˆš2 |x|+|y| max |x| |y|

6755737
min	max
distanceapprox x y z 1 + 1 4âˆš3 2 min 1 âˆš3 |x|+|y|+|z| max |x| |y| |z|

6755738
hide	show
what i am trying to do is force the that is currently being show via the hover css to hide

6755738
hide	show
and of course i have tried hide but this prevents it from being visible and still show as the mouse is hovering over the link once mouseout occurs it is then hidden in the dom unless set to .show

6755772
hide	show
since the css for the new class that hide it is after the css that show it the element will be hidden as long as your css specificity doesn t override that

6755778
put	get
so if you put together all my suggestions you might get something like this

6755782
jhat	jprofiler
the tomcat crashes on outofmemoryexception so i am trying to look for memory leaks using jprofiler jmap jhat utility and so on

6755788
post	get
whenever you do a post on rest you get a url back

6755817
tortoisegit	svn
i have just started using tortoisegit to work with my svn repository at work i have to jump between branches quite a bit so this saves on quite a bit of down time

6755843
post	get
can someone help me understand the http verbs get post etc

6755881
put	get	post	get	post	put
so to put it straight you re setting a post request but retrieving the variable on the server end as a get request

6755946
division	modulo
i was previously under the naive assumption that the modulo returned the remainder of division

6755953
post	get
php again consume in php and access with either a post or get to a php page

6755958
fast-forward	merge
another situation where a fast-forward won t be possible would be when multiple submissions are made before the project manager can merge any into the master branch

6755988
min	max
i suppose that you could drop the min and max heap size of the java process in question but you need to be sure that you won t trigger real java outofmemoryerrors

6756028
pop-up	dialog
in few words i would like to implement something as a facebook generic dialog pop-up

6756042
free	malloc
the arena interface releases you from the obligation to call free for every malloc

6756098
inline	inlining
method inlining unique to proguard.cfg which according to proguard s docs normally inline methods that are only called once

6756135
inherited	properties
actually there s a better way to do this change your observablecollection to reactivecollection which inherited from observablecollection but adds some extra properties

6756158
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

6756210
public	protected
perhaps one option would be to create a templated public function that preserves type information plus a virtual protected function for actually registering the handler

6756217
min	max
b finds the max and min value of each field in the collection

6756218
.htaccess	httpd.conf
however i configured it via httpd.conf instead of using .htaccess

6756237
width	height
if you give the images width and height attributes they won t change size when the image data arrives

6756282
google-chrome	firefox
however my solution only works in google-chrome and ie9 the content div doesn t show a scrollbar in firefox

6756282
width	height
the layout should fill the viewport 100 width and 100 height that s why i probably need to use tables please correct me if i m wrong

6756289
mouse	keyboard
i need workable controls inside my surface receiving any mouse and keyboard event focusable etc

6756314
zoo	xts
doesn t work because zoo objects can be a vector or a matrix while xts objects are always a matrix and there s no method

6756324
mouse	keyboard
it currently only supports the ps3 s six-axis controller but maybe you or i if i ever get the time could adapt the nokia project s keyboard and mouse routines into the python script or convert it to java groovy which is my ultimate goal

6756369
getter	setter
then i am trying to set a variable of customerinfo object with the defined setter method and im trying to echo that variable using the getter method

6756432
for-loop	arrays
i am inserting a segment into a uisegmentedcontrol while getting the name from a for-loop which is looping through the arrays getting nsdictionary which is retrieving a nsstring that i will put into the uisegmentedcontrol

6756432
for-loop	loops
so bottom line is i need to merge these for loops so i get the name like i do from the first for-loop while still getting the objectatindex like it is in the second for-loop

6756438
listview	gridview	datalist	repeater	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist
see the following stackoverflow question to learn more about the differences between a repeater and a listview repeater listview datalist datagrid gridview .

6756495
textmate	bbedit
so i m trying to make the switch from textmate to bbedit and i ve gotten past most differences except for one...the little arrows bbedit puts in to show tab

6756515
width	font-size
wherein not only would the h1 have a width of 100 of the screen easy but the text content itself would grow in font-size to fit 100 of the screen

6756526
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in the draw method i loops through with a for-loop my 2 dimensional arrays of tiles so that

6756529
onmouseover	onclick
but if you wanted to do an on hover instead of a click you d use option 2 replacing onclick with onmouseover

6756546
packets	pcap
i am writing a packets parser using libpcap and encounter strange behaviour when trying to read the packets length form the pcap header

6756563
put	get
normally when you put the . after an object and wait you get a list of methods fields classes that one can access

6756634
int	chars
and use the return value int which is the numbers of chars read then keep this information on a counter so that when you have read 100 of this

6756636
getter	setter
that s why i usually prefer having classes with getter and setter

6756636
getter	setter
yes it s more typing but with getter and setter users can easily see what properties they can get and set plus getter and setter are ide s auto-complete friendly

6756637
profiling	benchmarking
but benchmarking or profiling will give you the real answers

6756711
filtering	grouping
put where before the grouping by if you want to apply the filtering before max is calculated

6756731
getter	setter
according to the javabean spec the property has getter setter

6756787
freebsd	linux
on linux freebsd etc you re probably running one already

6756790
skip-lists	tree
create one non-unique skip-lists for each indexed field balanced binary tree are not duplicate-friendly

6756801
uiview	subviews
change the contentsize of your scrollview.your uiview size and uiscrollview size is same if the uiscrollview contentsize is more than its subviews size then scroll will happen change the line overviewscroll setcontentsize cgsizemake screenframe.size.width screenframe.size.height-25

6756827
postfix	dovecot
personally i use dovecot and postfix but that is not for the faint of heart

6756848
getter	setter
what i want to do is say something like selector_propery accelerometersensitivity and have it expand into the the getter and the setter

6756850
google-chrome	firefox
the problem was that i was testing in google-chrome and firefox

6756886
folder	directory
the first thing to do is stop thinking about folder or directory or their associated urls and do everything including access the applet via

6756957
try-catch	exception-handling
the scope of the try block starts after the member initialization list has been completed so any exception-handling thrown during member initialization will not be caught by this try-catch block

6756957
try-catch	exception-handling
it ensures that any exception-handling thrown from betwen the starting brace of the try block inside the function body gets caught appropriately it would mean any exception-handling caused during the argument passing if any can occur will not be caught in this try-catch block

6757009
versioning	upgrade
in light of this unless you re willing to upgrade to a pre-release java versioning i recommend just using joda time

6757018
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a pretty basic setup with a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller

6757050
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome the page looks exactly as it should wheras at the widget home middle 3 the recent comments scroll has ridiculously huge font and is and overlaid

6757051
getter	setter
i don t know if this is an option for you -- you may want to consider javascript getter setter functions

6757051
getter	setter
of course this could introduce some browser compatibility problems -- javascript getter setter are fairly new

6757100
for-loop	loops
since you re running the parallel for loops many times layers you loose the advantage of running in parallel since every time a parallel for-loop is finished there is an implicit barrier call which won t return till all other threads finish

6757132
getter	setter
this also allows subclasses to override these methods if they want since you essentially have setter and getter now

6757132
getter	setter
the advantage of this over native setter and getter is that this will work in any browser version with the above drawbacks

6757159
google-chrome	firefox
the problem with the above code is that it removes spaces in google-chrome and ie but in case of firefox its working fine

6757161
super	implements
i believe that i have made my super cool app perform the necessary duties but i am concerned that this is not the way apple intended or would recommend for me to implements this feature

6757220
uiview	subviews
in the loadview method of it create a uiview in the coordinates where u want to add the subviews in the current view

6757250
rss	feed
there may be a more appropriate source of this data somewhere perhaps an rss feed

6757256
width	height
i have js which resize the width and height of image which is working fine if i used alert before assigning the actual image src to the image object and if i omit the alertbox it is not working

6757262
google-chrome	safari
webkit is a rendering engine used in safari and google-chrome

6757305
ubuntu	debian
i ll bet you are using ubuntu or debian and making do with the old old version of rabbitmq that they include

6757305
ubuntu	debian
just say no to old ubuntu and debian packages

6757341
width	height
when you set the .src on an image you have to wait until the image is successfully loaded until you can read it s height and width

6757341
width	height
in this case since the image was already elsewhere in the document you should just read the height and width off the existing element rather than the new element

6757341
width	height
this uses a trick that you only need to set one size height or width on the image and the other will be scaled by the browser to preserve the aspect ratio

6757344
width	height
then you can remove the height width from your grid and all your other ui elements just let the grid dictate the size of its children

6757346
portrait	landscape
edited the happening is i statically placed the relative layout by specifying padding when running in portrait mode i made it fix at bottom but when i changed to landscape its not at bottom

6757363
prepare	execute
i have a series of 16 prepare execute and deallocate statements in a stored procedure each inserting rows into a diffterent table table 1 to table16

6757375
post	get
but you don t need to do that if you re operating views each postview already knows about its related model and so you can easily get the post id via view.model.get postid as well as any other post data that you want

6757375
post	get
also the code is better structured â what deals with particular post belongs to postview and doesn t get in your way

6757436
post	get
the one that is focused is sent along with the form submit so if you clicked the one with a name of submit2 that would come through in the form post or get

6757437
hide	show
hide the current div and show the previous one

6757469
google-chrome	firefox
from firefox and google-chrome

6757469
google-chrome	firefox
where as firefox and google-chrome will display the div wider then

6757548
fast-forward	merge
as long as said branch has been rebased on top of the canonical branch the new branch will be able to be fast-forward merge

6757548
fast-forward	merge
more generally the maintainer is rarely the one doing the work of solving non-trivial merge if there is no fast-forward step in sight he she will simply reject that branch and will ask the contributor for a new one

6757603
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
a separate distributed vcs git mercurial bazaar repository could have commit hooks that send patches to a gatekeeper person with svn access to incorporate distributed developer contributions

6757603

6762570
superclass	subclassing
or remove the init in the superclass and explicitly calling it in the subclassing constructor this is what i wanted to avoid since i will have to write it 100 of the time..

tax	shipping
the only way around it would be for paypal to eliminate the ability for the merchant to determine tax and shipping based on the customer s address or require this sort of thing to update it during the paypal payment flow

6763635
google-chrome	firefox

6764112
width	height
the width and height will be inversely proportional to the distance from the viewer

6764112

so if your natural distance from the viewer is a and the new position is at a+z you will want to multiply the original width and height by a a+z

6764201

if you still get an error with and the adding of parens before sending to eval then your data isn t what you think it is and you need to do some debugging to see exactly what is in the response look at the value in the debugger put the value into an alert etc...

svg	vml
raphael has a drawing backend for ie which uses vml dom and a backend for svg-enabled browsers which uses svg dom

6764279
svg	vml
it then has a facade which exposes a uniform drawing api and at runtime it loads the appropriate backend which delegates calls to the uniform drawing api to the appropriate browser api either svg or vml dom

6764279
svg	vml
see here s the svg adapter and here s the vml adapter

6764279
svg	vml
it is however different from svg web in that it does not use flash but instead delegates to vml internally in ie

6764303
ddms	adb
you d think you could run it from an alternate location on the pc and you likely can as long as you use it from the command line but if your fire up ddms it may kill off the running adb server and launch a new one using the default in the path so ultimately you ll have to put your modified version there

6764303
pull	push
more primitive things like logcat shell running process list push pull etc will at least partially work without this provided that your adb daemon doesn t quit modification may be required when it is unable to claim the debug socket

6764790

6765046
put	get
however since i could not find any concrete examples of what i m doing below multiple tasks i thought it might be nice to put it on here to get the answers and hopefully be an example for others

6765071
width	height
you could put a css class on the #square div which has an absolute width and height set and then in your jquery script use removeclass on #square to remove that css class

6765071
width	height
thus with no jquery available it d be that set width and height and then if jquery is enabled it becomes liquid

6767211
oncreate	onstart
so but if you get height of mapview by calling method getheight for example in oncreate or onstart you will get 0 because mapview has not been drawn

6767211
int	boolean
you need to inherit from mapview and override onlayout boolean changed int left int top int right int bottom

bindparam	pdostatement
bool pdostatement bindparam mixed parameter mixed variable

6767280
pdostatement	bindvalue
bool pdostatement bindvalue mixed parameter

you then have to use the iadssecuritydescriptor.control properties to control whether dacls and sacls are inherited by the object from its parent container

6767318
hide	show
if make single tap need show or hide navigation bar

6767333
google-chrome	safari
you should use firebug or something similar in google-chrome safari etc. to help you with your issue

6767352
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
the animate function only works with numberic units such as width height padding margin font-size...not with colors

6767358
backtracking	greedy
for such a question the notion of greedy is merely an implementation detail - if you re using one of the common but inefficient backtracking implementations this can affect performance but not output

6767368
width	height
you will need to build and then parse the pes packets before you can find out the width and height of the video

6767376
google-chrome	firefox
it fixes the ie7 problem and still displays perfectly fine in google-chrome firefox and ie8 that i tested

6767383
hide	show
when you re preforming upgrade you can show user only the progress or you can completely hide the ui

6767502
war	manifest.mf
if you have a war then you can reference it as an optional package by modifying the meta-inf manifest.mf file

6767510
hash	md5
you need to use a twisted.spread.pb.iusernamemd5password credentials object to log in because twisted s pb uses a little challenge response scheme during authentication which requires the password to be hash md5

6767527
width	height
note that i added an offset to the location of the tooltip based on the cell s height and width

6767587
maven	pom.xml
maybe including something in the maven s pom.xml file

6767639
g++	gcc
for example gcc will compile c without mangling names so you can refer directly to the function names as they are in your c source while g++ will compile c++ code with mangled names and you re best off exposing c functions via extern c declarations

6767701
width	height
you could set visibility to hidden and the width and height to 1px or position off the page somewhere as a semi display none

6767735
inherited	properties

width	height
the images that are passed in are all height 127 x width 293

6767765
superclass	subclassing
but even if it was a non- sealed class you d have to subclassing which would ruin the point because they you d have to use the subclassing and not the superclass with the operator since you can t define the operator overload between the base types.

6767765
superclass	subclassing
you could do the overload completely between instances of the subclassing but then you d have to use your new subclassing wherever you wanted to do the overload instead of the original superclass which would look clunky and probably not what you want

6767776
post	get
you will only get the value attribute through post

6767788
jar	manifest.mf

button	checkbox
when i hit on save button i able to find the checkbox which have been checked and i able to do it so far so good but the problem is

6767866
capitalize	uppercase
for some purposes lowercasing everything is better because it lowers the sparsity of the data uppercase words are rarer and might confuse the system unless you have a massive corpus such that the statistics on capitalize words are decent

6767879
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead you use a webclient or httpwebrequest or something similar to get data using the url you construct

6767895
width	height
firstly i would make sure the elements like those menu elements are all set to be variable width height

6767895
width	height
since all the elements are variable width height they will adjust based on the amount of space available to them

6767921
width	height
that s likely to be high ios uses approximately 4 bytes width height per image to store uncompressed uiimage s

6767921
profiling	instrumentation
as always profiling or as apple might say instrumentation before you optimise

6767975
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller a that pushes a uiviewcontroller b onto the stack

6767988
for-loop	loops
now as for your finalplacearray being out of order you are going to need to implement something like clear the finalplacearray before your first for-loop where you printed the expected results and then add nsnull null to each index in loops

6768016
hide	show
i would use quicksearch s show and hide options to add appropriate classes that can be used for filtering by isotope

6768017
inherited	properties
then inherited from that class and add aditional properties

6768081
automake	autotools
it is frequently used with gnu automake and gnu libtool collectively known as autotools

6768136
super	implements
the normal way to dispose of an object is to implements -dealloc where you release any ivars then call super dealloc like this

for-loop	loops
you are calling the dispose method inside a for-loop so when the program completes the first run of the code inside loops it then gets rid of the paint object

6768244
width	height
however when this png is loaded it causes the bitmap returned to have a -1 width and height

6768247

when one of the hyperlink buttons is selected jquery hide the displayed text inputs and buttons and show a different set of text inputs and hyperlink buttons

6768278
intersect	contains
the linq to objects extensions contains some set operations like intersect and union

6768278
comparator	icomparer
note employee must implement comparator employee or you should write an icomparer employee and provide it to the setlist constructor calls above

6768355
for-loop	loops
to get the data for all 40 rows you need a loops like a for-loop conditioned by mysql_num_rows

6768413

6768426
x86	64bit
on x86 either 64bit or 32-bit linux --

6768495
post	get
here is a blog post describing how to get html from a url using the java sdk or apache commons httpclient

6768595
webkit	gecko
the former gives false positives on at least some other browsers firefox for instance which uses gecko not webkit

6768595
google-chrome	safari
works for me detecting the difference between google-chrome which also uses v8 and safari which also uses jsc

6768672
portrait	landscape
some of the content on certain pages might not fit in portrait mode at all based on how things are already laid out in landscape

6768673
addclass	removeclass
it seems that this createcallback function is getting called a lot when i use addclass removeclass and it s happening in both firefox 3.6 and firefox 5

6768673
google-chrome	firefox
i found the same function in google-chrome and put a breakpoint on it and it s not getting called at all so this seems to be a firefox thing

6768673
addclass	removeclass
only the first two involved me calling removeclass and addclass

6768673
addclass	removeclass
i ve noticed it getting called also when i mouseover other jqueryui stuff on the page tabs when jquery uses addclass and removeclass

6768743
hide	show
and want to hide show this

6768765
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i saw this behavior in in opera firefox ie ie actually puts textb on a separate line and google-chrome

6768771
width	height
texture width height should be a power of two unless the device supports some extension that alleviates this requirement

6768837
ubuntu	linux	debian-based	linux	debian-based	ubuntu
using ubuntu and probably any other debian-based linux you can install it with

6768843
width	height
you have to declare a height and width for the div element

6768881
hide	show
on the click keyup and change events show or hide the appropriate elements jquery makes this easier

6768894
submit	submission
it makes it very difficult to allow the user to submit one form and while that form is loading via ajax submit other forms including the possibility of triggering an event that causes a new form to appear and then submission that form because of issues with keeping track of where to put the response data for each request

6768961
ienumerable	iqueryable
the sad is that linq to sql actually provide much better support for this with dataloadoptions.associatewith but it is still not exactly what you want whereas linq to entities ef provides only what you call workaround - even with respect to the implementation and existing difference between ienumerable and iqueryable it looks like correct solution

6768962
submit	submission
so what actually happens is that you are getting a javascript error because of wrongly using the function and the submit handler never has time to return false and cancel the default submission of the form and the browser happily proceeds into posting to the action of the form which is empty and default to the action that rendered this form

6768993
doc	rtf
i need to convert ms word doc to rtf file and load it into richtextbox and get the rtf string and plaintext string to db get the plaintext string for full text indexing allowing user the search

6769095
width	height
typically i ll resample to a width and height 4 times greater or 8 or 16 than the original

6769102
readonly	temporary
one option would be to make a new step in the build process that removes the readonly bit from the installed files but due to the nature of the build tool that will require a second temporary directory...ugh

6769115

6769204
rss	feed
i want the content to be loaded inside the application when the list item is clicked which is holding the rss feedlable example new feed in the list

6769231
public	protected
they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected

6769232
mouseover	mouseenter
if you are not inserting the list items dynamically to the dom in my opinion you dont need to use the .live as far as the flickering problem you are facing is probably because the mouseover bubbles instead if you use mouseenter you will be fine .

6769242
sorting	filtering
i am really interested in the addons for better jtable filtering sorting and customization ability

6769274

6769289
accessor	properties
value is a special keyword in c# that only has special meaning in the set accessor of a properties you define

6769419
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
you must use ff4+ or google-chrome and i haven t tried opera or safari

6769425
xrange	enumerate
for i val in enumerate numbers instead of for i in xrange 0 len listnumbers 1 etc

6769430
rsa	aes
the only solution i can come up with is to encrypt properly encrypt not hash the password into the database probably using rsa key based aes as i already have something to deal with that and decrypt it when i need to compare seems a very slow way around though as it will need decrypting and hashing for every single login on smtp and imap

6769437
folder	directory
if i want it to be a folder and not a file type i will pass directory

6769487
folder	directory
i already created virtual directory pointing to folder containing project services url

6769494
mp3	wav
i m using system.diagnostics.process class to convert wav file to mp3 file in a separated process

6769494
mp3	wav
but i don t really want to record proc somewhere and dispose it after the process exits as that would expose the internal mechanism of how the wav to mp3 conversion is implemented

6769524
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
notice that uitabbarcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller so you can keep using it as a normal uiviewcontroller

6769534
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly when copying an image from either google-chrome or firefox

6769608
fgets	fread
save for tab completion you could probably get it in there if you read out bytes with fread instead of using fgets this gets you on your way lots left to tweak

6769630
post	get
if you like this idea and get stuck please post small sample data expected output and error messages that you re getting

6769656
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
and another would be to loops through the arrays with a for-loop looking at each value

6769679
hide	show
then to show hide

6769683
rss	feed
after the docs and the rss feed on the home page of orchardproject.net a major source of information better than the previous 2 is the source code for the app and modules

6769701
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
one likely reason is that your io buffers are full and need to be fflush so try flushing both stdout and stderr from your process in the java code example code

6769738
filewriter	bufferedwriter
do the out new bufferedwriter new filewriter response

6769772
google-chrome	firefox
i currently think that it s a native browser issue as google-chrome and firefox seem to have the expected behavior

6769779
folder	directory
depending on what that header is you may also need to add its containing folder to the additional include directory property and you may need to add additional libraries and library folder to the linker options

6769809
width	height
the popupwindow probably has a width and height of 0 since the dimensions weren t initialized which would explain why you can t see anything

6769809

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i initialized the rest of the uiviewcontroller via code in my uitabbarcontroller i have the following

6769848
post	get
i think this could be a really useful script and so i ve done a little editing with it but actually there are no comments in it and i don t have the time to get it working 100 right now but i wanted to post it here in hopes that somebody could actually pick it up and run with it

6769854
post	get
this post might help people to get some insights about the strategy they should use if they think about going to dvcs in their own company

6769888
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

crypt	salt
when i insert crypt with out the optional second parameter the salt i get different encrypted versions of the same password

6770096
hide	show
if you need to know the implementation of this go to this link - - show hide tab bar

6770108
x86	64bit
in the case of x86 this is defined in arch_pick_mmap_layout which switches based on whether it s using a 32-bit or 64bit architecture for this process

6770113
crypt	salt
since crypt only uses the first two characters or whatever crypt_salt_length is of the salt argument passing in the encrypted password of which the first characters are the salt originally used to encrypt it does the right thing

6770122
folder	directory
easiest way is to look in your android sdk location on my machine that is c projects android android-sdk-windows-1.5_r1 in the platforms folder is a separate directory for each version of android

6770150
spatialite	proj
given the requirements of the proj it was decided that spatialite was a good choice especially because it is a mere extension of sqlite which is already supported by openframeworks through community developed addons

6770164
hash	salt
using passwords or encrypted forms of passwords as salt is not recommended but using some random hash base64 of a phrase is commonly used

6770166
capistrano	rvm
alternately you could just use the rvm capistrano solution

6770166
capistrano	rvm
look for rvm capistrano integration on the rvm website for more details

6770199
exponent	addition
for addition the basic principle is to break the representation 64 bits of each value into its three consitituent parts - sign exponent and mantissa

6770199
subtract	add
then shift the mantissa of one part based on the difference in the exponents add to or subtract from the mantissa of the other part based on the sign bits and possibly renormalise the result by shifting the mantissa and adjusting the exponent correspondingly

margin	height
i switched to having the image inline as usual but added a negative top margin equal to its own height since the image completely fills the cell it displays underneath the image i want to replace

6770371
unsigned	short
for example a 16-bit unsigned short can be promoted to a 32-bit signed int because every possible value of unsigned short can be represented as a signed int

6770371
unsigned	short
the types will be promoted to an unsigned type if and only if that s necessary to preserve the values of the smaller type if unsigned short and signed int are both 16 bits then a signed int can t represent all possible values of unsigned short so an unsigned short will be promoted to unsigned int

6770406

what i have done to prevent this is have the view thats loading into the gallery have a explicit height and width in dip s and using an imageview subclass that ignores layout requests

using the width and height of the screen in pixels is usually not good design but you can achieve what you want by simply passing the current activity to a static method located in some other class accessible by all the activities that should execute the code

i would say the use of inline is only ok for trivial getter setter functions written directly in the .h

draggable	droppable
the code below all works fine for example it allows a student to change a selection but it also allows a student to put two draggable on one droppable

integer	unsigned	range	minimum
if you re desperate to save a few bytes per date again with mongo s padding and minimum block size and everything this is only worth the trouble in very rare cases you can store dates as a 3 byte binary blob by storing it as an unsigned integer in yyyymmdd format or a 2 byte binary blob denoting days since january 1st of year x where x must be chosen appropriately since that only supports a date range spanning 179 years

records	anti-join
while it may seem that the inner query should be executed for each records from the outer query which seems to be bad for not exists and even worse for not in since the latter query is not even correlated it may be optimized just as well as all other queries are optimized using appropriate anti-join methods

6778054

i d also recommend that to initially get it working start with just a string of json even one that you copy from their examples that you put right in your code

width	height
i assume that masterbackground was being created with width and height of 0 previously and this is why no mousemove was being detected

6779406
stdout	stderr
that is i would like to do the same thing from my perl script as a shell does when invoking a child process that is fully connecting stdin stdout and stderr

i m not sure why you re getting that message but i d say the problem is you re trying to use pdostatement bindparam which binds as a reference and only gets the value of the variable when you call pdostatement execute however by that time the original variable has been overwritten with a new value

6779538
pdostatement	bindvalue	bindparam	pdostatement	bindparam	bindvalue
either use pdostatement bindvalue so the value is copied within the loop or use unique variable references with bindparam

websphere	ibm
so the 1.6 jre within ibm websphere application server v 7.x.x.x will run java ee code as far back as java ee 1 which i think might be java 1.2 compliant and should support java se code as far back as 1.1

6780880
udp	tcp
write a java client that uses tcp or udp sockets

6780880
udp	tcp
in the second case tcp is still synchronous but if you need asynchronous non-blocking behavior you can use udp

6780880
udp	tcp
additionally reset_package does not reset java tcp or udp sockets so you won t need to deal with tear-down reconnect pain

6780916

maven	m2e
regarding aarons comment about m2e check the checkout all projects option when checking out your project use checkout as maven project from the svn repositories view

6781105
getter	setter	inherited	properties
perhaps its because they wanted to ensure that an override of a getter will follow the same inherited path as an override of a setter but it would seem there are cases where regarding getter and setter as separate items would be more useful in some cases for example it may be useful to have a properties get method return a type which is distinct from but coercible to the set method type

6781610
activemq	rabbitmq
now how to scale it s not a good idea to have a lot of threads running at the same time os constraints etc so i d choose to scale horizontally meaning to add a load balancer that can send the requests to different servers that can be linked by using messages using jms like rabbitmq or activemq or even using a protocol like stomp or amqp

6781615
put	get
i m not sure if it s what you really should do but here s what you asked for put this in initialize and you ll get a list of the derived property names

6781931
hash	md5
from what i ve read md5 hash passwords are the best ways to store them in a database

6781940
equals	compareto
equals hashcode and compareto would be implemented using the value of the double

6781990
hash	md5
you d want to do the md5 conversion in your script and then insert that resulting hash into the query

6781999
post	get
the variable is local to the currently executing script started by the http post request so it s not possible a user will get another users uploaded files

6782083
cos	sin
the functions cos and sin both take your angle and map it to -1 1

6782176
httpresponse	request
if i understood the question correctly then you want to add a cookie to httpresponse at some point after receiving a request from a client

6782176
httprequest	httpresponse
thus you can check if it s available in httprequest and if not then add it to httpresponse and invoke your additional logic

6782189
hash	md5
that said lets use hash sha256 instead of md5 to represent the hashing part of the process

6782189
hash	salt
when you first create a username and password you will hash the raw password with some salt some random extra characters added to each password to make them longer stronger

6782237
hex	binary
if that is binary encoding it to hex or base64 might help

6782238
children	parent

6782324
google-chrome	firefox
if viewed in google-chrome or firefox the word share is to the left of the orange + addthis button

6782411
xslt	xquery
all you need is a schema-aware xquery or xslt 2.0 processor that runs in your chosen environment

6782438
apache	nginx
it is solved via two complementary mechanisms 1 putting ruby on rails node.js behind a dedicated webserver written in c and tested to hell and back like nginx or apache lighttd

6782438
express	node.js
reading frameworks like express makes it seem like the standard practice is to just serve everything through one jack-of-all-trades node.js service .

6782438
bower	npm
even if you are using something else to serve web content you might still use node.js as a build tool using npm modules to organize your code bower to stitch it into a single asset and uglify-js to minify it for deployment

6782438
post	get
see raynos s post on using futures this is the post that made me get futures

6782438

6782458
borderless	panel
createwindow createwindowex with ws_child would create a borderless menubarless window aka panel

6782472
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
also if you are counting on some event to fire that isn t firing you should search on that ie viewdidload not firing because that can both occasionally be broken ie no connection to the files owner but more often one might misunderstand when that actually gets fired ie viewdidload vs viewdidappear vs viewwillappear etc.

6782610
hash	salt
you can use a format like 128-bit salt 512-bit password hash when storing the hash passwords

6782638
post	get
this blog post should get you most of the way there - it s actually very easy to take existing viewmodels that use other frameworks and rxui ify them

6783049
int	double
but the below also works from convert string to nullable type int double etc...

6783051
min	max
from empirical testing it appears that max and min on a list will return the first in the list that matches the max min in the event of a tie

6783063

other answers are giving the cpython answer but other implementations ironpython jython could function differently

6783157
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
one of the proposals that didn t make it was selection roughly implemented by opera safari and google-chrome and by firefox as moz-selection but your use case doesn t really say anything about what you want to do so i have no idea if that selector is relevant to your needs

6783211
queue	fifo
i want the transactional emails to be delivered before the bulk mails but mailgun queue works on a fifo basis

komodo	notepad++
personally i use komodo or notepad++

6783348
public	protected
this is a property which is backed by a public field in this case it is somewhat redundant mparms should be declared as protected or private

6783360
folder	directory
opening a file available in present working directory s temp folder in python

6783392

this saves you from writing some code if our property getter and setter don t need to contain any logic

6783535
children	parent
i ve abstracted my collection name to parent and it s embedded documents to children

6783535
children	parent
in the map function i find the parent document in the collection which i m pretty sure uses the _id index and emit its id and children to the reduce function

6783575
post	get
thus you includes d s id as a get or post parameter

6783575
post	get
c as an alternative one could encrypt get and post parameters somehow

6783576
min	max
i don t see any of the linq methods like max min single etc and if i call those none of them work with the notsupportedexception

6783600
hash	md5
there were about 1 million rows and it took 2 hours to compute the md5 hash column

6783607
min	max
make an x-axis scale going from your min value to your max value in your case it would be pv.scale.linear -10 10 .range 0 w

6783607
min	max
in my example i calculate min and max based on the data

6783658
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it seems that all the browsers or at least ie firefox google-chrome opera have agreed on encoding unsupported characters as an xml entity

6783700

if you could setup your rewriterule in apache s conf and point your redirects to a php file then you could have php running w apc and have the logging done to a memcached object

6783713
children	parent	uiview	subviews
you could create a parent uiview to which you add children or subviews

6783759

right now i have to add another project project2 to the solution that not only must use class a both getter and setter but also project1 has a reference to this new project

6783931
maven	m2e
i switched from q4e helios to indigo m2e plugin and my maven 2 project no longer works

6783961
getter	setter
you code for the localstorage is actually working even if its suggested to use its getter setter methods instead of direct property access

6783966
put	get
the closest that you can get is to set the background image of the very first view in your application to the same default.png graphic and put a uiactivityindicator somewhere in that view

6783986
put	get
the best way to do this is to put the variable in an object and make all users of the variable access it through get and set methods or more specifically named methods

free	malloc
yes you have to free every instance of an object u allocated using the new operator or using the malloc function

6784218
inherited	properties
personally i think this is a mistake on microsofts part they should have allowed the programmer to override visibility of constructors methods and properties in base classes and then make it so that constructors are always inherited

6784280
min	max
i made the server multithreaded so that it can take either multiple requests such as finding the sum max min of a string of numbers provided by the user from a single client or accept multiple connections from different clients

6784282

i haven t tried this but you should be able to intercept the regular volume buttons by overriding onkeydown int keycode keyevent event in your activity

6784771
filtering	grouping
i have a serious problem while the user is filtering words somthing like search word but according char s category s grouping s etc

union	distinct
the best option in the sql is the union though you may be able to save some performance by taking out the distinct keywords

union	distinct
union provides the unique set from two tables so distinct is redundant in this case

6790601

4 not sure what you mean by standard getter and setter but writes to most variable types except double and long are atomic and so don t need sync just volatile for visibility

system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
i put my hope on this answer and reviewed the dllpath in the registry which is actually supposed to relate to odp.net as opposed to system.data.oracleclient and saw that dllpath points to the correct x64 installation of odac so if my application wasn t using system.data.oracleclient it should work b but since it does use that it still failed

6791235
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu it s easily installed

6791246
aggregate-functions	coalesce
group by id_a id_b then i believe i would be where i want to be but unfortunately coalesce is not an aggregate-functions but a scalar function

maven	m2e
instead of using the maven eclipse plugin mvn eclipse eclipse you could use maven eclipse integration plugin m2e all your jars will stay in the local repository

6791953

6792774
jar	war
manually placing jar in web-inf lib or setting the deployment assembly or letting an external build system like maven place the as jar in web-inf lib of produced war during the build is only for libraries which are required to get the code to deploy and run on the target environment too

6792780

it seems to me that your best bet is the getter setter method since you have a keyframe at the end where a new value will be inserted into the variable s value

6792817
hide	show
i have this piece of code that i use to show hide a popup

6792832

6793898
regression	anova

then when the user attempts to logon the next time grab the salt from the database and hash it as usual with the password provided by the user during logon and compare that value to the passwordhash in the database

6793930
button	checkbox
i added some checkbox one for each tag that could be chosen and a submit button but html forms send the data to the next page using which isn t part of the url and is generally annoying if you want to reload the page and get asked every time what if you want to resend data and stuff

properties extends hashtable implements map so you can get all the keys as a using keyset

6794076
uiview	subviews
however in that case i created a uiview with two subviews one for the tableview and one for a navbar

6794076

post	get
php will receive the request from javascript in the form of a post or get

6794097
width	margin
this doesn t work with the above margin trick because you don t know how much to offset it unless the width is fixed and you can t use relative values like 50 because it will be relative to the parent and not the element it s applied to

6794097
width	margin
thus 50 for transform means half the width of the element while 50 for margin is half of the parent s width

6794097
width	height
using similar code to the above example i recreated the same scenario using completely dynamic width and height

6794137
width	margin
you will need to set your width and then it gets the window width and changes the margin every few seconds

6794258
width	height
then inside of that place two linearlayouts that both have fill parent on width and height

6794277
put	get
or put it in their private app store if they get an enterprise enrollment

6794278
rar	gzip	rar	zip
when you want to send a big file to your friend you compress it using zip rar or other archiver like gzip to save some bytes and make it faster

6794327
put	get
i get back put failed 46 which i m pretty sure means that it s an s3statusconnectionfailed error

6794345
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what happen if i am using some other browser like firefox google-chrome or safari

6794350
typedef	struct
you could also think of using typedef to get rid of the struct part

6794369
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome however firefox is throwing an error referencing this for some reason

6794382
dbcontext	objectcontext
actually i use dbcontext but i just tested it with objectcontext as well

6794390

int	chars
i m using gcc to compile a program which adds floats longs int and chars

6794405
infobox	infowindow
the markers when clicked open up an infobox note this is a little different than an infowindow -

6794406
oncreate	setcontentview
in your oncreate method make sure you call setcontentview before any other ui-related tasks

6794420
portrait	landscape
i was also experiencing the problem of the uiwebview contents not sizing properly when switching from landscape to portrait

6794503
x86	64bit
the debug versions of the crt dlls are all available with the standard visual studio installation including the x86 versions even on 64bit machines

6794510
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if it doesnâ t let you stick a uiviewcontroller in between them making uinavigationcontroller embeds uiviewcontroller which has a uitabbarcontrollerâ s view added to it

6794519
sorting	grouping
you can solve this in a vectorized way by first sorting the array using the function sort then finding the indices into the sorted array where the differences between neighboring values are greater than your threshold where the grouping boundaries are using the functions diff and find

6794521
portrait	landscape
i was also experiencing the problem of the uiwebview contents not sizing properly when switching from landscape to portrait

6794530
google-chrome	firefox
found out that specifying works for google-chrome and firefox but shows annoying tool-tip with one space in ie

6794530
google-chrome	firefox
works for ie but completely ignored by google-chrome and firefox thus showing parent s tool-tip

6794564
pop-up	dialog
this gives me a link called apple that onclick pop-up a jquery modal dialog

pbkdf2 is also future-proof because it doesn t depend on a specific hash algorithm

6794672
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
all anothers common browsers like ie opera safari and firefox works fine

6794686
inline	inlining
inlining also known as inline expansion is a way to optimize a program by replacing function calls with the actual body of the function being called at compile-time

6794698
width	height
and remove the width and height from the iframe tag

6794728
range	minimum
in addition i also read that a 32-bit windows system has a physical memory limit of 4gb probably due to minimum address bus assumptions so even though a system may have more than 4 gigabytes of physical memory installed a 32 bit kernel will only allocate addresses within the 4gb range

6794738
for-loop	arrays
the only method call i permit to myself to write into the for-loop is a call of length method of arrays

6794791
pdfsharp	migradoc
pdf pdfsharp or migradoc

6794825
postgresql	mysql
when you have a complicated query with a lot of joins etc one day you need to understand how to optimize it and you come to explain command mysql explain postgresql explain to study the execution plan

6794825
postgresql	mysql
if you know different practise for different servers please specify explicitly mysql postgresql mssql etc

6794847
uiview	calayer
another approach could be using calayer s instead of uiview s

6794857
margin	height
the scroll bar was appearing because borders and padding add extra height to the footer so the negative margin was actually too small

6794857
google-chrome	firefox
while this works in firefox the op found out it does not work in google-chrome

6794870
for-loop	loops
you can replace the for-loop in your sample with a while loops and a mutable flag or with a tail-recursive function a tail-recursive function is compiled into a loops so it will be efficient even in imperative solution

6794884
decoder	encoder
if you simply want to serialize an object compatible with javabeans specification look at xml encoder and decoder

6794928
nunit	moq
i am working on a class that utilises a udpclient and attempting to learn utilise a tdd approach using nunit and moq in the process

6794947
uiview	subviews
it happened once in my app when i called a drawing method in my custom subclass of uiview instance right before i added it as a subviews to parent view

6795020
disk	ram
the only way increased memory usage could impact the execution speed of your program is if you have reached a point where the machine is swapping lots of ram to disk

6795025
implements	extends
edit i know i could try to extends map and implements my own wrapper etc but i am specifically asking about doing this just using using java s generic support

6795026
observer-pattern	mediator
use data caching mediator pattern observer-pattern

6795045
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in firefox 5 internet explorer 8 and google-chrome 12

6795060
cos	sin
it s more efficient since cos and sin are cpu-expensive in comparison

6795073
aptana	radrails
it sounds like you have an older version of aptana rdt radrails or dltk ruby installed as there is no ruby perspective in aptana 3.x

6795073
stdout	stderr
the enter return behavior you re talking about sounds like the program is not flushing stderr stdout and hitting enter is proceeding to enter in the input so it s buffering the output you should see that forms the prompt then you hit enter return and it takes that as the input so it proceeds after the gets call

6795146
google-chrome	firefox
these emails work fine in firefox and google-chrome but the images do not show up in internet explorer ie

6795161
uilabel	uifont
there s a so thread about changing the uilabel uifont letter spacing which ought to provide you with a direction to go in

6795186
hide	show
these statements will hide everything and the only show the formatted table of table_name at the end of that script

6795191
client-side	server-side
if you want to truly hide logic from your viewers then you need to do it server-side rather than with client-side javascript

6795195
graphics2d	bufferedimage
then you will get bufferedimage instance of which you can make your changes through graphics2d instance which you ll obtain by calling creategraphics on the image instance see docs

6795198
post	get
update i found another so post get selected element #39

6795215
google-chrome	firefox
once you ve installed the plug-in you can use silverlight in ie firefox and google-chrome

6795239
client-side	server-side
you should be performing both client-side and server-side validation

6795295
lwuit	j2mepolish
you can solve this issue by creating your own gui over canvas like j4me j2mepolish and lwuit

6795329
selecteditem	selectedindex
at first i thought binding could be the problem and the list items +are+ bound to an observablecollection but neither the selecteditem or selectedindex are bound at all

6795338
post	get
i m able to send a post request but in the response i always get the header connection close

6795360
client-side	server-side
update the client-side templating throwdown mustache handlebars dust.js and more from linkedin engineering rates mustache in it s top four with it being the only one with native .net rendering vs requiring server-side javascript to render on the server

6795386
client-side	server-side
i d recommend that you take a look at greg young s article on task-based ui s on how dtos and messages interact with your system both client-side and server-side

6795387
width	height
when your image is resampled to a new size the mask might not be precise any more -- since you are resizing to just a one pixel difference on width and height there is no way that this mask could match

6795389
folder	directory
i know that there is a zipfile -api which has a size -method but it requires a path to the file and since my file is located within the assets folder i am pretty sure the only way to read from this directory is by streaming

6795418
width	height
i need what the width and height to be exactly what i want

6795418
width	height
if the image is larger than the height it will only put the height to 350px and ignore the width that i ve set to 350 too

6795425
width	height
i need a spatial partitioning algorithm that doesn t need a level width and a level height

6795446
int	double
in a typical 32-bit computer the size of your objects is 4 sizeof int +sizeof double +sizeof short +padding which typically yields 32 bytes checked with visual studio on win32

6795523
children	parent
i have included an option for the user to select the parent checkbox to check all the children

6795573
getter	setter
you can easily write getter and setter for your gui components like a just some snippets

6795573
getter	setter
using getter and setter it is a standard way of objects data interaction

6795586
hash	md5
you can name it a substring of a md5 hash made of the users id and the time

6795604
post	get
to get around this you can create a php file on your domain which would curl out to the webservice you want and change your post function to call to the php file on your server via ajax

6795632
portrait	landscape
everything works fine in portrait but in landscape mode the label is too far down

6795650
entity-relationship	diagram
i have the following entity-relationship diagram which i want to convert to ror models and associations

6795653
getter	setter
this is arguably more in keeping with oo principles than with ml-style functional programming at least in the sense of oo principles that are espoused by the people who yell at you for using getter and setter and think control flow should be implemented via polymorphism

6795653
pull	push
given the above i d say that the iteratee concept would fit just fine in c# and would be most naturally implemented as a sort of inverted equivalent of ienumerable with compositional data-flow objects and a push interface rather than the standard linq s pull style

6795674
superclass	subclassing
not have your subclassing extend from the superclass

6795675
superclass	subclassing
instead of expecting the subclassing to invoke superclass functionality turn it the other way around

6795727
google-chrome	firefox
for example try applying bold in these editors in both google-chrome and firefox

6795727
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome but in firefox

6795746
put	get
i put in a breakpoint and watched it step into that if statement and get to the base.onauthorization ... call and step right back out again.

6795761
eventlet	gevent
in situations like this i ve had success using eventlet and nowadays gevent is doing the same types of things

6795775
versioning	upgrade
also if there are other third party plugins that rely on a older versioning then until they upgrade you can t

6795808
folder	directory
i don t know of any limit on the number of files you re allowed to put in the various directory in your res folder

6795813

after filteration grouping will be applied on grouping field for filtering data

6795897
opera	firefox
i have discovered a strange bug in firefox 4.0.1 it also happend in opera 11.5 so i ve created this example to show the problem

6795897
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if viewed in safari everything looks fine but when i open it in firefox or opera the image inside the div with a negative margin still takes up space in the div underneath

6795901
jar	war
and would just like to have the end users provide a jar or war file that contains there ui

6795901
jar	war
i don t want to have to bundle the jar inside my war file however whatever the end user provides should be deployable as is

6795908
implements	extends
class zfcms_acl_role_user extends zfcms_model_users implements zend_acl_role_interface

6795912
inherited	properties
your mainpage is a user control which has control as a superclass and hence inherited the above two dependency properties

6795912
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
your static class isn t a subclassing of control so it doesn t inherited these dependency properties

6795919
superclass	subclassing
this way the superclass doesn t have to know what the subclassing need

6795938
children	parent
here s a solution that removes the first level children with the specified name for the parent with the specified id

6795948
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	idictionary	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection	ilist	icollection
these 4 files are ilist icollection idictionary and ienumerable source code files respectively

accessor	properties
make sure your using the properties accessor in the translationobject or retaining the number

6795965
accessor	properties
is the syntax for calling the accessor methods for the properties

6796003
getter	setter
the name of the session attribute is userbean which has a property name with corresponding getter setter

6796064
put	get
unfortunately you won t be able to put on margins padding as they get added to the 100 so the right bottom edges will overflow

6796155
width	height
you can use their partial requests just to pull albumid photoid height and widths of the images and then pull required data depending on your business rules height width

6796161
portrait	landscape
my problem i believe is that i have a gallery in portrait mode and a listview in landscape mode

6796166
int	chars
in addition you don t need the -- d+ matches one or more number chars so looking for zero or more groups of one or more int is redundant in your case and actually means that you can have 0 or more groups of one or more int .

6796195
width	height
there is no way to specify the height and width in number of cells of an html table as each cell must be specified by itself with and tags standing for table data

6796196

i had installed the odbc driver via the initial installer when i installed pg and upgrade it to the latest versioning from

6796259
width	height
if the only problem your facing is the padding will be added to the 100 width and height you may consider the box-sizing css3 property

6796276
put	get
put a try and catch block around that and you get your exception caught

6796280
getter	setter
i m trying to find an example where a parameter that could be controlled through the filter property page has an exposed getter setter so that without loading the property page the filter property can be changed by the parent program that generated the graph

6796301
put	get
an implementation of map for javabeans which uses introspection to get and put properties in the bean

6796310
min	max
if n is odd you have a max level if n is even you have a min level

6796312
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for the way you described your problem you may consider using a uitabbarcontroller instead of a uinavigationcontroller

6796328
int	double
perl s pack has the n and v format specifiers for int and perl 5.10 added the and modifiers so you can read shorts floats and double and some other types in the endianness you want

6796357
button	checkbox
then go to dashboard - pages and themes click the inspect button next to your current theme and you ll see a checkbox next to that new page type -- click the install button or whatever it s called i can t remember but it s obvious when you see it

the code works fine on a nexus one 2.3 samsung galaxy both tmobile and at t versions on 2.2 even a viewsonic tablet but when i try it on a samsung moment on 2.1 i get a pop-up saying sorry this video can not be played and the logcat has some rather terse messages below which mostly pull up issues with streaming or mp3 files

6796450
put	get
to refresh a div as far as i know you need a php page to get the info you want to be displayed in there then use ajax function to put that page in there

6796472
width	height
old width height dimension 480 854 new width height dimension 320 569

6796483
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
so i need to choose ienumerable icollection ilist or may be even list

6796485
width	margin
reason ie 7 needs the parent in this case the element to be fixed width for the child element to use margin 0 auto to center itself

6796521
google-chrome	firefox
now when i give execute this code in the firefox or google-chrome console it gives a syntax error

6796566
innodb	myisam
i have briefly discussed this question in a table so you can conclude whether to go with innodb or myisam

6796566

6796792
clang	llvm
running make install leaves each directory with no action and running locate on a name of an llvm executable such as clang comes up with no results

6796817
unsigned	short
the easiest way is to redefine your color class to hold unsigned char rather than short and make sure they re in the correct order for the endianness of your processor

6796843
hide	show
you will have to use the options dialog word2003 don t know where the ended up in later versions to show hide them all in one fell swoop

6796947
profiler	visualvm
visualvm is practically the standalone netbeans profiler which is a great tool by the way

6796987
gson	jackson
for more dynamic map structure handling i strongly suggest switching to use jackson instead of gson as jackson will deserialize any json object of any arbitrary complexity into a java map with just one simple line of code and it will automatically retain the types of primitive values

6796987
gson	jackson
plus gson has other shortcomings that make switching to jackson well worth it.

6797082
int	chars
i also looked into reading the components of the time column which is the 3rd field of data on each line but not necessarily a fixed number of chars into the line in as 3 simple numbers int then converting to a real number which happens to be a decimal version of the time 107 45 00 - 107.75 which would be fine for the plot but i haven t been able to figure out how to get gnuplot to do that either

6797096
int	boolean
anyways the point is that i store a lot of other things because the nsuserdefaults enable you to store boolean int objects etc

6797098
ienumerable	ilist
implementfoo.thingies returns an ilist which is an ienumerable of thing1s which are ithings

6797130
addition	modulo	subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo
your interviewer may have been worried about overflow but your algorithm works fine if addition and subtraction are performed modulo any number m â n as would be the case for two s complement

you can inject any text html into your aspx page using getmytext where getmytext is a public or protected method in your code behind that returns a string

6797625
gridview	repeater
but if you want to do things the asp.net way you might use a gridview or repeater to display tabular repeating data and databind to it with some data

6797725
post	get
ideally i guess it would be best to store the chunk of html making up each article into a database but there seems to be a lot of problems with this and like i said i can t find many post over this particular topic and as someone new to php and databases i want to get some input on the best way to go about this before i proceed

pull	push
so you instantiate an ef context push objects in or pull objects out it tracks the complete state of the object changes if change tracking on

6797915
x86	64bit
64bit apps will use the 64bit instruction set which carries a great deal more optimisations than default x86 packages which can result in better performance as compared to its x86 counterpart

put	get
i can t put on the around the fb tag in this forum because it won t show up but you get the idea

6798014
tablet	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
your issue is that some tablet not all are actually xhdpi instead of hdpi though i would think it would fall back to hdpi before mdpi

6798014
tablet	mdpi
edit on second thought i think the more likely scenario is that your tablet is actually mdpi as there actually aren t a lot of xhdpi devices

6798042
metaclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
your singletons won t need multiple inherited because the metaclass is not a base class but for subclassing of the created class that use multiple inherited you need to make sure the singleton class is the first leftmost one with a metaclass that redefines __call__ this is very unlikely to be an issue

6798042
metaclass	subclassing
the metaclass is responsible for enforcing the pattern and the created class and subclassing need not be aware that they are singletons

6798042
metaclass	subclassing
since metaclass are usually subclassing of type type it s possible to use one to dynamically create an intermediary base class at run time with it as its metaclass and then use that as the baseclass of the public singleton base class

6798042
metaclass	subclassing
an ironic aspect of this approach is that it s using subclassing to implement a metaclass

6798042
metaclass	isinstance
one possible advantage is that unlike with a pure metaclass isinstance inst singleton will return true

6798080
stretchblt	bitblt
first you should choose in-memory double-buffer drawing using bitblt stretchblt functions

6798104

sha1 like md5 is designed to hash a lot of data very fast so it s very amenable to brute-force password cracking

6798283
put	get
simply put your getting the unique hardware id for each user that uses your app now you simply send that to a wcf service of some kind and store that string in a database you can save information along with their name or their favourite style its really quite simple when you think about it but makes such a big difference in your app ofcourse your app on start up would connect to your wcf service and pull back the values no need for hardware id since that never changes the beauty is your query string can just contain the hardware id of the device and then match it with the hardware id on your database to get the values

6798356

before executing the program a command line tool there was no temp folder in c directory but when i run the program it creates temp folder then in temp it creates user then in user it create fir folder and finally st.csv in it

i don t know how to fix the problem itself but an easy workaround is to move your projects directory outside the documents folder

6798822

wordpress	joomla
whereas customizing extending wordpress joomla drupal et al would mean you d have to invest a huge amount of time learning about their respective frameworks all for the sake of one part of any given website the cms if you learn cakephp you re learning a much more advanced and flexible framework that can pretty much be used to do anything well beyond the confines of cmses

6799867
folder	directory
yet as i navigate through the sdk directory i clearly see a folder called libxml2 libxml with all the headers i need to import

6799885
put	get
the reason i said there is no good monad is that any such monad would have to put the tree into a canonical form for a given number of entries to pass the monad laws or quotient out some balance concerns by not exposing the constructors to the end user but doing the former would require much more stringent reordering than you get for instance from an avl or weighted tree

6799899
getter	setter
but if i want that i need to write an object for every single query which may be many objects pages of code with nothing but setter and getter

6799932
getter	setter
if the object model exists purely to apply some semantics over the jdbc queries and not business logic perhaps public members are appropriate avoiding the need for the getter and setter in the style of the j2ee transfer object pattern

6799935
getter	setter
stateful procedures setter and getter functions allowing access to the arrays while also masking it

6799935
getter	setter
in this respect it is not better from a setter getter set of functions but still not worse

6800100
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
i would try creating a custom listadapter or custom simplecursoradapter

6800106
width	height
one caveat of setting width and height to auto is that when the dialog is larger in size than your content underneath it will stretch

6800133
hide	show
it s because you are using toggle which calls hide and show parts with alternate clicks

6800246

width	margin
for the .wizard ul li - class you should provide a margin padding and maybe relative width

6801084
division	modulo
this may be a bit fishy for negative numbers because it ll depend on the behaviour of division and modulo for negative numbers.

6801100
ceil	floor
you can try ceil and floor functions from math to produce results like 2 and 3 for odd inputs

6801102
width	height
i guess the code is pretty self-explaining the javascript code retrieves the height and width from the image below and creates two new variables newheight and newwidth which are shrunk by 80 of the original values

6801102
width	height
when the document loads those two new variables newheight and newwidth should be assigned to the height and width attribute of the image but this doesn t happen

6801122
stringstream	fstream
the built in streams differ in that some can have separate read and write positions stringstream while others just have one fstream

6801286

but keep in mind each ready event will be executed on its turn in the order they are defined or called

6801303
int	chars
even though you are calling inttohex x 2 each delphi 2010 chars when converted to an int will be in the range from 0 to 65535 which means that the inttohex call is returning between 2 and 4 hex digits which makes it hard for you to read the results without confusion

multiplication is higher precedence than addition and addition is left-associative so this is equivalent to but knowing that only tells you that the first addition will happen before the second addition and that the multiplication will happen before the second addition

6801431
addition	multiplication
all the rules of precedence and associativity are followed there -- the first addition happens before the second addition and the multiplication happens before the second addition

6801431
addition	multiplication
since a appears to the left of c a is evaluated first regardless of the fact that c is involved in a multiplication and a is involved only in an addition

1 you can add the button and checkbox into the html that creates the dialog and not the use dialog s property that generates button for you

button	checkbox
3 a third option use a regular button that provides the same check uncheck semantic that a checkbox i mean visually craft some css when this button is clicked just make sure some hidden field in the dialog markup im thinking in a form you will post after the ok is pressed gets updated to reflect the check state

slideup	slidedown
it looks like you want leaf_class to be added before the slidedown animation starts but only removed after the slideup animation completes

6805808
slideup	slidedown
you can achieve that in a simpler way with a pair of handlers bound to the toggle event and explicit calls to slidedown and slideup instead of slidetoggle

6806630
hide	show
does anybody have an idea how to make these divs show hide on the action of li items on left

6806672
uploadify	plupload
there are also other plugins such as uploadify and plupload which would allow yoiu to achieve the same uploadify for example uses flash while plupload detects what the client supports flash silverlight and if not it may fallback to hidden iframes to simulate the file upload

6806701

now i create a hmac hash of the hash created above using as algorithm and site key algo and key respectively

6807138
jboss	glassfish	jsf	seam
spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things

6807177

6807411
post	get
handling utf-8 get post arguments

6807415
coffeescript	haml
the correct order would be home.js.coffeescript.haml â you want the file to first be evaluated as haml to give you your variables then compiled as coffeescript then finally served as javascript

6807415
coffeescript	haml
however i strongly suspect that the haml processor will choke on some coffeescript syntax

in the pop-up dialog select x86 as the new platform and select any cpu as the source to copy from

6808025
x86	64bit
of course anyone wanting to incorporate physics2d.net into a pure .net engine or one that can accommodate a 64bit process will probably want to build the anycpu solution target instead of the x86 target

i m trying to implement drag and drop in c# and java in order to allow the user to move visual elements around with the mouse but all i m finding on google are tutorials about data transfer and copy paste

6808288
post	get
the problem is that i can t get the post to wok to create the album

6808290
disk	ram
to give a reasonable answer on speeding things up we would need to know the schema of the table the definition of the index you are creating are you reasonably sure if you are including uniqueness in your index that the data is actually unique what are the hardware specs of your server what are your disk speeds how much available space on the disk are you using a raid array what level of raid how much ram do you have and what is the utilization

6808318
width	height
illegalargumentexception if the width or height are 0

6808318
width	height
but while debugging in eclipse i see the width and height are -1 after creation

6808318
width	height
if i add a log and get the width and height

6808318
width	height
then look at the properties of the bitmap the correct width and height are shown i m assuming any call to read the width and height after creation would then update the properties in eclipse and it will show correctly

6808322
puts	gets
some kernel code in the kernel text section might be trying to call a function marked with the __init data macro which the linker puts in the kernel init section that gets de-allocated after boot or module loading

6808346
multiplying	subtract
do they hardcode the different cases adding some constant subtract some constant multiplying by some constant or is there some algorithm that can automatically predict this for you

6808395
for-loop	loops
you could then use a for-loop that would copy the value you want to all selected cells if you want to make the next ten cells follow the pattern use a for or a while loops that will update the value of those 10 cells

6808406
jar	war
reference shared.jar in your webapp when exporting your war from eclipse the tooling will create a jar place it in webapp s web-inf lib folder and create the war see screenshot

i m using simplexml to create an rss feed for google products and i want to create a namespaced child but when i do for example

6808628
hide	show
default is show change it in hide

6808698
width	height
this is just speculation but until the bitmap is used drawn the width and height can be -1 because it doesn t matter and is likely an optimization in the implementation

6808754
pop-up	dialog
i am designing a form in a pop-up dialog no iframe just html and no matter what i do there is always a scrollbar see image below

6808778

to convert data i firstly stored it in nsstring initwithdata datausingencoding nsunicodestringencoding and than created new nsdata from string

6808861
screens	tablet
for example if your multi-pane tablet layout requires at least 600dp of screens width you should place it in layout-sw600dp

6808882
integer	unsigned
bytes are signed in java - an acknowledged design mistake in the language - but we want to print out the hex value as if it were an unsigned integer

6808882
integer	unsigned
the bitwise and with just the bottom 8 bits effectively converts it to the integer value of the byte treated as unsigned

6808924
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
certain operating systems windows are case-insensitive for files and others unix are case-sensitive

6809031
children	parent
my approach is something like load collection of 10 000 children objects persist to database calling update on parent obj empty out children collection to free up ram repeat

6809046
post	get
i need to pass in a business address cafe restaurant museum etc. and get back one or more addresses and post code options

6809095
for-loop	loops
you are accessing the database in your loops because the command is executed within the for-loop

6809111
plone	buildout
other mass uploading options seem not to be updated to recent versions of zope plone except uploadify which makes my server unable to start when installed with buildout

6809112
public	protected
class cc can use any public or protected members of class c as though they were its own and thus only needs to implement things which do not exist in the parent class

6809181
folder	dir
secondly when you checkout it would have created a folder within dir cd into that and then do the rest of the commands

6809186
inherited	properties
for whatever reason if interface ireadablefoo provides a read-only properties foo iwritablefoo provides a write-only properties foo and interface imutablefoo simply inherited both the compiler won t know whether a reference to foo refers to ireadablefoo.foo or iwritablefoo.foo

6809260
rss	feed
i have a big loop that goes through a set of xml data and builds the row based on an rss xml feed

6809291
getter	setter
as my comment said the most prudent and least-expensive in terms of time spent would be to establish prudent rules but not to create a number of faulty constructs like magic getter setter and other cruft since your wily programmers can and probably will at times even without realizing it for instance the public property created in a function get around them

6809329
google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome but even on firefox this is not working

6809335
children	parent
when set up this way you do not need to load all or any for that matter children in your parent s collection - you can instead load or create children set parent on their end and save them

6809346
filesystems	ntfs
which will print ntfs if the path is on that filesystems type

6809462
width	margin
since the image div is now at the bottom and the full width all thats needed is to center the image so i applied margin 0px auto to the image img class centering the image and solving my problem

6809481
folder	directory
if i were you i would move all of your images outside your web directory or preferably just block the pictures folder altogether and then build a php script like this called image.php

6809489
getter	setter
also if i put a number instance variable with setter and getter it binds the value correctly

6809503
equals	compareto
is like java s equals while is like compareto

6809573
hide	show
the street view loads fine the first time but if i hide the div and then show it again the street view window just show a gray background

6809620
multiplying	transpose
i am basically multiplying a matrix by its transpose

6809620
multiplying	transpose
but multiplying this by its transpose gives this

6809712
rss	feed
my problem is not knowing how to dynamically add more items to the listbox after getting the first set of 15 through my custom made rss feed tied to my website into my windows phone 7

6809712
rss	feed
i am thinking of limiting my rss feed to 15 items so that those who subscribe will not be inundated with thousands of items in the feed

6809712
rss	feed
i already have my rss feed classes and i can successfully obtain my rss feed in my phone

6809712
rss	feed
again stated -- once i load my initial 15 items in the windows phone 7 how can i load additional sets of 15 if i keep my rss items in my website xml kept to 15 items at a time again so that i don t have an rss feed with 1000s of items every time a person loads it

6809726
button	checkbox
the checkbox s appearance mode is button

6809726

i ve tried to uncheck the checkbox on contextmenustrip s visiblechanged closed event but this caused menu not to hide or hide and show immediately

6809735
hash	md5
i have a web server that creates a qr code which is username + a md5 hash of username password

6809737
gdi	directwrite
now you can either use directwrite and then as you said render to gdi or d2d which is somewhat clunky or alternatively make your own font-handling class and use that which is what i ve chosen to done for my project

6809739
folder	directory
i like to keep all of my sdks in one place and for me an sdk folder under my home directory makes the most sense

6809761
put	get
im not sure about the other platforms but if you put your password hardcoded in plaintext on android they would get it really easily

6809783
serializable	deserialization
that proxy type requires a which is the root of your problem - for some reason gwt wires up all of the serializable deserialization methods in a string- js function map probably to facilitate fast lookups - but this setup code comes at the cost of lines of code that need to be in the final build

6809790
webclient	httpwebrequest
my program is using httpwebrequest not webclient

6809826
stdout	stderr
the bundle2 script is a mix between bundle exec and rackup with added bonus of decent error reports since fcgi has no stderr and no stdout and alot of elements in the chain swallow all possible exceptions resulting in crashes

6809841
put	get
notice when i put echo hello world etc in the controller i do get hello world in the alert box from the javascript

6809844
getter	setter
corresponding setter for id property getter mapped is not specified or does not really save passed argument value

6809893
textarea	textbox
when using the debug console in chrome document.getelementsbytagname textarea returns an array containing the textbox where you type the tweet but in my userscript it just returns an empty array

6809913
width	margin
i suspect that you have an element inside the dialog with 100 width and margin or padding

6809913
width	margin
then the width of the element will be 100 plus the margin and padding

6809932
for-loop	arrays
next you need to compute the average price for the first five days for values in index 0-4 of your arrays and store it in ffavg you can do this using the following simple for-loop

6809953
post	get
i m guessing the script is performing a get request which is the default setting when using ajax instead of a post request

6809957
subtract	add
add a height member to the node structure and determine the balance factor of any given node by subtract the right child s height from the left child s height

this is somewhat simple way of implementing a hover show and hide with jquery

6810084
put	get
i want to get this into a json string to put it into an ajax request

6810143
width	height
setting an inline style on the table to set the width height or

6810162
jobs	cron
i don t believe there is a ready tool for this but i think you may be interested in running a set of cron jobs from the zend framework cli building your own zend_tool provider and in zend_queue

6810208
width	height
insert it with display none and use jquery s width and height function

6810211

we would prefer to use tcp but if we could have significant performance gain with udp we would not mind losing data packets once in a while

6815039
udp	tcp
i started with the asio tutorials and played around with sync async udp tcp projects

6815039
udp	tcp

if you want to load your own modules dynamically study the dlopen dlsym family of functions

6815639
versioning	upgrade
first thought is to upgrade your ruby versioning

6815704
mouseover	mousemove
to detect active tab in browsers you can use mousemove or mouseover events

6815710
folder	directory
this other project is stored in the public directory in the folder of the zend project

6815763
elementname	datagrid
the reason for this is that wpf s and silverlights datagrid columns live outside the logical tree and thus make it impossible to use a binding source specified using elementname which is common when referencing viewmodel properties such as commands from within datagrid template columns

6815777
maven	cobertura
my problem was that i had the cobertura maven plugin setup in the reporting section instead of the build section

6815782

i have tried opera mobile emulator google-chrome 12.07 firefox 5.01 opera 11.5 safari 5.1 safari 5.1 with the iphone ua and ie 9.08

6815960
post	get
from what i can see basically a client calls a web server with get or post i presume and is returned a bunch of xml

6815960
post	get
as in the controller takes the get post parameters and returns json for example to the client

6815999

6816124
post	get
i m trying to get the topics which have the most recent post

6816132
width	height
or you can use a with the appropriate width and height set and use a css background image on it

6816153
post	get
the most obvious difference is that the access of a web service is done with soap and not http as on the servlet so no get or post for the service

6816221
telerik	radcombobox
i am using telerik s radcontrols like radgrid radcombobox on my aspx pages

6816258
post	get
if it s an application authentication submit a post get http request with the details

6816289
folder	directory
my wix installer needs the contents of a directory to be copied to a destination folder

6816291
google-chrome	safari
i ve recently been porting a google-chrome extension to safari and encountered this kind of error bug feature etc.

6816291
google-chrome	safari
ps in google-chrome i can load that page and it thinks i m acting on behalf of logged in user so i guess there are some restrictions in safari

6816293
for-loop	loops
you could use a for-loop or a while loops to do this quite easily

6816296
listview	gridview
note that gridview is hosted by customized listview class that has an event listener on gridviewcolumnheader.clickevent

6816332
internationalization	localization

6816333
internationalization	localization
gettext is an internationalization and localization i18n library which is commonly used for writing multilingual programs

6816377
disk	ram
varchar as you expect is variable-length but keep in mind don t specify something like varchar 100 when you only need 5 characters because although the length is variable when stored on disk it takes the length you specify when working with ram so you will be wasting precious memory

6816423
implements	extends
if you create your own listmodel you should extends abstractlistmodel and when implements your addelement method you need to call a fire -method for notifying the user interface for the update like

6816444
screens	tablet
i m working on a tablet and do want to display as a dialog but do not want to have the height match that of the screens

6816444
hide	show
the html contains links which can hide and show content hiding showing divs

6816467
int	double	int	chars
memset treats any memory buffer as a series of bytes so whether it s chars int float double etc doesn t really matter

6816587
evopdf	winnovative
winnovative did exactly what i needed it uses ie rendering engine unlike evopdf

6816597
postgresql	mysql
i don t know about sql 2008 but postgresql mysql sqlite etc all have extensions for spatially-aware data that can load and store shape files and various other formats

6816619
parent-child	one-to-many
1. i think indexed params only work if you have a parent-child or one-to-many relationship

6816626
superclass	subclassing
if i add self.load at the end of __init__ for both classes the load method of the subclassing would be called twice if try to create an instance of sub once from the superclass and once from the subclassing

6816667

i tried setting the frame property of viewcontroller s view see below in viewdidload and viewdidappear methods but it doesn t work that way

6816688
wordpress	elgg
i ve ruled out drupal too many features i don t need too complex want to try something new and thought i had it narrowed down to wordpress buddypress until i discovered elgg just today

6816690
hide	show
let s say i have some bit of javascript which will modify the dom perhaps hide show a form field or something like that and let s assume i want to execute this task on multiple pages but only once or twice per page

6816700
switching	screens
i am trying to create an application that has a main screens and then three buttons that would allow the user to switching to an entirely different context so i have another screens that does some rendering using opengl and another that will do something completely different to what the main screens does

6816704
google-chrome	safari
maybe testing the same resources in safari google-chrome or android browser would be helpful

6816711
super	abstract
if you actually want to instantiate super it s not an abstract class you need the if test in it s init

6816719
children	parent
the whole idea of mdi is that mdi children are contained within the parent

6816760
width	height
in mxml you can just specify the percentage sign in the width or height property like this

6816760
width	height
the values passed into updatedisplaylist are the component s height and width as defined by that component s parent

6816760
children	parent
although mxml can mask it sometimes all components size and position their children in updatedisplaylist based on the size set by the parent

6816776
folder	directory
i have checked with apache by navigating directly to the directory and i do see the new change with just two files in the folder

6816776
versioning	upgrade
last two things i tried upgrade mamp to latest versioning currently 2.0.1 and cleared all .ds_store from my localhost but to no avail

6816813
pop-up	dialog
this will pop-up a dialog where you can change a lot of options about the method

6816840
free	malloc
as the comments point out another very important detail is not mixing malloc free and new delete

6816840
free	malloc
if you allocate with malloc use free and similarly if you use new use delete

6816851
free	malloc
as a rule of thumb you pair new expressions with delete expressions and malloc function calls with free function calls

6816851
free	malloc
in fact if you really wanted to implement baby s first c++ you could define the operators as just as malloc free

6816867
superclass	subclassing
referencing subclassing in superclass methods is indicative of a design problem in need of refactoring

6816867
superclass	subclassing
while you can do it if this instanceof subclassing it tightly couples the superclass to the subclassing es

6816867
superclass	subclassing
in class-based oop subclassing are of course tightly coupled to the superclass inheriting is inherently tightly-coupling but the converse is rarely true and almost never appropriate

6816867
superclass	subclassing
edit from your edit it almost seems like you re trying to find out in the superclass s method whether it s being called on an instance whose final run-time class is the superclass and not a subclassing

6816897
udp	tcp
with http no tcp udp the only method i am aware of is to poll

6816898
post	get
there might be a limit on the size of data you can send by http get take a look at this question and rewrite your request to use http post

6816912
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the main difference is that c pointers are usually obtained directly through malloc calloc valloc and are released with free

6816962
free	malloc
you ll generally not use pointers in memory management malloc free etc. as this is all handled by the system frameworks

6816995
min	max
seems activity field is a bit and you cannot do a min or max on it

6817001
free	malloc
malloc and free are not to be used in c++ code because they don t support object semantics

6817001
free	malloc
furthermore the results of calling free to release an object that was allocated by new or of using delete to release memory that was allocated by malloc are undefined

6817022
portrait	landscape
for iphone its height is 50 for portrait and 32 for landscape for ipad its height is 66 for portrait and 66 for landscape

6817042
addclass	removeclass

6817082
multiplying	add
for sake of curiousity i would like to add or multiplying the color of the current pixel to the color of the pixel in the previous render frame

6817090
serializable	deserialization
you can also use json_encode and json_decode for serializable and deserialization

6817093
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

6817115
filtering	grouping
one of the requirements is to dynamically allow the user to filtering the results by the eeo job grouping number

6817115
filtering	grouping
i have placed a dropdownlist on the page that allows the user to choose one of the 10 eeo job grouping or by default all job grouping combined no filtering

6817125

6817201
onclick	onsubmit
with the above methods fully implemented your two options are to use the method in either the submit button s onclick event or in the form s onsubmit event

6817201
submit	submission
if you return false the form submit or button click depending on which event you ve wired to will cancel - either way same result - no form submission without what you want in the file field

6817213
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i don t want to use a uinavigationcontroller or a uitabbarcontroller as the rootviewcontroller either

6817384
children	parent
to do so i create a new instance of the child class add the child to the parent s children property of type

6817388
onclick	onchange
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange

6817423
try-catch	exception-handling
a big try-catch around everything in your main-method or a throwing main-method is not the way to use exception-handling

6817445
for-loop	loops
i have setup a for-loop to loops through the ball objects in an nsmutablearray

6817499
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
i would recommend using apache ioutils to copy the inputstream to a bytearrayoutputstream then getting the byte array from that

6817512
integer	unsigned
you have to explicitly select unsigned else it is a signed integer by default so your values can be negatives as well

6817514
g++	gcc
i don t think you can do this with include files apart from modifying the gcc g++ source code and recompile it

6817540
gprof	callgrind
edit oprofile callgrind helgrind gprof papi tau and others i ve analyzed seem not to match my needs

6817578

6817620
int	boolean
this isn t exactly the same as i m returning a boolean for bookedfrom rather than 0 1 int but suspect you are wanting a boolean here based on the alias

if you are talking about application pages then best way to do it is just add a mapped folder to the layouts directory in your sharepoint project by right clicking on the project and selecting add - sharepoint mapped folder

6817958
put	get
the strange part is when i get the results from db which i put in xml the page breaks and does not display the html table

6817964
width	height
as per wpf you are only scaling changing width and height of polygon uielement

6817964
width	height
create adroners and edit points using them visually or simply just update each point on width or height change

6817976
post	get
the value that is stored in variable first gets displayed correctly in all browsers but when i post the form only in ei i get the value of first_credit

6817976
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome its as if that hidden element is not a part of form

6817999
width	height
also i m not sure wether getting the height or width from window will do you much good maybe it s better to get the height and width of the html-element

6818046
codeigniter	atk4
as a result you are pretty much in charge of data management in codeigniter while in atk4 objects bind to each other

6818051

6818156
min	max
this problem could be viewed as bin packing into bins of size max with a funny objective minimize the number of items not packed into bins holding at least min

6818156
min	max
one idea from the bin-packing literature is that the small items in this case items that are small relative to max - min are easy to pack but are accountable for most of the combinatorial explosion of possibilities

6818156
min	max
suppose that max 1 and min 1 2

6818156

and in this case returning int would not be compatible with the expected return type double

6822990
int	double
you d run into trouble because zero says that it returns a double but it actually returns an int

6823056
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
the difference between mouseenter and mouseover is that mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble

6823056
mouseover	mouseenter
this means that you ll get a mouseover event if the mouse moves into any element inside the one you bound to which is probably not what you want whereas you ll only get a mouseenter event if the mouse entered that element itself

6823056

6823649
getter	setter
you use them you have no real logic in the getter setter other than needing to encapsulate

6823678
post	get
the default implementation of service for an httpservlet simply calls the appropriate handler for the request method get post whatever

6823678
put	get	post	get	post	put
you need to override service when you want the same method to handle all incoming methods no matter if it s a get put or post request you ll answer the same to all

6823680
getter	setter
auto-implemented properties with public getter and setter are shortcuts for private backing fields with trivial get and set implementations

6823687
width	height
you simply append the max width and height values with an

6823687
width	height
thefile is the path to the image and max_x and max_y are the width and height values passed in via what the user sets them to be

6823687
width	height
and it resizes while keeping the aspect ratio perfectly but as it s written up there it ignores the height and only resizes the width while keeping the original height

6823698
jobs	cron
cron jobs will run as the user that created them

6823700
google-chrome	safari
additionally under some circumstances that i have not been able to satisfactorily identify both google-chrome and safari will scroll down and place the jstor link centered vertically in the middle of the div

6823700
google-chrome	safari
i don t know what to make of google-chrome and safari s behavior

6823718
google-chrome	safari
i m using osx lion and in both google-chrome and safari the red event is logged before the blue one

6823724
getter	setter
so it s useful to use auto-implemented properties for properties that right now would have trivial getter and setter implementations but that may have more complex implementations in the future

6823833
getter	setter
another class doesn t need to care whether he can access some memory slot somewhere - he just wants an interface for which he can pass or retrieve a value - there are the getter and setter or properties

6823833
getter	setter
before auto properties came along we would typically store a field and create a getter and setter to encapsulate it for the reasons described above

6823926

whether recursion can be used in javascript for-loop recursion is depending on whther the javascript interpreter have implemented tail-call-optimization but most javascript implementations add a comment if you know of any does not have that implemented so generally loops recursion that is calling the function without putting the call on the event queue may cause problems if the call stack becomes too deep

there may be a way of doing this while remaining in the âµ-law domain since scaling becomes addition subtraction but it will be fiddly to get right and probably not worth the loss of portability simplicity unless you are really pushing the performance envelope

6827588
post	get
if i ve understood correctly and you are trying to make an ajax post back to a domain different to your point of origin then you could do this via proxy using the .load or .ajax commands and creating a server side scraper to get the remote page for you

installation	upgrade
use a different signing key - this will prevent installation without removal of the previous app but upgrade notifications will still appear i think

use a different package name - this will prevent upgrade since it is a completely separate app so far as the market is concerned and also has the side-effect that old versioning are still available for those users who are licensed for that data versioning

6828202
versioning	upgrade
the second option may be a better match since you can roll out upgrade if necessary for bug-fixes but can also ensure that wholly new versioning are not detected as an upgrade

the container would add some overhead so you would need to measure it first then subtract that amount from the final output

6828752
google-chrome	firefox
the most simple way to allow it is to go in your source code copy the css address paste it in your address bar and a window should pop-up asking you to confirm the certificate tested in firefox and google-chrome

i used the first line to remove cr linefeed however in temp.txt file i see a single trailing spaces char which is then used by sha256sum.exe

6829200

this will allow you to commit changes to the sub-repo inside a push and then pull and update into the sub-repo inside b keeping them in sync

6829268
int	boolean
i ve only ever had to work with strings within the strings.xml file before but now i have a case where i need to work with boolean and int items

i ve tried editing the height and width parameter within the swfobject but that didn t work

6829438
width	height
i tried reducing the width height in the html css but that also didn t work

6829817
superclass	subclassing
so to make the reading of the code easier and to avoid a lot of typecasting i would like the list of the superclass to refer to the list of the subclassing

6829829
min	max
it looks like maybe you have an array of arrays each inner array has two keys with the same value and you want the min and max of the whole set of values

6829829
min	max
if this is the case you might want to flatten the array so you get a single array with just the values and then use the php min and max functions

6829840
google-chrome	firefox
it shows up fine in google-chrome ie7 and firefox but its messed up in ie8-9

6829842
jsf	seam
i don t use seam just normal jsf + primefaces

6829843
pecl	pear
so pear pecl s sole pupose is now clarified and it also remains clear that xdebug needs to be compiled for php 5.2 as that is the php version used by the acquia 7.4.4 stack

6829860
actionscript	haxe
in java .net or haxe i would be to create a generic type and test against that however i am using actionscript which does not support generics which is why i need a new class for each type to maintain type-safety

6829880
google-chrome	firefox
however i can t make it work locally on firefox google-chrome

6829907
width	height
remove the px in the width and height attributes in the iframe

6829921
google-chrome	firefox
check this fiddle out open your browser javascript console i.e either google-chrome or firebug in firefox

6829974
min	max
here we expect get_slider.php to return a json object containing at least a min and a max property for instantiating the slider

6830025
put	get
assuming you cannot get them to alter their approach i would suggest you consider including all this as part of the product you are producing and using scrum put the tasks on the backlog so that the work involved in performing this is visible and can be prioritised

6830032
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to work on a cd catelog and there are about 4 buttons where the user has to be able to download separate things the catelog itself internet explorer firefox google-chrome and adobe reader

6830045
post	get
also in general new works with a get and a post is sent when creating.

6830060
int	chars
as already mentioned in other answers that you cannot have for non userdefined types like int chars and so on

6830078
pdfsharp	migradoc
i m using pdfsharp and migradoc setting the rows keepwith property to the index of the row

6830166
getter	setter
usually getter setter are defined

6830311
width	height
after the scaling zoom gesture - i get the width and height of the view and it s the same just like the initial size

6830311
width	height
but after onmeasure is finished if i get the width and height of the view it s again the same as before.

6830319
folder	directory
i figured this should be straight forward enough to fix i just need to include the root box2d folder in the pre-included directory so it knows where to look

6830374
fgets	fseek
use fseek fgets

6830386
fontforge	cairo
there is a library called fontforge which is using cairo for rendering but i haven t tried it myself

6830393
wxpython	listctrl
so i have a wxpython listctrl which contains rows of data

6830428
inherited	properties
this currently works but seems to be just a workaround because the properties has to have the same relationships as the classes that inherited from properties

6830449
getter	setter
for instance in a tight loop even if you used references rather than pass-by-value which then requires a costly memory copy operation constantly having to add about eight instructions in x86 for every call to a getter setter in order to setup up its activation record on the stack as well as the function s prologue and epilogue is using up valuable cpu time and really hurts performance

6830449
getter	setter
since you re getter and setter aren t doing much you really don t need them

6830453
x86	64bit
therefore i could check if it is 64bit java by checking if programfiles x86 is defined and if javahome points to location which starts with c program files

6830469
width	height
i have a form on the top of a page with a height of 20-30px and a width of 100

width	height
below there s an iframe with a height of 100 and a width of 100

6830480
centroid	convex
the obvious and simple algorithm i ve been using to handle simple convex polygons is calculating the centroid of the polygon translating that centroid to the origin scaling all the vertices and translating the polygon back to its original location

6830480
centroid	concave
this approach does not work for many or maybe all concave polygons as the centroid often falls outside the polygon so the scaling operation also results in a translation and i need to be able to scale the polygon in place without the final result being translated

6830481
uiview	uiwindow
i have added split view to the uiwindow and worked fine but i need to add uisplitview to uiview controller

6830512
google-chrome	firefox
that s sort of what is happening with firefox and google-chrome

rss	feed
i m using google reader api to get all available items for any rss feed

6835484
client-side	server-side
if you want to show an html page whose contents change every second based on server-side actions you will need to use something like websockets the node-compatible library and some client-side javascript which is somewhat more complicated than the code you have above

6835538
int	boolean
- allowed any number of times not yet invoked post id int title string method_of_exchange string you_tube_url string lat decimal lng decimal bounty int distance int user_id int consider_similar_offers boolean description text created_at datetime updated_at datetime address string city string state string zip string country string county string category_id int slug string status string popularity int delta boolean share_count int needs_reply decimal needs_offer decimal district string .facets any_parameters

docx	xlsx
larger context we re working on an intranet portal s search engine which needs to be able to search within all office types doc docx xls xlsx ppt and pptx

6835984
for-loop	arrays
so you would end up with code that looks like the following since you re only using a single arrays for your matrix you don t need the second for-loop

6836013
hide	show	pop-up	dialog
from the pop-up dialog you can show hide any of the columns that you want

6836016
partialfunction	implicit
your implicit conversion will result in a partialfunction that violates its contract if you apply it to a function that is not defined everywhere

6836026

6836308
children	parent

6836355
actionscript	mxml
i was able to have a button show on a custom itemrenderer from a separate actionscript file but i was unsure how to have the button click event propagate to the mxml file where the datagrid is located

google-chrome	firefox
i have a success callback for a model fetch and everything works fine on google-chrome but on firefox the event does not fire

6836446
width	height
the new width and height of the bitmap would of course be the multiple of the old size and scale

6836467
hash	md5
the second one is also obviously not true because an attacker can search the range of md5 values for the hash although for modern cryptographic-secure hash not md5 this is infeasible

6836467
hash	md5
getting to your question you could just ask the client for the md5 hash of the user s password you d need client side javascript to calculate this but that s a terrible idea

6836472
put	get
use getenvironmentstrings windows api to get everything up front and put them in a map for easy lookup by your service

6836484

i followed the directions found here cannot save file to directory using fpdf to change permission on the folder to enable me to write to the directory but whenever i run my php page now i get

6836657
serializable	deserialization
i believe there is a way that jackson does everything automatically without specifying a deserialization strategy as the serializable of mytype already works

6836680
pop-up	dialog
i certainly do not want the username password dialog box to pop-up

6836681
for-loop	loops
putting else at the end of a for-loop will cause that else block to run only if loops is not broken by break

6836687

even though the textbox is not contained in a typical data bound control such as a repeater or gridview calling databind on a control will force it to evaluate statements

6836700
hide	show
to hide component b and show a -

6836700
width	height
if you have a vertical split use similar approach and switch x with y and width with height

6836749
free	malloc
with your current data structures only one malloc free pair is needed

6836749
free	realloc
your code will also fail if the first call to realloc returns null you re breaking out of the loop and try to free which may be null here

6836752
int	chars
but you don t have any variable to store a string record has an int a float and two chars arrays which have fixed size

6836752
int	chars
so you allocate the record int chars pointer float and where the chars pointer is you allocate memory for the string

6836758
onchange	onblur
i haven t managed to get onchange working however onblur seem to work which may be sufficient for your needs

6836777
google-chrome	firefox

6837045
rss	feed
i m working on an app that downloads a zipped rss feed and then unzips that file and parses the feed to sqlite

6837045
rss	feed
i wonder if it s possible to directly unzip from nsdata to an in-memory representation of the rss feed that can be parsed

6837056
ienumerable	iqueryable
that code is definitely paging on the client side you are using ienumerable not iqueryable so the execution of the query is not deferred

6837056
ienumerable	iqueryable
you could pass the ef query result to paginatedlist and refactor it to use iqueryable instead of ienumerable

6837065
post	get
meaning the server may have gotten the post and acted on it but you will not get the results

6837188
explode	implode
this is how you do it using the explode implode function in a single row

6837224

in my own app i hide the uiwindow i m not using and added a ishidden check in the relevant uiviewcontroller to not allow rotation if the window is currently hidden

6837237
division	subtraction
ibm has a recommendation for comparing two floats using division rather than subtraction - this makes it easier to select an epsilon that works for all ranges of input

6837256
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
the #container gets directly found with getelementbyid then getelementsbytagname is used for the li and finally jquery manually checks the .target class on the results

6837384
folder	directory
what i have done so far is installed pysvn1.6 on my machine and moved the pysvn folder from my usr lib python site-package pysvn directory into the directory of my source files as it seems like that is how the previous author did it

6837457
strsplit	substr
you could parse the string into an array of objects strsplit or substr may help you here depending on the structure of your data

6837460
hash	salt
i would recommend using a salt cryptographic hash

6837460
hash	salt
essentially what you do is this when the user sets a password you generate a new random string the salt and then store the password as the result of hash salt + password

6837460
hash	salt
when the user submits their password you can simply compute hash salt + password again and check that the result matches what is stored in the database

6837498
width	height
you should create a container wrapper for the swf set the width height of the swf to be 100 then scale the container to whatever size you desire

6837522
rss	feed
my problem is is that i am trying to implement a virtualized data set into my rss xml feed

6837522

i push this button to load up the rss feed which in turns displays the items

6837543
pop-up	dialog
there s a part of the site where a dialog pop-up with a text input

6837570
accessor	properties
if you specify retain or copy and do not specify nonatomic then in a reference-counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned value â the implementation will be similar to the following

6837570
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

6837597
width	height
i would get the selected text and place it into an hidden div with the same width and same styles and get its height

6837601
free	malloc
eg you wrote to memory after it had been free or outside the region you had actually allocated with new or malloc or through a pointer that was just plain wrong

6837606
google-chrome	safari
if you use google-chrome or safari maybe also in firebug you can easily see the resulting expression by executing the code in the console

6837665
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with google-chrome and opera but with firefox 2 or 3.6.9 it fails

6837695
fast-forward	merge
there is a good reason for doing that - when presented to another developer assuming the merge is accurate this represents a straightforward fast-forward merge for them

6837709
put	get
i tried to get a line tokenize it and put that in the array

6837714
submit	submission
i want on form submission to take user inputed password value and take sha256 from it via this jquery plugin and submit and

6837752
submit	submission
regardless of where the extra code goes it will be much easier for you to prepare the hash prior to the form submit than it will be to send a second submission chasing after the first

6837775
jboss	glassfish
update we have read this is possible using the sar files in jboss but we don t think it s available in glassfish

6837781
folder	directory
then your root directory for each server will go in the google folder and the yahoo folder respectively

6837823
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
i would create a fileinputstream and a bufferedreader

6837823
post	get
please note this is very sloppy code that almost definitely wont work this is just to get you started and i will post my working code when i get home from work

6837834
children	parent
the sql will recurse down and join parent onto children until it can find no more children to return

6837883
getter	setter
you ll probably want to do something like define some getter and setter on the browser s top object which will necessitate some changes to the js being generated by the php script

6837951
put	get
i often code in such way that i put several classes in one cs file to get my code going and then at some point i want to move every class to a seperate .cs file within my c# project but i have to do this manually by creating a file for every class and cut and paste the class to the new file and then resolve the required namespace one by one for each file

6837956
google-chrome	safari
it renders fine in ie but not in webkit google-chrome safari browsers

6837964
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers google-chrome safari dont allow javascript to create bookmarklets

6837964
google-chrome	firefox
in the end though i suggest you look into making a google-chrome extension or a firefox plugin instead of a bookmarklet since you have more capability with either of the two

6838017
width	height
css allows for some manipulation of the form element - so you should be able to set it s height and width as with any element

6838031
post	get
i need to retrieve the types from each of the post variables sent to a php script but i want to do it without using javascript and or jquery i guess it would also be nice to get the other attributes as well id class etc

6838042
initializer	class-method
there is only one issue with this it will not serialize classes only the initializer object which will not include the class-method

6838050
websphere	ibm
we are using ibm websphere application server 6.1 and browser is internet explorer 8

6838050

6838080
post	get
im having a really hard time getting the html to post all i get is empty divs

6838089
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox scales it so small it s unreadable when using 4x1 paper settings

6838090
viewdidload	viewwillappear
now in the in the viewdidload method or the viewwillappear method go ahead and assign this value back to the textfield

6838095
getter	setter
i ve created a class with the same structure of this xml file called parsedexampledataset it has getter and setter

6838106
for-loop	loops
refer the for-loop tldp.org and loops tldp.org

6838155
mousemove	mousedown
the trouble is - when i mousedown then mousemove about 1-2px the point which i draw disappears

6838172
firefox	safari
this workflow works fine for ie safari and firefox

6838208
qpainter	qwidget	qpainter	qimage	qimage	qwidget
using qimage qpixmap for retrieving pixel information is not an option because i need very fast access to what s already been drawn onto a qwidget via qpainter on both windows and mac

6838227
google-chrome	firefox
tested with google-chrome 12 and firefox 4

6838228
typedef	struct
so i would agree with msn s answer to declare a dummy enum struct forward declaration or typedef declaration with a name that is obviously not going to conflict with anything throw a guid in there for good measure

6838244
getter	setter
therefore when you call your setter and getter you are always affecting the same object which you add multiple times to the array

6838268
width	height
i have a containing div that is constrained in its height and width

6838320
bash	zsh
this script also assumes that bin bash is available on your system change that value as needed to run the available shell bin sh bin ksh bin zsh you may need to change the path bin to usr bin to find the shells

6838335
width	height
its a delay in wrapper getting the height and width of the image

6838335
width	height
the jquery for centering is executing before browser has preformed its reflow and given wrapper the height and width of the image

6838335
width	height
by setting wrapper s height and width with javascript before centering

6838434
screens	tablet
an exception may be x-large displays such as tablet for which a great read is distributing to specific screens

6838451
accessor	properties
since you are using properties accessor and i am assuming you have the properties marked as retain you can simply set the new value - the old will be released automatically

6838456
children	parent
i don t know if there is some critical element i am missing because from my limited experience if a tag has children the tag s children should be contained by the parent tag

6838461
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
no current browser that supports canvas that i have tried google-chrome 12 firefox 5 opera 11.50 internet explorer 9 safari 5 renders the text the same as real text regardless of x-coordinate shift

6838542
ilist	icollection
ilist icollection parents of array etc

6838683
rss	feed
i m using yahoo pipes to analyze an rss feed

6838687
for-loop	arrays
you assign arrydata to a new arrays on every iteration of your for-loop

6838693
folder	directory
if you have a folder in the root directory images emptystar.png and your css is in styles site.css - then you ll need to reference it as

6838758
client-side	server-side
you might want to try client-side javascript solution instead of the default server-side approach

6838770
width	height
for example i have an image that is 1928 width x 451 height

6838770
width	height
then i assign the longest side of the image to 8191 and reduce the shortest side height by the percentage of which the image s width has overflowed in allowable pixels

6838792
put	get
as more an more emails are put into the database it may become unwieldy to get the entire list from the database and then run the comparison

6838852
getter	setter
however my getter and setter s are not getting called

6838852
getter	setter
my getter gets called however the setter still doesn t get called

6838861
g++	gcc
in gcc and g++ the optimization flag -finline-functions will force the inlining of functions it deems simple

6838861
g++	gcc
the -finline-function flag is also set by optimization level 3 enabled in gcc and g++ with the flag -o3

6838861
inline	inlining
with a little tweaking and adding inline directives to your code you should be able to set some compiler flags to achieve full inlining

6838878
getter	setter
cocoa classes don t use as many properties .foo rather they use getter and setter

6838883
google-chrome	firefox
finally and perhaps most importantly you will need to learn how to use either google-chrome s developer tools or mozilla firefox s firebug as these are indispensable tools for reading and writing html css

6838919
width	height
this also could happen due to dynamic height and width are specified in the grid s containing node using css using height or width like 100

6838919
width	height
dynamic height or width may cause problem when calculating the actual height and width

6838934
accessor	properties
to define your own implementation for properties accessor in your example use the following

6838946
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox safari

6838972
addclass	removeclass
what your looking for is the addclass and removeclass functions and on a timer

6838977
post	put
but there is no article method on the http protocol i believe you probably meant either post or put

6838996
post	get
if get method changed to post what are the necessary changes required

6839033
mouse	trackpad
i do this a ton when editing android uis and always reaching for the mouse trackpad is getting really old

6839033
maven	pom.xml
eta as another perhaps more common example consider editing a pom.xml file with the maven plugin installed

6839048
webkit	gecko
your best bet assuming basing your hosting code on open source software isn t an issue for you licensing-wise is probably to look at the implementation of npapi host in webkit chromium and or gecko

6839068
folder	directory
among other things empty cgi-bin folder lying around and an empty dispatch.fcgi file in my public directory

6839096
for-loop	loops
it throws the exception on inc i and if i replace that while loops with a for-loop .

6839101
shadowing	named
there are a few things that package objects are not allowed to do though the list is getting smaller all the time--i m not sure there s anything left except a prohibition against shadowing other named in the package so a regular object might be a better choice

6839103
width	height
so you want to maximize the scale s under the following constraints where h height of image w width of image

6839110
fadein	fadeout
im creating this frame by frame fadein fadeout image but the problem is the ipad is rendering it very slow.is there a better way to do this

6839127
width	height
so you set width to 8191 and then multiply height by 0.9671744007556972

6839127
width	height
if you don t care about your aspect ratio that is you want to stretch on one axis then you already have width at 8191 so set height to 2048 which will result in exactly the limit

6839128
solaris	bsd
absent a system call that actually allocates space for a file without writing data and linux and bsd lack this probably solaris as well you might get a small improvement in performance by using ftrunc 2 truncate 1 to extend the file to the desired size mmap the file into memory then write non-zero data to the first bytes of every disk block use fgetconf to find the disk block size

6839156
post	get
you can change it to post by changing the get to post

6839159
int	double
assuming we convert int into cint the type of double is transformed from

6839159
int	double
export + exports a specialized function for all known num instances at compile time int double etc

6839214
int	chars
the problem is that c code does not do this so if you compiled a c file and tried to make a reference to the name foo the linker wouldn t find it because the name of the function in the generated c++ file is chars foo int instead of foo

6839275
folder	directory
i am creating a java based applet to secure a file system directory directory here stands for the folder tree from being accessed directly

6839296
children	parent
to monitor files in a directory and still allow the directory to be deleted you would have to monitor the parent directory and its children

6839309
put	get
i want to get the image height after it has loaded so i put it on the onload attribute of function here s my code

6839333
put	get
3 get access to the third party libraries and put try catch around where the events are being invoked which could then be forwarded to the main application by a global event

6839366
range	min
however if y excluded min we add 2 c the total excluded space to it to ensure that it s greater than x+c but it ll still be less than b because our range was reduced

6839378
toolbar	tabs
the toolbar works and i can see the tabs on the side

6839408
rsa	aes
generally public key algorithms rsa need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms aes because they rely on different mathematical properties

6839456
x86	64bit
on 64bit os it will need to be done with two commands -- once with x86 version of ntsd once with x64 version so that you will be able to use jit debugger for both 32 and 64bit applications

6839478
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to subscribe to gotfocus event of the datatemplate s stackpanel but apparently i don t receive those events even though mouseenter mouseleave work

6839494
for-loop	loops
update i made some changes to my code but was already suspecting what others here have already pointed out sure the enhanced for-loop is slower but outside of very trivial tight loops the cost should be a miniscule fraction of the cost of the logic of loops

6839547
post	put
i ve put together different if not exists checks in my post ddl if not exists conditions to make sql scripts re-runnable

6839584
for-loop	loops
or you can use a for-loop that iterates over a sequence and then add extra logic to break out of loops

6839625
jquery	nyromodal
see nyromodal in jquery you can see lightbox examples for html forms and image gallery

6839842
umask	chmod
however it is recommended to adjust the permissions using chmod instead of relying on umask

6839847
umask	mkdir
try to add umask 0 before mkdir

6839849
int	chars
since rand can replace int i figured i could save some time by replacing four chars at once instead of one at a time

6839859
put	get
if i put the same button out of the table do not dynamically generate it then it works fine but then i dont get one button per column

6839867
alertdialog	progressdialog
a progressdialog is an extension of the alertdialog class that can

6839869
hide	show
you can also show progressdialog inside the onpreexecute method and then hide the same in onpostexecute method

6839907
jstl	taglib
for jsp jstl taglib please check the following links

6839914
int	chars
perhaps you are expecting that rand 4294967295 will generate a 4 byte int which you maybe interpreting as 4 different chars

6839921
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload or viewwillappear methods

6839985
int	chars
even if the overall chars array is aligned properly for int the 35th chars will not be

6839985
int	chars
if it really is always the 35th then you can pad the data with a leading chars so you re accessing the 36th being a multiple of presumably 32-bit int size then align the text to an 32-bit address with a compiler-specific #pragma or using a union with int32_t

6839985
int	chars
implementing code that overwrites up to three leading unaligned chars then switches to 32-bit int overwrite mode for aligned addresses then back to character-by-character overwrites for up to three trailing chars

6839990
hash	md5
remember md5 hash bytes not characters - it s up to you how to encode those characters as bytes before feeding bytes to md5

6840008
hash	md5
so when we compute md5 hash of the utf-8 encoded data we get the first result

6840008
hash	md5
so when we compute md5 hash of the data represented with the unicode code points of each character in the string possibly iso-8859-1 encoded we get the second result

6840033
superclass	subclassing
call your code in the touchesended method of your subclassing and then call touchesended on the superclass or called it on a specific view object

6840042
int	chars
if you know that sizeof int 4 sizeof chars then the above code will work

6840055
streamingmarkupbuilder	xmlslurper
you can serialize it using streamingmarkupbuilder when xmlslurper will make the required changes and output the results

6840143
pull	push
that way you have to mention to what remote you want to pull from or push to for that matter

6840204
button	checkbox
let s assume we have an interface icontrol and we have three implementations of it - button label checkbox

6840204
button	checkbox
the user will enter a number n at runtime and i should create n controls of a specific type button label or checkbox

6840221

i am having problem in my eclipse subversive 0.7.9.i20100512-1900 javahl 1.6.15

6840275
width	height
for resizing i am adjusting width and height of the movieclip

6840277
free	malloc
one workaround is to malloc as much memory as you can then free that memory

6840282
invokelater	invokeandwait
3 put enabled visible to the invokelater and all action from listener must be wrapped into invokeandwait

6840303
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i using everywhere my own methods instead of new fileinputstream .... and new fileoutputstream .... so this part is no problem i always delegate to the appropriate stream

6840330
int	chars
for this answer i assume that you want to generate the unicode chars int the range between b0 and bf

6840434
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i m using a qtableview and a subclass of qabstracttablemodel as its model

6840434
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i cannot find a way to tell code qtableview or qabstracttablemodel which is the search column

6840462
put	get
for documentation purposes you could put the mapping directly with the actual method declaration so they stay together and are less likely to get out of sync or rather that the mappings will miss new methods as you do not need to declare a mapping for each interface method

6840470
sorting	filtering
what i m selecting filtering on what tables i m using and what i m sorting by

6840474
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for kiddo

6840498
starttls	smtps
using smtps gmail and starttls

6840533
oncreate	ondestroy
if you do not persist you member in onpause ondestroy and then restore it in oncreate you ll have empty field after config change

6840542
folder	directory
the parameter maxage n will copy the files older than n - i normally do a copy to a backup folder and later i do a delete all from that directory once i m sure

6840551
onresume	onpause
to ensure that it s state is always maintained you should persist data on onpause and reload it in onresume

6840558
width	height
i have this problem.i am using decodebytearray to decode and decrypted data as an image and after that i am trying to get the actual size in bytes not width height of that image and show it in textview

having is used to filtering data after the grouping by occurs

6840702
width	height
i could not find any function such as get size or get height or get width

6840798
put	get
so instead of doing the full plot myself i can do that if i have to i am thinking of first making the bodeplot grab the data points do the wrapping on the data once i get the x y data the rest is easy then i need to put the new list of points back into the plot and then use show to display it

6840826
width	height
see width geometry height and size methods

6840841
cvs	svn
even better it supports git svn and cvs even mixing them within the same project if you want to freely experiment with d vcs

6840848
listview	gridview
i got a listview in wpf with a gridview as view

6840853
winpcap	jnetpcap
jnetpcap is an api based on winpcap just install winpcap and it will work

6840906
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i would use a real file and a real fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

6840965
integer	unsigned
you are using u unsigned integer in printf for all parameters but you are passing a pointer and integer and a string parameter i think that is the problem you are having

6840988
multiplication	exponent	division	multiplication	division	exponent
sympy does not cancel things like automatically but i think that any exponent that would combine through multiplication would also combine through division so powers should be canceling

6841001
std	ostream
using different stream types xmlstream rather than std ostream and defining etc and or

6841016
ultrawingrid	ultragrid
i have an infragistics wingrid ultragrid ultrawingrid whatever... with an unbound column

6841153
docx	xlsx
i m note sure about the service however if you can managed and deploy three .net assemblies for doc docx xls xlsx and ppt pptx

6841157
actionlink	renderaction
with creating helper method you reduce the complexity of calling renderaction actionlink and such methods and get rid of the magic strings

6841157
actionlink	renderaction
i would use t4mvc with its renderaction actionlink overloads that accept actionresult

6841158
multiplying	transpose	multiplying	multiplication
since the i j entry counts the number of non zero elements in the element-wise multiplication of rows i and j you can do it by multiplying matrix_logical with its transpose you should convert to numeric data type first e.g

6841310
onfocus	onblur
the only solution i can think of is to use javascript onfocus and onblur to simulate this effect on ie

6841311
calloc	malloc
3 use dlsym to access the memory functions malloc calloc etc and

6841370
keyevent	keyrelease
the best solution is add it to the jtable component where you are laying the jcombobox and implement the method keypressed keyevent e or the keyrelease keyevent e one in order to know which is the key and do the necessary action

6841373
hide	show
and i want to hide that cscript window that will show when i execute the above code

6841392
solaris	aix
we ve used openssl on windows aix solaris hpux and linux for quite a long time and never found any incompatibilities

6841430
button	checkbox
this adds a new checkbox to the dialog but you can use the same approach to add a new radio button

6841434
width	height
any component that requires some dimensional computation for its initialization won t work in a hidden tab because the tab panel itself is hidden via display none so that any elements inside won t report their actual width and height 0 in most browsers

6841495
put	get
when you read the contacts for the first time save them to arraylist make your custom class to hold necessary information about each contact like name and number then put them into the key is the contact number then you can quickly get it from the hashtable

6841602
distance	pdist
elaborating on my comment here is a distance function suitable for pdist

6841602
distance	pdist
note that pdist includes a jaccard distance measure but it is actually the jaccard distance and not the jaccard index or coefficient which is the value you are apparently after

6841682
disk	ram
but network input output is extremely slow compared to disk io which is extremely slow compared to memory ram etc..

6841705

jtextfield	jlabel
but part of them are based on jbutton jtextfield jlabel placed into jpanel with gridlaout gridbaglayout 7x7

6841783
jtable	jlabel
2 for weekview shedules are used jtable with one tablecolumn there put jpanel that contains jlabel because is possible that some shedules are penetrated or for other jcomponents#setopaque false

6841786
put	get
i think that you must put some effort to read the stored values directly as decimals edit your schema or something like that or if it s not possible then read them as strings and use decimal.parse to get actual values

6841791
width	height
this means your table width and height set to specific value less than screen size

6841881
getter	setter
interface will again expose all properties as public and ef demands that property must have getter and setter

6841922
ubuntu	debian
you need to install that using whatever tools ubuntu provides as it is a debian off-shoot apt get should work but there may be other preferred techniques for adding packages to your os

6841922
ubuntu	debian
i don t use ubuntu or debian so i cannot help with this aspect of your q

6841923
width	margin
for example after testing i found out that a control s desired size does not include it s border width and margin

6841928
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

6841956
dbcontext	objectcontext
explicit loading - you will manually tell property to load the approach depends on used api - dbcontext x objectcontext

6842002

6842101
google-chrome	firefox
so in firefox google-chrome it s takes float right in ie it s take float left it s work fine in other page s because you specify your class much more clear then products page reason you specify float right in #pagebottom .footerpanel .addthis_default_style .at15t_compact now the priority of float right is increased

6842109
superclass	subclassing
in my c# project i have a user superclass and an agent and client subclassing

6842153
post	get
is there one sql query that i can use to get the 2 most recent comments for each post that i get from the post table

6842175
superclass	subclassing
you can t cast an object you have instantiated as a superclass to a subclassing as it isn t of that type an object of type user can never been a type of agent

6842177
width	height
because we serve up images via a jsp rather than linking directly to image files shadowbox seems unable to dynamically determine their width and height and so just opens the images in an overlay of the screen size

6842177
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s possible to manually pass in widths and heights to the shadowbox plugin using rel so i ve got around the problem for firefox google-chrome safari using the following code

6842234
try-catch	exception-handling
if the new operator fails to allocate memory the exception-handling std bad_alloc is only getting caught if i put a try-catch block immediately surrounding the new statement

try-catch	exception-handling
you mentioned third party functions inbetween the exception-handling origin and the try-catch

6842632
jquery	nyromodal
when a user opens a link in a modal window using jquery plugin nyromodal and the auth cookie is expired nyromodal shows an error has occoured

6842639
config	ini
my zend app uses 3 ini config files with a total of over 200 lines to parse containing over 100 instructions

6842639
config	ini
the comments in those links have mixed sentiment - some say you should avoid ini config files and do your config in php some say you could use zend_cache_frontend_file and some say it s just not an issue

6842650
implements	extends
event though in declaration of b code reads out extends a implements i it does not mean a would retrospectively be implements interface i - it says b extends a and also implements i

6842665
datatrigger	eventtrigger
you can use an eventtrigger with the targetupdated event to trigger the storyboard instead of a datatrigger

6842668
portrait	landscape
i see the toast and the sysouts for both landscape and portrait orientation changes

6842670
width	height
you can get default display instance and then read width height from it

6842682
width	height
dm.widthpixels contains the width and dm.heightpixels contains the height

6842733
width	font-size
i am looking for a way to have a lable a textarea will do that i can have adjust the font-size automatically so that the text fits the width

6842733
width	font-size
say i have a 200px width label and i have text that spans about 300px the lable should lower the font-size so that it can be shown within the 200px area

6842735
primefaces	openfaces
i saw this kind of solution implemented by primefaces and openfaces

6842740
int	double
instead of calculating a double you want to round to two decimal places you can create an int value which is shifted by two places where 1234 represents 12.34 and then set the scale when you create the bigdecimal

6842753
put	get
yes you ll get only one request handled by apache if you put a quite long keepalive timeout the process will be held for that amount of time by the user

6842763
junit	easymock
i am using easymock and junit

6842773

header block holds some information about the image including it s width and height

6842773
width	height
however each image block has it s own width and height as well

6842790
drawrect	imagenamed
using the method praveen s suggested you could have a global variable for the next background image name and set it in your viewdidload method then in your drawrect method use the imagenamed stored in the variable rather than hardcoding it in the drawrect

6842812
folder	directory
i create a folder in the apache root directory that is owned by root so i can read write and execute with a root user

6842872
distance	polygons
so i just calculate the distance of each polygons based on the avarage of the 4 corners and sort them based on that

6842879
min	max
it s actually somewhere between n-1 and 2 n-1 because you have to compare each element with the current max and min but if the first comparison returns true you don t have to do the second one

6842892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
its works in ie firefox and safari but not in google-chrome browser

6842930
min	max
findin min and max within these two tables is n 2 2 so you have 3 2 n

6843326
width	height
the window is re-sizable and is having 350 pixels width and 250 pixels height

6843357
free	malloc
you free vertorofints when it was not allocated on the heap with malloc but on the stack - local allocation this is invalid and will make your program probably to crash

6843380
width	height
use window.resizeto width height

6843382
disk	ram
this could probably be an nfs file link or if you are only disk space bound you could point it to a ram drive so the files get stored in memory

6843390
hash	hmac
you say you want to hash a password but the code you are using is for a mac message authentication code specifically hmac

6843390
hash	hmac
hash and macs are different things for different purposes though hmac does involve using a hash

6843415
google-chrome	firefox
from quick test all major browsers latest google-chrome firefox and ie give pretty small numbers as the id so just looping blindly over all possible numbers should work just fine

in every upgrade script add a row to that table which can include as little or as many columns as you see fit to describe the upgrade but at a minimum i would suggest versioning execution_date description execution_user

versioning	upgrade
now let s you have an upgrade script from v2.1 to v2.2 of the database and you want to verify the lone maverick guy has actually run it on his database you can just search for rows where versioning v2.2 and if you get a result don t run this upgrade script

6843912

6843985
children	parent
registerattached is normally used where you want to expose a property that can be accessed and set in the child class like dockpanel where children of control tells parent where they want to be placed using dock.left or dock.right

6843985
children	parent
so they are kind of special dependency properties which can be accessed in the child controls which is not the case with simple register properties and they in case of dockpanel helps parent control in displaying children

6844029

6844222
getter	setter
this will create the backing ivar and the getter and setter with the signatures and but in the background they will be manipulating the ivar _audioplayer

6844222
getter	setter
you mentioned in a reply that you come from ruby this can be likened to something like this attr_accessor audio_player but in objective-c it creates setter and getter than can deal with memory management depending on whether you pass in assign retain copy into the property line

6844222
getter	setter
this is how apple does it in most of their examples and it means that it is clearer when you are accessing the ivar directly or going through a getter setter

6844222
getter	setter
i have used the getter setter anytime i have interacted with the audioplayer ivar

6844222
getter	setter
the reason this is using the getter setter is because of the self.audioplayer which will be compiled to the appropriate call like this

6844222
getter	setter
method correct we should use the ivar directly without going through the getter setter so i have to use the _audioplayer ivar that we synthesized like this

6844227

if you have a single process and use threads then sysv semaphores have a large overhead and consume global systemd resources when you don t need to

6861295
ssms	sqlcmd
again the problem is with ssms andnot general like if i run the query using sqlcmd like

6861304

6861574
fortran	ada	ada	pascal
assembly language has nothing to do with it you can take your question how xyz language depends on operating systems and use c pascal ada fortran and a long list of other languages and ask the same question with the same answer the language has nothing to do with it

6861574
cpu	processors
now there is the machine code the actually bits executed by the processors those do not change but the ascii files used to represent those instructions that language can change but not because of the cpu nor the operating system those differences have to do with the toolchain

6861649
width	height
i m relatively new to using the canvas but i assume thats because the square s height and width are relative to the size of the canvas element and so the canvas element s height and width must not be proportional since their assigned percent values as opposed to definite pixels

6861668
uiview	subviews
for uiview view in self.view subviews

6861672
pop-up	dialog
what i do is to pop-up a loading dialog before the ajax call and then use ajax#complete to remove it or change the mssage

int	chars
instead of converting to an int which will take the ascii chars value try using

6861702
google-chrome	firefox	min	max
my plugin accept parameter such as min max and step in input fileds like html5 but my problem is that my plugin is working fine in internet explorer but not in firefox google-chrome

6861702
min	max	minimum	max
this code getting values of variables like min and max in ie but not in chrome thus i m not able to define a minimum and maximum value of a type number input fields like html5 do

6861707
int	chars
the above line takes the chars 1 and converts it to an int

6861707
int	chars
1 is ascii chars 49 so internally the chars has an int representation of 49 and so that is what it is converted to since this is just trying to do a type conversion rather than any kind of processing

6861709
apache	nginx
so my doubt is can i use both nginx and apache server for running on my system

6861721
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if i remember the copy property will actually just retain an immutable copy i.e nsstring and only do a hard copy if it is mutable nsmutablestring

6861748
implements	extends
to get back to your code you cannot extends the membershipuser so simply you have to follow this guideline how to implements a custom membership user

6861764
portrait	landscape
as it stands the height of a jquery page will change especially as devices are rotated portrait to landscape so the solution would have to take this into account

6861769
profiling	instrumentation
usually profiling instrumentation your code on building stage or execution

6861780
interpolation	splines
then when i call ss304 setprop1d with an array of temperatures it should set the values of alpha based on an interpolation of the cubic splines at each temperature in t

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome firefox safari ie7 i ve actually tested these

6862076
post	get
thought it might be better to post here and get some feedback on whether i am doing this the right way or not

6862092
portrait	landscape
to make uiviews in landscape orientation and provided you want your root view controller to always be in portrait mode you have 2 options

6862124
folder	directory
i m not overly comfortable with batch scripting yet and i ve run into a problem - when i try to backup my firefox portable profile it s in a ramdisk it copies the contents of the app data and other folder and throws them all into one folder together without their respective parent directory

6862158
width	margin	width	height	margin	background-color	margin	height

getter	setter
you need to create public getter and setter if you want to change the values

6862466
google-chrome	firefox
one in firefox one in google-chrome for example

6862478
getter	setter
the syntatic shortcut is for when you have a simple property with a assigning returning setter getter

6862478
getter	setter
if you need to implement custom setter getter functionality that also includes setting a value you must make use of a backing class member as you have shown in your 2nd example

6862479
children	parent
as you can see i have a dictionary within a dictionary each parent node has children nodes which themselves are a dictionaryy with images and badges associated with them

6862479
children	parent
i was going to then do a for-loop with children but the problem is is that parent is a nsstring and you can t for-loop over a nsstring

6862492
int	double
for example textbox that accepts an attribute of datatype enum and values like int double email etc

6862492
min	max
another idea is for int type add a min max values i.e 15-32

6862496
pop-up	dialog
is there a way to just force app to never auto pop-up keyboard on new dialog fragments etc.

6862505

domxpath	domdocument
i was wondering if there s any way to do this with domdocument domxpath

6862619
boost	allocator
as your objects are similar they may have the same size in memory which is a good thing since boost variant storage is stack-based no heap allocator - this is faster

6862649
stateless	stateful
a session is typically but not always stateful meaning that at least one of the communicating parts needs to save information about the session history in order to be able to communicate as opposed to stateless communication where the communication consists of independent requests with responses

6862703
button	checkbox
otherwise just disable the submittion button and add a label explaining the situation to the user - and re-enable it as soon as the active number of checkbox drops below the threshhold

6862723

subclass	abstract-class
as far as users of this variable go they only see an object of the type inputstream - it could be any subclass of the abstract-class inputstream

6862785
implements	extends
yes in is the name of an object of type inputstream which is an abstract class there could be many classes that extends that abstract class including fileinputstream - each of which implements the required components of inputstream

6862811
google-chrome	firefox
i only have issues in ie7 not ie8 ie9 firefox or google-chrome

6862860
hide	show
alternatively instead of replacing the content of the main window you could try putting both the main content and the page content in the mainwindow...in separate panels on top of each other and then toggle the visibility of each panel to show hide the required content

prepare	execute
you re using the sql execute which execute a prepare statement when you want to be using the pl pgsql execute which execute a string as sql

6862972

i am drawing some colorful scatter plots using matplotlib in my django app for some small data sets but the import statements add about 1-2 seconds to the run time compared to my previous version which used a javascript graphing utility - so now it takes almost 3 seconds instead of under a 1 2 second to load the page

6863597

change their visibility to protected to see expected behavior that is only when the method is protected public or default visibility the concept of overriding even exists

6863649
width	height
the clickable element is a empty div with a height width and background-image defined in css

6863652
public	protected
for public protected and package private default access methods final does indeed prevent a method being overridden

6863667
int	double
to answer your direct question method2 does create objects by autoboxing assuming that the values you re putting in are primitives double int etc.

6863667
int	double
of course if you use a tuple class you re also creating objects but you will be creating 1 3 the number of objects assuming the tuple class maintains two int s and a double

6863668
jquery	touchswipe
to further dig into my problem will a jquery plugin for swipe functionality like touchswipe or wipetouch help me here

6863715

apparently what it should do is load 4 bytes from the file or 2 in the case of int16 i guess.. convert it from little-endian to big endian and then return it as an unsigned integer

6863715
int	chars
is it something to do with converting between the chars buffer and the unsigned int newbuffer

6863720

afaik you can t do it with java tools like jprofiler jvisualvm etc

6863764

width	height
you can specify the width and height

6864012

6864070
int	chars
with all due respect please since chars s map to int s just check the boundaries

6864073

6865217
equals	gethashcode
you need to define gethashcode and equals for your object to define what equality is for your custom type

6865217
equals	gethashcode
if you don t define a custom comparer which you can do by creating a separate class that implements it will use the default equality comparer which uses the class s equals and gethashcode definition

6865217
equals	gethashcode
either define a custom since you re calling distinct on a sequence of owner or add a equals and gethashcode for your class

6865219
free	malloc
there is nothing too fancy to do malloc for allocation and free for deallocation always paired

6865223
equals	gethashcode
alternatively you could just implement equals and gethashcode on owner and your original method would work

6865241
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
for example curly bracket content gets replaced with a few checkboxlist radiobuttonlist textboxes and a submit button

6865541
free	malloc
for instance if your structure will contain pointers to other memory buffers you can t simply pair a call to malloc and free for your buffer of structures .

6865548
put	get
you will also need to put a redirect in there to get them back to a page

6865638

6865699
public	protected
class properties must be defined as public private or protected

6865702
getter	setter
most books and examples aimed at beginners tend to use very simple objects so it may not make sense as to why you need to go through all the private properties and getter and setter molarchy but as the complexity of an object increases the benefits become increasingly obvious

6865703
int	chars
this will return the int representation of the chars that the user input

6865703
int	chars
however you could also do an if-else based upon the chars itself rather than converting it to an int

6865708
int	chars
if you want the decimal ascii value of a chars just cast it to an int

6865796
extjs	gxt

6865845
inherited	properties
the itemssource normally is used for data-objects and what you do there setting the itemtemplate suggest that you should not make your object inherited from listboxitem at all instead it should be a normal object possibly implementing inotifypropertychanged if properties may change after creation

6865853
superclass	subclassing
and both superclass and subclassing declare a field called field it will always use the superclass one anyway because that s all the compiler can see

6865890
hash	md5
an example of processing would be to generate an md5 hash of the file although the answer could apply to any operation

6866188
inherited	subclassing
next define the method that is to be inherited by the subclassing in currency s prototype

6866288
children	parent
what i want is to be able to order the parent by the time of the children but not to show the children

6866349
profiling	instrumentation
far easier to use than nszombieenabled is to use profiling instead when running and select the nszombie instrumentation

i would put this in the post build event for the main project that depends on everything else in the solution

6866375

inherited	properties
if you want to iterate over all of the properties on an object then inherited properties are the only real problem you have to deal with

6866446
inherited	properties
the object.prototype.hasownproperty method can be used to confirm that a properties exists directly an object and isn t just inherited

6866446

this will print all of the properties of the object itself but it won t print the inherited .example

6866484
struts	wicket
then to implement what you ve learned or already know about the mvc pattern look into struts spring or wicket on how many people implement the mvc pattern in a java project

6866505

win64	wow64
try this looks for wow64 32-bit on 64-bit or win64 native 64-bit in the user-agent string

6866614
addeventlistener	onload
if there were any other listeners to these events then you should use addeventlistener or attachevent instead of onload onabort onerror but if there s only one listener you can go either way

6866618
public	protected
class methods may be defined as public private or protected

6866661
public	protected
so public protected private is to properties as function is to methods now

6866663
width	height
in fact now tat i think you could apply a css class to thins anchor that applies a background-image to it and fixed width and height

6866681
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave

6867045
charat	indexof
the problem is that i need some functionality that comes with strings to be specific i need the charat substr indexof and substring methods

6867076
oncreate	setcontentview
this worked fine in 3.2 but in earlier honeycomb versions the action bar is apparently not set if you don t use the setcontentview in the oncreate method

6867076
oncreate	setcontentview
so i fixed it by using the setcontentview method in my oncreate method and just supplying it with a layout that contained an empty framelayout

how cool would that be your appender puts the log message on an http request queue the queue saves the diagnostic context and restores it when request gets run the http library logs an error and your appender still detects the loop

6867415
hide	show
unfortunately the result of these calls appears to hide the loading view but not show the results

6867435
subtract	add
each time an object moved it would subtract its size value from its old location and add it to its new location

6867475
portrait	landscape
the reason your alertview gets displayed in portrait orientation while the rest of your app gets displayed in landscape is because you are adding the alertview as a subview of your window rather than adding it as a subview of a view controller s view

6867564
width	height
notice that since gl_texture_2d uses normalized coordinates the offsets aren t 1 but 1 width and 1 height of the texture

6867579
width	height
the page size definition is quite easy to figure out 2480 72 300 is going to give me the correct page width in points and then the height for the final pdf page but the other values don t make any sense

6867591
cdr	cons
the cons cell has 1 as the car and 2 as the cdr

6867706
post	get
only the first of those will affect post variables gpc stands for get post and cookies but it s good to set them all since they all suck

6867710
folder	directory
however i came across a doubt netbeans when i created a new project it generated an nbproject folder with figures from the netbeans of course are the project settings since the eclipse generates files in the root directory of the project i wonder if i would do this with eclipse when i create a project in eclipse create it creates a directory named ecproject and play the files

6867710
folder	directory
settings inside this directory so it looks organized application folder

6867733
spaces	delimiter
strtok treats multiple contiguous spaces as a single delimiter so it should resolve your problem

6867735
cifs	smb
even linux servers sometimes use smb cifs the microsoft technique to share files and folders to publish data

6867740
division	multiplication
i dont need multiplication or division at this point so i assume its relatively simple however im not classically trained in php

6867816

6867842
public	protected
for example when class b is derived from class a using protected or private then the public members of a get promoted to protected and private respectively

6867901
superclass	subclassing
if not checking a condition means an error might occur that could have been caught 100 lines earlier or in a superclass instead of being raised in the subclassing then i say there is nothing wrong with checking

6867911
client-side	server-side
in asp.net web pages or razor pages the new framework using the razor view engine is client-side validation supported or is validation strictly server-side out of the box

6868011
google-chrome	firefox
i am aware that firefox 4 ie9 and google-chrome support it but it may or may not be enabled due to the version of the browser the os and the computer hardware itself

6868044
children	parent
except for scrollview and horizontalscrollview the stock layout classes are going to restrict their children to be within the parent bounds

6868054
int	chars
since you asked the htonl ntohl functions are for dealing with uint32_t int directly without explicit chars arrays

6868066
min	max
if you set only the max then there is no restriction on the min

6868066
min	max
if you set only the min there is no restriction on the max

put	get
generally templates get put in the .h files and included everywhere

6868236
range	minimum
but this does not really help me in this case as i do not know what divisions to do before hand unless i do the computation of the transfer function values over the range of the frequencies to find the minimum and the maximum which ends up doing the whole computation twice which i am trying to avoid

6868236
min	max	range	max	range	min
finddivisions would work nice if one knows before hand the min max of the plot range

zlib	libpng
just compile and build zlib and libpng independently and do a find_package png... prior to traversing down into my own app

6874883
zlib	libpng

it also has examples in perl ruby and tcl since the goal is to teach tk itself not the bindings for a particular language

6876463
serializable	deserialization
edit 2 in either case for the sake of clarity and maintainability i think you re better off just defining your own serializable and deserialization functions wherein you introspect the target object call special functions if available and then call serializable

6876473
getter	setter
with protobuf you have to include an additional library and write your data in a specific message format but you gain an automatically generated library with getter setter methods and the data is sent in binary form

so here is my understanding there is a setneedsdisplay in both uiview and calayer class uiview is a composite class that includes a calayer

6876948
uiview	calayer
but uiview uses drawrect while calayer uses drawlayer incontext they both use setneedsdisplay to call it

6876948
uiview	calayer
so i guess at some point in the implementation of uiview a calayer is created and this layer s delegate is set to the uiview class

6877001
put	get
if you put all that content into a single javascript string and get all the quoting and line breaks right to make it a legal javascript string then there should be no problem assigning it to innerhtml and the browser will parse all the tags and create the html for you

6877003
division	multiplication
it uses the sqrt of r s smallest positive floating point number as its default threshold so it handles multiplication and division propagated errors

6877004

6877055
min	max
you only need min and max values to decide nice bin width

6877055

6877679

gl_texture_non_power_of_two cannot break existing applications which expect power of two pot texture because it relax the specification in order to accept textures having any width height depth within the limits of course

6879076

unfortunately the php crypt interface is somewhat awkward the only way to explicitly choose the algorithm you want is by supplying a correctly formatted parameter which means you also have to generate the actual salt yourself

hash	md5
for example the number of bits in an md5 hash is misleading because there are known attacks that reduce the actual search space

6879756
hash	salt
you include the salt unique and unpredictable per hash along with your password when hashing but you also include a unencrypted copy of it outside of your hash so that when verifying the hash later you are able to include the same salt when given a test password before hashing it so you can properly compare the hash

although a single chars constant such as o can be treated as an int and can be promoted to an unsigned long long a string or cannot which means you can t use oaut as an argument to numberwithunsignedlonglong

6879852
int	chars
i guess the four-character code is supposed to be treated as an int the 8 bits of each chars put in place as if they together were a 32-bit int

6879888
int	chars
using a 4 byte chars used as int and promoted to unsigned long long would then be possible

however you do not want people who use the same password to get the same hash so you add a salt to the password before it is hash to ensure that even if two users have the same password they should get a different hash

6881840
put	get
you re relying on the number coming out of the database being exactly the same as the number you put in - and while it seems very odd for you to get exactly the results you re getting in terms of negation i m not wholly surprised that it doesn t work in general

subtraction	addition
note for both addition and subtraction it does not matter whether result is out of range of the enum or not in all three examples above

6882210
ordinals	difference
in other words the operator computes the difference between the ordinals values of x and y and the type of the result is the underlying type of the enumeration

6882228
keydown	keyup
the only events that fire are keydown and keyup and none of them has the value after the effect of special key is applied

6882228
keydown	keyup
i can find that by looking at the event object inside the keydown or keyup event handlers

6882242
post	get
for reference there is no concept of arrays for get post data your form gets transformed a key value string separated by

6882287

of the devices i tested htc hero is normal-screen and mdpi galaxy tab is large-screen and hdpi

6882416
screens	mdpi
is it because it has small screens or because it is mdpi

6882416
screens	hdpi
i ask this because there are devices that are normal screens but hdpi

iâ m using eclipse indigo ide jogl 2.0 libraries when i imported them into eclipse i filled the native library path jzy3d 0.8.4 version

6882470
formview	detailsview
the same as for detailsview but keep in mind that with formview you are more free of how to present your data out of the box detailsview need some tweaks to behave the same

6882470
formview	detailsview
to answer your given example single products details page will be easiest to achieve with detailsview or formview

6882504
uiview	calayer
generally uiview and calayer are implemented on top of opengl so animating the translation of a uiview already makes use of the gpu

6882512
jzy3d	jogl
jzy3d probably requires jogl 1.x

6882562
public	protected
now that i look at the documentation unfortunately ontap geopoint p mapview mapview is not public or protected so you cannot override it

6882583
move	drag
you could then move the error handling code into the method handling the drag drop

6882731
elf	dwarf
on nix systems you referred to dl_open this is implemented through dwarf debugging data in extra sections of the elf binary

6882731
elf	dwarf
windows pes however uses a completely different format so unfortunately dwarf is not truley cross plattform actually in the early development stages of my 3d engine i implemented an elf dwarf loader for windows so that i could use a common format for the engines various modules so with some serious effort such can be done

6882739
ant	maven
using maven or ant would make the proposed change easy to implement

6882755
pull	push
in that case you don t have to tell server b and server c to pull from a instead push from a to b and c

6882756
width	height
specifying static width and height is not a good idea

6882774
boost	allocator
constructor of boost shared pointer from a raw pointer allocates another object on the heap to store the object a reference counter that is why boost intrusive pointer is better since the reference counter is stored in the object avoiding this allocator

6882824
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
method string.contains performs case-sensitive and culture-insensitive comparison so if you want case-insensitive contain use indexof method like

6882828

width	height
so my dubt is if better to save img in 3 dimensions then do not use css or html width and height or if to use same img with css rules about dimensions.

6883227
int	double
there is no way to overload just + for your type unless you want to hide prelude s + operator which would mean you have to create your own addable instance for int double etc

6883264
put	get
i could use mapbindingresult and put the request parameters in that but then i have to get that binding result into the model

6883265
switching	airplane

6883267
google-chrome	firefox
some browsers google-chrome perform very high quality image interpolation while others ie firefox opt for a faster algorithm that does not give as nice of a result

6883267
width	height
as for using css or html tag attributes to set the width and height there will be practically no difference in speed

6883271
disk	ram
since you don t have the source for the exe and you can t won t use a ram disk the next option is to improve the io performance of your machine

6883271
disk	ram
but without access to the source code for the application this isn t really a programming question because the only way you can program a solution is to write your own ram disk application - and you can t use a ram disk so you ve said

6883292
implements	extends
you need to implements extends one of the server controls following to get databinding expression syntax

6883300
put	get
don t put the definition of your struct in both your main.h and main.cpp - or you will get a redefinition error

6883575
udp	tcp
you re limited by the architecture blocking sockets tcp udp all work by blocking until you receive data

6883580
put	get
the couch_url variable is just the regular http request and looks like mycouch _design model3d _list convert all except the path designators _design _view _list have been removed to get model3d convert all for cradle it looks like they are put back in the cradle function

6883603
ostringstream	std
use a std ostringstream for the output buffer

6883605
put	get
the main advantage is that having every request go through index.php makes sure that you have a single entry point into your applications s php code -- which means you can put your initialization configuration code there or call it from there and it ll always get executed

6883618
plot	heatmap
can any body suggest a function to plot heatmap for upper or lower triangular matrix in r

6883620
getter	setter
make sure that your dayreportpersistence class have the correct getter and setter for the fields you are looking for like customer_code contact_code etc.

6883652
for-loop	arrays
you either need to allocate enough space as many vectors as you have lines and use a for-loop to match the line with the offset in the arrays

6883668
folder	directory
be sure to clean your app shift-command-k or clean the build folder option-shift-command-k after making the directory structure change and before running again

6883669
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the init methods for nsstring and nsmutablestring for example both actually return an instance of __nscfstring which inherits from both

6883673
richfaces	tomahawk	primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	tomahawk
if this is really undesireable you might want to check if it works without problems with tomahawk richfaces primefaces etc each which supports rendering the children without additional markup

6883675
width	height
if you want to get all the contents of what is added to your stage then the easiest way would be to add a single container to the stage and add all objects to it then checking the width height of that container

6883675
width	height
this will tell you accurately the cumulative width height of all objects you ve created and added to the display list inside this container or one of it s children

6883675
width	height
then check the width height of the document class

6883675
width	height
this is because i noticed in air 1.0 back in the day that not setting these properties resulted in skewed results when setting object position and reading height width on the stage and in my cause it was probably because of scaling

6883695
post	get
the and other variables are sent correctly using the post method the one that gives the problem is the one in the select tag the variable first to explain is that i get the content for the options tag using a db then i set the options that will show using php for it but i really don t get why wont it send the _document variable using the post method

6883719
post	get
post worked while get didn t because that is the default method for task queue

6883719
post	get
if you look at the function documentation one of the kwargs is method in which you can specify get post etc but as you didn t in your code it defaulted to post

6883731
int	chars
you may not see the difference in your specific situation as you re calling printwriter.write int which writes a single chars - if the chars encoding you re using just maps chars to the same byte for chars less than 127 then you ll see the same result

6883737
put	get
for instance your long time users won t get any future defaults you add so if you put a great new feature in and they already have a db they won t get the defaults for that feature unless you put them in code at which point you have to write code anyway

6883754
switching	screens
but on switching the screens to landscape the image gets distorted and stretched too much

6883791
portrait	landscape
android recommends dedicated sets of images for landscape and portrait modes also for low media and high resolution screens

6883791
portrait	landscape
so you need to have a background picture suitable for landscape mode under res drawable-land portrait in drawable-port folder

6883791
portrait	landscape
for lunarlander app you can see that two sets of images were created each for landscape and portrait mode

6883796
portrait	landscape
i use two images one for portrait and one for landscape

6883811
int	double
but you could use boxing with nullable types this would work with int and double

6883811
int	double
in this example the int values will be converted to a double anyway so there s no loss of data and the int can implicitly converted to double but the return value would need to be explicitly cast to int

6883844
hash	salt
again i would urge you to salt and hash your user s passwords for better security

6883851
xml-rpc	json-rpc
aria2c has a nice xml-rpc or json-rpc interface to interact with it from your scripts

6883852
jobs	cron
cron jobs execute based on when you enable the add-on

6883928
bonjour	avahi
separating the service pub sub from the actual communication would allow you to use other bonjour libraries like avahi on linux too

6883970
subtract	add
add or subtract from divs scrollleft property depending on whether it s scroll up or scroll down

6883990
google-chrome	firefox
can t reproduce on firefox google-chrome and ie9 - only ie7 ie8

6884087
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox

6884118
equals	gethashcode
after implementing equals and gethashcode you re good to go

6884126
mouse	keyboard
this is the mouse alternative to the keyboard option above and it doesn t do as much collateral damage

6884143
int	double
i am writing a generic method for addition of int float double

6884145
rss	feed
i m using this parss jquery plugin to pull images from a bundle of rss feed

6884145
gif	png
checks against jpg png gif

6884145
rss	feed
if the above is false finds the correct src path somewhere else in the rss feed

6884162
getter	setter
should all classes implement an interface even if the only thing in the interface is getter setter

6884165
int	chars
yeah as far as i know you can only do performselector blahblah withdelay with objects as parameters not types int chars etc.

6884188
getter	setter
if the interface is only getter and setter that sounds like it s more to do with data than behaviour - and doesn t sound like the sort of thing i d mock

6884192
getter	setter
if a class merely consists of simple getter and setter there hardly seems any point in mocking it

6884211
width	height
window.innerheight and window.innerwidth will give you the current visible window height and width

6884211
width	height
the simplest thing to do is to use a width of w - distance and a height of h - distance

6884228
squash	branch
create a copy of the topic branch interactively rebase it to the master branch git rebase -i e squash the commits in topic branch into one and finally delete the copy of the topic branch you created

6884229
gif	png
if you want to check whether an image s src url ends in jpg png or gif you can try matching the tag returned by getimagefromcontent

6884229
gif	png
isproperurl will be true if the src ends with jpg png or gif

6884242
subtraction	addition
thus no addition subtraction etc

6884254
getter	setter
character and self viking both have the instance variable setter and getter method characterhealth

6884285
width	height
it would be optimal if i somehow would be able to define the height width posx and posy in pixel coordinates from the tile set to draw from

6884295
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
but before you do use a profiler such as jprofiler or yourkit to identify the exact spot that s causing the performance issues

6884325
post	get
the http request is used internally by lwp useragent and if they would return it via get or post -methods it would already be too late since the request is already done

6884365
width	height
i d like to standardize the full width and height that is the width and height including padding and border etc in and without losing the native styles that browsers use by default

6884367
getter	setter
prefer constructor injection to getter and setter

6884371
graphics2d	bufferedimage
rendering using bufferedimage is pretty easy by utilizing the graphics2d class

6884381
division	multiplication
if you read this carefully you ll see that the iterative newton s method is doing two subtractions one multiplication and one division per iteration

6884396
width	height
the quick answer to your question would be to use a form and add a target _blank attribute to it this doesn t give you control of the width and height though

6884420
post	get
you check for get in your php but send post by specifying the type as post in your ajax

6884429
width	height
the table has 100 width and height of the div

6884486
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
try fixing the captions width and height and setting margin and padding to 0

6884487
google-chrome	firefox
very annoying because this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

6884495
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
as a general rule of thumb both floating point division and square root are considered as slow operation compared to fast ones like addition or multiplication

6884513
width	height
height and width of the function getbbox bring me only the attribut values defined as width 30 and height 45

6884513
width	height
i am looking for the real parameters like i would open the picture alone which are in reality width 300 and height 430 pixels

6884530
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
is there a way to handle the user pressing the back button in caliburn.micro from my viewmodel rather than having to do it in the code behind

6884532
width	height
width and height for the li tags needs to be set to something in which your alt tags can fit

6884533
folder	directory
if yes you just can move the folder anywhere on your server let s say usr local symfony and from your sites just load the autoloader from this directory

6884552
cpu	processors
assuming you are using most common x86 cpus i can give you this link this is a collection of measured instruction latency how long will it take to cpu to get result after it has argument and how they are pipelined for many x86 and x86_64 processors

6884552
cpu	processors
for newer processors the cost is less and is almost the same for div and for sqrt for sandy bridge intel cpu

6884552
sse	avx
also newer cpus have vector operations sse sse2 avx of the same speed as scalar x87

6884598
folder	directory
so i took the suggestion of andrew mcgarry and put my android sdk folder in my c directory and viola problem solved...well after i redirected it in eclipse obviously lol

6884599
subtract	add
when incrementing time you should convert back to utc and then add or subtract

6884608
typedef	struct
this is extremely useful to make complicated compound types like struct and function pointers readable and handlable in c++ there are even situations where you must typedef a type

6884711
hide	show
textarea2 clicked - show button2 and hide button1

6884730
put	get
each time you put in a child or adult the object will get sliced off keeping only the person part of the object

6884741
post	get
what you need is a post redirect get pattern

6884751
width	height
i did a little research and was unable to discover a property that you could enumerate to get the images actual width and height

6884751
width	height
the solution is to utilize a hidden as a working container and pulling down the necessary images using where you can enumerate width and height there

6884755
hide	show
per default the searching dialog will be created once and then will be only hide or show

6884809
pull	push
in short this is what we refer to in order to compare against pull or fetch from and push to

6884809
pull	push
in the default case it will point to the branch you use to pull from and push to

6884815
folder	directory
and i m working on project with this directory hierarchy model control view and helper folder are in my project folder

6884822
super	extends
just write read the persistent storage in the onresume and onsuspend methdod of each activity or create super activity class and extends it for a b and c

6884823
for-loop	arrays
declare new chardata inside the for-loop and then add it to arrays

6884851
int	chars
another reason i can think of not to store phone numbers as numbers but as strings of chars is that often enough part of the software stack you d use to access the database php i am looking at you wouldn t support big enough int natively to be able to store some of the longer and or exotic phone numbers

6884871
int	double
int double and so on

6884877
onresume	onpause
make sure you release the wakelock and acquire them on your onpause and onresume methods

6884882
rspec	capybara
that is one of capybara s rspec matchers capybara rspecmatchers#have_selector

6884886
inherited	properties
in the code you posted yes when doing inherited that way it s necessary to reset constructor if you want it there because the object you instantiated to act as the child prototype has a constructor properties pointing to the wrong constructor its constructor

6884886
inherited	properties
edit also might be worth mentioning when doing inherited using the non-standard __proto__ it s not necessary to reset constructor because __proto__ merely specifies and object s prototype which it to say the object on which lookups will be performed when an own properties doesn t exist

6884891
uiview	subviews
the subviews was attached to that uiview

6884901
firefox	safari
i ve tested it in firefox and safari

6884960

basically whenever the main window is resized i also want to call with the update height and width

6884991
temp	tmp
i have a python program creates tmp directories under temp by using tempfile.mkdtemp

6885026
opencv	libdc1394
javacv first provides wrappers to commonly used libraries by researchers in the field of computer vision opencv ffmpeg libdc1394 pgr flycapture openkinect videoinput and artoolkitplus

6885036
uitableview	reloaddata
on viewdidload you have to call reloaddata on the uitableview

6885146
post	get
combining pipedinputstream with pipedoutputstream and peter s multioutputstream from another post here you can get the following

6885160
subtract	add
to use it only for collision detection you just set your bodies as sensors and when a collision is detected you send it off at the angle you would like subtract or add angles together rolling over when the maximum of a range is met

6885162
fadein	fadeout
the fadein or fadeout should be called once this timer of yours has expired the method doesnt need to take the deltatime but its good practise as it will lower the volume at the same rate across all devices

6885183
hide	show
after the animation ends the scrollview is show and i need to interact with the scrollview for example clicking the button and obviously scrolling but all the events are always caught by the linearlayout 2 because it always has the visibility set to visible even if is actually hide out of the screen

6885195
width	height
my recommendation is to use fixed width and minimum height to your body or main container

6885206
put	get
i ve seen a few ideas on this like instead of like create update insert delete crud use get and put

6885208
free	malloc
there is a good discussion about the safety of using malloc free in objective-c here

6885208
free	malloc
as long as you correctly free the memory that you malloc there should be no issue

6885208
free	malloc
if you don t need ultimate performance i would not use the c malloc free statements directly

6885211
submit	submission
then load all projects one by one and see in which it works and in which it doesn t if you found problems with specific project submit your bug at netbeans.org or there is in built system in ide itself for submission bugs in options

6885212
width	height
of course ie draws it as a huge full width and height square

6885214
public	protected
note that private public and protected visibility is at class level not instance level

6885229
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring has methods to write its contents to file so converting it to nsdata is not necessary and you can do that with just one line

6885229
nsstring	nsdata
if you can t do that and want to append line to an existing line you ll have to use nsfilehandle class for that as writing methods of nsstring or nsdata simple overwrite existing files

ddms	hprof
dump your heap using the dump hprof file toolbar button in ddms and examine the results with the mat plugin for eclipse

6885279
free	malloc
it is not legal to free temp since it wasn t allocated using malloc

6885417
qtcore	qtgui
in this case qtgui has a dependency on qtcore

6885417
qtcore	qtgui
qtcore therefore must appear after qtgui in the link list

6885422
fadein	fadeout
this is because you have 4 div elements in your page for each div element you tell to jquery to fadein wait 1s and fadeout this element #image so jquery do it as you request it

6885489
hash	hmac
relies on hmac which relies on the hash function

6885505
portrait	landscape
hi i want to detect ipad orientation in php i know i can detect the ipad but how do i detect the orientation i need it in php and not css because i want to show x pictures in my gallery in portrait and x in landscape

6885511
opera	firefox
although keypress is meant to be fired only on printable characters latest opera firefox 5 do support it

6885511
google-chrome	safari
but google-chrome and probably safari as they are quite similar doesn t whereas keydown gives the result i need

6885528
width	height
i u have a filename original image filename the requiered width and height max values call the resizeimage function

6885534
innodb	myisam
i am using mysql server and i came to know that mysql uses both innodb and myisam engine.so i want to know for any big project which engine should i choose innodb or myisam

6885542
innodb	myisam
myisam versus innodb

6885544
innodb	myisam
innodb may be preferable when you have many foreign key relationships to manage as it has the ability myisam lacks to enforce foreign keys and cascade deletes and updates

6885566
post	get
in the following code the get action returns a betting card for a given race date and the post i use the post action to transform properties of the bound model to route values for the get action

6885566
post	get
in the details view i only need one command being display for date so i get off easily by using the submit button and the http post takes care of model binding

6885566
post	get
however in the upload view i need two commands being display for date and upload for date so i would like to make the display for date operate strictly with the get actions and only use a post action to submit an uploaded betting card for the date

6885615
udp	tcp
in my security group i set it to allow incoming traffic on port 53 both tcp and udp but still nothing

6885620
sorting	filtering
the server is good at handling queries and sorting and filtering through truckloads of data

6885623
getter	setter
use this for getter setter constructors

6885657
width	height
check your s width and height

6885659
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and ie9 preserves comments does not in firefox which is what i will probably end up using

6885698
pascal	delphi
long story short i m very far from a skilled programmer in fact my most complicated programs so far were either plain ascii string manipulating simple maths and array searching sorting either in free pascal or later delphi 7 and java

6885703
textarea	textbox
all i want is to swap single line textbox for multiline textarea and still onclick get my lines posted in sql

6885705
min	max	range	max	range	min
the types of functions i apply to the buffered data include sd mean over range max min etc all basic statistical functions

6885721
width	height
your top edge is defined by height and your right edge is defined by width

6885721
width	height
for example you don t need to define the orthographical width and height by the width and height parameters but instead use some data telling your application how big your world should be

6885750
firefox	safari
the code that i have provided works on desktop safari and firefox

6885772
width	height
i want my view to be at 10 0 and have 990 100 in width height

6885776
google-chrome	firefox
i was wondering if there is any way of increasing the volume of such a video especially youtube but could be extended to other types because i m interested in doing it and even publishing it as firefox google-chrome other browser plug-in

6885784
hash	md5
you will need an asymmetric encryption algorithm eg rsa and a hash algorithm eg sha md5

6885794
int	chars
in the same way that a max-length can be specified for string data types varchar 5 maximum 5 chars numeric data type cells can have a display length specified e.g. int 5

6885809
min	max
drop a tprogressbar on the form and set its min and max to 0 and 16383 respectively

6885936
for-loop	loops
implement runnable and assign an id field to each object which will be the for-loop index loops queue 10 runnables and pauses check id while executing runnable and turn a flag on

6885942
ienumerable	iqueryable
asenumerable forces linq to consider the query as an ienumerable rather that iqueryable from this point so what comes next is executed in memory not in the db

6885955
getter	setter
when wpf reads or changes a dependency property binding and animation it does not use these setter and getter

6885955
getter	setter
these setter and getter you are showing are for us developers

6886037
superclass	subclassing
lastly the call to modify cannot be done in the function declaration because the implicit call to the superclass would then be executed again when we set the supposed superclass to the prototype property of the supposed subclassing

6886059
width	height
you canset at the beginning of method default values for width and height to be equals to squaresize and then remove following code block

6886081
post	get
when you post a form you do it generally with post request as opposed to get request

6886085
virtualbox	parallels	vmware	virtualbox
you can install those you need in separate parallels virtual machines vmware and virtualbox would work as well

6886102
post	get
basically the post will say that i m trying to gain popularity for the site that i could really use some shares i ll point out that they get six post a week without asking for anything and i ll tell them that i m fine with them deleting the post if they really don t want to share it

6886125
addclass	removeclass
you should look at jquery s addclass removeclass toggleclass and hasclass methods api references here here here and here

6886125
post	get
give this a try and post another question if you get stuck

6886130
folder	directory
the application goes to the correct directory on my server and the current folder is added with my application inside it

6886150
hide	show
also i m not removing the class on second div for the same reason rather i m calling show hide as i think that is what you intend to do

6886174
post	get
just use a get or post parameter when you run your ajax request

6886204
hide	show
i want to hide the back button item when the nib appears and to show it when i tap the screen

6886207
versioning	upgrade
it turns out that i needed to upgrade the versioning of ant i was using to 1.8

6886212
getter	setter
now this is all well and good for general use in your class but sometimes it is recommended to not use getter and setter in case they cause side effects

6886212
getter	setter
two places where you normally want to avoid getter and setter are in init methods and dealloc

6886212
getter	setter
therefore as you was in the init method you should access the ivar directly without using the getter setter

6886212
getter	setter
when i called it creates the getter and setter using the name appfolderpath but the ivar these methods effect is actually called _appfolderpath

6886212
getter	setter
this is good practice as you will always be sure when you are accessing the ivar directly or through a getter setter because just referencing appfolderpath in your code will not compile

6886217
portrait	landscape
in my -shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation i return yes for both landscape orientations and for portrait not portraitupsidedown

6886217
uilabel	uibutton	uilabel	uitextview
fyi the contents below the top uiview are a scrollview a uiimage a uilabel a uitextview and a uibutton from top to bottom

6886246
rubygems	rvm
instead of using rvm update i had to use rvm rubygems

6886249
hash	md5
i developed an auto-updater for my application that gets a md5 hash list for all files from the update server and downloads the new files in case of a mismatch

6886296
profiling	debugging
its great for runtime debugging and cpu profiling

6886303
typedef	struct
i need to reference a struct that s not yet defined because the struct actually conatins the typedef d function prototype

6886316
post	get
as others have pointed out params values can come from the query string of a get request or the form data of a post request but there s also a third place they can come from the path of the url

6886320
stateless	stateful
if you google on viewparam stateless stateful you ll find some more info

6886334
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome around 15-20 fps and in firefox around 2-3 fps on my computer

6886334
google-chrome	firefox
firefox would freeze before the switch and google-chrome ran about 10x faster

6886347
inherited	properties
thechild inherited the properties _parent_property from its parent class

6886358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following code works perfectly in google-chrome and safari but bonks in firefox

6886358
post	get
and the php relay on my server that uses curl to post or get from another domain

6886358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
token shows up perfectly in the error_log and everything works perfect in google-chrome and safari but in firefox the ajax status is error and the responsetext is blank

6886361
setinterval	clearinterval
i have a div that is above something i want to showcase and i have the setinterval working but the clearinterval isnâ t firing when it reaches 2 loops

6886393
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
other ways would be to loops thru the arrays using .each or a simple for-loop

6886424
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
raphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+

6886434
profiling	debugging
one thing that might help you debugging is using the undocumented profiling on -memory which will track allocation in the matlab profiling

6886454
nsstring	nsdata
thats because nsstring in fact does not respond to that message - your code adds a category to nsdata

6886502
getter	setter
it is to do with making your intent clearer about whether you are accessing the ivar directly or using the getter setter

6886502
getter	setter
this will compile and produce the getter setter declarations like this

6886502
getter	setter
to use the getter setter i can use dot notation or the getter setter like

6886502
getter	setter
it will not compile because i am not using the getter setter and there is no ivar called people it should be _people

6886514
accessor	properties
i know of the error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

6886523
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in a traditional programming language you would use a for-loop to go through the elements of an arrays or vector but generally in matlab you want to avoid for loops if you can and instead take advantage of matlab s vectorization because it s much faster

6886531
public	protected
recall that internal means not visible outside of this assembly except through internalsvisibleto access which makes internal look like public whereas protected means visible to all subclasses

6886565
firepath	firebug
you can use firebug and firepath plugin for firefox to find the ids

6886589
conio	ncurses
you need a special console input output library like ncurses or borland s conio to do that

6886599
hash	md5
you should probably use an md5 hash

6886606
apache	lighttpd
it has a webserver installed first apache then i changed to lighttpd to see if ot solves the problem and i am editing files on a shared folder and then load them in the w7 host via the webserver

6886623
superclass	subclassing
it is quite improbably for a subclassing implementation to define a total order among objects of a superclass

6886640
requestfactory	gwt
requestfactory and findentity method in gwt

6886640
requestfactory	gwt
when i request a list of entities using requestfactory with servicelocator and locator constructs gwt executes n+1 sql calls

6886664
accessor	properties
if you mark entire properties as internal protected and accessor method as protected - everything is fine

6886714
kdtree	octree
the descriptions of kdtree chapter 21.2 and octree chapter 21.8 in numerical recipes are quite understandable

6886757
dictionary	map
i used csv.dictreader to create dictionary for each file but i am stuck trying to find a way to map each city to each code

6886763
flask	django	flask	pylons	flask	pyramid	pylons	pyramid
django is great but you might also consider flask or pyramid pylons

6886786
width	height
you need to set the img styles height and width to 100

6886820
width	height
and ask gently for it s height and width

6886833
getter	setter
give it some setter and getter and call it balloonview

6886834
post	get
i found this post which seems to be an exact duplicate but i can t figure out how to get the answer to work for me so i m posting again.

6886841
google-chrome	firefox
currently google-chrome 12 and firefox 5 do not support this

6886844
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in this example users browsing with firefox opera safari ie7 9 10 will see a red background

6886866
submit	submission
it is just beta - and it includes ios5 which is also beta - you can submit to the mac app store with xcode 4.1 but xcode 4.2 can t be used for app submission yet

6886897
width	margin
this gives it a width and a flexible margin

6886905
mouseover	mouseout
to keep the mouseover and mouseout functions consistent and to reuse the navjumpheight variable instead of using magic numbers you could change the previous line to something like this

6886938
width	height
adjust width and height as necessary

6886941
post	get
i get this message when i post to the facebook wall

6886960
google-chrome	firefox
the script doesn t execute on firefox like it does on ie and google-chrome

6886965
960.gs	fluid
there s also the fluid version of the 960.gs

6887001
folder	directory
i m trying to find a way to duplicate a series of files folder from one section on a server to a new directory on the same server

6887020
button	checkbox
i am creating a form with both radio button and checkbox

6887086
hash	md5
of course md5 has been shown not to be a good hash function

6887086
hash	md5
take a md5 implementation hash your serial numbers and see if you get a collision

6887086
hash	md5
a basic md5 implementation should be able to hash a few million values per second and with a reasonable hard disk you could accumulate a few billions of outputs sort them and see if there is a collision

6887115
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari and google-chrome possibly other browsers have issues playing mp3 files and other audio video files uploaded to this application

6887115
hash	md5
if i download the mp3 from my web application via curl it has the same md5 hash so it s not corrupting the mp3 in any way

6887147
post	get
a link cannot post data only get

6887229
multiplying	add
multiplying the matrix a with the vector x and add the result on the vector y

6887242
put	get
i would use constructor injection but if i put the iuserstatusservice as a parameter in the constructor i can t figure out how i would get ninject to inject the correct parameter when i call new usergridmodel html in the view without explicitly using the ikernel there

6887253
sorting	filtering
sorting filtering pagination i believe raw data can be sorted and table can be rebuilt

6887282
portrait	landscape
i want to use the same image for portrait and landscape but to make it look decent i need to rotate the image 90 degrees when in landscape so that it does not get stretched to fill the screen

6887282
portrait	landscape
my solution was to just create two copies of the image one for portrait that i put in drawable-port and one for landscape that i put in drawable-land

6887299
hash	salt
i ve read on so and from other websites found on google after i tried to look into it a little bit more that the correct secure way to store passwords in a database is to store the hash + salt value of a password

6887299
hash	salt
from my understanding you hash the password then you use another value that you hash the salt and combine those two together so the algorithm to retrieve the original password is different for every user

6887315
int	chars
reading from argv 2 one int to g.number and one chars to c

6887338
folder	directory
the file that it is requiring is on the same server within the same root folder but it was one directory up

6887339
uilabel	uibutton
then add this uilabel as subview of uibutton

6887346
hash	salt
one uses a salt to avoid the attacker creating a rainbow table a table containing all usual passwords and the corresponding hash sorted or somehow easily accessible by hash

6887346
hash	salt
if the hash are salt and the attacker gets the salt with the hash he will still be able to do the same attack with only slightly more work to input the salt - but now this work of building a rainbow table is useless for the next hash with another salt which means this will need to be done for each user again

6887346
hash	salt
some hash algorithms for example bcrypt which is specially made for password hashing have a special salt input parameter or generate the salt themselves and include it in the output

6887346
hash	salt	hash	hmac
a simple variant which works for most hash algorithms would be using hmac with the salt as message input the password as key

6887346
hash	salt	hash	hmac
hmac password salt hash password âš opad || hash ipad âš password || salt

6887346
hash	salt
then you store the salt together with the hash

6887346
hash	salt
for a slightly higher barrier you could store the hash in another location than the salt

6887346
hash	salt
but you will still need both for login. for login you then will give the password and the stored salt to your hash function and compare the result with the stored hash

6887356
freemarker	velocity
every single templating language out there does exactly that velocity freemarker stringtemplate and jsp jsf expression language

6887385
hash	salt
a salt is just a random string of characters that is appended to the password before it is hash

6887385
hash	md5
if you google this you ll get a number of pages telling you that this is the md5 hash for letmein

6887385
salt	md5
you d be then performing md5 letmein747b517c80567d86906cd28443b992209b8ec601a74a2d18e5e80070703c5f49 which returns af7cbbc1eacf780e70344af1a4b16698 which can t be looked up as easily as letmein without a salt

6887385
hash	salt
you d then store both the hash and the salt and when the user types in their password to log in you d repeat the process above and see if the password the user entered with the stored salt appended hash to the same thing as the stored hash

6887400
post	get
if the form method was get you should have already appended the data to the url if the method was post you ll want to set the data for the curl request to the data query string you generated from the form names

6887409
salt	md5
using salt prevent precomputed rainbow-tables usage as an example if a user use password as a password md5 password sha1 password or whatever password may be well-known results stored in some rainbow tables

6887409
salt	md5	hmac	md5
if you use a different salt value per person - called a nonce - you ll get md5 hmac password randomsaltvalue sha1 password anotherrandomsaltvalue .

6887451
japplet	jdialog
this will give you the option of using your gui in a jframe or a japplet or even a jdialog or embedded in another jpanel should you so desire

6887451
awt	swing
as others have stated and as i stated in my earlier comment you should move up to the swing library as it is much more flexible and robust than the awt gui library that you are currently using

6887457

public private protected

6887467
uploadify	plupload
i ve heard good things about plupload and to a lesser extent uploadify

6887476
fadein	fadeout
it will create a mirror observablecollection using reflection use the mirror as itemssource instead and handle the fadein fadeout animations

6887491
webclient	httpwebrequest
list is long i have been strongly advised to use httpwebrequest only problem is i need the raw headers with the response the websites i am trying to download sends a very long and weird cookie which is not handled by httpwebrequest webclient

6887603
calloc	malloc
is there a scenario where malloc fails while calloc returns success

6887603
calloc	malloc
suppose i give malloc 20 and does there exist any scenario where malloc could fail and calloc succeeds

6887613
calloc	malloc
the only reason i can think of where malloc fails and calloc succeeds is if some library or your application overrides one and not the other

6887657
facebook	fbconnect
drag and drop the fbconnect folder from the facebook sdk project into your application s project

6887694
int	double
this doesn t of course mean that you can declare a as an int and then define it as a double

6887735
post	get
unfortunately html specs only has http get post

6887735
post	get
a form tag can either do a http get or post

6887773
versioning	upgrade
we have apache 2.2.14 but need to upgrade to a higher versioning due to security vulnerabilities

6887822
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
if you can t change the memory limit a workaround might be calling the commandline imagemagick or graphicsmagick tools if they re installed .

6887867
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome and safari apparently i m getting the info correctly but in firefox it just returns nan

6887872
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
uitabbaritem extends from uibaritem that has the tag property

6887875
post	get
after editing you can again import the screenshot from to datauri and send it via ajax post or get to your php script

6887883
inherited	properties
you could copy the properties over to the the new object but then it isn t really live inherited

6887905
ironruby	ironpython
you can download the vs 2010 express editions and then download the ironpython or ironruby tools as addon

6887908
portrait	landscape
for example if i wanted my view controller to support portrait and landscape right this would be my implementation this could be reduced to a line but i m expanding it for the sake of clarity

6887945
free	malloc
important thing is that when you allocate memory with malloc you should always free the memory

6887946
put	get
you will only get an newline into a java string if you put it there explicitly

6887948
post	get
and also please read what is the difference in get post requests and when it should be used

6888024
hide	show
it looks like most of the options accepted by the .animate function are accepted in the show and hide properties

6888027
notepad++	jedit
you might find it easier to learn the basics in a simple text editor like jedit or notepad++

6888028
width	height
you ll have to change the height and width accordingly to fit your image

6888062
gridview	onclientclick
how change visibility of gridview template field on onclientclick event

6888070
post	get
third the only important difference not the only but the important between post and get is

6888070
post	get
u can clearly notice that post s dont display in the browsers address bar but get do

6888073
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

6888074
subtraction	add
remember you can add negative numbers so you have subtraction covered too

6888074
printf	getchar
scanf printf putchar getchar - basic c io functions

6888074
strdup	strcmp
- strcmp strdup - a couple useful string functions that will be useful

6888077
hide	show
to do hide lblnetpayments and txtmypayment and show checkmypaymentstatus on btnbulkassign_click event

6888101
int	chars
here the default attribute of the integer-typed property shall only accept valid int values whereas the default attribute of the string-typed property shall accept any chars

6888132
puts	gets
this jsp simply calls the el function let s call it put that takes two parameters and is derived from a java method putperson string string that gets a connection to the database and puts the first and last name in their proper places

6888165
children	parent
if two children have the same parent how does an event firing from one child get handled by the second child

6888172
udp	tcp
my application has the main thread a tcp server thread which accepts async connections and a udp server thread

6888202
lisp	scheme
if foo is a function then it was clear common lisp took the ideas from scheme behind lexically scoped first-class functions and integrated it into the language

6888223
range	infinity
there is no special infinity value in java s integer class you can store the full range of values

6888268
implements	extends
for an object to be runnable it needs to implements the runnable interface or extends the thread class however it does not seem that httpservlet does any of these

6888290
xlsx	xlsm
edit basically i would like to open an xlsm document and save it as an xlsx document without required excel to be installed via the openxml sdk or something

6888292
unsigned	short
of course you are still relying on unsigned short being 2 bytes on your platform and the representation in the file having the same endianness as your machine but at least you aren t making assumptions about structure padding

6888292
int	chars
if you want to see the numeric value you should cast to a non- chars int type

6888342
fadein	fadeout
you can use jquery s animate function to do that or fadein and fadeout which are basically wrappers for it

6888436
setinterval	settimeout
so you re absolutely right calling settimeout through loop from the delayed function itself only reimplements a poorer setinterval

6888443
put	get
to get the data downloaded i use asihttprequest which methods i have put in another class

6888458
setinterval	settimeout
the solution in my opinion is not using setinterval at all but rather call the next xhr request only from within the callback of the previous request possibly by using the settimeout as well to ensure it will wait the proper amount of time before polling again

6888490
min	max
i would find the max and min value within each set and the draw a vertical line on that x point

6888507
switching	screens
i tried switching to version 1.0a2 1.0a4 and 1.0b2 but on 1.0a2 the screens goes blank on orientation change and on 1.0b2 and 1.0a4 split button appearance changes in a not desired way

6888558
spweb	spsite
the above should be fine as long as you still have a reference to the spsite and spweb then you can dispose of them

6888558
spweb	spsite
just a small one best practice is to called dispose instead of close on the spsite and spweb objects

6888566
hash	salt
the membership provider will use a salt sha1 hash of the password

6888566
hash	salt
the salt and the hash are stored in the table aspnet_membership assuming you ve not implemented a custom provider btw - this is why the hash values are different - the salt are different

6888566
hash	salt
on login the membership provider will pull back the membership record hash the password you entered with the salt from the record then compare the results

6888566
hash	salt
what s obviously happening in your case is that you re either not creating the same hash password possibly the wrong salt or you re not comparing the hash output to the correct value

6888572
floating-point	integer
if you know your input will never exceed a certain length and don t need to be able to parse to a primitive floating-point type then you could use something like nsdecimalnumber good for up to 38 digits or implement a comparable utility yourself where you note the position of the decimal point parse the number as an integer and reinsert the decimal point at the correct location whenever you need to print it out

6888578
getter	setter
the clr property getter setter is not used for databinding

6888597
equals	gethashcode
c# compiler generates field-by-field equals and gethashcode implementations because obviously you can t provide them yourself

6888601
comparator	icomparer
each .net object implements the icomparer interface and has it s own implementation of the comparator method

6888601
comparator	icomparer
edit sorry i was confusing icomparer comparator with equals each object implements the equals method and as an example string class overrides this method and just checks that both strings contain the same value not reference the same memory address

6888602
equals	gethashcode
since string has well defined gethashcode equals this works fine

6888604
hide	show
now based on where the slider is you will hide show that div

6888606
put	get
i found that only way to get html data to word is to put them into clipboard

6888633
put	get
the main problem is that i have no parameters to put them in the data section in the get method which means i can t access these data

6888657
hide	show
you need to give unique id to each then use this id to show hide only one specific element

6888665
mouseleave	mouseenter
after that the mouseenter and mouseleave events continue to fire just fine but both the element s html and its data have the same test string so it doesn t change

6888665
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseleave div becomes thicker which will cause an almost automatic mouseenter

6888665
mouseleave	mouseenter
but since mouseenter fired the div went to the test string and became thinner so now the mouse is beyond the boundaries of the div but without firing a mouseleave

6888665
mouseover	mouseenter
next time i mouseover the div mouseenter will fire again this is twice in a row

6888665
hide	show
if you want to toggle things i suggest hide and show

6888677
pop-up	dialog
if user fist time click on this button it is need to pop-up application allow dialog of facebook or facebook login page without redirection to facebook

6888769
sorting	filtering
sorting on a simple name string property fails unless i also have a filterby and even then it only works if i type in at least one letter into the filtering box

6888797
mouseleave	mouseenter
when you leave the element by moving out by the bottom border it grows and causes a mouseenter event which again changes the size so that the mouse is outside but without causing a mouseleave event leaving the element looking like the mouse is still hovering it

6888810
hide	show
it works with the hide before the click but i don t know if it works without calling the show method

6888810
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
never tried this on opera i tested on ie firefox safari google-chrome and it works

6888858
peer	p2p
for instance let s suppose a p2p application which uses tls between peer and which use the trustmanager as a way to authenticate peer from his contact list

6888865
cos	sin
many systems have a lookup table for common values of sin and cos so it s not inconceivable that exactly zero could be returned

6888873
couchbase	couchdb
if you need these types of features you ll want to check out couchdb which specifically targets this scenario with android couchbase

6888898
implements	extends
in order to fill the contents of the cells in the jtable i had to write a custom renderer that implements tablecellrenderer and extends jtextarea

6888933
folder	directory
assuming a typical project directory structure your public folder should go inside your server s public_html folder and all other zend project folder should go one level up like this

6888965
drawingarea	cairo	gtk	drawingarea	gtk	cairo
i wrote an app that uses cairo to draw things on screen on a gtk drawingarea to be exact

6888975

error c2784 std basic_istream _elem _traits std operator std basic_istream _elem _traits _elem could not deduce template argument for std basic_istream _elem _traits from std ostringstream

6888992
folder	directory
this seems to be important in your case because it would appear that whatever folder you have your manage.py file in does not directly include your testapp directory

6889026
for-loop	arrays
e another thing you are statically looping 10 times i think it would be better if you d use the count of the arrays instead if the size of the arrays changes but you forgot to change the number in the for-loop then you will get an exception which will break your app

6889042
children	parent
you have to go through all processes checking their ppid parent process id and compare that to the pid of the process you want the children of

6889044
mp3	wav
i found until now a source code for stuff that do it on wav files and not on mp3 file

6889070
children	parent
children are linked via their ppid parent pid to the parent so it s just a matter of following those links depending on what language you use to implement that

6889101
put	get
i think you put an extra space on this line this means get all elements with that particular class that are descendant of a textarea

6889134
int	double
this is true only for value types structs int double byte etc

6889206
hash	md5
with current html5 it should be possible to calculate the md5 hash of a binary file but i think the step before that would be to convert the banary data blobbuilder to a string i am trying to do this step but have not been successful

6889264
glfw	glew
i m new to cmake glew and glfw

6889286
width	height
what you need to do is check if the line is beyond the width and height of the canvas and in your case the window itself since the canvas fills the browser window

6889286
width	height
you check if the line x + line width is canvas width and line.y + line height is canvas height

6889383
jobs	cron
cron jobs often made easier via a custom management command

6889383
jobs	cron
cron jobs are the time-honored method

6889383
jobs	cron
the only fiddly bits with cron jobs is getting your code to run in the context of your django project -- that is your code must correctly load your settings.py in order to know about your database and apps

6889383
jobs	cron
celery provides a wealth of advantages over simple cron jobs

6889385
boost	stl
by the way i m doing everything in c++ and make use of the boost libraries and stl so nothing is off-limits in that regard

6889433
postgresql	mysql
if it makes a difference and i don t think it should the site will be written in ruby rails using postgresql or mysql

6889516
folder	directory
however although the copy from the assets folder to the app database directory works fine and the copy to the sd card works fine tested by opening the db file copied out to the sd card using an sqlite browser trying to display the database on the device gives me a problem whereas i ve run into no problems at all with the emulator

6889533
post	get
if i select user_id from post i will get only the integer value

6889543
bmp	png
in a site i m developing i need to be able to pass all my images through imagejpeg so i decided as my site only accepts jpg bmp + png uploads to simply convert bmps and pngs to a jpg first

6889545
jar	war
the ear file has grown quite big 6.5mb though most of it consists of external jar files like apache commons solrj primefaces and pdfrenderer etc. which are copied into the respective war ejb files

6889561
post	get
with this for each post you ll get the corresponding user s informations -- and you can add whatever field you want from users to the select part of the query

6889577
qstring	qlist
it has a more reasonable api mainly it doesn t expose qt types which have a direct equivalent in python qstring qlist etc. or which are completely superfluous due to python s dynamic nature like qvariant

6889613
integer	unsigned
you should use an integer type and unsigned integer types will allow larger numbers than their signed counterparts uint or ulong rather than decimal as you are working with integers

6889628
hash	salt
4 you shouldn t store passwords in the database but salt hash

6889679
dumpsys	adb
when i re-issue the command adb shell dumpsys alarm i see that my alarm is gone

youtube	vimeo
this is for videos posted on facebook from youtube vimeo etc

6889798
cpython	pypy
that bytecode is either interpreted note that there s a difference both in theory and in practical performance between interpreting directly and first compiling to some intermediate representation and interpret that as with the reference implementation cpython or both interpreted and compiled to optimized machine code at runtime as with pypy

6889800
hide	show
show and hide it based on if a user is logged in or logged out

6889821
hide	show
2 show and hide it based on if a user is logged in or logged out

6889840
free	malloc
while ugly from a formal standpoint using int -to- casts with the thread argument or return value to pass small integer data is usually the lesser of two evils the other choice being malloc sizeof int in one thread and free in the other which not only fundamentally adds significant costs but also can be pathologically bad on some allocators tuned only for the case where the allocating thread and freeing thread are the same

6889890
salt	md5
a secret is usually a random number which you can compute its md5 and put it inside a cookie this is how i do it for one of my applications salt is a unique large arbitrary string

6889933

i think you can use a factory method returning an object of uiviewcontroller as that is the argument type of pushviewcontroller as you can see in the api docs for uinavigationcontroller

6890011
strcpy	strncpy
if you want to do this you should be using the strcpy or strncpy function from the header

6890214
folder	directory
for the normalise meathod to run it needs a folder called mymard in the working directory

6890214
folder	directory
so i thought that i would give the mymard folder as the in input path to hadoop job but m not sure if that would help beacuse mard.normalisefile bunch of arguments will search for the mymard folder in the working directory but it will not find it as this is what i think the mapper will only be able to access the content of files through the values obtained from the filesplit it cannot give direct access to the files in the mymard folder

6890286

6891225
rubygems	bundler
the application loads them by loading the bundler code which overrides parts of rubygems to use the versions specified in the gemfile

6891225
rubygems	bundler
by default bundler just calls rubygems to install gems again system-wide or in your homedir

6891225
rubygems	rvm
when you re using rvm the directory where rubygems installs things is overridden and is specific to your current ruby version and gemset

because after stdout or stderr redirection you will got r r n instead of r n if you write r n to the console

6891292
sorting	filtering
most developers would expect a logical database design and sorting filtering to be done on the db rather than the client

6891303
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that this only works in certain browsers google-chrome ie8 9 and not others most notably firefox

6891326
getter	setter
one caveat is that implementation-file ivars are not visible to subclasses which can occasionally be a little bit awkward if you have manually generated setter and getter that you need to subclass

6891339
portrait	landscape
i have a layout that is different for portrait and landscape

6891339
screens	tablet
however on tablet really big screens xlarge layout qualifier i want to use only the portrait version for both orientations

6891813
google-chrome	firefox
when i put that url into desktop google-chrome and firefox and ie i got the mobile login ui

6891910
put	get
yeah you could always get the contentpane from a jframe and put it into the contentpane of a jinternalframe via the expected get and set methods but it s many times not a good idea to try to add good code into a bad design

6891910
jinternalframe	jtabbedpane
that way you ll have the flexibilty of placing your jpanels wherever you wish be they jinternalframe jdialogs jtabbedpane components or swapped via cardlayout

the work-around would be to use onmousedown instead of onclick with the potential caveat described here

6892176
filesystems	fat
yes fat filesystems does store these values in local time but the win32 api is doing the utc conversion for you

6892176
filesystems	fat
getfiletime retrieves cached utc times from the fat filesystems

6892189
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems records times on disk in local time

6892189
filesystems	fat
getfiletime retrieves cached utc times from the fat filesystems

to put that another way the scroll position is restrained to an area of two screens centred on the middle of b so you get all of b and half a screen either side

6892342
hide	show
it s currently set to only show the items that are selected but you could flip it to hide the items that are selected instead

6892345
hide	show
a possible solution to hide all posts with class post_entry then show only those which have all selected categories

6892417
textview	imageview
this could then be used in a custom layout group which will also need an imageview for the envelope and a textview for the number side by side

6892450
put	get
so correct me if i m wrong but the only thing that can happend if i put the tracking code in the head is that i might get inaccurate reports when a page load is aborted halfway through

6892454
getter	setter
iam a little bit confused about the usability of setter and getter inside a rails 3 application controller or helper

6892454
getter	setter
why would someone use the setter and getter in a controller method or a module and not just an instance variable

6892495
maven	m2e
ensure that you configured your external maven installation in the m2e plugin

6892495
maven	pom.xml
furthermore if you haven t used maven 3 before and you have plugin version numbers coded in your pom.xml s there may be incompatibilities as not all plugins that worked with maven 2 work with maven 3 as well

6892499
hide	show
the hide show is working

6892505
min	max
..maybe generating the min max values from the php script

6892572

writing directly to a standard stream would still require you to write a serializable deserialization function pair

6892583
width	height
basically i need to extract all measurements that i can into usable dimensions and store each unit into a new column height width depth

6892644
width	height
when hovering the circle container the circle increases it s own width height and border width

6892669
pull	push
if this is a server where you don t have direct access to the repositories only through a web interface or through push pull clone then your option is to hope that the web interface have methods for eradicating those changesets otherwise go to option 2

i wrote follow-up questions as comments but did not get any responses so i thought i d try to put it up as a question and hopefully some expert will see it

6897350
int	double	multiplying	modulo
you need to do the multiplying using double or floats and the final modulo on an int value so it will be like this in c# code

6897370
int	double
try int math.ceiling double x y

6897479
allocator	stl
looks like the feature of stateful allocator in stl containers is widely supported already

6897479
allocator	stl
so most stl implementations support statefull allocator which means that they do not create additional instances of the allocator type under the hood but store the client-supplied allocator instance and all allocator deallocations are done via that

6897479
allocator	stl
update vs2008 s stl requires the allocator to have the templated copy constructor which imo makes the most important use of custom allocator impossible simple segregated storage

6897479
allocator	stl
for whoever is not satisfied with the current state of stateful allocator in stl i recommend to consider boost.intrusive and boost.container

6897500

6897929
post	get
please post the code to get a clearer idea

6897932
width	height

6897952
client-side	server-side
gwt is client-side technology and has nothing to do with server-side

assuming your encryption create binary data from text data and is not just text only you probably want to use a qdatastream for writing and reading the encrypted data it handles writing chunks of bytes qbytearray correctly without translation

6898300
superclass	subclassing
so effectively by declaring a constructor in the superclass that is not accessible there is no other constructor that your subclassing could call and thus java prevents compilation

6898312
maven	pom.xml
so i make some research on linked library with maven and i find this command line on a pom.xml

6898312

6898807
client-side	server-side

jar	war
both wars have a maven dependeny with scope provided to the common jar not included as jar within the war s lib

6898942
jms	jta

awt	swing
we are not rendering any swing or awt components other than the frame or jframe or an enclosed jpanel component etc if it is best

6899032
uilabel	uibutton	uilabel	uitextview

6899326
superclass	subclassing
i know that generally with oo it s better to stick the functionality back to the superclass subclassing themselves but for my specific use cases i have a bunch of subclassing that are immutable model classes which should be passed to different kinds of execution engines think different example classes

6899335
getter	setter
both getter and setter for all class members are defined properly

6899406
width	height

google-chrome	firefox
in my iframe when i post data in google-chrome or firefox it works well but ie it seems that charset is not utf8

instead of using datagridcomboboxcolumn use datagridtemplatecolumn and you can bind text property of the combobox to some property which will hold the free text value after closing drop down list

6900220
textview	imageview
the way your buttons look you might as well use a relativelayout containing a textview and an imageview

6900379
post	get
a textbox control does not get its value from the view state but from the post data in the form in this event

6900379
post	get
so even if you disable view state for the textbox control it can get its value from the http post data if it implements ipostbackdatahandler interface

6900422
post	get
the catch is that you need to call the service a particular way with jquery in order to get a json response instead of xml specifically with a post request of content-type application json

udp	tcp
here is some highly recommended technical material for udp or tcp hole punching

6900477
udp	tcp
also apparently udp protocol is used because it is more empirically successful than tcp

6900575
google-chrome	firefox
but it does work when i use google-chrome or firefox

6900603
udp	tcp
i am aware of the tcp udp hole punching method however i am not willing to setup and run a server on my machine 24 7 for this purpose besides my network is behind a nat anyway...

6900613
children	parent
this is basically the same setup as a tree structure in which each node has a single parent but many children

6900616
division	addition
actually thinking about it - to do the whole equation just replace the space with a + sign and run it through sp_executesql this should i havnt tested this right at this point convert 1 1 4 to 1+1 4 and the standard math engine will do the division before the addition so it will end up as 1.25

6901451
width	height
you ll probably want to use a grid with the height width of the columns rows set to if the item is expanded or auto if not

6901451
width	height
also if you re using a grid in an itemscontrol you need to set the grid.row grid.column and width height properties on the contentpresenter not the itemtemplate since the itemtemplate in a itemscontrol is always wrapped in a contentpresenter

6901466
implements	extends
you should implements runnable instead of extends thread

6901468

6901847
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on google-chrome and firefox still no luck

6901865

depending on where you put the id annotation on a field or on a getter all fields or getters not marked with transient will automatically be made persistent with a default column name

6901901
128bit	64bit
i don t see a problem here - a 128bit integer is represented by two 64bit integers which is the largest native type outside of sse registers a 64bit intel cpu can handle

6901910
for-loop	loops
if you have multiple different divs make a foreach loops for that too if you want same div to repeat 3 times wrap it around a for-loop

6901931
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the drop-down disappears perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome

6901931
google-chrome	firefox
here is the actual page the script contains jquery and some plugins src ed and the rest - the actual code i wrote... i m aware it doesn t work in ie but in google-chrome the onblur for the buttons on the left of the search bar does not work but it works in ff5 so it must work in lower firefox s too

the issue however is that the grand total accounts for the shipping rate as shown below the order form however i d like to also have it displayed above the sales tax line

6902108
selecteditem	selectedindex
use binding on selecteditem instead of selectedindex

6902134
ienumerable	iqueryable
for example iqueryable builds the expressiontree which it later parses according to the concrete provider executing shared code once for optimization while ienumerable accepts func and performs it as you would expect

6902137
put	get
all the get variables are put into a superglobal array

6902143
width	height
but like matias said you need to devide these values by width and height of the image respectively as texture coordinates are in 0 1

6902186
multiplying	subtract
since it reads a multiplying subtract 1 instead of negative

6902191
post	get
the documentation of jquery.post tells us that the query string in either post or get request is built from the second parameter of that method

6902191
submit	submission
there was never really a submission of the form but it was sent via ajax thus there s no input of type submit

6902234

edit 0 by the way i don t know that they use a uitabbarcontroller for the bottom but from all indications they do use a uinavigationcontroller up top

6902562
webclient	httpwebrequest
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient and set allowautoredirect to false

6902588
implements	extends
but i went ahead and implements the method of extends the sessionidmanager class and overriding the createsessionid and validate methods to use a guid as explained in this msdn article

6902588
hash	md5
for example an md5 hash produces a 128 bit value

6902588
hash	md5
however the md5 hash of incremental values a timestamp or 8-bit random numbers are each insecure because the source of the random values can be easily predicted

6902589
jlist	jtable
there are maybe easiest and nicest way i think that jtable with one tablecolumn and without tableheader in all cases better as jlist here is your render macox version

6902597
inherited	properties
there is one thing that i did try that does work but i m not sure that it wont cause all sub folders to inherited the properties

6902604
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

6902670
uiview	subviews
the game that i m working on has a set of about 10 classes that all subviews uiview and are drawn once when they are loaded using quartz code in drawrect

6902670
uiview	subviews
initially the uiview subclass that itself adds all these subviews probably 20 instantiated objects of these classes had a drawrect method that would be called every frame with quartz code

6902688
entities	entitymanager
the point therefore is that the entitymanager or the persistence context must be associated with an active transaction before you perform any changes to entities so that all changes made to the entities in the persistence context can be flushed to the database

6902691
bash	zsh
files you want with bash not with zsh

6902713
chown	chmod
both directory and files have been chown d for ownership and chmod d for 775.

6902775
put	get
if you don t get the error then the problem is in that block otherwise put it back in and take the next block out

6902783
post	get
i ve seen a few different post on this but i can t seem to get it working

6902783
post	get
i followed this post uipopovercontroller toolbar at top in order to get started

6902789
google-chrome	firefox
i thought maybe it was my novice understanding of ajax but then i tried google-chrome firefox and everything is working as expected

6902806
couchbase	couchdb
make sure to run these commands as the owner of all the other files in these directories couchbase or else couchdb won t have the permissions to use the files you create

6902809
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the various subviews of uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are both private and trying to mess with them is likely to not work correctly

6902809
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
and apple doesn t give us the tools to create container view controllers so you can t easily embed the uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller inside another view controller or recreate uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller yourself

6902831
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
checking the links in the other answers make it clear you ll never have a guarantee of whether floating point is correctly implemented or whether you ll always receive a certain precision for a given calculation but perhaps you could make a best effort by 1 truncating all calculations to a common minimum eg if different implementations will give you 32 to 80 bits of precision always truncating every operation to 30 or 31 bits 2 have a table of a few test cases at startup borderline cases of add subtract multiplying divide sqrt cosine etc. and if the implementation calculates values matching the table then not bother making any adjustments

6902855
glm	predict
is there perhaps a way package function in r which will use the coefficients of this glm model to predict ie

6902869
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox

6902880

second the function you are seeking is likely to be predict which can take a glm model

6903048
getter	setter
in this super-simple case you d just be accessing public properties or fields when an instance is passed in to a function - you might have to access them through a public getter setter since you want the variables to be private

6903064
equals	compareto
edit my code as shown requires compareto to be consistent with equals even thought that s not a requirement

6903088
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks that link pop-up the dialog to let them feed in the custom settings and save that on the server after performing the relevant validation

6903348
int	double
how can i convert it to an int double float whatever in order to check if it s bigger smaller equal to.

6903349

if college is having its website and the website provides rss feed for time table you parse that xml file and show the data which is parse or you can save the time table information of which course in the database and display that using cursors

6903362
post	get
for example you could use post to do a search which is semantically more of a get request

6903362
post	put
the entire html version of the world wide web gets along pretty well without put or delete and it s perfectly fine to do deletes or updates with post but if you can support put and delete for updates and deletes and other idempotent operations it s just a little better because agents can assume that the operation is idempotent

6903389
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
web services don t know about runtimeexception so throwing unchecked-exception from your service will not have any effect

6903412
hide	show
however you can perform the same action hide show toggle on a group of elements by using the appropriate selector to get the group

6903423
post	get
if your button is clicked then a get or post request should be most probably be made

6903423

6903861
google-chrome	firefox
an easy way to reproduce the problem is to go to i m using firefox but google-chrome doesn t work either

6903919
int	chars
the chars a and the int number 65 are stored the same way atleast on 32bit systems in memory

6903934
width	height
to keep in the x y width height thinking you can construct a utility function to build a rectf with the coordinates in the order you like to think of them

6903934
width	height
ellipse2d.double takes 4 values x y width and height

6903934
width	height
you should be able to more clearly see what your top left bottom and right or x y width and height values should be

6903990
children	parent
i have a parent object project which contains a number of children

6904000
google-chrome	firefox

6904034
openrowset	openquery
and use openquery instead of openrowset

6904068

this works and any subview frame changes you make are animated nicely as the device is rotated landscape - portrait

doesn t really help because this gets called before the rotation takes effect so when accessing self.view.frame you get the pre-rotation sizing so you can t know whether we re going for landscape or portrait

6905648

you ll need to write some small functions like hasclass addclass and removeclass then your listener can be

6906921
hash	md5
instead of storing a password in your database you generate a md5 hash of the original password and store it

6906921
hash	md5
but when you re trying to login a user he s going to type the real password you will then run the md5 algorithm again and compare the hash with the one you have stored if they re the same then the user possibly typed the correct password

6906927
hash	md5
md5 is a one-way hash encryption algorithm

6906927
hash	md5
there is no way to directly decrypt a md5 hash

6906927
hash	md5
the only way to get some form of un-encrypting a md5 digest is to compare other hash to it

6906927
hash	md5
so does md5 me hash then hash decrypted me

6906929
dbcontext	objectcontext
you can get to objectcontext because dbcontext mostly wraps objectcontext.

range	minimum
if the desirable range that you would like to amplify is not the true minimum or maximum you can set imgmin and imgmax values manually

range	minimum
if you actually want to adjust the range of the image you can just normalize it by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the available range

do you need cos sin tan values for all of a b c for various other things in your database or do you just need sin a cos b and tan c

maybe you can even get away with storing the final result of sin a + cos b + tan c

6914764
client-side	server-side
i know it s not always possible to exchange server-side implementation php with a client-side one javascript but there are many cases in which it is possible especially the layout stuff and so i am looking for some study or resource that shows performance comparison between a php based implementation vs

6914874
spaces	delimiter
you ll have to get your output into an array using some sort of string manipulation using the spaces as delimiter then loop over that to build some html output - so the return value will basically just output your select box on the page where you execute your cgi bash script

6915293
yacc	bison
this declares token3 to have higher precedence that token2 but by your comments you may be misunderstanding what higher precedence means to yacc bison

6915293
yacc	bison
in yacc bison all that precedence matters for is resolving shift reduce conflicts -- whenever there s a shift reduce conflict the parser generator compares the precedence of the token to be shifted with the precedence of the rule to be reduced and does whichever one has the higher precedence if they re the same then left favors the reduce while right favors the shift

6915693
typedef	struct
among other things this means that struct in c++ are more or less automatically typedef

so when compiler sees typedef on the next line it finds a name collision because typedef is not the same as struct declaration in c++

6915718

typedef struct struct_name

6915771
jboss	glassfish
for example tomcat doesn t ship with jsf libraries bundled but glassfish jboss websphere etc do

typedef	struct
since what you re doing is really defining a struct and then creating an alias with the typedef i think it s more readable to do this in the c case

6915780
width	height
the trick here is to realise that when the elements are hidden during initialisation they don t have any height or width - therefore the flash buttons which are used for the file and clipboard interactions in tabletools don t have any any size they are 0px x 0px which you should be able to confirm with firebug inspector

listen for the keyup or keydown events and write your own

6919410

6919613
width	height
the css box model defines border and padding to be outside of width and height that is width and height specify content area size only and don t include border or padding

6919643
fadein	fadeout
but the problem is it removes the class then adds class then performs fadeout and fadein

6919732
fadein	fadeout
that s because animation methods like fadeout and fadein are asynchronous they return immediately and perform their work later

6919732
fadein	fadeout
in your case you only need to run the fadein animation when the fadeout effect completes in its callback

6919782

the problem is that width 100 sets the width to 100 of the parent element not the size of the children

6927369
folder	dir
its a lot better than using the phones memory for that thats the cache dir on the phone which fills the phone memory you can just clear the sd cache by removing all the images in your cache folder ondestroy

6927389
g++	gcc
this is particularly bad in g++ which often emits errors containing lowered vtable references but even gcc can produce inscrutible error messages in some cases when it tries to do this

6927404
hash	salt
store a hash of the pw + username + salt and recalculate that when the user tries to log in

6927413

the same is also valid for setter and getter or add and remove

6927426
post	put
the embed code in your post is fine put it on a php page and replace

unfortunately this wouldn t work for post delete put http requests

6927603
post	get
i get a lot of these viewstate errors on one of my sites and it s normally a bot trying its luck to post something nefarious

6927621
post	get
but if it has to be post and what you get back has to be actual script code as opposed to data then we ll have to do something like eval

6927624
hide	show
the way i ve usually seen this done is the show the new form and hide the previous one

6927627
google-chrome	firefox
in particular you should be using the javascript console in google-chrome and firefox to see what errors you are getting

6927673
children	parent
the elements with red text match the selected class and are even numbered children of the parent div

6927675

basicly i m making an app that lets you add or subtract by a certain number and i want to do so with a slider

6927675
subtract	add
how would i program a slider to be able to add or subtract by an integer by tapping a different button for adding and subtract

6927676
realloc	malloc
my experience in c is fairly limited and i am fearful of using pointers for anything but simple data like 2d grids image storage and strings although i am familiar with referencing malloc realloc and other trivial actions i am not used to the hard parts of c which makes such structures hard to tackle from theory and i don t want to just copy working code into this

6927676
dictionary	map
so far i ve been coding combining lua for dictionary searches and designing data and some logic parts and left all video and audio storage heavy math and world storage in c using grid structures and a not-too-bruteforced collision detection approach using a linear array to place objects in 1 24 of the map nothing complex in code terms

6927679
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine using google-chrome firefox or internet explorer in quirks mode but ie9 in standard mode draws a textarea with same height as root div

6927686
flying-saucer	itext
please check my answer at itext flying saucer pdf headers and ignoring html you can customize the header footer content based on the page number i know this is not a answer using flying-saucer

6927694
mdpi	hdpi
edit - the best way of doing this is to define the text sizes as a dimen and vary the sizes depending on what hardware you are targeting by putting different values in the dimens.xml file in your different dpi ldpi mdpi hdpi etc bucket folders

6927697
hash	md5
so i introduced a table of contents file which mapped the md5 hash of each file to its name

6927723
post	get
however they only return null if the request is not a get or a post which should never happen based on the way they have set up the factory in the web.config

6927740
post	get
if this still fails then post the error that you get then

6927742
int	double
no switch works on an int value i think floats double are not even allowed

6927811
subtract	add
when the functions are called they grab the value from the variable and add subtract it to from something

6927811
subtract	add
you could of course combine the two functions into one and decide wether you should add or subtract according to which button was pressed you get that by looking into the sender argument but i think it s less effective and the code woud be more complex for no reason

6927823
getter	setter
then i would avoid getter setter and use package local or public fields

6927823
getter	setter
if you have a class which you expect other modules developers to use following a getter setter model may be a safer approach in the long run

6927831
implements	extends
if instead of a class you want to extends you want to implements an interface take a look at java.lang.reflect.proxy

6928015

implements	extends
i m playing for a few days with apache mina and i want to ask you how can i create by extends or implements iosession to create something like myiosession

6928341
google-chrome	safari
use an object inspector so you can see the live dom like firebug or the built-in google-chrome or safari inspectors

6928348
width	height
in my case i was looking at the uialertview s button sizes which always showed a width and height of 0

6928365
jsf	seam
i m new to jsf and i m learning it with jsf 2 apis and seam by kent ka lok tong

6928410
express	node.js
i have successfully implemented socket.io node.js and express to server realtime json data to all browsers except ie testing on 9 using a secure connection

6928410
google-chrome	firefox
when the same is done from firefox or google-chrome the line xhr-polling writing 8 is appended with the correct response for example

6928410
express	node.js
i am using node.js version 0.4.10 socket.io version 0.7.7 and express version 2.4.3

6928410

atomic	interlocked
furthermore the interlocked methods guarantees that the operation is atomic even on multi-core computers where each core has its own cache and potentially its own view of the main memory

6928515
mvp	presenter
in most of the mvp examples i ve seen the presenter calls some service which calls some repository which returns an entity

6928528
hide	show
when someone instantiates the control they ll pass in a popupid attribute which is assigned to the id of a div inside the control and will be used to call show and hide functions in javascript

6928544
dbcontext	objectcontext
if i add a new category and then write something like that i m intentionally not using repository here but row dbcontext or objectcontext if we are using ef 4.0 to be clearer to you

6928548
put	get
i finished my game cocos2d but when i make an archive from xcode product- archive then click on share to get game.api then put it in the itunes and sync to my iphone the accelerometer it seem that it didn t work i tested the game in 5 devices and it didn t work the ship always in fix place and it didn t move but if i click build and go from the xcode it work properly on all the developer devices i use the code below

6928589

the md5 hash is stored in the database as varchar2

6928664
next	except
i browsed through the code on the next couple of pages and i can t find any release message anywhere except for a release being send to timelabel in dealloc

6928673
mvp	presenter
most mvp frameworks populate the presenter view relationship from the view especially since asp.net runs in the context of the page the page is the http handler processing the request so it s what is alive at that point

6928676
actionscript	mxml
in mxml you would do this in the metadata tag in actionscript it would be before the class definition

6928697
hash	md5
the only way i can imagine to do this is to connect to the database every time a page is loaded and check an md5 hash or something from the database and renew it but i imagine this would generate a lot of needless server traffic and i m almost sure there s a better way to do it

6928697
hash	md5
for the most part i m pretty solid on this part i hope but i don t know what my md5 hash should contain in order to be able to later re-check the hash with the one in the database the one in the cookie and a newly generated hash to make sure a cookie hasn t been conjured by an attacker

6928720
min	max	range	max	range	min
it takes an excel range like a1 a5 or a1 b5 and 2 optional paramters min and max

6928720
range	max
you should get back the result the range is now 3 3 3 4 5 since you did not give a max

6928729

hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if you just hash a password once with md5 and no salt it d be trivial to look up the hash and see what the unhashed password is unless your users are all smart enough to use really long random passwords which aren t found in any rainbow tables

6931917
pop-up	dialog
the alert dialog is supposed to pop-up once the person is done editing the text leaves the edit text focus thanks

6931940
int	chars
in the .net clr strings are laid out in memory pretty much the same way that bstrs were implemented in ole automation as a word-aligned memory buffer consisting of a four-byte int giving the length of the string followed by the chars of the string in two-byte chunks of utf-16 data followed by two zero bytes

6931947
put	get
put breakpoint to get set run the program and filter the columns

6931956
mouseover	mouseout
or something similiar to mouseover and mouseout

6931966

the data consists of a weekly count from each server s log for a particular request get login.php or post update.php

6931981
onchange	onblur
text inputs have onblur and select boxes have onchange events that can be wired into

6932002
int	chars
what i did was set the data type to string so it would work with maskedinput but then in a custom model binder i stripped out all the non-numeric chars so it could save to the database as an int

6932002
client-side	server-side
you still get both client-side and server-side protection because the user is prevented from entering non-numeric characters by maskedinput client-side and potentially bad characters are filtered out server-side

6932007

free	malloc
multiple heaps can be an issue when the library uses a different c-library and therefore a different malloc free and therefore a different heap

6932020
width	height
so it seems that for some reason the width and height are giving out-of-scale values for 125 although they work properly at 100 smaller and 150 higher

6932085
min	max
one alternative would be to specify every selected field using aggregate functions like max or min but this will probably make the scope even longer and less versatile

6932111
post	get
when php receives post get variables which i assume this is about because json_encode wont t do it replaces dots in keys with an underscore a register_globals legacy i think

6932165
hive	hdfs
when you use an olap data warehouse using hdfs and hive you are not quite barred from updating the fact data

6932165
hive	hdfs
table partitions in hive are implemented as hdfs directories so exchanging partitions is almost instantaneous it s the time needed to rename a hdfs directory

6932165
hive	hdfs
well you ll have to call hdfs directly bypassing the hive interface and you would likely employ straight mapreduce to maintain stage but in the datawarehouses developed by the company i work for it proved to be a good approach

6932333

6932506
mouseleave	mouseenter
css3 is adding a bunch of transition properties to handle things like this but for the moment if you re set on using jquery you could make use of the .animate function combined with mouseenter and mouseleave

6932514
stdout	stderr
when you run the process redirect stderr to stdout like this

6932519
visualstatemanager	togglebutton
for example i ve created my own control and with visualstatemanager i m able to handle several events that fire for the control as a whole i d like just my togglebutton in the controlto fire the mouseover event

maven	buildr
you can see the dependencies for v2.6 here and here for v3.0 along with the required code to import the package using maven ivy buildr or groovy s grab

6932743
width	height
you can use the properties to get the frame rate similar to the way you got the frame width and height however since you are capturing from the camera you will probably have to test the capture rate by using a timer in your code and estimating from that

6932819
mongoid	mongomapper
code stats for mongoid and mongomapper

6932835
width	height
the -crop parameters are 1 4 of the width and height

min	max	range	max	range	min
the perl does not look like it s simply the python min max and range functions

6932859
udp	tcp
.net remoting allows for tcp udp ipc communication and to your code it just looks like you are calling a method property on an object

6932922
width	height
remove the height and width settings on your button and if you need the initial sizes add these setters to your style

6932923
width	height
without a code example it s hard to diagnose but i would recommend that you ensure that the width and height attributes are set to 100 on the iframe and that you have a height 100 style on the div and td that contain the iframe

6932935
put	get
how do i get the information the user enters in the job no field put it in job and submit it without page refresh

6932947
getter	setter
however the properties should have included the contents of the getter setter which yes would be a syntax error because of the invalid field name but it is an accurate representation of the il

6932950
stdout	stderr
using dup2 in unistd.h you could close both stderr and stdout and re-direct them to a file

6932950
stdout	stderr
now both stderr and stdout when used will write to my_log_file.txt

6932974

results are what i only assume is a list by year of the min max 1st qu median etc

6934316

if you continue to queue animations via setinterval or settimeout while animation is paused all of the queued animations will begin playing when the window tab regains focus

6934904

6935006
stdout	stderr
i m redirecting stdout to a log file but leaving stderr unchanged so that cron will e-mail it to me if there is any output.

6935006

hash	md5
assuming you want to return the base64 representation of a md5 hash of a string this would be equivalent

6935190
width	height
c# does not execute inside of a browser and should not be used to try and determine the width and height a given html page will render at in a browser

6935190
width	height
optionally you can repeat step 3 with different browsers to get the width height for all the different browsers that you care about

6935238
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera and google-chrome do the job but firefox keep me logged in it doesn t send the expiry signal

6935287
prepare	execute
another way is that use prepare statement in your appplication when the prepare statement is execute

6935338
stdout	stderr
it works by temporarily storing all output stdout and stderr in a temporary file and then sending the contents of that file to stderr or stdout depending on curl s exit code

6935338
stdout	stderr
if curl failed the entire output will go to stderr and be e-mailed to me thanks to cron but if curl succeeded the output will go to stdout instead which is redirected to a log file in the cron command resulting in no e-mail.

6935361
octal	decimal
012 octal twelve is 010 octal ten which is decimal 8 plus 2 or decimal 10

i repeated this with similar success in both windows with cygwin and on ubuntu linux

6935641
superclass	subclassing
if the common functionality is identical methods in various modules subclassing then you can just factor it out of the modules into the common superclass and just have the method defined once there

6935641
superclass	subclassing
if the method is implemented in a different way in every subclassing but you want to call it in the same way regardless of which subclassing instance you have then you can declare it as abstract in the superclass and have an implementation in each subclassing

6935641
superclass	subclassing
then you can factor out the most common implementation into the superclass and override it in the exceptional subclassing

6935647
width	height
i would create another div before the description with the same height and width set that div s opacity to transparent add a background then put the description in another div without a background

6935675

6936656
ubuntu	linux
if you are on linux especially if its a recent version like ubuntu lucid which can get qt 4.7 - then try

6936656

i google on the net and found two approaches to redirect incoming requests to apache in ubuntu os 1 using httpd.conf and 2 using .htaccess

6936926
.htaccess	httpd.conf

your computer probably has an ethernet card or a wireless network adaptor or both and either of both of those could each have their own private address

6942842
int	double
i guess it s not possible to convert double to decimal without possible loss of precision but it is ok with an int

6942844
msdeploy	ajaxmin
how can we include the files created by ajaxmin in the msdeploy package created by msbuild

6942854
mkmapview	mkannotationview
however if you must add a button directly to the mkannotationview the problems with your approach are that the mkpinannotationview s default frame which can t easily be changed is smaller than the button you re adding so most of the button will not respond to touches and even if you switch to using an mkannotationview and increase the frame size the mkmapview will prevent the button from getting any touches

6942866
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested w javascript disabled tested on ff3.0+ safari 4.0+ google-chrome 10.0+ and ie6+ checked my z-index values and no matter what i do i am unable to duplicate this issue so therefore i am unable to find a solution

6942872
dbf	dbase
you can select your platform for example dbase for dbf files and look for a driver

6942925
put	get
in case your users can get kicked out in the middle of their work you can solve this by creating an action filter and put it on either

6942941
google-chrome	firefox
but when deployed the project and started the application on a browser i checked in google-chrome and firefox too the application did not start

6942995
int	double
they do this because double has such a huge range â 5.0 ã 10âˆ 324 to â 1.7 ã 10 308 whereas int is only -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647

6942995
int	double
a decimal s range is -7.9 x 10 28 to 7.9 x 10 28 10 0 to 28 so it can hold an int but not a double

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
i m not surprised but i ve discovered that ie8 behaves very differently than google-chrome and firefox with respect to retrieving the caret position from a text or

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
whereas google-chrome and firefox report the caret position analogously to the index within the string value ie8 does not

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
first off here are the functions that i use to retrieve the caret positions respectively in google-chrome firefox and ie

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
the code above reports the following caret positions for the given criteria in google-chrome and firefox

6943041
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome

6943066
folder	directory
i need to change the current folder directory as well which is over 1000 records

6943092
for-loop	loops
to change while loops to for-loop

6943092
for-loop	loops
to make while loops print numbers like the for-loop

6943098
pygtk	pygobject
i m in the process of converting a program from pygtk to pygobject introspection for the first time and i ve hit a roadblock with threading

6943098
pop-up	dialog
i have a process that takes some time to complete so i pop-up a dialog with a progress bar on it and i use a thread to do the process and to update the progress bar

6943098
pygtk	pygobject
this worked fine with pygtk but after converting to pygobject i get all the usual improper threading weirdness the program hangs but it seems to hang in different parts of the process etc

6943108
public	protected
if the form is declared within a class under private protected or public section then the class needs to be instantiated then the form itself needs be instantiated and passed around wherever it is needed

6943118
x86	64bit
if you re running 64bit windows make sure to change the platform target of your c# project to x86

6943130
folder	directory
however i do not know how i can do the same thing with directory and folder

6943133
hash	salt
i was just thinking if creating a password hash by using a salt created from the password himself is safe to use

6943170
getter	setter
in delphi which was afaict one of the first languages with properties as language construct at all it is customary to wrap all ivars in properties but not all have to be public and there are many such unreal i am deliberately avoiding the term virtual here properties the ones that are only implemented in code and not just getter and setter for an ivar

6943170
getter	setter
it doesn t make sense to declare and implement either via synthesize or with custom setter and getter public properties for each ivar

6943186
hide	show
i tried changing it so it cloned and then did the show hide but i didn t notice any obvious difference in speed

6943188
capitalize	capitalization
setting the capitalization property to words will suggest that the user enter capitalize words

6943201
getter	setter
many people will tell you that using the getter setter instead of the variables is more robust to programming errors and changes and reduces code duplication

6943201
getter	setter
but as long as these getter setter are no inline functions you may get a small performance hit and as the implementation has to know the class s internals anyway why not just use the variables directly

6943212
getter	setter
i would prefer using setter and getter that way if way your change some implementation details for example introduce validation on value assign you jest have to change that in one place in setter.

6943250
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button new simpler design

6943260
pop-up	dialog
in excel 2007 you use this according to the tag when you open a xml file it pop-up a dialog box asking what to do with the xml file

6943267
getter	setter
you should nearly always use getter setter methods to access a variable when you re outside of the class and often you have to because that s the only way to do so

6943268
for-loop	loops
i try to download a site in an infinite loops here only a for-loop and

6943269
getter	setter
using a setter getter reduces this to just a couple of methods

6943337
implements	extends
class panel extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

6943367
google-chrome	firefox
what i am trying to is after loginbutton is clicked opening dashboard.aspx and setting focus on it.and this code opens dashboard.aspx and sets focus in google-chrome and mozilla firefox 4.however when i try it on ie9 dashboard.aspx is opened but focus does not work and dashboard.aspx remains under the login page

6943386
ienumerable	ilist
here is an alternative implementation of gishu s answer that returns an ienumerable rather than an ilist and makes use of the yield keyword to simplify the code

6943391
jruby	mri
also notice with the neo4j server solution you can run a rails frontend on ruby mri and the backend using neo4j server with the active model compliant neo4j.rb on jruby

6943397
getter	setter
the point of the abstraction of setter and getter is that the method of retrieval may change

6943405
dictionary	map
if you re doing this lookup a lot it might be easier to create a dictionary to map from typea to typeb

6943411
put	get
you can then put an index on the new column and get the database to do the work for you

6943443
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if the file name contains accents it works as expected in opera firefox google-chrome and ie9

6943458
g++	gcc
your are probably compiling and linking with gcc instead of g++

6943458
g++	gcc
gcc uses the file extension to guess the real language but when linking g++ also pulls in the c++ standard library which is where allocators are usually defined

6943480
int	double
since you are seemingly interested in numeric types a very natural requirement for such types is that they provide a constructor which takes a fundamental type int or double

6943481
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently works on google-chrome firefox edge opera but not safari 10 or ie11

6943515
docx	xlsx
microsoft office files doc docx xls xlsx ppt and pptx

6943596
post	get
you can get the post body string using

6943618
int	double
even the conversion from double to int

6943658
children	parent
example first number is pid the second one is number of children + 1 parent

6943670
hash	salt
so in this case just hashing their password and adding it as a salt would still make 2 user s final hash password equal when the same original password is given

6943694
ssl	https
i want to use ssl to make the site secure using https

6943697
realloc	malloc
if you ve allocated a buffer with malloc you can use realloc to expand it

6943752
hide	show
when the value of a long list of elements is set to hide show the hidden elements are removed from the flow and placed on the bottom of the page in the order they were removed

6943824
fold	catamorphism	catamorphism	unfold
extremely loosely speaking a catamorphism is just a slight generalization of fold and an anamorphism is a slight generalization of unfold

6943858
put	get
so whenever the byte stream received and put into a bytebuffer by java we call getint to get the value

6943947
setinterval	settimeout
there is js optimalization causing inactive tabs to slow down setinterval and settimeout in ff5 and chrome

6943962
udp	tcp
udp sockets are much simpler then tcp ones

6943962
udp	tcp
to elaborate a bit after your comment - when you get a datagram on a udp socket you don t get a new socket descriptor like with tcp so your parent still handles all the input

6943964
ienumerator	idisposable
additionally ienumerator doesn t implement idisposable whereas does. if you re new to generics that s more than can easily be covered in an answer here.

6943965
nunit	mstest
i would say you use the setup and teardown nunit or classinitialize and classcleanup mstest for this

6944009
getter	setter
when we set property cocoa creates some setter getter which are handling the relasing and retaining of the objects

6944009
getter	setter
in order to automatically generate the getter and setter you need to synthesize it

6944009
getter	setter
you could alternatively write your own getter and setter which do not even have to reference a real ivar

6944014
implements	extends
then a new node is simply implements by extends one or both of these abstract classes

6944023
mutators	setter	mutators	getter	getter	setter
i defined isfirstwordbeinganimated at the top of my .m file without creating the mutators setter and accessor getter methods.

6944025
cairngorm	flex
i am creating an crm application using flex cairngorm 2 java hibernate

6944039
client-side	server-side
it also includes features like client-side browser history support that don t make much sense on the server-side

6944039
client-side	server-side
though you could technically use it on the server-side with node backbone is targeted at building single page interface apps on the client-side

6944071
put	get
try to put it to the topmost of your page however since the dom isnt loaded yet you cant get any other elements

6944073
innodb	myisam
i am using the mysql workbench to alter some huge millions of rows myisam tables to innodb

6944073
innodb	myisam
so i thought i could wright a sql script that loops oversy every 10000 entry or so and copy the content of the myisam table in chunks to the innodb table

6944119
width	height
returns a mutable bitmap with the specified width and height

6944154
vmware	virtualbox
i m trying to migrate an existing vm from vmware to virtualbox

6944196
tortoisegit	svn
tortoisegit and tortoise svn

6944202
imagemagick	im4java
fortunately imagemagick has 2 popular java bindings and if the jmagick api doesn t let you deal with inputstreams you might look at im4java which is a straight wrapper to the command line version of imagemagick

6944202
imagemagick	im4java
if that is the case you can use imageio.read inputstream to read the image data into a bufferedimage before sending it off to imagemagick for processing using the im4java api

6944209
uiview	calayer
though the nice fellow then answered with even more helpful advice uiview contains a .layers which contains calayer in which i m trying to access the calayer .contents to try to see if i can add an image manually to uiview using cgimageref

6944236
switching	screens
in order to disable switching to full screens mode either form button or pinch gesture you can use this

6944251
getter	setter
because by accessing directly the ivar you are bypassing the setter and getter

6944308
pop-up	dialog
i assume you re referring to registration - the dialog that pop-up when you request push notification registration for the first time

6944390
comparator	comparable
you need to use the comparator method on comparable instead

6944396
content-disposition	content-type
it s not 100 clear what you mean but the browser will use the content-type and content-disposition headers to decide whether to display a resource in the browser or to show the download prompt

6944411
websphere	ibm
i am using websphere 6.1 with ibm rad - connecting via a datasource that implements com.ibm.db2.jcc.db2connectionpooldatasource

6944422
google-chrome	firefox
i can not explain why the internet explorer to always fall into the last if but does not firefox and google-chrome

6944424
getter	setter
secondly you created the getter setter fine but you re not actually using it

6944426
put	get
even if you had put more effort into obfuscation an attacker with strong motivation would still be able to get what he wants

6944435
inherited	properties
when trying to map an inherited properties using attributeoverride annotation openjpa throws an error that it cannot find the properties in the super class

6944470
draggable	droppable
i have initialized box to be draggable and div b to be droppable using jquery ui libraries

6944493
implements	extends
though not every possible feature is implements in jqm by default it s not that difficult to extends

6944501
hide	show
i have a simple show hide jquery script that works fine on its own the problem is that i am using it on the comments section off a php mysql driven site

6944501
hide	show
i am struggling to pass the commment id variable to the jquery script so that the show hide function works for each comment independently

6944541
width	height
my recommendation add a background color to #col2 such as #ff0000 which is red to see its width and height

6944554
post	get
i think you don t have to use the twebbrowser and can use anything that can issue get and post requests

6944621
jar	war
as for war files you can extract the class files from war or jar by unzipping it

6944621
jar	war
you can even zip and unzip the war with jdk jar -xvf tobe_extracted.war

6944672
pop-up	dialog
pre-ie9 when the user clicked my preview button on the pop-up window they would get a dialog like this once the report rendered

6944672
pop-up	dialog
i ve looked for ways on the net to either show the the download bar on the pop-up window preferred revert to the old dialog or remove it all together

6944679
google-chrome	firefox
tried the same file in firefox 5.0 and it didn t work either only google-chrome is able to play the mp4 video

6944707
sorting	grouping
you use groupingview having groupdatasorted false so the sorting of the grouping in your case with do jqgrid for you

6944725
jar	war
the jar file must be under web-inf lib in the war

6944737
implements	extends
you could try extends datagrid and then implements a notifypropertychange event

6944771
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int note that it has type chars

6944771
int	chars
in c++ ...the value of an int chars constant containing more

6944772
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox

6944780
setinterval	settimeout
first of all i m asking this for settimeout and for setinterval

6944783
opera	firefox
however html5 has also defined limits on these attributes and webkit browsers have implemented these restrictions likely with firefox and opera not far behind

6944783
min	max	required	placeholder	width	height
the following content attributes must not be specified and do not apply to the element accept alt autocomplete checked dirname formaction formenctype formmethod formnovalidate formtarget height list max maxlength min multiple pattern placeholder readonly required size src step and width

6944783
submit	submission
webkit browsers are responding by not submission the form at all and not triggering javascript s submit event

6944783
submit	submission
temporarily display and immediately hide the offending form controls though i m unsure when this would be done since the submit event is never fired and it s possible to submit a form without firing the click event on the submission button or

6944802
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i can obviously use nscalendar and nsdate and nsdatecomponents to achieve this

6944812
setinterval	settimeout
but it s better to always pass a function rather than string to setinterval and settimeout

6944814
setinterval	settimeout
both settimeout and setinterval will eval a string but best practice is to sent a reference to the function - therefore no quotes

6944823
ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	ingres	firebird	ingres	postgresql	postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql	informix	firebird	informix	ingres
it also supports a lot of databases sqlite postgresql mysql mssql firebird oracle ibm db2 informix ingres and google app engine

6944940
put	get
on first thought it seems that as i get or put tasks into the queue i should be reading and writing to a file simultaneously

6944982
for-loop	loops
set echo in for-loop you will always be able to set loops variable now simply echo print the code

6944991
post	get
i have this query to get the first result i want from this post earlier

6944991
children	parent
but i have another problem now as i want to return the parent that have not children at all

glut	glew	freeglut	glew
i want to run opengl glut freeglut glew libraries in monodevelop on my ubuntu machine

6945032
vim	emacs
my personal opinion is that every ide except emacs vim and qtcreator is not worth using

6945037
post	get
since you re trying to teach yourself kudos btw i won t post a complete solution but also note that you can use indexing to get substrings

6945043
post	get
the problem is when someone selects the list then types a number it will change with every key stroke they press and that will trigger the post back before they get to the value they are trying to type

6945083
onclick	onsubmit
you need to put the javascript event in your form tag and use onsubmit instead of onclick also you don t need an external js for this

6945114
width	height
also be sure to include width and height attributes

6945125
packed-decimal	comp-3
another common cobol field definition is packed-decimal or comp-3

6945160
singleton	facade
you want to combine a singleton with a facade

6945160
singleton	facade
create a singleton that got the same methods as your interface and then assign the interface to the facade as the singleton

6945183
folder	directory
but when i do a ls on that folder i do not see a .svn lock file in that directory

6945185
keyevent	onkeydown
the method onkeydown int keyevent of type myclass must override or

6945214
listboxitem	textbox
looking at the following picture you see that the textbox in the fourth listboxitem has the focus and keyboardfocus while the second listboxitem is selected

6945214
listboxitem	textbox
i know i can catch the gotfocus event of the textbox grab its datacontext and set the isselected property of the bound object so the listboxitem becomes selected

6945221
versioning	upgrade
the issue in this case was that i needed to upgrade to the newer versioning of xcode v4

6945264
prepare	execute
named prepare statements are a different thing if you notice a query is often issued you can use prepare and then execute it multiple times

6945292
onresume	onpause
i register the receiver onresume and unregister it onpause

6945368
portrait	landscape
setting a maxwidth would limit the textview s width but that solution doesn t scale across portrait landscape and different display dimensions

6945424
dictionary	map
suppose data dictionary is std map string foo dictionary

6945441
queue	fifo
in computer comilation is made by fifo fifo .first line compile first n result print first that is queue

apache	nginx
how can i setup nginx as reverse proxy along with apache on centos 5.6

6945581
apache	nginx
i have already install apache but i dont know if i should proceed with installing nginx because i am afraid that may set nginx as the default server

6945590
switching	screens
i am building a game and to switching between the login screens and the game screens i am using a cardlayout

6945590
switching	screens
the code i am using to switching between the screens is

6945590
switching	screens
what happens though is after i switching the screens if i move my mouse over where the swing controls in the login screens were they appear and i can interact with them

6945598
int	chars
if the blah is of int type then you might have to cast it to chars like find_in_set cast blah as chars ids

6945609
super	abstract
i have a super class myclass and it is abstract

6945611
post	get
make sure you are calling url.content instead of just in your get post calls

6945622
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
use an nscalendar instance to create a nsdatecomponents instance out of your nsdate then just check the hours minutes and seconds property of the nsdatecomponents and present the appropriate message

6945629
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it renders as coded in google-chrome and firefox but safari is giving me trouble

6945661
post	get
multi-page form this is more difficult and less preferable to your visitors this can be accomplished using cookies get or post on page 1 the user will select style which will be saved on a variable cookie get post on page 2 the user will be presented with the sizes relative to the style found on the variable

6945739
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux box with the latest ubuntu on it

6945757
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera as far as i recall are returning mainly npvarianttype_double even if this represents the location of an element in pixels .you can create a function that converts npvarianttype_double and npvarianttype_int32 to whatever you want

6945831
min	max
you should pass into this container the min and max for the x-axis probably as separate properties and a dataprovider that describes when to show a highlighted section

6945831
min	max
you might have to compute the min and max based on the dataprovider you pass into the chart

6945831
min	max
if you just want to show the highlighted area you will just use the drawing api and compute where to put on the x-axis based on your min max width of container and data point start and end values from your dataprovider

6945836
put	get
each environment would get its own instance of a configuration file and in a deployment plan you can use the deploy configuration files action to put them in any environment

6945865
udp	tcp
i have a sample application of a sip server listening on both tcp and udp ports 5060

6945873
children	parent
one way i thought of doing it is by creating a webinvoke method which would take a json string like this parent name daddy children name tom name dick name harry

6945873
post	get
another way of doing it i don t like it is to call post on parent entity and get its id and using it to post for each child

6945899
user-controls	tabcontrol
transfort all your windows into user-controls and build your new window with your tabcontrol

6945935
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in google-chrome and safari with this html

6945936
accessor	properties
it s a public readonly properties it only has a public get accessor

6945945
mouse	trackpad
also the mouse wheel trackpad scroll is not working on laptops but is working on ipad 2

6945945
mouse	trackpad
so on laptops you can click and drag the scrollbar to see the content but cannot swipe the trackpad mouse wheel whereas on ipad it is the opposite you can swipe track over the text and the scroll works but cannot drag the scrollbar

6945959
stdout	stderr
which would redirect your stderr to stdout

6945981
stdout	stderr
so even closing stdin stdout and stderr php will not reuse resource id s

6945981
stdout	stderr
even more stdin id #1 stdout is #2 and stderr is #3 when in fact stdin has file descriptor 0 stdout has 1 and stderr has 2

6946004
width	height
basically at level_4 what would the width and height be of the cell in feet or meters

6946013
mouseup	mousedown
2. apply a bezier curve â between the mousedown and mouseup events log an array of the points and apply the curve

6946021
hide	show
i am using a simple jquery toogle to show and hide a form

6946074
mouseleave	mouseenter
i also have jquery listeners for their mouseenter and mouseleave events that update a parent image according to whichever thumbnail is being rolled over

6946093
coalesce	isnull
you could probably do this more easily using isnull or coalesce

6946105
stdout	stderr
this is how stdout 0 stdin 1 and stderr 2 are inherited by child processes

6946119
nsdateformatter	nscalendar
nsdate is highly efficient and highly productive especially when combined with nsdateformatter and nscalendar although you could argue the latter classes are quite bloated and slow they are incredibly deep

6946137
opera	firefox
select box shows the options in firefox opera ie7 ie8 and opera

6946137
google-chrome	safari
but it fails in google-chrome safari and ie9

6946137
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome are using webkit so is most certainly a browser implementations issue or an issue with the tablesorter pluigin

6946154
128bit	64bit
some wider instructions like sse2 128bit wide or double float 64bit wide are faster or sometimes will not work for alignment of native width if you need to load 128bit data you should align it in 128bit

6946186
int	double	int	boolean
in primitive types int float double boolean it actually compares the value

6946198
hide	show
i am asking this because i don t think that it was intentionally designed to show hide the form after clicking on a fieldset legend

6946209
for-loop	loops
aside from using the wrong style for-loop you re trying to make a function in a loops

6946213
put	get
however when the map is and according changes in the rest of the code the listener and the put i can see the evictions taking place and the code simply works and the values get garbage collected

6946220
inherited	properties
i have an interface that has like 20 properties that should be implemented all this properties should return an interface type or anything that inherited from this interface each properties of those 20 is returning a diffrent type than the other

6946224
post	get
doing this ending up allowing me to make cross domain request as i please but it limits me to only post and get requests

6946228
width	height
i have tried setting the width and height to 100 but that doesn t work

6946655
udp	tcp
as documented in the man page msg_trunc is only valid for packet sockets udp so this will not work as you want for your tcp socket which is stream based

6946655
udp	tcp
there are literally hundreds of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere that talk about preserving application message boundaries on tcp hint you need to do this yourself tcp is a byte stream interface and doesn t so i won t go into the details here suffice it to say you need a mechanism to know how big an application message or packet is on the recv side to enable you to do what you want over tcp or you need to switch over to udp

6946664
onresume	onpause
this could happen if you are still rendering the lw while he configuration activity is open try to pause it using the onpause call and resume rendering on onresume

6946666
google-chrome	safari
i think the problem here is that ffx and google-chrome block reading the http cookie unlike safari

6946782
serp	bing
bing has an api which doesn t appear to simply return serp position but which can be used to fetch search engine results which you can then iterate through

6946782
serp	bing
because you mention bing and yahoo in your page rank sentence i conclude that you mean search engine results page rank serp rank not pagerank

6946822
put	get
put them together and you get the following which appears to give the output you re looking for

6946829
post	get
my controller action handling the post expects to get a person object not the entire viewmodel posted

if not skip it multiplying by 24 and add to hours

6946941
gridview	objectdatasource
objectdatasource paging - no data displayed in gridview

6946991
puts	gets
im pretty sure this has to do with how the iphone reuses the cells and when i scroll away from on that has a check mark it probably puts it back in when i gets a chance

6947010
sorting	filtering
the view also has some sorting and filtering abilities so it might help to find the info you re looking for

6947094

i have a chars type column in table a and all the strings in the column correspond one-to-one to int in table b

6947103
int	chars
what i want is to replace all of the strings in the chars column of table a with their corresponding int from table b

6947125
listview	gridview
listview table gridview

6947134
ssl	https
i was thinking of using the global filter approach provided in mvc 3.0 in order to verify what are the pages being accessedâ if the user is accessing public pages them make sure heâ s in http if the user is accessing an ssl page then make sure it prints out the https

6947149

i have a checkbox that does not render as a checkbox and would be displayed as something similar to a button

6947174
int	chars
change your chars c to int c

6947180
stringbuilder	stringwriter
a typical approach is to implement some kind of rtf generator that builds an rtf-compatible string using fast string manipulation stringbuilder stringwriter etc and then replace the richtextbox control s rtf code with your own

6947184
width	height
it resizes to maximum width and height of the actual screen but no larger

6947195
tabcontrol	tabitem
i would use a tabcontrol with it s itemssource bound to the details property and then use a datatrigger within the tabitem to determine how the itemtemplate tab content should get drawn

6947205
kerberos	ntlm
ntlm is proprietary and insecure compared to digest and kerberos

6947212
asterisk	freeswitch

6947290
google-chrome	safari
everything works perfectly in ff5 safari and google-chrome but when i test on ie 8 i see the following behavior

6947298
hash	salt
nothing would stop an attacker from sniffing the link and getting the salt as it goes from server- client or the hash password as it goes from client- server and replaying either

6947310
unsigned	short	int	chars
i want data to hold max of either unsigned chars unsigned short int and unsigned long int the data_t enum contains

6947319

6947340
devise	cancan
as ruby-toolbox indicates cancan and devise are the most popular authorization authentication solutions for rails

6947364
move	drag
i would like to limit the drag area on this object so it can only be move up and down or side to side

6947430
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
presumably you d be using touchesbegan touchesmoved etc. so it should be as simple as testing whether the touch point is outside your view s bounds in touchesmoved

6947437
put	get	button	checkbox
mx checkbox extends mx button so if you put added css that skinned mx button mx checkbox would also get it

6947443
int	chars
this program exhibits undefined behavior the type of chars does not correspond to the type of the scanf arg d wants a signed int

6947451
super	extends
the web service client extends javax.xml.ws.service and the error is thrown when the client tries to call the super class constructor with three arguments

6947455
uitableview	nsindexpath
if the cell is to be re-used try setting the tag property of the textfield with the row then when the touch is detected by the uitextview use one of its delegate methods to call the above uitableview method providing an nsindexpath derived from the uitextview s tag

6947467
folder	directory
so for example no matter where you launched the bin from it would always know that it s .conf file was going to be up one folder in the that relative .. etc folder or possibly even right next to it in the same directory .

6947468
firepath	firebug
my firebug and firepath were working fine but they just started acting strange

6947497
put	get	post	get	post	put
these apis usually use http get post put and delete methods to interact with services they provide and sometimes optionally transmit the bulk of the payload data in json format

6947506
parent-child	one-to-many
see the prototypical parent-child relationship example in the hibernate reference and the bidi one-to-many section of the annotation reference

6947514
jar	war
for example when i make a jar or war file with mvc structure and put it into existing spring mvc web app it should work without recompiling the web app

6947515
children	parent
then when hibernate fetches the parent class and initializes the set of children the child class will have a reference to the parent class

6947530
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
this test was done on a modest i3 laptop but it reviewed varnish ats apache traffic server nginx lighttpd etc

6947530
cherokee	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd	nginx	cherokee	g-wan	lighttpd	g-wan	cherokee	apache	lighttpd	apache	cherokee	apache	nginx
the interesting point is that using a high-end 8-core server gives a very little boost to most of them apache cherokee litespeed lighttpd nginx g-wan

6947547
post	get
i am trying to get list of recent post from a blog filtered by category completely on the client-side using jquery

6947559
int	chars
but the column will still be a chars column so afterwards you still have to do an alter table to convert the column into an int

6947560
submit	submission
click on the first submit button in a form will usually be fired on an enter keypress but there are cases depending on number of controls in the form and what browser it is where it doesn t happen and so you can end up falling through to actually submission the form

6947589
metaphone	soundex
soundex or metaphone might work

6947671
gridview	sqldatasource
here is a simple way to do it with javascript an update panel gridview sqldatasource and a textbox

6947682
google-chrome	firefox
it works fantastic in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it bugs out

6947682
min	max
in ie8 the numbers max min current value all show up as web address rather than the numbers they are supposed to be

6947687
single-quotes	double-quotes
in particular you probably need to surround the source path in double-quotes not single-quotes

6947746
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve got an interesting issue with combining jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave events with a call to append

6947746
mouseleave	mouseenter
my object is to show extra content when the mouseenter something and then remove it when the mouseleave

6947760
min	max
since min and max are declared as int on size you are stuck

6947760
min	max
with this solution you can declare min and max as string keys that your validator will resolve in the bundles prior to validation

6947761
versioning	upgrade
upgrade the maven-jaxws-plugin s jaxws-tools dep to the needed versioning of yours

6947769
nunit	mstest
i found this question as i am switching us to nunit from mstest because we can t trust the result of our ci build anymore because of mstest

6947769
nunit	mstest
switching to nunit will allow us to finally trust that a ci build failure is real not another mstest glitch

6947775
msdeploy	webdeploy
and put the assembly into the extensibility subfolder in the webdeploy folder normally c program files iis msdeploy v2 extensibility

6947779
children	parent
children new arraycollection parent this

6947804
post	get
so if you load a post and edit its title and body two records will get created in the revisions schema

6947807
google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen in google-chrome or the latest release of firefox everything works as expected

6947820
put	get
if you put location.reload true after the callback it will get run before the callback

6947821
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome safari and firefox but doesn t in ie9 and opera

6947827
maven	pom.xml
for reference here is the full configuration of buildnumber maven plugin that i used it goes in pom.xml in the build plugins section

6947858
uitableview	uisearchbar
i am attempting to add a uisearchbar with its corresponding search logic but there is a problem i am using the uitableviewcontroller subclass s automatically generated uitableview instead of a separate nib file and manipulating everything programmatically in terms of the table view

6947865
memcached	apc
create a cron job that runs once a day preferably during a light traffic time to do your heavy lifting save or cache the result for example using apc or memcached or even just overwriting the currently-used image with the new one and display that result to your users

6947894
gridview	datalist
so at that point you would reference the handler in your web.config and then create a gridview or datalist that references the images and the handler will render them for you at runtime

6947901
hide	show
your render function would in this case never hide a div just show another one

6947932
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade was not carried out as new versioning of jira needs 64 bit hardware

6947985
ienumerable	iqueryable
contacts is of type iqueryable which itself implements ienumerable so whtat you are actually looking at is a collection of contacts not a single one

6948002
hide	show
changing textboxes and labels works perfectly but when i want to show or hide the whole gui from another thread this fails

6948082
hash	salt
also as mentioned it would be possible to brute-force a users password quite easily as the attacker can intercept the salt going from server-- client and then the hash password coming back

6948082
hash	md5
md5 being a fast hash algorithm it would likely be quite an effective attack against standard user passwords

6948112
int	double
int and double are different types but are and also different

6948119
google-chrome	firefox
i did it with following code which works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie.

6948128
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera and safari all follow the redirect as expected

6948142
int	double
b int and double are different types and cannot operate without cast

6948153
int	double
int and double are different types but are double and int also different

6948153
int	double
int and double most likely have a different representation in memory for the same values as far as they can represent the same values and different sizes

6948200
versioning	upgrade
the value from channel getposition using fmod_timeunit_ms was working for me on iphone until i upgrade to the latest versioning and now it seems i only get the time in 1 second intervals

6948235
onclick	onchange
try onclick in place of onchange

6948329
min	max
note that the min and max of both axes scales have been set

6948372
folder	directory
another tip any files and folder you place inside the car will be dumbly copied into your profile directory whenever restoring a server configuration from that archive

6948379
google-chrome	firefox
i am getting a http error 500 on google-chrome and getting a blank screen in firefox

6948383
namedtuple	dictionary
there are now namedtuple -- starting to feel more like a special-case dictionary

6948387
int	double
performs an implicit conversion from int to double on the initialization of x but probably nothing in the compilation process is going to create text that looks like

6948390
post	get
now android market allows you to post updates to your application so your users can get new content through there

6948400
int	double
apparently int is fine but double long might not be

6948400
post	get
one of the above post notes that the value will eventually get flushed and the other thread will get it

6948409
put	get
i ll clean it up and put it in a proper model when i get this figured out.

6948438
g++	gcc

a dictionary is indexed by key in fact it s a hash map

6948485
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

6948508
rss	feed
i have used google feed api to read a rss feed url and display the title

6948508
setinterval	settimeout
but when i call it with settimeout or setinterval i am able to see only blank screen and the page does not stop loading

6948513
namedtuple	dictionary
i suppose here you could see a namedtuple which has both a name and a value for each element as an immutable analogue of a dictionary

6948513
namedtuple	dictionary
there are now namedtuple -- starting to feel more like a special-case dictionary

6948581
namedtuple	dictionary
first of all ordered dictionary and namedtuple were introduced in python 2 but that s beside the point

6948597
portrait	landscape
i would look at the display size and determine myself if i am in landscape or portrait

6948597
portrait	landscape
there is a method getrotation on the display object but that is the rotation value from its natural orientation which depending on device may be landscape or portrait

6948604
hide	show
the nice thing about this is it s directly interfaced with jquery s show and hide functions

6948607
put	get
you can put to get the old value

6948629
getter	setter
by synthesizing it in your eventstablecontroller.m file you are telling xcode to generate the getter setter you need to correctly touch mydata which is where your program seems to be failing

6948646
union	distinct
selectmany will flatten the list of lists into one list then you can just pick out the distinct entries in this enumeration instead of using union between individual sub-lists

6948651
namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple exist for convenience and are intended to replace simple classes rather than dictionary really

6948680
hide	show
now it s easy to hide and show - to hide fade out .overlay

6948691
hide	show
i have some php conditional logic...basically i want to use jquery to show or hide certain div s when i submit a form

6948733
rspec	capybara
i m setting up some integration tests using capybara and rspec

6948779
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade my python 2.7.1 installation to 2.7.2 using the .msi installer and the process seemed to go ok

6948812
post	get
we also have a jenkins server running as a local unix jenkins user that i want to get check in with gerrit and post build results into gerrit

6948867
avaudioplayer	mpmediaitem
if you use the url provided by the mpmediaitem object with an avaudioplayer instance or similar it will be routed differently and may not be able to continue playing in the background

6948928
post	get
iâ m a newcomer to django myself so will post a more complete reply once i get it to work

6948929
put	get
here you put the full namespace in a kind of sub-namespace that don t get into the user s namespaces but is still available

6948936
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 9 it says that win is undefined or null

6948936
google-chrome	firefox
edit the window is opened correctly in ie it s just that a reference to it is not saved in win like it is in firefox google-chrome

6948938
width	height
it s width is 850px and height is 567px

6948973
serializable	deserialization
objects events do not survive the serializable deserialization round-trip because they are logically function pointers - so when the object is removed from memory and later re-built the entire memory landscape has changed so those events pointers would no longer be valid

6948994
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
then you will have pages that show virtually the same on ie opera safari and firefox

6949006
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on firefox but not google-chrome or ie

6949009
umask	chmod
perhaps the report file should be chmod -ed after generation to allow others to delete it or the app users should have a correctly set umask

6949015
folder	directory
the program monitors two folder and sends files in those two folder to certain directory on the computer

6949015
folder	directory
i thought about using messagebox.show to let the user know lets say the folder does not exist but with 10000 or so files unable to be moved or if access to directory is denied the computer might just run out of memory with 10000 popups

6949018
vim	gedit	vim	kate	vim	emacs	kate	gedit	emacs	gedit	emacs	kate
emacs and vim should be able to view them without any problem as should gedit kate or pretty much any other syntax-highlighting text editor

6949076
subclass	abstract-class
the jvm doesn t really know or care about that - so it s only as expensive as creating an instance of any other class which happens to be a subclass of an abstract-class

6949085
google-chrome	firefox
the image in firefox is displaying with different colors than the one in google-chrome

6949127
put	get
i think you ll need to put the full url in there or else use native php functions to get the base url

6949169
puts	gets
raw_input username gets the username and puts it in the variable username and same way for password

6949186
post	get
there will be a section if its post you need to post if its get you use get

6949232
src	attr
and no need to use attr here the src reflected property is supported by all major -- and probably all minor -- browsers.

6949317
g++	gcc
if you use the same version gcc as you use g++ it should definitely not be any problem

6949354
folder	directory
mapping a network directory or folder would be simple

6949365
treelist	gridcontrol
if you don t know which assembly it s defined in you can create a collection of devexpress assemblies typeof gridcontrol .assembly typeof treelist .assembly .

6949383
for-loop	loops
i should have mentioned this is removing one object from the collection then breaking out of loops which prevents any errors you have described although using a for-loop with the count is the better option

6949393
typedef	struct
as someone else said here it s probably a typedef now but i don t think c had typedef back in 79 as it only just had struct

6949445
superclass	subclassing
edit also the superclass forcegaugeviewcontroller should not include the subclassing forcegaugeviewcontroller in the header file

6949463
post	get
first it tells some script to get an url then it instructs to post to

6949479
for-loop	loops
note that i substituted your foreach with a for-loop since we aren t able to modify values within a foreach loops

6949482
width	height
oh and i should also mention that because of how the css box model works having an element set to 100 of height or width with a padding won t work well for you

6949553
google-chrome	firefox
i have built a site to market lumber handling products our company sells and it works great in firefox google-chrome etc

6949579
put	get
it s already the case that if you put a date or a time into a cell you get a datetime value

6949584
gradle	ivy
it seems to download all the jar files successfully but those jars only contain pom.xml which it seems that gradle or ivy doesn t pick up any pom.xml for any references so i got complication errors

6949636
inherited	properties
dependencyproperty has inherited properties so if you don t set the usercontroldp s datacontext the datacontext is inherited from the mainwindow s datacontext

6949667
centos	linux
i went to the source examining a linux shadow-utils source package but i did not ensure that the version i was looking at is in fact the same as that which is part of centos 6

referring to ecmascript 5 compatibility table page firefox 4 - 6 and google-chrome 13 - 14 are the most compatible browsers

6949802
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
in regards to the second part of your question regarding your uisearchbar s scope i d strongly recommend replacing the uisearchbar with your own uisegmentedcontrol that s all the scope of a uisearchbar is anyway so that the user isn t confused by there being an off-screen uisearchbar that doesn t do anything

6949803

6949897
int	double
it effectively says treat 1 3 as a double - don t use truncating int division

6949897
int	double
it effectively says treat 1.0 3 as a int - don t use as much memory as you would with a double

6949924
int	double
this means that 1 gets converted to a double and 3.0 is automatically a double so you ll end up doing a floating point division rather than int division

6949924
int	double
the same thing would happen with double 1 3 because the divisor is a double so even though the dividend is an int the system realizes that you want to do floating-point division

6949924
int	double
so when you say int 1.0 3 you re doing double division but then you re converting the double into an int afterwards producing 0

6949928
int	double
double 1 3 - first evaluate the expression in parenthesis - 1 3 is an int division so the result is 0 then cast it to double you get 0.0

6949943
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
instead you have to tell your desktop environment what to do when double clicking a jar or png-file and you have to do it on linux the same way you do it in windows - maybe the installer on windows does it for you because there is normally just on desktop environment windows on the os windows but linux has gnome kde xfce lxde fluxbox and millions more

i have created nibs for ipad iphone portrait landscape so i have four possible views

6950674
iboutlet	ibaction
no problem setting ibaction iboutlet just ctrl-drag as usual to create the code in one nib then go and right-click the object and drag the actions outlets to the right controls in the other nibs so that the connection exists in all nibs

6950674
portrait	landscape
as you guessed everything is fine in portrait orientation but in landscape any interaction with the target object crashes

6950674
portrait	landscape
the weekviewtarget object refers to an object created with the portrait view so the landscape view is looking for a different instance that hasn t been held with a reference

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie9 and recent versions of firefox google-chrome safari opera

6951020
ord	chr
if that doesn t work you can always iterate and then use ord and chr

6951023
int	chars
if you really want to write the function yourself python s string library has a list of ascii lowercase letters but you could exploit the fact that ascii chars are really just int values and add 32 to each letter that has a value between 65 and 90 65 a and 90 z in ascii but there are a few punctuation values in between z and a. no need to parse lists

6951027
comparator	comparable
even if your employee class implements comparable if your subclasses overrides the implementation of comparator you can have problems if you are not careful

6951045
serializable	deserialization
i have a sneaking suspicion that it may be possible to serializable my custom .net objects into json objects and pass them via the ajax call to the web service for deserialization but frankly i would have no idea how to even begin at that

6951086
hash	md5
when the file is uploaded compute the hash of the file using md5 or similar algorithim

6951102
int	chars
if it is an exercise you can flip the chars to an int check if it s in the ascii upper case letter range if it is then add 32 to convert it

6951102
ord	chr
x chr ord x +32 if ord x 64 and ord x 91 else x

6951111
int	chars
if that doesn t work try finding out the length of the text and the int ascii values of the chars in the text

6951153
width	height
width and height changes are the most common effects child elements

6951190

i tried making a new uiview subclass and laying out the subviews in ib but i ran into trouble getting the table controller to link w the uitable because i don t know enough about ib

6951229
getter	setter
i want to make a private member variable that is private even to the class that owns it and can only be accessed by its getter and setter

6951229
getter	setter
but i want to be able to modify the getter and setter so for example i could log how many times the field has been set even by the owning class

6951229
getter	setter
where hiddenvalue is the member that is only accessible in the getter and setter

6951294
post	get
what worries me about this implementation is when i pull a list say ten post and 9 are over the time limit i would have to get another list and if there are post over the limit in that list i would have to get more ..

6951314
public	protected
only public protected and package-level methods and fields will be directly accessible to the child class

6951380
keydown	keyup
using sendkeys pinvoke it s possible to do this by sending alt keydown event tab keydown then tab keyup then alt keyup

6951380
keydown	keyup
if you want to do multiple tabs alternate the tab keydown and keyup while keeping the alt on keydown

6951381
folder	directory
what i ended up doing was just moving it out of the public directory into my home folder

6951432

i have the ability now thanks to some pointers in the right direction to place the correct pictures with the correct post but i would like to actually drop them into the text based on where i put the tag in the post itself

6951539
for-loop	loops
everything works fine but in the for-loop it only execute once transfer only one folder and then break out loops

6951546
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you have a one-to-many list on one side and a many-to-one on the other side you should be able to let the list control the relationship so that nhibernate can take care of setting the index values for you

6951546
set	bag
collections like bag list set etc

6951546
many-to-one	one-to-many
if they exist in conjunction with another relationship however like your traditional one-to-many many-to-one they should be specified as

6951548
serializable	deserialization
implement some interface for serializable deserialization which you can use as a parameter to the static method to lessen the dependency between the serializable deserializeton process and the class

6951548
serializable	deserialization
just implement your serializable deserialization interface accordingly

6951563
hash	salt
i want everything to use a unique salt that i will store along side the hash in the mongo document

6951655
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter for stream is spaces so when the stream encounters a spaces it simply stops reading that is why it reads only one word

6951661
division	multiplication
if you want multiplication and division to have higher precedence 2+3 5 gives 17 you d need to create a stack and hold operators and temporary intermediate values and some other complexity

6951664
client-side	server-side
you cannot do this as javascript is a client-side language and ruby is a server-side language

6951675
keydown	keyup
if the text shows up before keyup then it s probably triggered in keydown event

6951680
put	get
this is the degree character from a website but when i put that into my model i get the dreaded invalid byte sequence in utf-8 error

6951751
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and apparently the latest versions of firefox too reduce the speed of setinterval when the tab is in the background to improve foreground performance

6951751
setinterval	settimeout
use repeated settimeout instead of setinterval with some type of repeated settimeout like this

6951752
uiview	subviews
if you have uiview i would imagine at least one uiviewcontroller then you could for instance design view a in interface builder adding view b as a subviews on top of view a

6951752
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you used uiviewcontroller and had a uinavigationcontroller you could set a s view controller as the root view controller and simply push b s view controller

6951769
stdout	stderr
the reason for the error mail is that the mta thinks there was an error if the executed program has written something on stdout or stderr i m not shure - this is what php does when it is emitting a warning

6951818
google-chrome	firefox
it also has mozilla firefox and google-chrome and are almost equal in functionality to the windows versions more or less

6951818
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so my suggestion is try this with a linux flavor such as ubuntu or linux mint

6951839
client-side	server-side
but if you need a certain value to exist in both the server-side where your rails is and client-side where your js is you would probably be better off storing that value in the server-side

6951865
ubuntu	centos
i would however argue that ubuntu or centos is a better option when it comes to server installations

6951899
post	get
and thus gives a 405 error but without the auth info on my post request i get a 403 error

6951947
mezzanine	cartridge
mezzanine which integrates cms+blog and cartridge as shopping cart application

6951947
django-cms	mezzanine
both combinations are nice although not perfect...at the moment there is problem integrating released versions of django-cms zinnia due to their usage of non-compatible versions of django-mptt or mezzanine is missing some features like linkback support in blog etc

6951947
rss	feed
rss feed

6951947
django	web2py
considering the features we would like to have our non experience working with any framework which one - django or web2py - you consider is more suitable in terms of ease of learning ease of use application support etc

6951949
rtp	sip
i am trying to develop an application in which a sip call is established and then i am capturing rtp audio packets

6952002
onclick	onchange
in your php code for the event try onclick or onchange to trigger the delete

6952025
setinterval	settimeout
i d favour using settimeout repeatedly over using setinterval - so many things can go wrong with setinterval and you don t know how busy the browser is and whether the interval is realistic

6952032
int	double
number data types db2 has many more standard types such as smallint int double etc

6952086
post	get
one thing i would suggest you change is the get method change it to post

6952113
hide	show
everytime you refresh it will show the ajax spinner and when the dom is ready it hide the ajax spinner

6952137
put	get
from there i have get that path and put it in bitmap bitmap bitmapfactory.decodefile filepath

6952160
gitolite	gitosis
gitosis or its more uptodate version gitolite always manage bare repos to allow any user they authorize to push to without worrying about a working tree not in sync with the index

6952160
redmine	gitolite
for example it uses gitolite areponame where gitolite is a ssh shortcut defined in your config file see here for an example of config file try using a full ssh uri scheme ssh user host port path and check that address works both from your workstation and from the redmine server

6952254
google-chrome	firefox
i got stuck in an issue i wrote following css for showing page breaks in my html but i am facing the problem that it works fine in the internet explorer but not working in firefox and google-chrome below is the inline css i applied

6952296
inherited	subclassing
example a person object has 2 subclassing called parent and child both subclassing have the same hierchical structure as they inherited person therefore this is a valid type conversion

6952326
stdout	stderr
cron reads the stdout stderr of the command that gets executed if something is written then cron sends an e-mail

6952326
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr and stdout to dev null that means append to your cron command

6952349
switching	screens
this way you will have the back button act as it should be and it would be easier for you to handle when switching screens

6952424
int	double
i need a algorithm to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers that are way above range of float double int or any other data type for that matter

6952456
ant	maven
here s how the maven ant task works

6952458
portrait	landscape
i want to be able to develop in such a way that in any phone with any screen size in any view mode portrait or landscape my page should align itself accordingly and all should be seen

6952493
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are more lenient here

6952539
width	height
use relative layout and don t specify height width instead use fill_parent or wrap_content which ever is appropriate.you can show your code for more clarity

6952543
free	malloc
also it seems you were leaking memory you malloc d but never free d and your myarray wasn t released

6952546
implements	extends
but when i create a class that extends activity and implements sensorlistener it doesn t work

6952570
width	height
resolution in pixel width x height

specifically when the user has already accepted the eula in a previous versioning the eula hasn t changed in the versioning being upgrade to manually set by me and the app is being upgrade

6952759
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and i assume debian that would be

6952804
ssl	spdy
update if you are living on the edge turn on the spdy to boost the ssl connection

6952820
udp	tcp
like that used for tcp udp communication

6952828
int	boolean
call onlayout boolean changed int left int top int right int bottom

6952853
hide	show
then inherit all your other views from that base class and you ll still have the button label to show hide or update as necessary

6952870
tostring	string.format
you can override the tostring method so that string10 can be used in string.format and friends you could even define a widening implicit conversion to system.string so that you can use string10 with apis that expect a system.string

6952914
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu systems have bin sh linked to the dash executable

6952948
visualvm	yourkit
if you want to reduce how much garbage you produce i suggest you profile your application with something like visualvm or yourkit

6953019
loops	if-statement
and get it out of the two while loops right at the beginning of the if-statement

6953060
pop-up	dialog
i have a pop-up dialog cdialog that handles wm_ctlcolor message to color itself

6953060
pop-up	dialog
one idea is to put the controls as the children of an intermediate dialog that is the child of the original pop-up dialog

6953064
ddms	adb	ddms	adt
android has the 100 linux file system.the adb tool shows the correct file structure its the ddms adt in particular which is not showing all the directories due to some reasons probably security reasons

6953133
google-chrome	firefox
other rules on the page work fine and firefox google-chrome show the correct layout

6953170
children	parent
it can be a textview or a more complex layout and that both for parent and children

6953203
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to do a preg_match on an arrays of strings using a for-loop but it s only returning the filtered result for the final item in the arrays

6953205
mouse	keyboard
i would like to know if there is a keyboard shortcut that would move between spring config and its classes icon on editor outline with mouse click

6953212
typedef	struct
by prefixing it with typedef you are changing the way the declaration works and defining instead the type name instead of an instance of the struct

6953266
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome but does not on firefox 3.6.18

6953274
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m working on an app that has a uitabbarcontroller at the bottom and uinavigationcontroller at the top of the screen

6953281
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome firefox and safari

6953285
put	get
i know this will get a lot of traditional answers but i would also like to put forward something completely original we tried and succeeded doing ourselves for more efficient localisation of silverlight using attached properties instead of binding

6953291
uiview	subviews
i changed it to a uiview and then added uiscrollview as its subviews

6953315
maven	pom.xml
this pom.xml would have a snapshot dependency on the maven artifacts created in the 2nd step

6953336
for-loop	arrays
range based for-loop is created as the c++ counterpart for foreach in java that allows easy iteration of arrays elements

6953338
client-side	server-side
now it s unlikely that you ll find a public smtp server that lets you do this and if you really don t have access to anything server-side whatsoever no webserver no control over any smtp server then you ll need to rely on the client-side mailto links instead

6953373
portrait	landscape
the layout from portrait and landscape are totally difference so it can t be solve by using uiautoresizingmask

6953383
hive	hdfs
in hive there s bucketed map join but the distribution of the files representing the tables to datanode is the responsibility of hdfs it s not done according to hive clustered by key

6953389
filtering	grouping
if you really wanted to do filtering first then grouping then you are looking at some sort of two pass transform

6953421
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie i m getting

6953442
udp	tcp
for example udp protocol doesn t guarantee delivery and tcp does

as an aside i think you should be handling mouseup rather than mousedown since in windows buttons are clicked when you release the mouse button rather than when you press it

6953614
setinterval	settimeout
mozilla is working on a different way of implementing setinterval and settimeout called requestanimationframe perhaps it could help you solve your problem or atleast hope for future updates that will take care of the problem

postgresql is actually following the sql standard here whilst sqlite and mysql break from the standard

6953627

6953644
postgresql	mysql
have at look at this question - converting mysql select to postgresql

6953681

6953846
gentoo	ubuntu
it seems the latest version of gentoo doesnot need the ubuntu patch

6953902
superclass	subclassing
in this case think about having an intermediate subclassing between your original superclass and your app-specific subclassing one that encapsulates the core functionality and offers a formal protocol to interface with it

6953905
multiplying	add
adjust this result by multiplying with 18.2065 and dividing by 18.0 or using integer arithmetic multiplying by 182065 add 90000 and divide by 180000

6953905
division	multiplication
if you choose the calculation with integer route make sure you are using 64-bit multiplication and division

6953929
equals	gethashcode
in tests we found that in calls to the tolookup extension only gethashcode is used despite providing the implementation for equals

6953950
put	get
i know this will get a lot of traditional answers but i would also like to put forward something completely original we tried and succeeded doing ourselves for more efficient localisation of silverlight using attached properties instead of binding

6953978
width	height
the purpose of using a percentage here for me was in using one gradient to support large and small containers with size appropriate stripes while also auto sizing to either height or width whichever is more appropriate for the specific element

6954046
lme4	nlme
have a look at lmlist from the lme4 or nlme package

6954094
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql both have coalesce function so you can do something like

6954105
filtering	grouping
we use a company called mailchimp for sending out subscriber mails and i questioned them on how to avoid spam filtering especially in the context of essentially an advert out to a large grouping it can be very difficult to avoid them here is their advice and there is lots of it

6954111

but if i put the class difinition to the rails-plugins i get next error message

6954120
internationalization	transliteration	internationalization	translation	translation	transliteration
although ext gettext and ext intl are both related to i18 internationalization gettext deals with translation while intl deals with internationalizing things like number and date display sorting orders and transliteration

6954151
filtering	grouping

6954166
ant	maven
i do this all of the time admittedly using maven not ant but the same principle applies

versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade to the latest versioning 3.1.0 rc where i hoped this would be fixed but unfortunately it hasn t

6954385
equals	gethashcode
so long as you implement equals and gethashcode correctly -- whether in the types themselves or a custom implementation -- then there won t be any problems

6954385
equals	gethashcode
the problem with your example code is that you re not overriding equals and gethashcode at all

6954385
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode correctly or set up an to do so and everything will start working as you expect

6954396

6954397
min	max
min unknown5 celsius max shift

6954512
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if you extend an arrays instance like this make sure you only traverse over its elements with a for-loop not with a for...in loops you should always use for for arrays anyway

6954524
hash	salt
you should store only a salt hash and your editusermodel should have two string properties for password and password confirmation which are not the fields in your table

6954531
post	get
if it is third party web site you are trying to use then you can use httpurlconnection to make get post

6954571
hex	binary
how do i break up the lparam variable look at bit values printing it out in binary hex decimal

6954642

you ll need the correct value but you should be able to refer to it by its int value chars 146

6954661
mouseup	mousedown
i have tried click mousedown mouseup etc

6954674
button	checkbox
when the button is clicked inside flash control it causes redirection or may be postback to the same page but the values typed the user in textbox and checkbox are no longer available

6954714
put	get	post	get	post	put
another way is to have an iframe which points to a https page that can make all kinds get post put etc of ajax calls to the server over https same domain as iframe is on https too

6954722
hide	show
i have a page configured to hide a fileupload control so when you click a button it show the file upload windows and after you choose the file it automatically submits it to the server

6954729
onchange	onkeydown
update here s an alternative using a custom validator that will allow you to enable the submit button on change when the textbox s text is valid - remember this is onchange not onkeydown up so the user must change focus tab off of the textbox before the validator will fire

6954743
wordpress	expressionengine
i have recently migrated my site from expressionengine to wordpress and i m getting a lot of 404 s from the old ee paginated pages

6954775
qapplication	qobject
the native c++ programming is based on raii while qt uses tree objects model mechanism that each qobject should has a parent except for some root objects like the singleton of qapplication and by this way qt manages objects and resources

6954780
superclass	subclassing
in your case if you want the superclass to have and the subclassing to have then i d expect that to work

6954780
superclass	subclassing
the superclass s annotation will be ignored because the annotation machinery will see the subclassing s annotation first and stop looking

6954803
x86	64bit
i know that there s no 64bit version of it and that i need to compile it against x86

6954819
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the very latest versioning 15.01 which appears to have fixed this bug

6954825
versioning	upgrade
you can either upgrade the php versioning on your server or you replace the function call with something similar like

6954827
uilabel	uitextview
i am facing a problem placing a large text into multiple uitextview uilabel

6954827
uilabel	uitextview
assume three boxes are uitextview or uilabel

6954827
uilabel	nsstring	uilabel	uitextview
text will get from server as a complete one nsstring now challenge is to place the text in the boxes uitextview uilabel

6954850
try-catch	exception-handling
note that there is no exception-handling for this condition or application is not crashing without any try-catch

6954851
width	height
you can easily calculate the x and y coordinates of the vertices of a rectangle in 2d space given the center width and height by subtracting adding half the width height from the x y position of the center point

6954853
int	chars
i opened the file in binary mode read the data as chars and did a casting into int so i get the ascii codes

6954902
pull	push	versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade check an early versioning of netbeans7.1 you would get a more complete git support including push pull operations

6954913
int	chars
i think you might have to use unsigned chars and unsigned int to get correct results

6954954
post	get
the editurl would get the input data from the and should post back the id of the new generated row

6954973
implements	extends
enums can not extends but they can implements so if you had multiple month types for different calendars you could do this to keep strong typing

6954997
onresume	onpause
a better approach would be registering a locationlistener in onresume and unregistering it in onpause through locationmanager.requestlocattionupdates and locationmanager.removeupdates respectfully

6955050
switching	screens
so is it possible to do it using uinavigationcontroller...as far i know...navigation control allows switching using stack....so you can come back to previous screens only

6955076
rss	feed
i have seen many deals website which does t provide api and rss feed but still this aggregators scraps data out of them

6955090
cgsize	cgrect
as said in use tex.contentsize as a cgsize or make a cgrect by cgrectmake 0 0 tex.contentsize.width tex.contentsize.height

6955105
client-side	server-side
just because the server-side language is javascript doesnt mean you have control over client-side events

6955147
rss	feed
if the site doesn t provide any api or rss feed it s still possible to extract data from it the old-school way by querying the pages where the info is and extracting the data from the returned html

6955147
lxml	beautifulsoup
in python this could be done using urllib2 or requests for querying pages and lxml or beautifulsoup to extract the data from the html

6955250
free	malloc
see i m using multiple time malloc free

6955250
free	malloc
all malloc are free

qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply
even though checking the qnetworkreply in the finished slot with bool fromcache reply- attribute qnetworkrequest sourceisfromcacheattribute .tobool returned false

6955291
client-side	server-side
with linq - sql the metadata assigned is taken into consideration for both client-side as well as server-side validation

6955352
many-to-many	one-to-many
from there on it should be a simple case of determining if any 1-to-1 one-to-many and many-to-many relations exist between them

6955367
free	malloc
you could wrap malloc and free and count some basic statistics by yourself

6955389
express	node.js
try to look at node.js web middleware frameworks such as connect or express

6955397
mouseleave	mouseenter	hide	show
the menu show hide on mouseenter mouseleave with a toggle button to remove this functionality should a user find it annoying

6955538
chown	chmod
also check for chown and chmod

6955558
portrait	landscape
for different landscape and portrait design use view controllers methods such as

6955623
pop-up	dialog
if for example you pop-up a progress dialog with an animated gif in it when the user click a submit button the gif will freeze if you use the normal behaviour

6955644
textile	asciidoc
i have tried asciidoc no forumlae except for the latex filter but the output is extremely bad with latex output and textile markdown

6955675
for-loop	arrays
i make an application using apis..in that i have to send arrays of image to php api at a time..i don t want to use for-loop to call url again and again

6955700
width	height
i interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case it will use a wider width

6955734
firefox	safari
both the ways seems to work fine with ie firefox and safari browsers

6955783
int	chars
to get a consistent and correct result you can cast the value to unsigned chars before assigning to the int

6955838
subtract	add
i need to extract the time part of the value in to a separate variable and then add subtract time from it

6955866
width	height
set the contentsize of the scroll view to cgsizemake total width of buttons height of one button and enablescrolling to yes

6955886
width	height
i have pictures of constant width 100px but with variable height could be 200px 130px .

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m targetting ie 7+ firefox 3.6+ google-chrome and safari 4+

6955934
outputstream	inputstream
if the mp3 file is by business requirement stored outside public webcontent then you may indeed need a servlet for this but the servlet should do absolutely nothing more than getting an inputstream of it in some way and write it unmodified to the outputstream of the httpservletresponse the usual java io way

6955934
content-length	content-type
you only need to set the http content-type header to audio mpeg beforehand and if possible also the http content-length header

6955954
width	height
using the images width height attributes would scale it which you don t want

6955956
folder	directory
the simplest option is to stop tomcat and delete the root folder in the catalina_base webapps directory

6955981
children	parent
events bubble up by default to the element parent so you can attach a single event listener to the parent and all the children will be able to catch that event via their parent listener using event.target

6956111
setcontentview	findviewbyid
that you reference using findviewbyid you must re-reference them again after calling setcontentview

6956160
free	malloc
keil provides the #pragma __use_no_heap which prevents malloc and free calls to be linked

6956160
free	malloc
for some reason the linker still states that malloc and free are being called

6956160
free	malloc
for some reason the only way i can get this to compile is to create a heap space and then allow the malloc and free calls to be compiled into the project

6956160
free	malloc
is it possible in c++ to bypass malloc and free when compiling pure objects

6956174
ubuntu	linux
i have javascript client - executed through node.js and c++ server code running on ubuntu linux and i want this client-server to communicate with each other

6956204
mouseover	mouseout
i don t directly use a mouseover mouseout event on one object because i want the collapsing to be triggered only when the user takes his mouse out of the menu not the expander link

6956233
try-catch	exception-handling
however the problem is that the second try-catch statement keeps throwing an exception-handling even when the internet is back

6956487
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a web app mostly tables and forms loaded from a database that uses ajax to load almost everything and everything works in internet explorer but not in firefox or google-chrome

6956487
google-chrome	firefox
none of the pages load in google-chrome or in firefox

6956524
ubuntu	debian
you should use apache2ctl -v or apache2 -v for newer debian or ubuntu distributions

6956542
autofac	castle-windsor
use dependency injection using any container like castle-windsor autofac etc by providing per request object context

6956595

instead of setting width and height properties of the videoelement set the mediacontainer s width and height to _playerwidth and _playerheight respectively

6956611
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
amplify.store supports ie 5+ firefox 2+ safari 4+ google-chrome opera 10.5+ iphone 2+ android 2+ and provides a consistent api to handle storage cross-browser

6956632
factors	matrix
in the dct-ii section of wiki page it is written that some authors further multiply the x0 term by 1 âˆš2 and multiply the resulting matrix by an overall scale factors which makes the dct-ii matrix orthogonal but breaks the direct correspondence with a real-even dft of half-shifted input

6956765

6956812
uiview	uiwindow
you have a window uiwindow that you add views to uiview

6956818
post	get
get back to my post

6956858
isapi	iirf
passing the rewrite responsibility to iis7 s url rewrite module or any other rewriter such as iconics iirf or helicontech s isapi rewrite means that you can change these rules separately rather than burning them into your code

6956905
post	get
modelstatetotempdata attribute when applied to the post method or even to the whole controller will make any modelstate in a post method be serialized in tempdata and deserialized back in the first get method called after that

6956905
serializable	deserialization	post	get
so you will have post - handling of data error - serializable of modelstate - redirect to get method to display the form - deserialization of tempdata back to modelstate - profit

6956921
post	get
you should post the index action of the home controller to get some more specific answers on your problem

6957008
opera	safari
safari and opera support otf ttf and svg

google-chrome	firefox
i am getting the follow error on the following line in ie8 not in ie9 or google-chrome or firefox

6957358
listview	gridview
you probably have a default id associated with your listview gridview if you created them from a layout file

6957456
lxml	elementtree
handling that should be left to existing mature libraries - for python it s commonly agreed that lxml is the most convenient choice followed by the stdlib elementtree modules by which one lxml module lxml.etree is so heavily inspired that incompabilities are exceptions

6957480
google-chrome	safari
important but there is only a single line of text in the textarea vertically centered google-chrome and safari

6957757
width	height
calculate and set width and height to the needed size

6957788
cpu	affinity
or the opposite you have some low priority tasks you put them all on one cpu then leave the others free for more important tasks using process priority will give you most of this benefit without having affinity but i can imagine some memory heavy cases where it wouldn t

6957800
typedef	struct
in c struct names reside in a different name space than typedef s

6957849
implements	extends
generally speaking extends the class you re wrapping is the wrong way to implements the wrapper pattern especially since you generally want to redefine the interface in the process

6957861
post	get
my off the cuff guess is you are maybe re-populating the list on a post back and that is causing the selected index to get reset

6957884
profiling	debugging
make sure you re building using your team development provisioning profiling and that you allow debugging in your entitlements.plist

6957901
google-chrome	firefox
ie javascript engine sucks on ie 6 and 7 and less so on ie8 but still pretty bad compared to firefox google-chrome etc

6957928
hide	show
secondly you just show hide based off of those values in the select list passing them as id s

6957937
children	parent
the real performance gain is by using only one event handler attached to the parent element and catch the children element generated event with event.target since events bubble up by default in javascript to the outermost parent

6957944
mouse	keyboard
it s selectively ignoring keyboard and mouse input unless that input is the right password

6957961

6958216
int	chars
that is if you instantiate it with chars int short then

thus i implemented the equals and gethashcode methods

6958431
min	max
i m hoping theres soemthing similar to an insert into the array where the primary key is between the min and max value but i m not sure

6958431
min	max
edit solution bulk collect would work for this but it s much easier just to return the min and max values to my program and then just do a separate select in there

6958433
getter	setter
attr_accessor creates the getter method.attribute and setter for the specified attributes

6958450

memcached	apc
cakephp offers support for apc xcache and memcached in addition to its default caching engine

6958475
memcached	apc
xcache and memcached both seem as though they might take a little bit more setup but apc appears to be literally a case of changing one line in the core.php

6958550
modifiers	sealed
editing the il to remove the abstract and sealed modifiers from the class

6958550
modifiers	sealed
if you don t remove the abstract sealed modifiers the c# compiler recognizes it as a static class and gives a different error message

at this point i can only retrieve one value even if there are several children for any given parent

6958968
folder	directory
try to move a directory that is not within your application folder - that should do the trick

6958971
onresume	onpause
a common way to avoid this is to unregister your listener in onpause or onvisibilitychanged false and reregister in onresume or onvisibilitychanged true since you shouldn t react to settings changes when your canvas isn t visible

6958985
google-chrome	firefox
the bookmarket runs on google-chrome and firefox but on ie currently tested only on ie9 i am getting error from the next code

please try your code with another browser and if the problem remains try with a different rails server there are a lot of them passenger unicorn mongrel thin

6959154
implements	extends
should i simply extends the apiclient class implements my logic and then extends my class again to create a mock version

6959165
children	parent
any extension as the documentation clearly states that maintains it s own file descriptors will then have corrupted descriptors because all children an parent share the same file descriptors

6959206
implements	extends
i have implements a custom metadata provider extends associatedmetadataprovider

6959208
irc	xmpp
the irc protocol only uses plaintext as opposed to xmpp for example that uses xml style and is therefore very simple to parse and use

6959214
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
i may have misinterpreted your entity-relationship diagram but it seems that applications servers and environments are all independent entities and an appserver is a unique combination of one each of the three

6959218
switching	screens
then i planed when a view need load i will just add it like subview and remove it switching to another screens

6959219
children	parent
yes that is correct - the children share the same file descriptors as the parent

6959290
button	checkbox
now unmark the checkbox then click on the button

6959322
profiler	shark
use mac os x and get the free xcode developer tools from apple xcode 3.x and also the free chud performance tools package which includes shark a very good sampling profiler which you will find extremely useful

6959324
int	chars
although as you ve seen here you are specifically not allowed to define a chars enum because there is no implicit conversion from chars to any other integral type there is an integral conversion from chars to int so you can do this

6959338
opera	firefox
here s a function that will work in ie 4 and browsers that support getclientrects in range firefox 4 webkit since 2009 opera

6959360

6959474
width	height
set the image view s frame to have a max width and height of the screen s dimensions depending on the current orientation

6959517
width	height
width and height is important because your website will not be resized after loading the picture but imiedietely will reserve some space

6959610
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using the console in safari google-chrome or firefox firebug

6959622
hide	show
then i d like to be able to click on a line in the diary to expand collapse it hide show details

6959647
filtering	grouping
this way you can still apply sharepoint s default filtering grouping by etc behaviour and you actually don t need to code anything yourself -

6959650
rss	feed
this is a very handy feature and i was wondering if there is a kind of api available to access the rss or atom feed as displayed by google reader

6959672
ecj	javac
also note that it is useful to specify which compiler you used - javac or ecj eclipse compiler for java

6959676
mouse	keyboard
so if you set breakpoints on keyboard mouse and control events then chrome will step into the appropriate js code if any that fires on those events

6959692
getter	setter
i am using an api which requires lot of getter and setter and then perform the operation

6959692
getter	setter
is there any template based generation of java code which reads apis setter getter and generate code

6959692
getter	setter
so i want to keep the common code in the template and generated getter or setter code based on api

6959706
width	height
i have got the basic functionality to work by having my thumbnail class generate a thumbnail that is 50 of the width and height of the original image

6959710
getter	setter
if you are creating a properties you should synthesize so the compiler will automatically generate getter and setter methods for us and if you are doing custom initialization then you need to remember self keyword

6959738
google-chrome	firefox
this approach is working for me in ie9 running in ie7 browser mode as well as the current versions of google-chrome and firefox

6959776
int	chars
all that we are storing in those variables are at most a 6 chars string or a single digit int

6959787
getter	setter
in eclipse you just select your field and do a right click source generate getter and setter

6959787
getter	setter
you add the skeleton of your class with some dummy fields and getter setter and you just replace the names and delete the extra ones

6959799
jpql	hql
i try to convert my sql query into hql or jpql i want to benefit of the object mapping

6959802
inherited	subclassing
in your example you can simply declare the relationship in its own class note it does not inherited from you declarative_base class and then inherited it in any subclassing something like this

6959807
put	get
i have a list of files stored in db which i get using linq i want to put them in asp listview or something better for this case if you can suggest

6959814
mouse	keyboard
i would like to add an option to an application to make them always visible to make it easier to use mouse and keyboard in combination mouse to point and open a specific context menu keyboard to execute a certain item on that menu

6959818
uiwebview	uimenuitem
i m using my own uimenuitem a bookmark button in a uiwebview

6959829
switching	screens
in this way when you start the activity without launch parameter you always fall into the default switching case and never need to set the main preference screens

6959858
getter	setter
for example if you are using eclipse you can make code templates for new classes snippets where you plug in a few variables to generate a block of code or generate getter and setter based on your existing class variables

6959869
textview	imageview
i replaced the imageview and the textview with a datepicker and a timepicker

6959918
equals	tostring	getter	setter	tostring	getter
you put an annotation data on the class and it writes the getter and setter for you as well as equals hashcode tostring

6959918
getter	setter
to expand on this a bit the getter and setter do not show up in your code anywhere

6959918
getter	setter
lombok generates the getter and setter as bytecode during the compilation process

6959930
audiotrack	audiorecord
i tried to use audiorecord and audiotrack to do this but the problem is that my device cannot play the recorded audio file

6959972
ready	each
before a release we take all of the issues that are ready and put them all on rc together where we make sure that tickets don t cause problems with each other

6959984

spaces	delimiter
from this index expand check the characters to the left and right and stop when you reach a delimiter - spaces coma etc. to get the word under

6960005
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
also it is important to note that getelementbyid returns a dom node while getelementsbytagname returns a nodelist

6960185
folder	directory
or if not - to which directory except the temp folder do i have write access

6960214
pull	push
hopefully this one is pretty obvious creates an object that i m going to push data i pull from the database into

6960214
put	get
get a specific row from the database put the info into a row object see row.h

6960217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however my code still works in firefox google-chrome and safari

6960250
rss	feed
i am reading a rss feed using setinterval method and displaying notification to the users i want to make sure i store the latest feed title so that the user does not get multiple notification of the same title again

6960255
post	get
a full example here get urls captions titles for images attached to post in wordpress

6960288
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed google-chrome and firefox also do it

6960295
apache	nginx
in my case i want to use foo bar as my static directory but couldn t find any info related to configuring this other than running apache or nginx locally

6960369
onresume	onpause	oncreate	ondestroy
you have both an oncreate and onresume method available to you as well as onpause and ondestroy

6960386
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the usb ports on tf101 system only supports the external storage devices like flash drive or hdd with usb cable filesystems needs to be fat fat32 ntfs

6960405
nsmutablestring	nsstring
methodb calls copy in case the nsstring returned from methoda is actually a nsmutablestring

6960500
firefox	safari
however in every other major browser that natively supports websockets firefox v6.0b yes i did turn on websockets functionality safari v5.1 it can t connect for some reason

6960500
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari it goes straight to the onclose function and never connects

6960500
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i believe google-chrome 14.x implements the draft 10 spec of hybi websockets and i think firefox 6 implements draft 07 or 08 and i m not sure about safari 5.1

6960524
folder	directory
the package gets created fine and is put in the obj release packages folder under my source directory for the project file

6960568
children	parent
the classes use aggregation and inheritence parent lists the children as modules and each child specifies parent as its parent

6960568
children	parent	maven-javadoc-plugin	pom.xml
i want to invoke maven-javadoc-plugin aggregate-jar in the parent pom.xml to generate a single javadoc folder with the combination of the children s sculpted javadocs but it doesn t appear to be working

6960579
width	height
look for glviewport and related calls and make sure they are using the backing width and height and not the view or layer width and height

6960605
debian	linux
i ve written a google chrome extension and i m noticing that the extension works on my linux desktop but not my linux laptop both running the chromium 13.0.782.107 r94237-1 in debian unstable

6960645
mbunit	mstest
i will like to swap-in sql ce 4.0 as executed from mstest or mbunit

6960645
mbunit	mstest
my intention is to generate the edmx for ce use from a pre-build event in my mstest or mbunit project

6960646
width	height
place the duplicated content into another element and set the visible width height and overflow hidden

6960651
post	put
what i m trying to do is have a featured post area filled with whichever post i put in the featured featured2 categories

6960666
django	web2py
both django and web2py are very good frameworks in my opinion

6960666
django	web2py
that being said having not used frameworks i would say to with web2py unless you need certain modules that only exist in the django world

6960666
django	web2py
i don t think there is anything that web2py can do that django can t except db migrations -- but i think you can make django do them with some 3rd party code or vice versa

6960666
django	web2py
django favors a explicit is better than implicit development methodology which requires to you import various modules and doesn t have all the magic of web2py

6960666
django	web2py
i m not saying this is in contrast to django but rather that web2py is very strong on this point

6960666
django	web2py
i also prefer web2py s templating language to django s as it allows pure python and does not require one to learn a separate templating language at all

6960666
internationalization	localization
i think both frameworks have decent internationalization localization features

6960666
django	web2py
django vs web2py for a beginner developer

6960772
rsa	aes
instead of encrypting messages with rsa most protocols generate a key for a symmetric cipher like aes and encrypt the message with that

6960791
put	get
i just put null for that following some tutorial i found somewhere but i still get a compile error

6960799
hash-collision	key
the hashcode method on the other hand is used to optimize lookups but cannot be relied on to compare equality of two key as there is the possibility of hash-collision

6960799
hash-collision	key
in the event of hash-collision among key a single bucket will store two or more values for two different key and the bucket must be traversed sequentially to find the value matching the key which is the worst case

6960822
filesystems	ntfs
but it should give you some idea about the relative efficiencies of filesystems ntfs vs database mssql

6960845
google-chrome	firefox
in dev mode i can successfully open the app in firefox and google-chrome

6960853
post	get
without the try catch block i can see the post get and server variables in my error_log but with the try catch block i only see the default php error

6960853
post	get
is there a way to have php include post get and server variables for all errors that get logged to file and not just wherever i have added error_log print_r _post true

6960894
disk	ram
however loading the information into the session variables requires reading a file off of your servers file system and into ram which depending on many factors disk speed io load db speed etc might be slower or faster than reading the same information from a db

6960930
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

6960943
hibernate	gilead
i m building an application with gwt hibernate and gilead and i m attempting to make an rpc call that loads a list of lightentity objects from the database

6960950
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you need unchecked-exception or exceptions that extend the runtimeexception class

6960963
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i know it only has one edittext area but that s because i need help adding two more and being able to use them as integers to add subtract divide multiplying

6960977
put	get
i tried to use php to get all of the information and use it later like put it in a txt file or just import into a database

6961022
width	height
it doesn t appear that textnodes in javascript have a height or width so far as i can tell

6961022
width	height
i m building an app that breaks html into pages epub html actually and i need to know the position height and width of each block of text on the page so i can know whether to put it on this page or the next page

6961080
x86	64bit
after an entire wasted day the solution is to set your vs project to any cpu in advanced compile options because if set to x86 and running on a 64bit os you are limited to the wow6432node in the registry

6961105
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

6961128
folder	directory
you need to put the config file for ion auth into the main application s config folder not in the ion auth directory

6961129
width	height
thus it has an absolute width and height that can be retrieved by javascript

6961131
opera	firefox
domattrmodified works in ie9 opera firefox and not regrettably in all others as dr.molle suggests

6961131
google-chrome	safari
everything else - must resort to setinterval loop that checks if value changed this includes webkit browsers google-chrome and safari since they still don t have domattrmodified support so - you ll have to resort to loop check for those browsers

6961138
width	height
and added a sudo-hard coded height and width for the container as a variable

6961147
hide	show
wrap the ul and div and then show hide the wrapper instead of the ul

6961163
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in the body i have the full slideshow javascript which works great in firefox safari and google-chrome

6961173
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 aurora build prefixed with moz but enabled by default support the hybi-10 version of the protocol

6961185
post	get
check that out and infer the problem from what you find post what you find if you cannot get a solution from that

6961217
jobs	cron
i need to write an algorithm that will only do a small chunk of the jobs on cron at a time so it doesn t overload my server etc

6961268
put	get
if you can t get rid of it you should at least put an empty script tag first in the code that you can control

6961387
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
anyways the code for ie firefox and safari work fine but i have tried everything that i could think of with opera and it just will not see markers as an object

6961387
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
as you can see there are no errors reported in ie safari and firefox but opera is a different ball game

6961387
firefox	safari
some warnings in safari for the svgs returned by google and some css warnings in firefox but 0 errors

6961431
superclass	subclassing
also since the error mentions the class domainobject which i assume is your global superclass i would try to make it implement serializable or isserializable too in addition to its subclassing

6961473
disk	ram
upgrade hardware faster disk faster cpu more ram

6961476
opera	firefox
then using a browser-based keybind in my case with opera although examples for firefox uzbl acrobat and conkeror are provided as well i was able to capture the following

6961506
google-chrome	firefox
it happens when using google-chrome but not firefox

6961512
prepare	execute
i tend to lean towards the first option since coldfusion willi prepare the statement and execute it immediately as opposed to store the value locally and then having coldfusion prepare the sql statement

6961538
mouse	keyboard
it has many other features to it like detecting keyboard mouse inputs drawing images and much much more useful for programming games too

6961567
put	get
when i put both the .php and the .pem onto my android phone in the same folder and tried to run it with the same wifi connection i get the following error message

6961628
post	get
first off you ought to use a post request instead of a get because it s clear from your code that this request is supposed to change state on the server

6961661
button	checkbox
but it happens rather often that i click a button realize that i forget to check a checkbox and so i click it but to no avail

6961688
django	web2py
plus moving from a php mvc framework to web2py or even django would make things easier

6961691
mdpi	hdpi
following the 3 4 6 scale ratio rule it seems that if i have a button resource that s 100px wide for the mdpi density i should make another button for the ldpi density that s 75px and one for the hdpi density that s 150px

6961699
button	checkbox
when you open the dialog the checkbox do not take effect until you hit an update button if you click cancel or just close the window the changes you made get reverted and the dialog is set to its former state

6961793
google-chrome	firefox
i m getting a messed up result in firefox and google-chrome didn t test in others yet

6961801
ubuntu	linux
original setup node a arch linux open mpi 1.4.3 node b ubuntu open mpi

6961832
x86	64bit
now i didn t encounter errors when i tried to load an .so file compiled and linked without the -fpic gcc option on 32bit x86 computers while it fails on 64bit bit x86 computers

6961838
super	implements
pagination was super easy to implements but the sorting has proven to be a nasty challenge

6961894
google-chrome	firefox
if it s ok for this feature preview image upload to only work in modern browsers latest firefox google-chrome for example you can try using the file api in html5

6961895
hide	show
you can basically find the scrollheight whenever you show hide any content on the page or add any dynamic content on the page to any container

6961928
filtering	grouping
i m posting this because while it does the opposite some of it is still useful particularly the filtering for getting grouping from ldap since that s the same whether reading or writing and it uses python-ldap

6961949
cobertura	emma
if you want to see that all methods of a test subject are exercised by a particular test class you can run the test under a code coverage tool like emma or cobertura and ensure the results are to your liking

6961982
getter	setter
make a data layer class that corresponds directly to your user table s columns with all public getter setter a parameterless constructor and no behavior

temp	tmp
i ve got a solution with about 40 wpf and class library projects and it hasn t improved when i launch visual studio in an environment whose temp tmp are pointed to the ramdisk

6962262
temp	tmp
so i m thinking these temp tmp environment variables don t influence the temp folders used when c# is compiling wpf and class library projects

6962269

you should not be setting the transfer-encoding chunked header yourself if you are actually not writing out the file using chunked encoding yourself using for example chunkedoutputstream

6962497
pull	push
in mercurial if you want to push or pull from a repository you could just type the following

6962497
pull	push
i would like to ask mercurial to push or pull against a repository at path to repository on the server corresponding to my ssh config entry host_nickname

6962502
inherited	properties
you can only use the inherited keyword alone as a value for the properties and even then the use of inherited isn t appropriate here

6962509
nhibernate	queryover
i don t understand why the code below not compile on the queryover line i tried wih nhibernate 3.1 and 3.2

6962512
pop-up	dialog
the setup involves a dialog that pop-up with a text field that needs to be filled in and an enter button to press once you re done

6962888
free	malloc
2 provide your own malloc and free to make linker happy then repeat step 1

6962888
free	malloc
in the worst case if number of calls to malloc free is limited you can roll out your own version which will give the callers some preallocated memory - but hopefully this will not be neccessary

6962954
submit	submission
when your edit user form is submission it will automatically submit phone fields too

6963008
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox ie definitely can get the value though google-chrome will only tell you the filename with c fakepath prepended

6963013
xuggle	vlcj
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.

6963106
min	max
i ve tried various combinations of group by min date max date etc

6963172
google-chrome	safari
the html output uses to bold the word which is somewhat unfortunate it s in safari google-chrome but nonetheless does the job

6963208
slideup	slidedown
i d advice you to look specifically at the slideup and slidedown effects although special consideration must be taken about how the library modifies particular css values of the elements you wish to animate and how it affects the rest of the html

6963297
havok	physx
windows only at this point in time so physx havok are possibilities for the simulation but i would prefer a managed solution

6963383
post	get
so the issue here is that earlier the ajax request for the flag functionality on blogs message board portlets was post and after this update it changed to get

6963383
post	get
please help to us to understand what triggered this change from post to get and how to change is back to post

macports	homebrew
you can also use a separate package manager like homebrew or macports to install libraries and dependencies for gems which need to be compiled

6963458
versioning	upgrade
if you have a current software maintenance contract for your matlab it may well be that the easy thing to do is just upgrade to the next versioning of matlab since r2011a is out now unless there is some compelling reason why you must develop on r2010b

6963498
groupbox	panel
now put this whole panel inside a groupbox

6963498
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
i think i have to handle the mousedown mouseup mousemove on the panel to set the autoscrollposition so that when someone touches the panel and drags it does it s scroll magic

6963507
pop-up	dialog
java applets if signed and set up properly can get access to the local filesystem if the user clicks allow on the pop-up dialog box

6963507
pop-up	dialog
flash and silverlight being built by intelligent beings do not allow you access to the local filesystem -- and if they did they would also have a dialog pop-up asking if the user trusts the web app

6963532
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
does nspopupbutton or nsmenu handle that somehow

6963538
ostream	istream
at this line on istream ostream

6963587
portrait	landscape
i use an if statement to detect when the orientation of a device changes and when it does a new view is displayed one portrait the other landscape

6963587
portrait	landscape
the only problem is if i rotate from portrait to landscape and the landscape view shows it has not rotated all of the way

6963596
visualvm	jstat
when i start jstat then visualvm sees a local jstat but when i double click on it it just seems to monitor that jstat process and not any other java process

6963603
lisp	scheme
this guy reckons that adding fexprs to lisp dramatically simplifies the implementation of the language in scheme

6963647
hash	md5
the best way is to get some hash md5 and compare it

6963649
getter	setter
now firstly i don t see why a regular moose hash trait couldn t accept array refs for both the setter and getter

6963661
post	put
i m able to read the website with the code i put at the end of this post

6963673
zsh	tcsh

6963678
x86	64bit
microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable package x86 probably what you need for 32-bit and 64bit os

6963700
int	chars
this code works nicely in linux32 where memset accepts 32-bit int s as second argument initializing element but it s not so for linux64 where and iirc in other platforms where memset accepts chars as its second argument

6963792
int	boolean
in this exercise we will represent sets as functions from int to boolean

6963796
ostream	istream
i think you should not alloc and init the istream and ostream variables

6963817
implements	extends
i m implements a semi-duplicate rails pipeline by refactoring an existing ruby class say a which extends activerecord to have a module say m with common functionality then to be mixed into two similar ar classes now shallow wrappers

i have a listbox with 20 items.if orientation is portait the margin of the grid must be 140 25 5 0 and width of stackpanel inside 320

6963898
uiview	subviews
i d venture to guess that it s an extension of uiimageview or even a uiview container that adds a subviews containing the check mark when it detects a tap

6963931
children	parent
sometimes i process a parent tag that contains children that i want to prevent from being processed in a later recursion

6963931
children	parent
i then tried this which works in that it removes the parent and its children but doesn t result in any subsequent siblings of the parent from being skipped affected as well

6964005
post	get
you can t redirect using existing post or files data only get the url query string

6964013

width	margin
because left and right column width is 160 px they have a left and right margin of 10-10px thats extra 20 px

6964099
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
for this you have a few options - for pre-implemented methods you could try the java serializable objectoutputstream objectinputstream or the xmlencoder xmldecoder

6964099
decoder	encoder
you might also look into other xml or json libraries or even writing your own encoder decoder if the events are simple enough

6964103
int	boolean
somehow we ve got to produce a boolean when all we have to work with are sets a b of type and int equality

6964103
int	boolean
from these primitives the only way to get a boolean value is to start with int values

6964134
fadein	hide
jquery functions such as hide or fadein or other transformation functions take an optional callback parameter to accomplish this

6964275
vim	emacs
i want to draw stuff either on emacs or vim or even in the terminal directly

6964284
button	checkbox
the idea is simple since normal input fields including radio button checkbox textareas etc can only be styled to a small degree they have to be hidden and their visual appearance replaced with similar working new fully customizable constructs

6964290
post	get
in my controller action method for the post i can get the values of the dropdowns like this

6964310
min	max	range	max	range	min
you could try using a lookup table to get rid of the calculation of s since min and max can only range from 0 to 255

6964317
hide	show
you could use a js library such as jquery to hide show elements on a page

6964325
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note this works for firefox google-chrome and safari but not ie

6964339

i recommend not limiting yourself to one processor family avr arm msp430 etc nor one chip vendor lpc atmel ti etc

6964371
kde	gnome

6964434
strlen	strcpy
i understand the error is happening because strlen does not count the trailing null whereas strcpy adds it

6964443
client-side	server-side
edit for clarity i m talking about a server-side solution as the client-side aspects of this are working fine

6964449
memcpy	strdup
consider using either strdup if you need the trailing null or memcpy if you don t need the trailing null

6964485
intersect	contains
for not to intersect the 3d array is used with flags this point of space contains a pipe

6964494
libreoffice	uno
the openoffice and libreoffice calc filter use all uno and are dependent on the calc core design

6964495
put	get
for some reason this little code is preventing the user from being able to check the actual checkbox and having it put the checkmark inside of it and the only way to get it checked is to click the row

6964540
hide	show
i had a jquery code to hide show this menu and somewhere in it i used event.stoppropagation which accidentally prevented unobtrusive javascript from changing the hyperlink method to post

6964550
put	get
in the handler for the ok button on the dialog you should get the textbox.gettext and put it back into a public cstring member m_inputstring

6964558
firefox	safari
here is the full example how to do that works in safari firefox ie iphone andorid works with rotation

6964596
dlsym	dlopen
i d like to get a compile time binding of symbols that normally would be done by a dlopen dlsym

6964596
dlsym	dlopen
however there could be collisions which are nicely avoided by the dlopen dlsym

6964623
hide	show
you could switch to using live or delegate for binding your click event or better imho use two separate buttons and hide show them as needed

6964651
pycharm	komodo
pycharm komodo or wingware should all fit the bill as well

6964680

nsstream is generally the way to go with device discovery through nsnetservice nsnetservicebrowser bonjour

6965288

uiview	subviews
the problem is because of the frame size of your testviewcontroller and method for adding the uiview as a subviews of the uiactionsheet

6965310
button	checkbox
when i click in a checkbox the button will enabled

6965310
button	checkbox
if checkbox is checked button should be enable

6965351
folder	directory
i m attempting to get the directory of res raw so that i can use listfiles to make an array containing all the files in the raw folder so that i may get the file names and sort which files i will use or not through there names as i can then access them through r.raw.concat fileiwanttoaccess but i need to be able to read all the files in the folder so that i can decide which i use

6965355
for-loop	loops
to my mind a for-loop is simpler to understand than traversing the list backwards with a while loops

sorting	filtering
after experiencing some rather bad performance whilst sorting and filtering on these attributes from matches left join attributes_i_want on primary index i decided to try to improve it

6965635
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering performance increased a lot for easy queries

ienumerable	iqueryable
you should also check if ienumerable object is iqueryable indeed and cast it to latter type before using extension methods skip and take

6965649

you can also move it around when you tap and drag anywhere except on the close button

6965829
free	malloc
free should be used with malloc so you shouldn t be using free on something you allocated with new

6965843
mouse	keyboard
installing a mouse keyboard hook just to find the idle time of the user strikes me as conceptually wrong

first thing to do is not generate the routes you do not want get users new and post users you can do that by changing your routes to

6965970
post	get
post back with more details if you get stuck again

mouseover	mouseout
this method works for well for mouseover and mouseout effects when you just want to show state but is sadly useless when you want to animate the opacity

...was altered between versioning when you upgrade from say java 1.4 to java 5 you d have all sorts of weird things going on potentially causing bugs where the code didn t behave in the same way as previously

6966452
getter	setter
it would be better to not expose the label directly but create getter setter functions for properties of the label - encapsulation

6966460

make sure getter and setter are available for your car

one difference is that by defining a metaclass __call__ method you are demanding that it gets called before any of the class s or subclassing s __new__ methods get an opportunity to be called

6966909
metaclass	subclassing
in contrast if you define foo.__new__ without a metaclass you allow subclassing to override foo.__new__

post	get
so instead i tried to use wmi code taken from another post on here but here i get an privilege not held error when trying to call invokemethod

but i read a guide to getter setter and properties online which has lead me to believe that instead this is right

6967056
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter and mouseleave events are bound to the object you bind hoverintent to

6967081
hide	show
i want to use some buttons to show hide multiple divs using jquery

6967109
xslt	xquery
normally you just need a transformation from the documents into another form for this many languages provide an interface to xslt and xquery

6967125
hide	show
if you want to be able to show hide singular divs and or groups of divs with less code just apply several classes to them to insert them into groups if needed

6967137
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization of a struct to a char in c

6967162
folder	directory
after long while of trying i was able to understand that the duplicates referred to are the duplicate files in the output directory one of the android android-classes folder and maven output classes folder

6967254
ttabsheet	tpanel
example i just dropped few tpanel from pallete to my form inside of a ttabsheet

6967335
width	height
note that you might want to add width and height values too but not height to the #content of course

6967401
getter	setter
the best way is to use synthesize which will create a getter and a setter to with respect to the properties you wrote in your property nonatomic retain not threadsafe but fast getter and setter and a retaining and also releasing setter

6967403
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout setinterval callback is executed in a different context than your object and when it s executed the this keyword does not refer to your object

6967403
setinterval	settimeout
the right way to pass variables to a cabback functin for settimeout setinterval is something like

6967436
opera	firefox
the differences are on all browsers firefox ie opera

6967476
button	checkbox
you must notice that when a custom listview contains focusable elements such as button or checkbox the method onlistitemclick may not work i think it s the expected behaviour

6967480
int	chars
if the string does not contain any of the chars . e or e and the numeric value fits into int type limits as defined by php_int_max the string will be evaluated as an int

6967489
prepare	execute
i noticed that if i prepare a multi-insert statement and execute it into mysql via pdo and then request the last_insert_id i get the first id of the multiple inserted rows not the last one

6967548
superclass	subclassing
whatever you want to do in mymethod consider having a method for it in superclass provide a meaningful default implementation or make it abstract to force subclassing to implement the method and call this method on s in your method

6967585
int	boolean
with the boolean on the left implicitly converted to an int

6967630
profiling	debugging
while developing i used the debugging profiling in visual studio 2008

6967647
int	chars
where all names with even number of chars get 2 null chars to make it even and then the next two bytes store a short int

6967675
int	boolean
with primitive types such as boolean and int the actual value is passed to the panel and not a reference and so changing these values in the panel wont affect the rest of the program

6967675
int	boolean
another solution would be to encapsulate all the int and boolean types in a object but i don t really want to do this as it would mean a lot of rewriting of code in the main program

6967704
put	get
you will then need to use a for-loop to get the html of all the images or put an id on the image and specify it only in the jquery selector

6967710
google-chrome	firefox
i like firebug for firefox or ctrl-shift-i in google-chrome

6967714
writetofile	nsdata
if you are using nsdata objects then you will need to first write the data using the data object methods such as writetofile atomically

6967722
uitableview	reloaddata
now i can t call reloaddata on the uitableview since it s nil

6967730

6967767
yourkit	jprofiler
jprofiler is my favorite but yourkit is good as well

6967774
webrat	cucumber
as you can see webrat is not so updated anymore so yes you might be better off with integration testing with cucumber + capybara

6967804
int	boolean
with primitive types such as boolean and int the actual value

6967869
int	chars
since int is normally wider than chars truncates the value of int being assigned

6967875
phpmyadmin	heidisql
i would recommend you scrap phpmyadmin for heidisql though

6967910
calloc	malloc
or as griffin said using calloc instead of malloc to allocate and initialize the area at the same time

6967919
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	memset	memset	strncpy
nope consider the memset memcpy or strncpy functions

6967951
width	height
x 32 y 32 width -32 height -32

6967951
width	height
this will make the rectangle x 0 y 0 width 32 height 32

6967954
hash	salt
the server stores salt password hash which will be different from sha1 password

6967965
memcpy	strcpy
this may be because of a careless memcpy strcpy overwriting the stack of newclient

6967965
free	malloc
on another note generally it is recommended that both malloc and free are done in the same thread

6968024
button	checkbox
your best bet is to wrap your checkbox input tag in span obtain a reference to that span and replace the innerhtml with a new button element with important attributes copied over

the h1 h2 and h3 of my site only on local server atm are much bolder in firefox than in google-chrome and safari

6968249
google-chrome	firefox
if i center in firefox it s off in google-chrome if i center in google-chrome it s off in firefox etc

6968300
fadein	fadeout
what you need to use is the fadein and fadeout callback property

6968304
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout
the easiest way to do this is to hide the currently showing gallery rather than fadeout and then fadein the newly selected gallery

6968315
google-chrome	firefox
between google-chrome that returns and firefox that returns

6968370
google-chrome	firefox
this is the same in firefox and in google-chrome

6968381
capistrano	rvm
if you just called require rvm capistrano without the statement you would get an error because by default rvm s capistrano library is not in ruby s load path

6968385
google-chrome	firefox
so from what you say happens it s easy to imagine that in google-chrome the second parameter is being checked with and in firefox they use

6968430
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using hover a shortcut for mouseenter and mouseleave instead and change your selector

6968446
google-chrome	firefox
i have problem because my code working in google-chrome firefox and not working in ie

6968614
cfstring	nsstring
click the arrow next to the cfstring category name to see what s calling the alloc function on nsstring

6968635
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
another way to accomplish this is by making the uitabbarcontroller the rootviewcontroller of a uinavigationcontroller

6968649
width	height
ok i just figured out that the width and height can be set in the css itself which is probably the right way to do it

6968671
email	dkim
you can try mail.dll email component it supports dkim both signing and validation

6968756
post	get
what i m attempting to do is post multiple url s which are exploded by a line break get and then concatenate the contents of all files

6968796
hash	hmac
hmac itself is specified in rfc 2104 and windows can do the sha hash for you with cryptcreatehash crypthashdata and cryptgethashparam

6968842
actionscript	mxml
if you created these elements in mxml yes you would be using the id property to uniquely identify each object when you are using it in actionscript

6968853
min	max
the problem is if your max and min are separated by a small distance for 5-10 your slide will behave in steps because the default step 1 so you need to compute your step based on that

6968861
put	get
just put an expression which gives you a timestamp inside the curly brackets like timestamp time 0 depending of course which api you use to get the time ..

6968905
udp	tcp
it sounds like you are trying to create a system where the implementation of the socket raw udp tcp is totatly hidden from the end-user -- i assume that is why you don t want the other header files to be included

6968915
width	margin
what the client has asked is for the tabs width to be changed with the first tab being lined up with the first thumbnail in the image gallery as it currently is and the last tab being lined upu with the end of the thumbnails in the 3rd column with a 20px margin between them

6969054
put	get
when i echo the variables i get the values i put in but it also emits an error

6969054
stdout	stderr
the first two lines are being emitted to stderr while the next three are being output to stdout

6969105
hide	show
use it to hide show a based on data

6969134
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem is that firefox and google-chrome when it comes to requesting the images on the website they just open up another connection from the same ip but a different port

6969164
joptionpane	jdialog
the jdialog is created by explicitly calling one of jdialog s constructors not by calling one of the methods from joptionpane

6969166
bmp	png
you can now use the image for displaying saving as jpg png bmp whatever you like

6969176

you did not declare the method of your form as post so it uses the get method but you try to get the post values

6969189

imagine i have a viewport with a defined width and height

6969262

it does sudo ls -la and waits for either passwd or username username

6969307
for-loop	loops
to loops over a string you can use a for-loop

6969328
printwriter	bufferedwriter
instead of using a printwriter try an outputstreamwriter wrapped in a bufferedwriter

6969350
uiview	subviews
i am trying to do something very similar to how to tell when a subviews is removed a uiview

6969388
for-loop	loops
the compiler cannot prove that the code path will never leave or even enter the for-loop and so it is expecting to hit a return statement sometime after loops

6969400
portrait	landscape
i want to have a photo gallery that fits landscape portrait photos together doesn t leave any blank space unless of course on the very end of the gallery if necessary

6969469

for example i have a for-loop that parses an arrays that hold value s of a select tag and then my js code created the select with the given values

6969489
width	height
2 i m not sure what height to give #row2 because while i want the whole table to be 100 height width and #row1 to be a little bigger than #row2 - eg 60 40 but i want #row2 to be fixed at a height of 20px

6969504
width	height
here i create two variables one for the screen height and the other for the width

6969504
width	height
so go back to your principal class game1.cs and in the update methode update the value of theses variables with the screen height and screen width like this

6969540
min	max
for every block in your world that could intersect that vector which can be as simple as a 3d loop over a cube of blocks bounded by the min max x y z values for your reach vector cast a ray at the cube if it s not air to see if you hit it

6969552
width	height
you might want to mess about with the width and height etc too

6969583
width	height
here i create two variables one for the screen height and the other for the width

6969605
getter	setter
must have properties available through getter and setter

6969605
abstract-class	superclass
but an abstract-class can be the superclass of a javabean class

use ntlm or kerberos instead

6969703
folder	directory
i want to create two folder on in this directory so i do

6969703
folder	directory
now i thought this would make the directory mnt sdcard my_app some_data but after using a file manager to look at the sd card it turns out that this folder is created at mnt sdcard my_app mnt sdcard my_app some_data which is quite bizarre

6969705
int	chars
then suppose you had 64 chars fields and 64 int fields if you put the chars fields first then all fields of both types can be addressed using the best instructions whereas if you put the int fields first then the chars fields that aren t 4-aligned will just have to be accessed differently perhaps by loading a constant into a register rather than with an immediate value because they re outside the 256-byte limit

6969744
hide	show
now i d like to create a link that hide show these elements on request

6969805
google-chrome	firefox
prior to google-chrome 14.0.833 see this question the text-shadow is rendered more tightly on the text than firefox

tablet	hdpi
if i use drawable hdpi on my tablet i want to eventually make a tablet game everything runs fine and the textures do not have to be recycled

6970174
width	height
what it does is between li items click one to expand with the width and height and click again to reset it back to default

so post is just the html element of the post they then simply get the id of that post and the 8 char code needed to like or reblog a post

6970240
versioning	upgrade
the server i am running it on already has python 2.5.2 and django 1.1 installed but i want to use a newer versioning of django and dont have administrator rights to upgrade

6970242
inherited	subclassing
my first intuition is that since in the first piece of code we are assigning a foo reference to bar then it means the change will also apply to foo while on the second code it probably inherited from foo and therefore the change on bar s subclassing attribute won

6970245
simplecursoradapter	spinner
but i am also using a custom simplecursoradapter to populate the spinner and because of that i also need to query the _id column

6970264
inherited	properties
creates a new object that inherited from foo and since it s a different object when you assign the properties

6970264
inherited	properties
the object referenced by bar in fact will contain two own properties one and three but since it inherited from foo the properties named two is resolvable through the prototype chain for example

6970295
disk	ram
a simple way would be to use your system s way of providing a file system based totally on ram - tempfs on linux a ram disk on windows

6970298
hash	md5
apple is crazy about privacy and udid still allows to differentiate devices etc so i suggest to calculate some hash for example md5 and only afterward to pass it to the server

6970317
gif	png
everything else works over 100kb png gif newly created zip files etc

6970367
subtract	add
finding the sum from zero to index now becomes a binary tree traversal where for every node you traverse you add the node s sum and subtract any right hand or higher value child you are not traversing

6970434
put	get	post	get	post	put
so the correct implementation for this is to put your post processing code inside a new php and make that php to echo some json response so your .post call can receive a json response with data about if the process was successful or any other data you want to get in response to your post

6970440
updatepanel	scriptmanager
my example uses a hidden div and some jquery through the usage of the scriptmanager control to inject text into a div that is outside the updatepanel

6970440

6970572
mdpi	hdpi
you can try with creating a folder named drawable without hdpi ldpi mdpi in res

6970580
int	chars
bar chars foobar chars and not bar int foobar chars

6970594
apk	dex
if i add the proguard cfg file to the default.properties file no modifications to the cfg file and try to export a signed apk the exporter fails saying that it couldn t convert to dex bytecode with error 1

6970597

you can even disable cross origin policy in firefox and google-chrome from the client side - so even if you could verify the request came from a browser it s still possible to get around your security measures

6970647
rss	feed
how to programmatically determine whether an rss feed is a full feed or a partial feed

6970670
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that in google-chrome the pixel count is 1pixel different to that of firefox

stdout	fflush
unless your libc doesn t fflush stdout on close

6970859
post	get
i am trying to get the ids of people who liked a post

6970879
comparator	comparable
let s say the way i term two objects as equals within the equals method is different from the way i term two objects of the same class as equals within the comparator of the comparable

6970890
put	get
asnotracking will not ensure that you get a entity that is not cached in the database its purpose is to not put the objects inside the context

6970891
serializable	deserialization
since model binding was no where near as transparent as i had hoped for complex model viewmodels i simply built a custom actionfilter to resolve the types and only the types i want to deserialize in the action method and use servicestack.text for all my serializable deserialization needs

6970899
post	get
closest one i am familiar with is everyauth but it just does fairly basic fb integration for oauth2 authentication but that is most of the heavy lifting you need to get your access token with the proper scope so you can then make an api call to post to a user s wall or whatever

6970924
mouse	keyboard
i want to handle at least two joysticks keyboard and mouse

6970971

with the android drag drop framework you can allow your users to move

6971034
int	boolean
this will give the classcastexception because the interpreter process 1 2 and put the boolean into the stack while the third variable 3 is an int so it is not comparable with a boolean

6971069
mouse	keyboard
obviously they handle mouse and keyboard but they re basically gui libraries

6971149
hide	show
if you indeed had 100 odd elements and you wanted to hide show them and are deciding whether delete new-ing them would be a better option - i guess i d still go with hide show

6971150
int	chars
i guess the only use of this is in conversion of a chars quantity to an int

6971170
post	get
replace the 50 with the number of popular post that you want to get

6971178
stdout	stderr
basically when the main program forks it should create new pipe s that will become the child process stdout and stderr

6971178
stdout	stderr
then the main program will need to read from its end of all the new pipes and potentially buffer the information so that the main process can send the data from children to its own stdout stderr in a specific order - all of the first child s output then all of the second child s output then all of the next child s output etc

6971178
switching	screens
the other alternative is to have a currently selected child which can become a lot more complex especially if there s an end-user who needs to be able to see the output of the selected child as that d mean implementing some way of switching between currently being displayed children - when the user selects a different child clear the screens and display that child s backlog

6971183
int	chars
inline with what you mentioned chars are 8 bit int values

6971221

6971243
int	chars
chars is an int usually with a width of 8 bits

6971259

6971280
folder	directory
it could be the session directory is getting wiped out improperly in that case try to set different folder for the session_path

6971301

you can do so for a specific properties if you really want an element to inherited that style from its parent but it doesn t make sense for most designs in general to do it for every single properties unless your design is specifically about outlining every single rectangle with a thick red border

however this does not work for multiplication the true result of a multiplying say 0x10000001 0x0fffffff will be too long for the mantissa of a double so the low-order bits will be lost if the specification is followed to the letter

6976423
width	height
width and height of a rectangle may be changed independently from one another

6976423
width	height
width and height of a square cannot be changed independently from one another and that wouldn t be meaningful in the first place

6976423
width	height
the problem with this approach is that while the invariant correctly states width and height don t have to be equal but they can be it is ineffectual 1 because it is a tautology and 2 because it is less restrictive than the invariant in the derived class square

6976423
width	height
this will forbid the derived class square from simply updating height to width whenever width is changed and vice versa it won t stop me per se from deriving a square class from rectangle

6976453

6985935
int	chars
you can assign a chars variable to an int one because the compiler applies a broadening conversion

6985935
int	chars
the basis being that an int is larger than a chars and as such there is no chance of loss of information in the conversion

6985935
int	chars
if you tried to assign your int to your chars though you would notice the compiler rejects your code until you put in a specific typecast

6985935
superclass	subclassing
note that at no time can you convert objects that aren t related to each other by superclass subclassing hierarchy

the code snippet you show is correct anyway my guess is that you have very possibly a memory problem that makes your uilabel instance to be released at some point before layoutsubviews is executed then that memory is reused by an nsstring so you get the error there

6986529
post	get
the point is that if i do a normal get or by using a childaction inside a view i have those two set when getcontrollertype is called but if i do a post ajax call with contenttype application json

to make this dynamic you just need to replace that with the value of half of the width and height of the element to be positioned

then you don t need to subtract anything from the overall height and width

just follow the links in the various see also sections to get to the implementing classes for example hashmap then look at the insertion methods generally a variation on add push or put to see if that implementation permits null

you should note the pid of the fork ed processes maybe in an array and do a wait waitid or waitpid

the code works for both firefox and google-chrome but for some reason when i try to search an address in ie the map just reloads rather than placing the marker at the appropriate location

6997919

allocator	stl
i d recommend to look into custom allocator for stl if you run into any memory performance issues which is not likely to happen in the first place as deadmg mentioned

6998515
allocator	stl
i personally use stl with custom memory allocator that again use my own memory manager so that i can keep track of the memory used by the stl containers strings i use

6998515
allocator	stl
so if memory usage fragmentation is your concern i d recommend to look into providing custom allocator for your stl code

6998515
allocator	stl
this was a great resource to get me started with custom memory allocator for stl

6998515
allocator	stl
i also remember that ogre3d has some custom allocator for the stl containers which could be a great example to get you started

6998517
mdpi	hdpi
there is variety of different resolution for hdpi mdpi and ldpi

6998519
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in ie7 google-chrome and firefox and it worked

6998846
integer	unsigned
however with an 8-bit unsigned integer the sign bit has a value of +127

i thought nsfilemanager and nsfilewrapper supported extended attributes since snow leopard but i can t find any documentation p you can always use the bsd level functions though

urllib	httplib
http.client httplib and urllib

6999569
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

crypt	salt
it s less secure than if you just use crypt the way it was designed with the password as the first argument and the salt as the second

6999637
salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5
if your system uses an md5 crypt then you ve just limited the salt space to 12 characters so you re truncating the space of users passwords to twelve characters

6999637
crypt	salt
worse still my system requires me to use a prefix on the salt in order to specify my crypt or else i get old school crypt meaning you have two characters for the salt

6999637
crypt	salt
plus there s no point in even running crypt at this point you might as well just store their two character password since the salt is prefixed to the ciphertext so that subsequent calls to crypt can pass the same salt

6999637
crypt	salt
what you want to do is the industry standard use a strong crypt pass the password as the first argument and random salt data in as the second argument and make sure that you re passing the maximum allowable number of bytes in for the salt

7001814
installation	upgrade
well assuming this is a new installation and not an upgrade i am guessing that your permalink structure is messed up

7001823
webclient	webrequest	webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest doesn t support socks proxies so after a long research i ve determined that the best way to add socks support for webrequest and webclient without reinventing the wheel like sockshttpwebrequest does was to create a temporary http proxy which forwards any incoming request to the socks proxy

7002198
hide	show
the thing is if the user already logged in clicks on the home button it will show homeview and i need to hide the login button and show a exit button

wordpress	joomla
the wordpress codex gives some plugins that could help you importing from joomla to wordpress

7002267
maven	pom.xml
in order to convert a maven project to an eclipse project your project must first be a maven project which requires a pom.xml to exist

7002271

memcheck	callgrind
callgrind reported an assertion violation in malloc although memcheck and a usual run reveals no errors

7002336
valgrind	callgrind

7002339
mouse	keyboard
another idea would be to change the lufa installation on the arduino reconfiguring it to one of the many other modes supported by the lufa project so that it looks like something an unmodified honeycomb tablet already knows how to talk to such as a mass storage drive or a keyboard or a mouse etc

7002359
post	get
the other methods post load and get are just shorthand ways of invoking the ajax method so it s a matter of style convention

7002380
tabcontrol	tabitem
i m not positive if the ribbon tabs are the same as a tabcontrol tabs but a tabcontrol destorys it s tabitem when they re not visible

7002402

maybe start to use ant not maven

7002445
folder	directory
in iis i enabled the project as an application and set this new project folder as a virtual directory in all the projects that will be using it and enabled each virtual directory as an application

7002476
post	get
if i had to give a small analogy of get post and ajax its like you would be able to buy yourself a completed car with a friendly interface pedals steering wheel etc. so you don t have to do it all yourself

7002478
width	height
width or height cannot exceed gl_max_texture_size

7002541
post	get
analogy updated to compare an all-in-one tool vs multiple specialized tools which more accurately reflects the comparison of ajax vs get post and load

7002580
x86	64bit
if it s set to x86 that might cause that error if your system is 64bit

7002689
margin	height
oh also - you might want to just give the content div a margin bottom of the height of the footer that should put the footer always at the bottom it s getting cut off for me in mac safari and also allow enough of a gap beneath the content if it goes beneath the footer

7002730
caliburn.micro	mef
i have a silverlight client that uses caliburn.micro and a mef container with a loadcatalog class to keep everything loosely coupled in an mvvm way

7002813
pop-up	dialog
do you want to have the listview pop-up as a dialog box or a new activity

7002813
pop-up	dialog
if it is a pop-up dialog instead of creating a new intent in the onclick view view you would have to inflate the listview layout from another layout xml file create the adapter then set the listview to that adapter

7002832
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however i can t seem to figure out how to get drag and drop to work in safari while it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	gdi	gdi	directdraw
more specifically a java2d rendering pipeline seems to connect cross-platform java code to native graphics libraries opengl x11 direct3d directdraw gdi that may support hardware acceleration

7003021
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	gdi	gdi	directdraw
by default when java2d is used on a windows system both this direct3d pipeline and a directdraw gdi pipeline are enabled by default i assume they are each being used for different things

7003021
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	gdi	gdi	directdraw
i think this disables direct3d but not directdraw which can be disabled with and then all operations will be performed with gdi but this doesn t noticeably improve initialization time

7003032
strsplit	substr
my guess is this is a tab-delimited file with a known constant number of columns in which case you could use strsplit to separate the substr

7003056
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
i currently have both sorting and filtering working but the grouping settings is giving me trouble

make a settings folder in the same directory as manage.py

7003244
ssl	https
my site doesn t have ssl yet but the authorize.net makes a secure https post so i use the dpm method to accept payments

7003250
dbcontext	objectcontext
you must either include foreign keys to your entities so they will be tracked as normal values or you must convert your dbcontext to objectcontext and use more powerful and more cumbersome objectstatemanager where you can get instances of objectstateentry for both entities and relations

7003250
dbcontext	objectcontext
to convert dbcontext to objectcontext use

7003278
int	chars
i have a piece of shared memory that contains a chars string and an int between two processes

7003301
hash	salt
if the two hash are the same then no salt was used and you probably have a simple hash of the password

7003301
hash	md5
if not then try the md5 hash of simple combinations of the username and password

7003301
put	get
if it gets to that it might be easier to just put a network sniffer onto your network where it hits the old system so you can read your users passwords before they get hashed

7003329
uninstall	downgrade
in order to downgrade from crystal reports â œ11â to â œ10â i had uninstall all related crystal report products removed the projectâ s references

7003343

7003344
post	get
there is a ubiquitous com object called msxml2.xmlhttp that can do get and post requests and return you the results

sysv	systemd
on some sysv systemd eagain

7003405
getter	setter
in order to ensure that the type of the variables is correct i wrap most of the attributes in my classes via getter setter

7003405
getter	setter
i was wondering if it s a good idea to put do that permission checking in the getter setter well.

7003405
getter	setter
also i ve read that properties should ideally be kept simple and that is not a great practice start loading the getter setter with code that can cause a lot of side effects some people say that is difficult to track errors when the code just reads myduck.age 512

7003411
implements	extends
all i really know is that i should create a class that extends delegatingreverseengineeringstrategy and implements tabletometaattribute to add the base to the name of my base classes

7003441
hash	salt
also the salt is stored next to the password hash

7003441
hash	salt
therefore it appears someone would need to get my table with hash s and if they did they could also get the salt and the rest of my code and do what they wanted with my site in general

7003469
ubuntu	linux
i ve moved suse linux code to ubuntu and windows with simple recompiles

7003469
gentoo	ubuntu
it started on an old version of slackware 32-bit got moved to gentoo 32 and 64-bit and ubuntu 32 and 64-bit

7003476
hash	salt
most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers

7003476
hash	salt
you should also never store the actual password on the server you only store the hash and maybe the salt if you don t already know it

7003486
inherited	properties
if you read a properties from an object that does not have that properties javascript will search the objects prototype chain that is all the objects that inherited from each other for that properties and returns it if found

7003486
inherited	properties
if an oject has a properties itself it s prototype chain will not be searched so you can override an objects inherited properties by setting the porperty on the objects self

free	malloc
the interesting thing about malloc and free is that they don t actually change the memory they give you -- they just change how it s thought of

7007214
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the os often zeroes out unused memory in the background to make calls to calloc faster but free only tells the operating system i m done with this memory do whatever you need to with it. the os typically updates some housekeeping data to indicate that the block of memory is no longer owned by a process so that a later call to malloc can use it if it s needed

thinking about it reveals that the width and the height in 2d are actually vectors two except that their direction is implied width is the length of a vector in x direction height is the length of a vector in y direction

7007270
width	height
the normal vector is not necessary anymore since it is can be calculated by the vectorial product of width x height

portrait	landscape
i am having a real problem with the thumbnail rendering on galleries with mixed portrait and landscape images

7008076
fgets	strtok
another possibility is to read a line using fgets not gets and to tokenize it either with strtok or a custom loop which parses the line not recommended it s messy to write produces spaghetti code and is vulnerable to bugs

7008083
getattr	isinstance
however occasionally i can find some strange logs in uwsgi.log reporting that getattr isinstance is not defined

7008091
min	max
i need to get the min year and the max year and then populate the years between them

7008091

i can easily create a stored proc that gets the min and max and then create a loop in my script to achieve this but wondered if there is a better way to do this in sql

7008123
folder	directory
finally found the solution had to copy the folder and foldername.state files that are created during project build process to the directory from where ccservice.exe was running

7008129
min	max
at this moment i know three such names min max and lim

7008138
client-side	server-side
if you chose to generate the html server side then you will need to find a way to avoid duplicating the images array on both the client-side and server-side

7008141
getter	setter
in .net the getter for a property foo is called get_foo and the setter set_foo although c# hides that fact for you

7008141
getter	setter
you can either write your own getter and setter

7008178
switching	screens
i want to add an animated uiviewcontroller transition when user swiping screens to switching tab

jboss	glassfish
finally if you re running in a container such as tomcat jboss or glassfish then you can simply bind a datasource to jndi and use that

7008204
jwindow	jdialog
and if you don t want your jframe to be clickable you should use a modal jdialog by extending jdialog instead of jwindow

7008209
pdfbox	itextsharp
i tried for the above solutions but couldn t make it out.there are so many free sdk or dll s available such as pdfnet pdfclown itextsharp pdfbox pdflib.finally tried again with pdfnet sdk now i can able to do it if my input pdf is of type tagged pdf

post	get
but when i run the mydomain or mydomain post in the browser i get always an 404 error

7008495
tax	shipping
i m not into the tax rules in your country but probably you have to change the calculation to be based on shipping origin and define the origin under system configuration shipping settings origin

7008524
clang	llvm
in the newly rebrandished llvm try out well it just went from llvm-gcc to clang

7008532

7008534
actioncontroller	activeresource
it implements object-relational mapping for rest web services to provide transparent proxying capabilities between a client activeresource and a restful service which is provided by simply restful routing in actioncontroller resources

7008549
comparator	comparable
expecially see how to use a custom comparator cause float is not directly nor easily comparable

7008579
for-loop	arrays
effectively i wanted to set a tag value to an arrays of objects using a for-loop

7008643
hide	show
note i have already added code to hide and show the buttons based on what page they are looking at so don t need to do that

7008674
int	boolean
as you can see on scala class hierarchy int unit boolean and others are not subclasses of anyref because they are translated into java int void boolean and so on witch are not subclasses of object

7008692
pull	push
the best direction of a solution is that you should use pull not push - that is install something on every computer and let them pull information

7008694
google-chrome	firefox
i need to know how to access google-chrome pdf rendering capability from javascript in google-chrome but also firefox etc now i start with google-chrome

7008709
google-chrome	safari
as an aside if you aren t already the best way to quickly test all this stuff is in google-chrome or safari on your desktop with the developer tools turned on

7008732
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on windows xp it s working fine in firefox 3.6 and safari 4 but it doesn t seem to be working in the latest version 13 of google-chrome

7008766
x86	64bit	folder	directory
it s a bit workaroundish but given that the lib directory of ironpython is installed under the x86 program files folder in 64bit systems and on the usual program files path on 32bit systems you could do in this way

7008770
apache	nginx
i would like to ask which server to choose apache or nginx to host the application in ror

7008776
int	boolean
i ve got a int column mapped as boolean type in domain objects

7008938
redmine	trac
latest versions i used in production were trac 1.0.1 and redmine 2.2.3

7008938
redmine	trac
but redmine has some serious drawbacks over trac

7008938
ubuntu	debian
you cannot use debian ubuntu package system for production use

7008938
redmine	trac
administration is not easy considering making a backup in trac this is a one-liner in redmine you have to backup configuration attached files and database content all separately

7008938
bazaar	trac	bazaar	git	bazaar	perforce
version control system i think installing a plugin is not that hard and for almost every vcs there is a plugin for trac git perforce mercurial darcs monotone subversion bazaar

7008938
bibtex	latex	redmine	trac
plugins i would argue trac and trac-hacks have much more plugins than redmine so integration of doxygen jenkins latex bibtex etc

7008938
redmine	trac
redmine s installation process is not easy but trac installation became also more complex these days so manual database creation etc

7008938
redmine	trac
this happend to me more than a dozen times for redmine but also sometimes for trac

7008972
post	get
i want to get the required image post on my wall when any user like my page from my website

7009047
pop-up	dialog
the issue was with getting the dialog to only pop-up after databinding rather than just using

7009075
client-side	server-side
i prefer there be a server-side command not a client-side

7009113
min	max
without knowing in advance the min max points of the axis

7009139
implements	extends
but i guess you are recommended to implements your own tokenizer class probably extends abstractlinetokenizer using a workaround strategy like this one

7009163
vbscript	jscript
as far as i understand it you can use the jscript and the vbscript language with msxml and msxsl script

7009165
post	get
everytime i try to post something on the wall i first get a webview with the following error

7009248
width	height
void buttondeclaration uibutton mbutton xposition int xloc yposition int yloc width int bwidth height int bheight imagename nsstring simage myview uiviewcontroller mview selector sel mselector

7009248
width	height
self buttondeclaration mybtn xposition 5 yposition 10 width 5 height 10 and so on.......

7009251
hash	md5
in java you are doing a double md5 hash

7009256
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
padding margin and borders are not counted in the height and width so 100 height or width on an element with 10px padding on each side will actually take up 100 plus 20 pixels

7009256
box-sizing	border-box
the way around this is to use the css box-sizing border-box

7009259
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
i implemented a qtcpserver and a qtcpsocket

7009270
put	get
at the moment i use the stl vector container template to put back and get the connections

7009323
joptionpane	jdialog
use a modal jdialog or joptionpane instead

7009324
post	get
my own tryout only pulls out my last post each time it does get loaded into the div but it doesnt genereate other post then the last so all links i click goto the same post

7009378
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to copy folder from my linux ubuntu to my mac book using scp

7009420
inherited	subclassing
since the initialiser of the subclassing is inherited from mapping while the update method is overridden this will cause an error when run

7009450
memcpy	memset
some compilers are putting implicitly the built-in memset or memcpy for such things

7009475
children	parent
i want to create a function that deletes all the children of the parent without selecting them all first

7009508
int	chars
the error has to do with mixing unsigned int of 8 bits with chars that are signed if you use just chars

7009566
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memcmp	memmove	memset	memmove	memcmp	memset	memcmp
the compiler may generate calls to memcmp memset memcpy and memmove

7009572
google-chrome	firefox
this is getting fired if i am working with ie but not with google-chrome or firefox 4 but working fine in firefox 3.6.3

7009615
post	put
the net effect is that the data in modelstate will override anything you put into the model that is passed to the view in your post action

7009658
folder	directory
i know you mentioned you set the permission to 777 but is that for the uploads directory or the entire folder that the application is in

7009713
folder	directory
i tried specifying different folder within directory directorymatch etc directives but couldn t get it working

7009721
for-loop	loops
edit shift doesn t work in a for-loop because all the lines within the parens are interpreted at the same time for all iterations but you can roll your own loops

7009728
coalesce	isnull
interestingly this is one of the few places where you can t use coalesce instead of isnull

7009748
for-loop	arrays
in my code i have a function that accepts an arrays of jquery collections and applies some code to each via a for-loop

7009792
inherited	properties
deadline is one of these properties that are not inherited by default

7009899
width	height
computed size - width 320.000000 height 450.000000

7009899
width	height
content size - width 320.000000 height 484.000000

7009953
implements	extends
public class imageprocess extends jframe implements actionlistener

7009953
implements	extends
class openimage extends jframe implements actionlistener

7009975
rss	feed
the address gives only access to the rss feed of yahoo news

7009997
min	max
you should create this array before passing it to max and min

7010004
ubuntu	debian
i ve created some applications using pygtk and thought they had been ok until i executed them in an environment with accessibility enabled gnome on ubuntu and openbox on debian

7010015
google-chrome	firefox
actually neither should return true and indeed they don t in firefox or google-chrome untested in other browsers

7010032
hide	show
and hook the click events to show hide the lists

7010097
min	max
you should thus transform the args array of string s into an array of int s and pass this new array of int s to your min and max methods

7010185
int	chars
restrict chars and allow only int in textbox using javascript

7010217
awt	swing
don t mix swing jscrollpane and awt canvas

7010230
width	height
am assuming that the images are of same height and width .

7010268
button	checkbox
for example the checked property of a checkbox or radio button does not correspond to any attribute

7010321
width	height
1 img2- height img2- width calculate as constant before loop

7010333
hide	show
now the issue is when i click touch on the checkbox the errormsg show for a while and then it also hide it immediately since target is not the errormsg

7010370
hide	show
for multiple lists eack with it s own show hide merge those 2 spans and put a control after each list like so

7010376
equals	gethashcode
edit the equals and gethashcode methods is overriden

7010395
getter	setter
however you could write a wrapper class with getter setter methods to do what you need which could be called from arbitrary threads inside a dispatch block

7010398
google-chrome	safari
intel mac os x 10_6_7 applewebkit 535.1 khtml like gecko google-chrome 13.0.782.107 safari 535.1

7010444
equals	gethashcode
it s related to the equals and gethashcode

7010444
equals	gethashcode
missing overrides of equals and gethashcode is one of multiple thing which can cause this

7010459
post	get
it works for get and post

7010532
jsf	jspx
if upgrading to jsf 2.1 where jspx is been supported is not an option then you need to rename your .jspx files to .xhtml and remove the now superfluous xmlns jsp taglib declaration

7010537
getter	setter
ef only wraps it and wrapper properties still call base setter and getter

7010543
put	get
whereas i can see the benefit of removing exception handling code where it s just been put in thoughtlessly i would consider carefully what benefit you get by pushing responsibility for handling an exception of this kind higher up in the call chain

7010562
getter	setter
objective c is somewhat similar to c# in that it provides you with easy ways to generate getter s and setter for your class properties

7010562
getter	setter
those synthesize keywords in your implementation file create getter and setter methods for you for your properties

7010562
getter	setter
your first synthesize looks good it will create a getter and setter for simpleproperty backed by the instance variable of the same name

7010562
getter	setter
it will create a getter and setter for propertywithunderscoreivar backed by the instance variable _propertywithunderscoreivar which you never declared

7010584
opencv	emgucv
i want to develop a people counting system using opencv or emgucv

7010585
portrait	landscape
all images keep their image ratio - i mean that eg portrait image is high and narrow while landscape image is short and wide

7010603
accessor	ivar
you are accessing the ivar via the accessor

7010610
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome opera ie8 ie9 only firefox is a problem

7010613
getter	setter
in order to access the getter setter methods you should use self or any instance

7010633
equals	gethashcode
the problem was the equals and gethashcode methods were not implimented for the class

7010642
rss	feed
i want to create a service that would listen to few rss feed and parse new feed to json for further use

7010652
jar	war
as user474249 commented you could use the maven archetype plugin to generate a folder structure based on your project type jar war etc

7010704
inherited	properties
if you loop over it like that for..in you ll get all properties which are directly on the object and inherited via the prototype chain

7010707
inherited	properties
using a for...in construct will also iterate all properties including all properties inherited through the prototype chain which is why you get all the properties of the object alerted as well as the set of matched li elements

7010714
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome there s exactly the same issue while in firefox the kerning is correct for printing too

7010750
int	double
i pretty much always use the int double etc.parse methods when i m certain it s a number

7010786
hash	hmac
so i looked into hmac but although many hash function are available in both python and php i m baffled as to how i d go about verifying the hash

7010823
rss	feed
i want to have an application which parses various rss feed and send the information to a remote server

7010881
pop-up	dialog
i also want to be able to create a pop-up dialog box so when you click on csc a box will appear with a little information about csc

7010902
debian	linux
running fine but now when i deployed the application in linux debian

7010930
put	get
first i would find all the dates in your range that have one or mor associated tasks and put themn in a dictionary in order to be able to get them knowing the date then i would create temptask

7010961
rss	feed
the only way to observe rss feed changes is to poll the feed by requesting it over a set interval of time

7011011
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable or ienumerator

7011033
intersect	contains
compilation error is no definition found for intersect contains

7011041
folder	directory
the admin app is imported to the collected directory within an admin folder however my app static data gets imported directly into the main directory thus overwriting other apps if duplicate files are found

7011058
width	height
you do not need to set its width or height nor should you set it grid.row or column

7011098
teamcity	partcover
teamcity 6.5.3 must support partcover 4.0.11129

7011128
windows	wow64
if your process is 32-bit call iswow64process - 32-bit processes run in wow64 on 64-bit windows and without wow64 otherwise

7011131
button	checkbox
a button similar to a checkbox except that only one item in a group can be selected

7011141
width	height
now on calling the modal popup from the jsp i am specifying its width and height but i want that the end popup should have a height just sufficient to hold the table the table height may differ if more rows may get fetched

7011148
uiview	subviews
to allow for flexible layouts i wanted to create a subclass uiview that overrides layoutsubviews to layout all of its subviews under each other automagically and would continue to do this every time one of its subviews got resized

7011148
uiview	subviews
however the only way that i can think of to let the superview know that it should call layoutsubviews is by overriding that method in each of its subviews something that i would like to try and avoid i want people to be able to add arbitrary uiview to the superview and have this taken care of

7011162
superclass	subclassing
define abstract superclass class absatractstate put there code of methods that common for all states and all classes that represents real states must been subclassing from it

7011175
for-loop	arrays
in php you can just do a for-loop over since it will return an arrays of the fields

7011180
button	checkbox
a button similar to a checkbox except that only one item in a group can be selected

7011206
disk	ram
i have plenty of ram and am reasonably sure the page faults are not disk io related

7011229
width	height	portrait	landscape
because the width and height of the webview is not the same in portrait and landscape mode i use a percent to represent the user scroll position

7011277
ienumerable	icollection
basically you are asking the following if the type i tried to resolve isn t found return another type that can be converted to it if you try to resolve ienumerable return a type that is registered for icollection

7011356
post	get
if i refresh the page it then renders correctly so i ve worked around this temporarily by doing a redirecttoaction to force an get to the view instead of just returning the view from the post but would like to know what s going wrong and how i can fix this properly

7011443
post	get
an example of this is implementing the post redirect get pattern

7011519
openmpi	mpich
but i installed mpich 2 and not openmpi

7011672
implements	extends
you extends org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.job and implements run to define a job

7011681
post	get
which means that viewstate alone will not help any time you get the page - not post - it will have a new viewstate

7011682
hide	show
try to show the element and hide it after you get the height

7011695
getter	setter
best practice in java and c# has long been to use getter setter or properties to access fields

7011695
getter	setter
i think that is the first problem the idea that if you have a getter you must also have a setter

7011731
button	checkbox
it s pretty rare to have a toggle button with a null value here but more common on some of the subclasses like checkbox

7011743
oledb	openrowset
openrowset can be used to access remote data from oledb data sources

7011743
oledb	openrowset
openrowset and opendatasource should be used only to reference oledb

7011762
getter	setter
and create getter and setter for the same variable and where ever you are creating object just say store .getinstance .setobject yourobject

7011793
mouseover	mouseout
1st if i pass fast with the mouse over the image some times the image state with mouseover image don t detect the mouseout event

7011814
folder	directory
given a list of file names the program should scan the directory and copy the files in the directory to a destination directory maintaining the folder structre

7011821
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you get the min and max iid s you have a range you can check from

7011821
min	max
update this should return two values min max

7011843
put	get
i added this to the controller in an action that handles put requests instead of get requests update method

7011862
put	get
you must then process the tagged output and put names and roles in a list instead of printing but you get the picture

7011963
getter	setter
if you would use for inheritance some kind of global variable but that wouldn t be inheritance that would be a default value you could also think about using a boolean flag which will be checked in the getter to find out if the backing store or the default should be used and it will set always to the opposite of its initial state within the setter

7011975
for-loop	loops
i didnt put the for-loop b c i know that loops works b c i got the correct number of rows

7011976
post	get
ff stores it in prefs.js in profile folder checkout this post to get to it via code

7011976
google-chrome	safari
not sure about google-chrome and safari

7012042
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine with google-chrome firefox ie7 and ie9

7012059
versioning	upgrade
if not then you should contact your hosting provider and ask them to upgrade to the latest php versioning and or resolve the mail function issue for you

7012076
wan	lan
this port has to be forwarded by the router from the wan address to the lan address of the streaming server

7012123
width	height
as documentation says that width height is caclucated based on 160dpi screen i came to conclusion that this is the way to achieve this

7012169
postgresql	mysql
i have a query that worked fine on mysql and now doesn t on postgresql

7012171
move	drag
i move it out of it and restarted eclipse note drag drop does not work it creates an alias copy-paste the eclipse folder and then delete the one under application .now it seems to find all dependencies and dependent plugins

imagine a custom view where the height required for the content depends on the width of the view similar to a multi-line textview

7015097
width	height
obviously this only applies if the height isn t fixed by the layout parameters. the catch is that for a given width it s rather expensive to compute the content height in these custom views

google-chrome	firefox
anyway if i change the padding on instead of it seems to fix it in both firefox and google-chrome

7015712
width	height
both of these questions say that to bind a stretching textbox to container width height and not grow with user input you should user a placeholder border and bind to its actual height width

7015712

also adding an additional element to bind width height to seems a bit hacky

7015737

lastly if you want full control you could use c or c++ to assign to shorter int types or even chars types

7016581
splash	homescreen
i am working on a web app and i am having an issue with the splash screen when you add the site to your homescreen

7016618
width	height
as the element shrinks in width the height will shrink proportionately and the box will remain in the same ratio of width to height

7016644
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
both uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller are controllers of multiple view controllers

7016680
width	height
iframe width 100 height 100 src frameborder 0 allowfullscreen iframe

7016688
getter	setter
if you want the fields to be modifiable later you ll have to either use automatic properties or declare concrete backing fields and getter setter pairs for each property

7016716
src	attr
this .parents tr .find .someimage attr src . new.png

7016730
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ can t be used by itself like libstdc++ it has to be linked along with libc++abi

7016737
stdout	stderr
note that i m only redirecting stderr not stdout

7016745
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the request goes through without any problems

7016766
free	malloc
either libc on unixes or winapi and call system s malloc and free functions yourself

7016768
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist
that s very possible but i would use a listview or datalist as your parent container because if you use a gridview you ll have to put the child list in a column which will look ugly

7016785
put	get
i am learning about rest and put delete i have read that both of those along with get is idempotent meaning that multiple requests put the server into the same state

7016815
width	height	children	parent
however the parent won t necessarily resize to encapsulate its relatively positioned children visually so you will have to set height and width values yourself

7016818
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on mac os x windows firefox on mac os x windows internet explorer 7 printing without clicking on a point first prints the page correctly - other than the map doesn t take up exactly the full height of the page because of the hard-coded div height

7016857
hide	show
i ve also tried jquery hoverintent plugin show hide div on parent hover but keep showing when hovered but again no joy

7016877
mouse	keyboard
i m doing what the topic says on a system without keyboard mouse so i need to make this work from code

7016909
icmp	udp
udp being bare-bones send and forget does not do anything about dropped packets for you except in corner cases where you get an error from the second send 2 on a connected udp socket and only if icmp works properly

7016945
post	put
put and delete requests may or may not be handled differently from post in the site s code

7016949
for-loop	arrays
to iterate over an arrays use a normal for-loop

7016980
width	height
i d set the width and height of the td s using html use the valign property on the td s and finally use the style property to style your td s border using css

7016981
width	height
i have an isometric grid system who s coordinates start from 0 0 in the left hand corner of the grid the corner shown in the above image with x incrementing towards the bottom of the image and y incrementing towards the top so 0 height would be the top corner and width 0 would be the bottom corner in a diamond shape with width and height being the size of the grid ie

7016992
ienumerable	icollection
however the simplest thing to do to protect the array s encapsulation is to expose only an ienumerable or icollection and the methods to mutate the internal array

7016992
ienumerable	icollection
as the return type is ienumerable icollection then there is no possibility to mutate the internal state other than via the methods properties on the class

7017013
int	double
you probably should not be using floating point to take the square root of an int especially long double which is poorly supported and might have an approximate not accurate sqrtl on some systems

7017022
accessor	properties
as for it being a bad practice that largely stems from the reason they describe that even if you only provide a get accessor on your properties a user can still modify the contents of the array and thereby mutate the state of your class without your class having a way of validating the changes -- and worst of all this consequence of the design is not very obvious unless you already have a deep enough knowledge of c# array semantics

7017043
system.configuration	system.web
i have an assembly class library project in .net 3.5 that has some references like system.configuration and system.web

7017098

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and opera are showing the button properly but firefox is not

7017165
opera	google-chrome
in opera and google-chrome the span is at the top left corner

7017204
mayavi	matplotlib
suffice it to say this requires mayavi and is rather beyond the scope of matplotlib s handy but limited 3d features

7017232
google-chrome	firefox
btw i was running an easing function easeinoutquad which worked great in firefox but google-chrome and epiphany browsers got stuck on it

7017266
width	height
this way we can use the values from the slider to manipulate the width and height of another element

7017292
identifier	ambiguous
write the full namespace directly in your statements if some identifier is ambiguous

7017294
docx	xlsx
however recently the customer noticed that all microsoft office 2007 documents docx xlsx ect are corrupted when any user try to download them

7017335
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
important rule to force some rules to take place so you can nail down the problem also using tools like firebug for firefox and inspector for google-chrome and safari helps you to see the the computed css

7017373
postgresql	mysql
ps i don t know if they use mysql because normally python either uses sqlit or postgresql so if you want you could use the libraries i gave you and import the python-mysql module and do it d

7017383
screens	tablet
now running it on android 3.1 tablet it shows only half of the screens

7017454
put	get
for further debugging purposes you can put echo in front of cp and you d see what commands would get run - in a sort of dry run.

7017495
hash	salt
you can t treat it like a password you would salt hash a password but you need to keep the original access token value

7017521
filtering	grouping
the great thing about contracts is that they allow you to grouping instances of certain objects of a specific type and filtering out any unwanted instances of objects of a specific type

7017522
stdout	stderr
i am a bit confused by your description of system2 because it has stdout and stderr arguments

7017522
stdout	stderr
so it is able to return both exit status stdout and stderr

7017525
spweb	spsite
but in my opinion you should use using when you re working with spweb or spsite

7017533
subtract	add
i want the up button to add 1 to the count and the down button to subtract 1 from the count

7017571
s-function	simulink
in the tlc file for this s-function you would just ask simulink to include the appropriate header file for the static library and then make function calls that reference the library

7017597
put	get
simply put the relationship between kinetic energy and velocity is so after taking the derivative with respect to velocity you get

7017600
piston	tastypie
you can setup one-off request handlers that can return some json for backbone to parse ingest without piston or tastypie

7017614
post	put
you ll see that i had to put because the model from the post is blank but the model from the options is not

the thing i need but cannot figure out is how to get that calculated price and use it as an php variable in a post form

7017638
vb.net	vb6
especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

7017652
google-chrome	firefox
now when i use this in google-chrome or firefox the inline spelling doesn t work and the spell check icon gives a very long error reproduced at the end of this question

7017779
rss	feed
as others have suggested an rss feed would be a great way to pipe in the data

7017788
hide	show
i wonder how can i hide the attached panel in a way that only the red button to be show on the left side of the browser s window and when i click on the red button to appear the whole panel

7017813
portrait	landscape
my whole app is landscape based but the mediaplayerviewcontroller seems to rotate from portrait to landscape and when finished the previous view would then also rotate from portrait into its original landscape orientation

7017815
children	parent
as for inheriting opacity - children cannot be less opaque than parent but could be more

7017829
width	height
the width and height of innerborder is less than outerborder by borderthickness 2 from each side so you should calculate the corder radius in this way

7017830
client-side	server-side
php is server-side thus it does not have any connection if you re not checking user s agent and other client-side information

7017838

keep in mind that runtime folder and binfolder are directory i declaratively setup in my main product wxs file

7017890
puts	gets
i want to make a really script in python that gets the contents from the title tags of a specified web page and then puts them into a mysql database

7017904
min	max
i considered assigning the in a loop but that could be a bit complicated with min and max values

7017954
rss	feed
there are a few ways of doing it one would be to create an rss feed on a remote server and parse that and if you wanted realtime updates you could use push notifications

7017970
folder	directory
in my project i have a local images folder in a different location that is configured in iis as a virtual directory say otherimages

7018026
spock	grails
try grails install-plugin spock 0.6-snapshot without groovy-1.8

7018028
rss	feed
that would also mean you would need to have the rss feed updated in real time as well

7018167
stdout	stderr
if you are using redirectstdouttoserverlogenabled feature as described in it will redirect both stdout and stderr to the server logs

7018218
width	height
since in your game squares probably have static size or you zoom camera but never increase width height you can calculate which squares are in your selection box easily

7018218
for-loop	loops
go through x from selectedstartsquare.x to endx and trough y with for-loop from selectedstartsquare.y to endy but change start every time startyindex++ every loops

7018238
nsimage	nstrackingarea
my initial instinct was to setup nstrackingarea s for each nsimage instance but wanted to ensure i wasn t missing something obvious

7018282
accessor	properties
every time the object is referenced using a properties accessor the retain method is called

7018301
folder	directory
i was wondering my scandir function works on a php _get variable so the variable returns the folder but i m having a problem because i m not sure how to echo out an error if there is a problem with with directory

7018329
profiling	instrumentation
i m having unseen object leak cfruntimecreateinstance when profiling my app with instrumentation leak tool

7018350
dbcontext	objectcontext
why should dbcontext care about entity s of another context specifically one of a objectcontext derived class

7018364
division	modulo
the operator modulo will always return an integer - it s the remainder of the division

7018393
postorder	inorder
to understand why this works you should investigate the 3 primary tree-traversal algorithms pre-order inorder postorder

7018397
hide	show
with application_env you can use them to show or hide events depending on your environment

7018414
width	height
however the problem with this is that editing the map size width height and layer count should be allowed while editing the map

7018422
gmail	hotmail
especially if you are building to match standards for hotmail gmail outlook mail.app etc

7018440
qgraphicsview	qdockwidget
i ve put a qgraphicsview in a qdockwidget

7018471
hide	show
i have a listview with some gridviewcolumns and i d like to be able to show or hide them through checkable items in a contextmenu

7018472
switching	screens
the problem you re having is when you launch the app by tapping it on the home screens you re actually just using ios s multitasking to switching back to it it never quit

7018502
pop-up	dialog
some newer models will pop-up a dialog box asking the user if they would like to turn javascript on if the browser detects that the page requires javascript

7018512
hide	show
it would show the rating of the item until the person hovers over them then it would hilight the previous stars and hide the current rating

7018520
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you have the luxury firefox safari google-chrome etc. you can use css animation like the following which assumes each frame is 100px square and you sprite has 5 frames

7018532
opera	google-chrome
for some reason google-chrome opera ie9 and likely more standards compliant browsers picked this up while older browsers did not

7018544
spaces	delimiter
if you need to add a spaces delimiter between the elements it becomes a bit more complex and i would probably use a different solution like this

7018558
filewriter	printwriter
i can t remember - it s likely that closing the printwriter will close the filewriter

7018572
put	get
when i try to put this image into the innerhtml of another object that s a div i get this plain text where the image should show up

7018600
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade a nexus server from versioning 1.7.2 to the latest 1.9.2

7018652
maven	pom.xml
i suspect maven is trying to hit that repo because it is being referenced in the pom.xml of a transitive dependency maven 3 uses slightly different dependency resolution than maven 2 or else there may be something in the compatibility notes about repositories that is affecting you

7018660
foursquare	flickr	twitter	myspace
facebook twitter linkedin google myspace windows live paypal salesforce.com foursquare hyves verisign myopenid openid flickr blogger livejournal wordpress orkut vz-netzwerke and netlog

7018707
post	get
also your form will use get because you did not ask it to use post with

7018715
addclass	removeclass
i d also suggest using addclass and removeclass rather than manipulating the attribute directly as it gives you more flexibility to have other classes on the object and it s more readable

7018729
width	height
i have an image image1 which is a uibutton and what i want is that if i touch this button the width of the image is multiplied by two with animation not the height just the width

7018741
versioning	upgrade
installed a versioning that was working before the upgrade

7018766
accessor	properties
the synthesized properties accessor for retained properties looks something like this

7018787
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
inotifypropertychanged is part of the core framework unlike say icommand and dependencyobject which belong to wpf specifically

7018799
folder	directory
i added the src folder of my project to my the directory list in

7018800
emacs	aquamacs
add the following to your emacs init file in aquamacs to prevent it from swapping the buffers around

7018819
autofac	castle-windsor
however it takes 200 times longer than any other ioc frameworks i tried namely autofac castle-windsor lightcore ninject structuremap and unity

7018828
post	get
if your form uses get instead of post change to accordingly

7018832
folder	directory
on startup i want to copy a folder containing a few other folder that are empty from the application bundle to the documents directory

7018832
folder	directory
however when i use this path to copy the folder to its new location in the documents directory only the folder itself and the .txt file in it which i put in there as a test it s not really supposed to be there gets copied and not the 6-7 empty subfolders

7018867
pop-up	dialog
now the dialog won t pop-up but if i take out the perms and use this button

7018867
pop-up	dialog
the dialog does pop-up

7018869
graphics2d	bufferedimage
what graphics and graphics2d give you is a context for drawing on a component like a jpanel or a bufferedimage

7018921
portrait	landscape
i am attempting to have my list view remain at the same index when switching between landscape and portrait orientation

7018928
udp	tcp
if you don t mind using an external module and not using udp or tcp scapy is an easy solution

7018970
int	boolean
for instance int fields default to 0 float s to 0.0 and boolean s to false

7018984
folder	directory
i am not familiar with this library myself but just had a look and it looks like you just want to download the library and copy all of the folder in the downloadable zip into your codeigniter application directory

7018985
google-chrome	firefox
navigate to the url address of a video mp4 in my case on the server in question in google-chrome firefox

7019010
textview	imageview
i have added textview with no problem to llfirstscreen and i am wondering why imageview

7019131
vim	emacs
i wanted to allow the emacs cursor to move around freely outside of actual text similar to virtualedit all in vim

7019180
inherited	properties
when you try to access an array s properties with a for in it will climb up the prototype chain all the way to arrayname.prototype since it inherited from it

7019200
mouseover	mouseout
edit there is a combined mouseover mouseout version which is cleaner

7019263
textmate	gedit
well i usually code on ubuntu and so i just use gedit with the gmate package so it works and acts like textmate mac

7019280
min	max
your random number is bounded by min max values

7019291
google-chrome	safari
edit google-chrome and safari do not show a tooltip on s with a title attribute because webkit doesn t

7019314
min	max
take 2 records at a time a min and a max

7019342
pop-up	dialog
i have a jquery ui dialog box that pop-up ajax with a table using the datatables 1 pagination feature

7019369
sikuli	selenium
currently i am working on the automation testing framework which combines with both selenium grid and sikuli api

7019369
sikuli	selenium
i already implemented a library which includes functionality of selenium and sikuli and it works well when i set up my hub and node on the same machine

7019386
width	margin
for some reason i m guessing margin or padding your two width statements contradict each other

7019393
pop-up	dialog
then disable closing the pop-up via the x in the corner forcing the user to click either cancel or ok to finish close the dialog

7019434
getter	setter
i suggest to create a single class with mutable attribute add getter and setter and do not use setter without necessity

7019467
google-chrome	firefox
in this case you should implement your own 3ds loader on javascript and make it run on both firefox and google-chrome although the buffers trick isn t useful on google-chrome afaik

7019497
post	get
typing php curl post into the search box will get you the code

7019515
int	chars
are based on the original unicode specification which defined chars as fixed-width 16-bit entities. therefore casting chars to int will always give you a utf-16 value if the chars actually contains a chars from that charset

7019515
int	chars
the docs go on to discuss how the supplementary utf-16 chars can only be represented by an int since chars doesn t have enough space to hold them and if you re operating at this level it might be important to get familiar with those semantics

7019543
post	get
im working with blogger and i need to get the last images from latest post using the json feed api in which you set the feed mode to json-in-script

7019572
button	checkbox
this applies to checkbox radio button spin boxes drop-down menus etc

7019613
int	chars
use int # chr to get the chars

7019618
ant	maven	inherited	properties
do you just inherited a wad of properties from ant that have the version numbers in them or is there a more formal mechanism a la maven

7019630
google-chrome	firefox
i have a javascript issue where something doesn t work in google-chrome but works in firefox

7019643
getter	setter
so i m trying to figure out the best most elegant with the least amount of code way to allow overriding specific functions of a property just the getter just the setter etc. in python

7019643
inherited	properties
however if i want to inherited from a class that defines properties in this manner and then say override the foo setter function it seems tricky

7019643
getter	setter
basically atimestwo inherits the getter function from a but overrides the setter function

7019648
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
i loaded the maven project in eclipse then found sth wrong with pom.xml file when i clicked the overview tab m2e it said

7019655
ubuntu	linux
i have successfully used mingw to build 32-bit and 64-bit binaries from c source for windows machines on the linux machine with the following packages on ubuntu

7019665
put	get
you put placeholders in the layer style which get populated by the features attributes

7019691
spaces	delimiter
iirc the streams use spaces as a default delimiter and you will have to specify that is another delimiter

7019706
width	height
you should put the trigger on slide event of the slider and inside you can set the width and height of the scalablediv

7019729
int	chars
the chars data type is typically represented as a 16 bit machine int though it may or may not be machine word aligned depending on the specific context.

7019729
decoder	encoder
if you did this and you were able to register the corresponding charset encoder and decoder before launching the compiler then a literal that looks like c viewing the input as ascii or utf-8 would actually have the value 67 in the compiler program rather than 99

7019754
filewriter	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i mean why not declare filewriter filereader bufferedreader and bufferedwriter

7019803
getter	setter
please no answers regarding the use of setter getter

7019809
opera	firefox
in addition firefox and opera require that style fit the css property name such as font-size where ie needs the name in javscript syntax fontsize due to interpreting the hypen in the css syntax as a minus sign

7019820
x86	64bit
this code worked perfectly well when i was on x86 but the jump to 64bit is screwing everything up

7019868
inherited	properties
should really include a hasownproperty test otherwise it will copy inherited enumerable properties also

7019878
int	chars
returns you the underlying ascii code of ascii chars instead of the literal int what you want

7019879
xslt	xquery
if you want to combine data lists with document templates a template for an insurance policy with place-holders for the name of the insured and the amount of coverage then using xml for both your data and your template can enable use of languages like xslt or xquery to combine them

7019884
filewriter	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
okay i assume you understand that the variables are not actually called filewriter filereader bufferedreader and bufferedwriter but rather this is the variable type

7019884
filewriter	bufferedwriter
clearly filewriter and bufferedwriter are to do with output in some way

7019911
width	height
the middle portion of the screen should be a single image that occupies the entire width of the screen spanning across columns and of height 2 cells

7019941
folder	directory
if you re trying to access files directory across the network you need to have the appropriate permissions set on the network share not just the permissions set on the actual folder

7019947
width	height
but forcing a height and width didn t help either

7019972
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop to loops through the list of abbreviations you have and then use the replace method mentioned above to swap out the abbreviation for the tag you need

7020052
opera	firefox
i ve tested it and it works in opera safair ie and firefox

7020052
post	put
i ve read several other stackoverflow post and web entries explaining the problem and the most common answer has been to put it on a live server as chrome doesn t accept ajax functions locally

7020066
width	height
the problem here is that the width and height of the imagebutton are fixed and the image is not told to scale

7020101
melt	reshape
the reshape function in the stats package can also be used to do this but the syntax is difficult and i haven t used it once since learning cast and melt from the reshape package

7020123
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
these files could be pdf txt jpeg image bmp image gif image or png image formats

7020158
expression-blend	silverlight
if you really want a rich user interface i would try wpf or silverlight you can get great effects using expression-blend

7020159
width	height
for example on a 480x800 screen if the object s height and width are both 80 pixels i would divide the screens into a 6x10 grid or in the context of java code i would make gameobject 6 10

7020243
octree	quadtree
common data structures for better collision-detection performance are quadtree in 2 dimensions and octree 3 dimensions

7020248
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass for my activities wherewolfactivity in my android app that has a static sqlitedatabaseopenhelper for all subclassing to use

7020248

7020531
getter	setter
and then subclasses can override a single setter getter like this

7020531

7020812
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
_navigationcontrollers is retained as a member of parentviewcontroller so i suppose all my navigation controllers initiated inside for-loop are kept by _navigationcontrollers so they won t be released or become nil but when i try to use navigationcontroller in myviewcontroller to push someotherviewcontroller it doesn t work

7020812
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
i put a breakpoint before pushviewcontroller someotherviewcontroller and po self navigationcontroller the console tells me it is a nil reference

dot performs the rendering to ensure that the graph is laid out in a natural tree configuration-- parent nodes are positioned above their children

7021083

7021413
ggplot2	lattice
i am aware of lattice and ggplot2 but i don t want to use them now

7021467
width	height
since these methods don t accept percentage values you need to calculate the parent container s width and height in pixels

7021489
std	ostream
so your function should accept either an std ostream ref or pointer

7021497
google-chrome	safari
i am using a textbox with textmode as multiline option its working fine in ie mozilla problem occurs in google-chrome and safari

7021500

it working fine in firefox google-chrome safari but in ie it will take extra space from the left side

7021685
int	chars
edit to clarify why this change resolves the issue in your code sscanf tried to write sizeof int bytes in a memory location that could only hold sizeof unsigned chars bytes ie

7021706
ready	each
after each chunk of the file was ready it would then call synchronize and get the main thread to add the contents of the string list to the edit control and then clear the string list

7021707
ready	each
what i would do in your situation with such a short release cycle is have those two collaborators share their local repositories with each other completely skipping the central repository until it has been tested and is ready to push to production

7021727
portrait	landscape
if you didn t specify anything the application will work in both landscape and portrait modes

7021755
stdout	stderr
the easiest way is probably to redirect printf statements to the system log based on the viewing stdout and stderr section of the official adb reference manual

7021755
stdout	fflush
just be aware that since the data is buffered before transferring from the emulator or device you should definitely fflush the stdout buffer eg

7021767

7021840
x86	64bit
this might be a silly question but i have to add reference to programfiles x86 folder on a 64bit machine or to programfiles folder on a 32 bit machine

7021846
for-loop	arrays
first of all while the arguments object available within a function is not an arrays it is array-like enough such that an incremental for-loop for var i 0 len arguments.length

7021846
inherited	properties
first let s focus on all - by which i mean to say not just properties of the object itself but also potentially properties said object has inherited from its prototype or its prototype s prototype or so on

7021855
int	chars
make sure you prepare to catch an exception from the biginteger - if the scanner fails to find a string you might get a biginteger with non int chars and it ll throw an exception

7021870
put	get
i then put the array values into a list as below and i still get the same kind of thing happening

7021898
google-chrome	firefox
this works when i connect to my node.js from firefox which ends up using long-polling but fails when i connect from google-chrome which uses websockets

7021939

portrait	landscape
the exact problem in 2.3 is when i open my camera i am able to see preview in portrait mode but when image is saved its in landscape mode

7021963
int	double
the reason it is important for me to be able to use int rather than double to store the length is that in my past experience with floating point numbers sometimes the values are unexpectedly inaccurate

7021963
int	double
if not then what else can i do to be able to store the note s length using either an int or a double depending on the what i need the type to be

7021990
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you will probably want to use these in viewwillappear viewwilldisappear or viewdidappear viewdiddisappear

7022011
put	get
now i have a problem that if i put those things in each line get space after | but if i put them in same line like than no white space between them

7022032
int	double
it is not possible to convert a variable from int to double it is possible to convert a value from int to double

7022032
int	double
the problem with this approach is that you absolutely must keep track of whether you are currently storing int or double in your unions

7022032
int	double
bad things will happen if you store an int and then try to access it as a double

7022044
onfocus	onblur
i am getting a problem when using onblur and onfocus event of textbox in firefox

7022044
onfocus	onblur
it works as expected onfocus is called first then onblur

in firefox onblur is called first then it calls onfocus

7022231
button	checkbox
i cant use radio button instedof checkbox becasue user can select none of the options and i cant give an additional option for none of the above

7022321
tpanel	tdbgrid
the example assumes a form with a tdbgrid and a tpanel panel1 that will hold the controls created at run time

7022405
autocomplete	typeahead
this code will create a reusable typeahead autocomplete style field for selecting a language

7022409
post	get
however when the user presses submit at the end of the rest of the form i need to post back and get the values of the drop downs

7022434
button	checkbox
edit since you say you can t add a none option and want to use a checkbox even though i strongly disagree on checkbox where a radio button is more appropriate - a common ui error .

7022507
google-chrome	firefox
the user agent is the application usually a browser such as google-chrome or firefox that you are viewing the website with

7022512

simply put a hidden textbox somewhere in the page add the values to it when ur adding them to the dropdowns then split the string on the server side to get the values and add them programatically to the dropdowns

7022676
for-loop	loops
one method is to raise an exception in the inner code and catch it inside the for-loop and continue loops

you are posting data to server so it should be a post not get

7023019
put	get
in that case put the code to get the data from that website in your worker

7023088
chm	rtf
keep in mind that chm is compiled html and not very related to html so your main problem is conversion of rtf to html

7023139
ienumerable	ilist
the reason this works is that is an extension method on the non-generic ienumerable which ilist inherits from and return a generic

7023143
post	get
you can make a php page or so and get the post values i guess

7023155
ienumerable	ilist
additionally your code example is trying to assign from a ienumerable to an ilist you need the tolist on your result

7023178
daemons	systemd
on the other hand if you want to make a systemd daemons with your app which starts at every systemd s startup i d go with a shell script

7023178
daemons	systemd
in your question comments you say using would be unsafe as the application wouldn t restart if it failed crashed but that s the same with any other daemons on your systemd for example if apache crashed it would nt restart by itself

7023178
stdout	stderr
about the logging thing you can either make your application output to stdout stderr and redirect it from the startup script or handle logging from your application using the logging module

7023230
hide	show
specifically show hide

7023236
hide	show
show the hide elements again

7023238

7023289
hide	show
europe it show another select box with a list of countries or hide it if not europe

codelite use gcc g++ as its compiler

7023340
g++	gcc
probably its gcc g++ compiler won t work as you expect on your winos

7023770
spidermonkey	chakra
ideas are floated and must past muster at both the implementer level the guys who write v8 spidermonkey jsc chakra etc. and then the actual user level user in this case being web developers writing code to run in those engines

7023877
button	checkbox
i think that i could add a at first invisible checkbox to the xml layout of each listview item and after the user clicks edit i would set a flag in the list adapter to make the checkbox visible and show the move and delete button

7023892
inherited	subclassing
a mapped to table a is the top-most parent class and its inherited mapping strategy is means each of its subclassing is mapped to a single table

7023939
post	get
there are two types of methods that exist when submitting a get and post

7023942

7024042
superclass	subclassing
what is use of creating subclassing reference to superclass object

7024093
unix	bsd
if there is a good general book on developing for either bsd or at t unix i would be interested in that

7024116
superclass	subclassing
one reason is so you can call methods that appear in the subclassing that do not appear in override the methods of the superclass

7024136
button	checkbox
i have a button that suppose to get all the checked checkbox and the account name associated with it

7024210

7024382
rss	feed
click the on the orange rss feed icon then you will find the feed for the photostream

7024406
mouseup	mousedown
flash manages to handle everything nicely it just turns out that you should watch out when using mouseevent.click because if you swap the image object during a reload after you have done a mousedown but before a mouseup flash won t dispatch the click event as you haven t caused a mousedown and mouseup on the same object

7024420
uiview	caanimation
i know apple recommends blocks instead of the old uiview animation methods uiview beginanimations etc but what about caanimation

if there were an upper limit you wouldn t be able to count on it remaining unchanged across even minor versioning upgrade

7026092
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
there are a number of things that can affect how the sqldataadapter ultimately handles versioning but my guess is that you either have a timestamp on the table or there is a sqlcommandbuilder that is generating the sqlcommand through the getupdatecommand method which ultimately checks all the values in the row in the database against the previous values in the row that you updated the datarow stores the previous version of the row for comparison

7026255
set	bag
a more standard approach is to set the collection-type property on the bag mapping to a custom type - an implementation of iusercollectiontype which you can choose to make a base class that mycollection derives from

there are two directory in home example folder but there are not recognized as folder for sure they are

7029536
hide	fadeout
instead of using fadeout use hide

7029574
width	height
in order to trigger the normal events in autocomplete you can set the autocomplete-results container to a width and height of 0 with a float not sure if thats needed and set the overflow to hidden

7029598
actionscript	haxe
i ve heard of haxe and it seems to be similar to what i want although it introduces a new language that can be converted to c++ actionscript etc

7029646
sqoop	hadoop
i try to import database from mysql to hive with hadoop with automatically create table and load data to hive with --hive-import command from sqoop

7029661
portrait	landscape
so an image in portrait mode might have cords 20 5 and on landscape mode that image will have totally different coordinates

7029661
portrait	landscape
so is there a way that i can set the iboutlets have specific cords on landscape and specific cords on portrait with xcode

7029661
portrait	landscape
i have to store the cgpoints in an array with the cords of iboutlets in landscape and portrait mode and then if the device enters landsape mode set it s center equal to the array elemets

7029679
folder	directory
both git and mercurial use a single directory at the root of your project to store their data so you will never corrupt a working copy by moving folder and files around

7029716
range	minimum
i m trying to find the maximum and minimum number so i can find out what the range is

7029723
hide	show
you can use a navigation controller even for the root level then show hide the navigation bar as necessary when you push or pop items on the navigation stack

7029724
folder	directory
change the current directory to the local working folder i don t know of another way to select the current workspace

7029741
icomparable	compareto
customclass implements icomparable as there is custom sort logic in the compareto method

7029749
mouseup	mousedown
i can detect mousedown and mouseup events but not sure how to do it what i want

7029760
hide	show
so you just need to hide show the editing icons by calling this method

7029762
dbcontext	objectcontext
ef generates a class that derives from objectcontext objectset not dbcontext dbset

7029798
folder	directory
your problem is that inside folder directory you can have two directory a and b then the reading retrieve a and b as file names while is_dir receive a full path filename or a relative filename you have two options

7029835
for-loop	arrays
this is done using a for-loop but the arrays you will end up with you can just pass to .apply

7029848
udp	tcp
all robots listen to it with udp sensors and all running guis connect to it via tcp

7029851
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
note that you ll also want to check for mousemove events in between the mouseup mousedown in case the latter two events happen to occur at the same location

7029852
folder	directory
i want to modify that to access the parent directory of thisdir and then create the extracted items folder

7029865
post	get
but that will be a get not a post

7029882
width	height
also often times it s useful to have the dimensions of the bounding box so multimeasuretext returns both the width and the height

7029912
min	max
that said you ll still want to map the strings into floats before calling max or min because otherwise you will be comparing the strings as strings rather than floats

7029918
webkit	gecko	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that fiddle provides the standard css for it and the engine-specific properties for webkit safari google-chrome and gecko firefox

7029922
post	get
if you can get this into a failing test and post it to either the moose mailing list or #moose on irc.perl.org i m sure someone can help sort out what is going on

7029974
portrait	landscape
i ve tried adding in the couple lines in the appdelegate but when it runs the table in the root view doesn t show up and it no longer properly switches between portrait and landscape views

7029979
nsdata	nsstream
then nsmutableurlrequest can accept an nsstream for the body instead of an nsdata so you should create an nsinputstream to read from your file back from disk and upload it

7029984
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
i tested with a launchd daemons that would call nslog test every minute and with a systemd sleep idle time of 1 minute and the systemd never went to sleep

7029992
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox when i close the window the video stops but not in google-chrome or internet explorer

7030007
min	max
i do think this is a particularly nice application to jump into as seemingly simple expressions sums max min of random variables can lead to nightmarish consideration of cases well-suited to the patience of a computer

7030051
hide	show
so i decided to hide the variadic functionality in a macro that swig will never trip over show in a simplified example below

7030081
width	height
i ve tried setting canvas width and height

7030081
width	height
none which are taller or wider than the main floor canvas width height

7030093
hide	show
you could easily get the desired result with a few and then using show hide based on category

7030133
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if your home page is just a uiviewcontroller you can present a uinavigationcontroller modally which will allow you to navigate through to different areas

7030183
google-chrome	firefox
i want to write script and iframe elements in the opened window which works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

7030191
udp	tcp
right now they communicate using udp datagram sockets since a missed packet only means a skipped frame and tcp sockets are too slow

7030191
udp	tcp
i just don t want things to get too messy with opening a bunch of different ports and using udp and tcp sockets at the same time but if that s they only way to do it that s okay

7030192
floating-point	fractions
convert the datetime value to be rounded to a decimal floating-point value representing the whole and fractions number of timespan units

7030202
put	get
but if i do it the other way around i will get whatever i put in #field

7030214
mouse	keyboard
basically i d just like to launch an app which intercepts all the keyboard mouse events and disables anything from happening so the screen seems frozen

7030214
mouse	keyboard
i m thinking maybe there s a winapi where i can catch the events mouse move click keyboard click and then mark the event as handled

7030233
int	boolean
method post location as string test as int 0 reset as boolean 1 as status

7030233
httpresponse	request
if this completes correctly the response to this request will be in the httpresponse

7030245
hash	salt
when the user registers a password you hash a combination of the password and a user-unique random string known as a salt

7030268
int	chars
in each case the chars gets promoted to int before the shift

7030293
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
it shows nicely in ff3 ie7 ie8 and recent versions of safari google-chrome and opera

7030307
width	height
.logo is an a which is an inline element and won t accept width and height

7030310
width	height
i don t think you can set a width or height for an anchor because it is an inline element

7030317
fadein	fadeout
working on my home page where i m cycling through some images using jquery s fadein and fadeout methods

7030317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this behavior only happens in safari and google-chrome not in firefox and ie

7030318
imperative	declarative
xml is declarative not imperative

7030318
imperative	declarative
instead i ve now decided that declarative syntax of view engines razor is much easier to work with than imperative languages

7030320
memcached	apc
if your project size warrants it you d be better off using something like memcached or apc cache to store the cached values for a given period of time

7030336
public	protected
create a private protected or public member in your mdicontainer window

7030336
children	parent
this is useful for parent to child but it should be implemented in different way for parent to many children with synchronization

7030340
width	height
if its because your height and width are being ignored in your .logo class that would be because you need to display block .logo in order for your to respect them

7030345
move	drag
happens when you drag a marker and the shadow move for example

7030392
bitconverter	binaryreader
you can write a private constructor that takes in the byte array and uses a binaryreader or the bitconverter class to read from the byte array you d have to wrap it in a memorystream for binaryreader or to simply convert sections of the byte array to the values you need bitconverter

7030392
bitconverter	binaryreader
at that point you might as well use the binaryreader bitconverter as it will be faster than the marshal class

7030393
width	height
i m running a small application which has an 70 width and 90 height value as the rest of the screen is menus

7030394
japplet	jcomponent
i tried extends japplet jframe jcomponent for the section class but it didn t seem to help

7030550
portrait	landscape
one that describes the portrait orientation and one that describes the landscape orientation

7030558
width	height
don t constrain both width and height then

7030558
width	height
but if you tell your browser to resize your image to height 60 it will automatically make the width 60 to keep the image s proportions and it won t be distorted

7030561
ssid	captivenetwork
captivenetwork provides the ssid of the connected network but not much else

7030572
superclass	subclassing
when subclassing the guideline is that the designated initializer has to call its superclass designated initializer

7030572
superclass	subclassing
another guideline is that the subclassing needs to override the superclass designated initializer to call the new designated initializer

7030572
super	self
designated initializers are chained to each other through messages to super while other initialization methods are chained to designated initializers through messages to self

7030593
udp	tcp
it would be less complex to open tcp sockets on each end and roll your own file transfer protocol on top of it than to implement reliable transfer on top of udp

7030611
post	get
but when dumping it out after the form post i get this value

7030617
mdpi	hdpi
here i explain for ldpi device header you have to do for all you device hdpi mdpi etc

7030617
mdpi	hdpi
i shown header for ldpi device similarly you need to create for mdpi and hdpi device

7030618
iboutlet	ibaction
xcode doesn t automatically delete the iboutlet or ibaction if you hook up objects and get rid of the objects or ibaction

7030643
width	height
in addition to controlling the position of your form the form.move method will allow you to set its size by assigning your values in twips where 1440 twips inch to the width and height parameters

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
and iirc it is relatively easy to add grid grobs to lattice or ggplot2 plots objects for this sort of arbitrary notation annotation etc

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
what doesn t make too much sense is extending ggplot2 or lattice along the lines you are thinking

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
what would be very useful would be if the data processing guts of ggplot2 or lattice were available for others to write actual plotting code on top of

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
ggplot2 in particular and lattice are quite difficult codes to get into to read understand

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
edit the point i was intending to get across was that the interfaces provided by packages like ggplot2 and lattice are necessarily high-level

7030733
pop-up	dialog
statement in my program windows will pop-up a dialog saying dummyservice.exe has stopped working

7030740
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox and google-chrome and it works fine i m wondering if i ll encounter problems in other browsers though

7030797
hide	show
since there will be several sets of data i want to limit the number that can be seen and have the user be able to scroll horizontally to show hide the different sets of data

7030822
post	get
i m trying to use wpdb class to get the post id from the top-level site in a wp-mu environment from one of the sub-sites using a meta value from the sub site

7030825
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the crazy thing is that i have tested this code with ie safari on mac and windows google-chrome and opera and all return data

7030863
google-chrome	firefox
here is my working example on jsfiddle its working on almost every browser i tested it on ie9 firefox google-chrome except ie8 its acting weird class change buttons mavis or test1 only works if you click twice on it

7030885
chunked	transfer-encoding
because its large and will eventually be dynamically generated i decided to use chunked transfer-encoding

7030892
war	manifest.mf
so i am curious to know if there is anything need to be done before one deploy standard spring war on virgo like creating a manifest-inf folder parallel to web-inf folder and adding manifest.mf file in it

7030918
post	get
this post explains how you can get the items of a template based listbox

7030931
content-length	content-type
in particular the host and content-length headers are not optional and the content-type header is usually needed to tell the server how to interpret the body

7030990
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari and google-chrome with no errors in console

7031126
clang	llvm
i have a number of projects built using cmake and i d like to be able to easily switch between using gcc or clang llvm to compile them

7031210
valgrind	callgrind	perf	callgrind
i m used to valgrind callgrind which is of course a totally different approach to the sampling based method of perf

7031233
google-chrome	safari
support for border-radius on images in google-chrome safari or rather webkit seems to be a bit buggy

7031233
google-chrome	safari
you may want to report the bug you re seeing to the webkit google-chrome safari projects

7031233
google-chrome	safari
this would have a few drawbacks as it s only a fix for google-chrome safari example jsfiddle

7031261
udp	tcp
no easy way with tcp but with udp you have multicast

7031278
google-chrome	firefox
it works wonderfully in firefox and in google-chrome but a lot of it won t work in internet explorer

7031278
google-chrome	firefox
try this example in google-chrome firefox and ie

7031278
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in google-chrome and firefox but once i try it in ie it gives me an error

7031328
folder	directory
this war file which is part of an ear is exploded in the target directly and i need to copy a file version.properties to the web-inf classes folder of this exploded war directory target mywebapp-1.3.2.war

7031339
getter	setter
if the number of element in the array is fixed i would only provide a getter for the array and leave off the setter

7031343
shadowing	named
the use of the shadowing named in the inner scopes is thus on average closer to their declaration and less ambiguous

7031343
shadowing	named
allowing shadowing also allows to keep using descriptive named that are sufficiently to the point even if they are the same as al already used named instead of inventing other weird named â like prefixing them with my local or worse _ or single-letter namesâ

7031358
operands	decrement
the prefix decrement increases the value of its operands before it has been evaluated

7031453
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use gridview s events such as rowdatabound or rowediting

7031528
int	boolean	int	chars
i don t know if it applies to your case because we lack that information but you can always pass your values as strings since it can represent pretty much anything boolean chars int longs floats etc.

7031547
post	get
one way could be to get the last row of datagrid using this post and set it s height to

7031566
width	height
i have a container that has a border radius of 150px the container has 300px of height and width

7031583
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i set that last 48px to 18px it shows fine in firefox does not round at all in google-chrome safari square edges

7031583
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i leave it as is at 48px it makes a huge smoothly rounded corner as it should in firefox here s what i get in google-chrome safari

7031610
rss	feed
the best i can do is work with content providers to offer rss feed and such

7031651
draggable	droppable
jqueryui s draggable and droppable can make this easy

7031651
draggable	droppable
draggable requires 0 effort an droppable gives you the exact coordinates

7031690
firefox	safari
i m using firefox 5.0.1 also tried with safari and firefox on windows

7031711
ant	maven
i m having trouble producing a bundle after converting a maven project to an ant project

7031723
opencv	emgucv
i invoke the following opencv method emgucv wrapper which detects faces in several threads simultaneously

7031779
getter	setter
no except that you could use a getter and setter like this which delegates the setting of a variable so that you can check whether it is to set at one time

7031787
width	height
the setgeometry seems to work since width and position change accordingly but funnily enough the height doesnâ t budge

7031787
hide	show	qmainwindow	qwidget
nb if i create the same scenario using a qwidget rather than qmainwindow and using a show or hide on the child widget then i can resize the parent with adjustsize without problem it seems the problem here above is qmainwindow specific

7031806
int	chars	16-bit	64bit
chars is 16-bit short is 16-bit int is 32-bit and long is 64bit

7031829
exponent	modulo
i m trying to convert string public key to publickey with modulo and exponent

7031834
getter	setter
this gives each object it s own history as in it can check multiple values not just one - as with the getter setter stuff mentioned in other answers and is guaranteed to work in any scope as all functionality is contained within the defined object

7031837
ant	maven
i also prefer ant script over maven

7031939
width	height
the custom refresh loop just calculates the change in width and height that is desired per 25 ms and then sets the new width to the rect

7031974
post	get
you could just use to get the post data from the form directly without needing to get the values for each input

7031976
put	get
a tip when your asynchronously getting images from the website create a custom view is a delegate of nsurlrequest get the data from a webpage parse the data into a uiimage using imagewithdata and when the finished delegate method is called put a imageview on top of the custom view

7032001
oncreate	recreate
your application will then call oncreate for your sqliteopenhelper and your database will be recreate

7032009
submit	submission
if you want to use a pure html-submit button you ll have to disable the button and disabling submit over enter or set a flag that prevents submission as other users have already stated in their answers

7032045
rvm	bundler
to have many different rubies installed at the same time without conflicting with each other you ll use rvm and to make sure all your app dependencies are defined your rails app has to use bundler or maybe something else that does the same

7032060
jsf	seam
hopefully someone wiser in the ways of jsf and seam it won t take much i m still new to both will be able to enlighten me

7032060
jsf	seam
like i said i m new to jsf and seam

7032060
jsf	seam
if there is an obvious better way to get a simple string from the backend to the frontend in a seam jsf application i m all ears

7032151
median	minimum
and u k is the mean or minimum maximum or median of the

7032163
hash	salt
let s say you hash the password with a salt and store that in your local sqllite db

7032163
hash	salt
now when a disconnected user types in their username and password your code will have to hash what they typed add the salt and compare it against a value in the local db

7032165
dumpsys	adb
adb shell dumpsys meminfo your apps package name

7032171
profiler	gprof
in fact the well-known profiler gprof was created specifically to try to address the uselessness of self-time-only profiling not that it succeeded

7032185
icmp	tcp
icmp messages sit directly on top of ip and thus there s no concept of a port since that s introduced by tcp

7032195
memset	malloc
with the same function signature i think the size parameter should represent the size of the value parameter to make a malloc memset of it and save it in your list

7032224
post	get
here are 2 simple methods which sends off either get or post and returns a string response

7032230
width	height
every class have x y width height property

7032326
rss	feed
i am setting up a portfolio site for my articles and i am going to bring in feed of all my articles straight from the sites they are posted on via their rss feed

7032326
rss	feed
i can use the shortcodes to set up a div with the url for the rss feed as a data attribute data-content-url or i can simply write the parsing function in php and link it straight from the shortcode parser

7032335
width	height
this image always starts at the top left 0 0 position but i m not sure how much height and width is will require

7032339
width	height
you have width 100 and height 100 on the links in the menu which messes with their size in ie

7032339
width	height
you can give the object layout by setting the height or width property setting the position property to absolute setting the writingmode property to tb-rl or setting the contenteditable property to true

7032383
youtube	vimeo
i need to make an html page that will play video 1 youtube and once video 1 is done will instantly play video 2 vimeo and once video 2 is done will play video 3 brightcove

7032383
youtube	vimeo
the thing is i want to do this with external videos from vimeo youtube brightcove players which means the videos will not be in my directory

7032427
hash	md5
return a new md5 hash object

7032474
pull	push
the only difference for you is that depending on your current location you ll have to push pull etc from one remote or the other

7032485
hide	show
this will hide and show the cursor for a split second

7032488
int	double
assuming age is of type int use if it s a double

7032531
google-chrome	safari
before safari 5.1 came out i noticed that the images were nice and smooth in safari but kind of jagged in google-chrome

7032531
google-chrome	safari
now safari 5.1 seems to be just as bad as google-chrome

7032531
firefox	safari
one shows scaling in safari and the other one in firefox

7032569
children	parent
edit to add an example when this may go wrong - if the constructor of child tries to access the children collection of its parent then it forces evaluation of the lazy value before it can be created and you get a runtime error which is what the warning says

7032573
google-chrome	firefox
windows 7 google-chrome and or firefox

7032627
button	checkbox
at the bottom of the page i have a div with form containing text checkbox and submit button there is also client side validation to check if the checkbox is ticked as its mandatory

7032671
setinterval	settimeout
and i think you want to use settimeout rather than setinterval because you only want the timer to fire once for each message being shown

7032680
post	get
finally a good book should discuss in more depth than an so post can do and thus you will get information at a deeper level than just the code to fix your current problem

7032685
put	get
thus you get the files and you put them in the repository

7032685
nexus	artifactory
a release repository like artifactory or nexus can get you out of the loop

7032709
int	double	int	chars
undefined reference to func3 chars int double |

7032710
onclick	onmouseup
using onmouseup and other events instead of onclick nope

7032713
post	put
don t put the author bio in the post content use a custom field for example and display it when appropriate

7032772
post	get
requestparam is about http get post parameters

7032788
google-chrome	firefox
and here s a screenshot of what it looks like in firefox google-chrome and ie9

7032825
rss	feed
as bensiu noted it would be easier to use the rss feed

7032830
google-chrome	safari
it never runned on google-chrome or safari

7032853
children	parent
so that may also influence whether your parent or children have had their related code executed yet

7032858
post	get
the callback function on the post request returns a boolean value and i m trying to get the entire function to return that boolean value

7032866
min	max
i m trying to offset the x y position of a uislider s min and max value images

7032866
min	max
however i m my min max value images may change size dynamically so i m not sure how to properly implement it in this case

7032913
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
usually the app loads i put nslogs in viewdidload viewdidappear and viewwillappear and they all show up in the console then it crashes

7032941
implements	extends
i admit that generics is like magic to me but i can somehow acknowledge that foodelegator is not a foo that extends delegator foo it simply implements both interfaces

7033001
pop-up	dialog
if one or more such breakpoints exist then a dialog pop-up letting you select the ones that you want to restrict to only apply to the given object instance

7033083
button	checkbox
event validation ensures that every option available in a constrained input dropdown checkbox list radio button list has been registered before render

7033083
put	get
seems to me that 600 is just too much for a dropdown and you could get a lot more bang for your bandwidth buck if you put a little more into narrowing down the user s choices a little more dynamically.

7033086
jsf	seam
you are trying to call a seam action from jsf where that action calls some gwt code

7033101
profiling	debugging
it however has very good tools for debugging php including allowing you to run a server via phped to test your site and allowing you to debugging in multiple versions of php and perhaps more importantly a profiling to find bottlenecks in your code

7033138
post	put
incoming post data but not put

7033144
min	max
you can first check for bounds-rectangle collision min and max x y positions of each polygon make a bounding rectangle and if they overlap at all you then need to check each individual line segment for collision

7033153
public	protected
instances of foo only know about themselves the public interface of their members and the public protected interface of their base class if they have one

7033156
websphere	ibm
version 7.x of ibm websphere application server was

7033162
postgresql	mysql
ideally the dump should work for mysql postgresql sqlite etc

7033162
postgresql	mysql
at least mysql and postgresql

7033231
google-chrome	safari
the file uploader is working but the callback to refresh the page dom isn t working in google-chrome or safari

7033259
jscrollpane	jviewport
the jscrollpane should be painting behind the jviewport which should be painting behind the list

so as you loop through each checkbox you can use this in conjunction with the append to append the button to each checkbox

7034040

rss	feed
it s more extensible -- if you use something like drupal s aggregate facility or a plugin like feedwordpress not sure what your cms platform is if any the rss feed of tracks you re using can also be taken and used elsewhere by your users thus potentially increasing the size of your audience

your best option if you don t want to use multiple attributes is to either a merge the assemblies so that they can just naturally share internal s or b make certain key internal members public or protected and make those the integration points for the other assemblies

7034944
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

width	height
let s say i have a logo with the dimensions 150px in width by 40px in height and i want to contain it at the top of a 820px wide container

7035067
width	margin
so far this has been fine for me as it gets the job done however i still believe that the container with the width set to 100 is overhead unneeded and that there s a better way to be able to use the margin property properly on content below the logo without it messing up because no container above it has the width of 100

7035078
min	max
windows.h defines macros named min and max like so

7035093

7035099
set	bag
all collection mappings except those with set and bag semantics need an index column in the

7035138
free	calloc
we play it safe here checking that the pointer address is valid before freeing with free because we ll allocate with calloc -- these are c level memory allocation functions that persist across calls in to c unlike r_alloc and clearing the pointer to signal that it has already been finalized

7035178
width	height
making a ui object invisible or reducing its size in width height to 0 will simply mean the gpu won t have to process it in the same way regardless of whether it is on screen or off

i add the hidden attribute and post the same data i get the above error

7035242

it s a good idea to put it inside the on instanceready function so you don t get an undefined error

7035272
hash	hmac
if the length of the code is important you can truncate the hash produced by the hmac but bear in mind that the shorter you truncate it the more practical a brute-force attack is

7035318
google-chrome	firefox
while i doubt this is how firefox google-chrome does it it would be possible to archive your goal with out sockets and relying solely on the file system

7035387
pop-up	dialog
the firefoxprofile part is to dismiss the confirmation dialog because by default firefox will show a pop-up dialog to prevent pishing

7035424
floating-point	integer
binary_double is a floating-point representation not an integer

7035425
google-chrome	firefox
i changed z-index of the p element but it won t cover the part of the image i m attempting it to cover - i believe it s an ie issue as this works with firefox and google-chrome

7035527
google-chrome	firefox
i want my swf to fill the browser window but it s not working in google-chrome firefox unless the user manually resizes the browser

it starts with a random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 obtained from the function random_normal which implements the boxâ muller transform and then transforms it to a random variable with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.5 in the rands array via multiplication and addition

7035567
pull	push
let s say you pull the latest from home1 make some changes and push them back

i am making a website where the scroll bar is not showing in any browser.....in firefox i can use down key to move downwards in google-chrome it worst...i am showing my codes below and i used div tag for division of page.

7035763
width	margin
with specified width and margin 0 auto

in other places i want to know about the specific types - in the implementation of my example ialpha ibeta interfaces i want the children to be typed the same as their parent

7035844

size_t is a typedef for an unsigned integer type

7035844
integer	unsigned
i suppose in c# you could use a 64-bit unsigned integer type

7035847
post	get
i can t seem to get back into the account i used to post this question so i have to post my follow-up to tim s question in the comments for the previous answer as a new answer

viewdidload	viewdidappear
i moved audiosession init from viewdidload to viewdidappear and the sound is not low anymore

7035869
folder	directory
if that doesn t work and apache still doesn t have access to usr local bin directory make a apache folder there and give full access to apache on that folder and link convert to that folder

7035943
int	boolean
boolean floats int longs and strings

7035954
public	protected
unfortunately it isn t public or protected so you can t simply derive from it and override the close method removing the check for whether the folder is open

7035976
min	max
i looked at the documentation and there doesn t seem to be a way to achieve that with the combination of connection lifetime max pool size and min pool size

7035986
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux ubuntu and python django

7036008
hash	salt
since i m ideally taking a salt hash of the password before i store it in the database it s going to have a fixed length due to the hash function and so limiting the password length doesn t reduce the database size whatsoever

7036009
hash	salt
you should store a salt cryptographic hash of the user s password which can have a limited size in the database and check the tendered password by hashing it and comparing it with the stored hash

7036029
sorting	filtering
it should not be about tasks like restructuring the dom to be a certain way sorting and filtering through data and so on - unless there is a compelling reason

7036030
hide	show
if the mouse hover on the tab2 li then cdmore li hide and the ebmore li show

7036036
jtable	jprogressbar
i have added multiple jprogressbar to tablecolumn of jtable

7036050
put	get
so for example you can go to www.gamespot.com get list like the one below and put them in your database

7036141
int	double
so if you declare two overloaded versions of fun1 in the base class say fun1 void and fun1 int and then declare another version of fun1 in the derived class say fun1 double the function in the derived class will hide both fun1 functions inherited from the base class

7036149
for-loop	arrays
you should iterate an arrays with this type of for-loop

7036177
accessor	properties
i have tried several method to remove the dummy properties of the get and set accessor like type.deletefield but it seems doesn t work

7036220

you are supposed to put the address on the get method

7036296

7036336
tabs	tabpanel
the goal is to create an app which has a tabpanel containing four tabs one of them should be a map the others are a nestedlist and two panels working like a charm

7036366
subtract	add
inheritance would mean that calc.h can modify the implementation of add and subtract which it can t since it only contains declarations

7036379
post	get
basically make sure that you re using post as opposed to get in your requests

7036388
children	parent
what you are referring to is merely the semantic setup of your tabs which acts just like parent and children elements

7036414
post	get
so unless something has changed post is 2006 it appears you ll need to use it s dll to get the text

7036423
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
added a grid which binds its width height to the fixedpage actualwidth actualheight to achieve centering

7036440

if rtf html doc format you can easily do this

7036519
width	height
basically when you put the url of an image in one field i d like to populate another field with the name of the image height and width via javascript

7036521
for-loop	arrays
you need to make a new datatemp for each iteration of the for-loop otherwise you are just passing the same object into the arrays each time and modifying it s values

7036618
post	get
the moment you submit the form the browser will initiate a post method and your post version of action would get called

7036666

if you want it inside the image view it should have origin x 0 y 0 and the same width and height as your imageview

7036668
inherited	properties
in the following code i am trying to implement inherited and polymorphism properties my question is obj1.hello3 1param 2param obj1.hello3 11param are these statements not correct what would be the correct way of doing this

7036690
ubuntu	linux
i am new linux ubuntu and python my ubuntu come with python2.6.6 installed in it.i newly install python 2.7 and again installed django

hash	md5
an sql injection requires using characters like or thus a hash string that was generated by md5 won t cause an sql injection ever considering that the algorithm works expectedly

7042263
hash	md5
if you have hash a value with md5 it no longer contains any maliciously injectable characters

7042263
hash	md5
mysql will not decode the md5 hash and interpret execute it as sql

7042263
hash	md5
in fact the md5 hash cannot be decoded as it is a one-way algorithm

it seems that the htmlpanel is not fully rendered yet as the dialog pop-up so miglayout does not know what to do with it

7042277
width	height
manually specifying the width and height of the dialog so that the html page fits in it does nothing

7042277
pop-up	dialog
my workaround as of now is to delay the pop-up dialog by 500ms to ensure the htmlpanel finished navigating

7042297
hash	md5
md5 hash values are binary data which are represented hexadecimal in php

7042336

â if your picker is in the way hide other objects then it should be dismissable preferably by touching the background and by a button that show up together with your picker and dismisses with your picker

7042507

but this is working in both firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

7042510

7042544
accessor	properties
in terms of ownership you own the object returned by alloc-init and then the properties accessor claims ownership of the object again resulting in the object being over-retained

7042544
accessor	properties
the properties accessor copies the original object and now the properties holds a pointer to the copy and you lost track of the original object immediately leaking it

7042561
hash	md5
md5 hash values themselves can t cause an sql injection but if you re trying to avoid an sql injection your approach is a very good way to cause one

7042597
collabnet	svn

7042605
accessor	properties
you don t use the properties accessor

i have tried changing the parameters of glviewport and glorthof to width 2 and height 2 but the textures still do not scale at all they remain exactly the same

7042665

7042672

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that javascript makes the img without a trailing slash in safari 5.0.5 in firefox 4.0.1 in ie8 and in google-chrome 13 -- so everywhere near as i can tell as in html5 it is optional

7043136
int	chars
a chars is a 1byte int

7043138
jdom	dom4j
if you want to generate an xml document you have many choices dom jdom dom4j jaxb or even plain string concatenation although i would not recommend it except if all you need to do is generating such a small document with only one dynamic attribute

7043164
google-chrome	firefox
i was doing this by using the session variable but i came to realize that this works badly on firefox and google-chrome and i abandoned that idea and decided to pass the values by query string

7043308
google-chrome	safari
where it doesn t work is ie8 on windows 7 as well we mac os 10.7 safari 5.1.7 and google-chrome version 13.0.782.112 on the same mac

7043349
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the html5 data block-based way shown here works in firefox in opera in webkit-based browsers such as google-chrome and safari and in ie9 while ie s xml data islands work only in ie

7043361
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that a div tag has the style overflow auto which apparently is not implemented well with webkit which is used by safari and google-chrome see emanuele greco s answer

7043370
cpu	hyperthreading
single core just means one cpu operation at a time assuming there s no hyperthreading - not one overall operation at a time

7043630
width	height
the width and height parameters from gldrawtextfoes are in pixels

7043630

therefore instead of using 64 pixels for the width and height parameters you should use variables that scales the width and height globally and if needed select a part of the texture using texture cropping

7043633
gridview	detailsview
master-detail with the gridview detailsview and modalpopup controls

7043633

i figured out that iscroll doesn t play nice with our rss feed reader zrssfeed for jquery

7043656
stdout	stderr
the buffering logic for stdout and stderr is buried within libc and to change it you need to fool the application to think it s writing to a terminal

7043705

couchbase	couchdb
couchsync is basically what couchbase is calling couchdb replication

7044180
couchbase	couchdb
it is very simple to setup in both couchbase server couchbase single server and in couchdb

7044180
membase	couchdb
since membase doesn t provide any of the couchdb support it doesn t actually fit into this diagram and therfore doesn t support couchsync

7044180
membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb	couchbase	couchdb
you will actually want to look at the developer preview of couchbase server since this product has both membase and couchdb features

7044180

i think you might be able to get away with not using it if all you want is .text but the ctype gives you access to all of the textbox s properties not just it s inherited properties and also you might need to do checkboxes or other controls at some point where you pretty much have to ctype in order to get to .ischecked etc

7044324
int	chars
your my_char should be int because that s what fgetc returns using a chars will mean that you ll never find your eof condition

7044324
int	chars
the eof value is an int that is not a valid chars that s how you can detect the end of a file while reading it one byte at a time and from the fine manual

7044324
int	chars
if the int value returned by fgetc is stored into a variable of type chars and then compared against the int constant eof the comparison may never succeed because sign-extension of a variable of type chars on widening to int is implementation-defined

7044371
textview	simplecursoradapter
simplecursoradapter is just that - a simple way to bind fields from a db to a textview of some sort

7044388
width	height
additionally specifying the exact width and height of the child a is redundant

7044437

from the sender and no i want to get the data in post

7044444
salt	md5
i want to use md5 encryption with a salt

7044463
hash	salt
some even regenerate hash with new salt upon each successful login of given user although commenters below argue this is not the best idea see comments

7044498
hash	salt
to answer your original question the salt is stored alongside the hash password in the database

7044498
hash	salt
the salt is not meant to be secret if the hash password is discovered

7044507
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it was developed using firefox for testing and works as expected in firefox safari and google-chrome

7044521
width	height
i m not sure why exactly as pg1 s width and height are set by op1 s but there is probably a very valid reason

7044570
gridview	sqldatasource
my gridview uses as sqldatasource

7044574
subtract	add
today while i was trying to write a code to just add subtract the two 2 2 matrices in which i used switch statement i got an error case bypass initialization of local variable in function main

7044594
hash	salt
okay so salt are used for both one-way hash and encryption

7044594
hash	salt
the salt is a random string or set of bits properly that is cryptographically combined with the user s input to produce a more secure hash

7044594
hash	salt
for example if the string to be hash is still kiwi and our salt is 5m3d a simple salt mechanism might concatenate the two into kiwi5m3d

7044594
hash	salt
you will have to save the salt somewhere because it s the only way to know what s been hash or encrypted

7044594
hash	salt
in the case of a hash you compare the user s original hash against the salt hash of their input

7044610
antialiasing	transparent
for antialiasing images it just looks like the image is surrounded by 0.5px transparent line and then black border around that

7044627
distance	polygons
well the distance to these two points is very large while in fact you are very close to the polygons

7044629
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
if you are using the objectoutputstream for serialization and wrapping it around a fileoutputstream then the objects will go into that file

7044646
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in firefox and also google-chrome

7044667
getter	setter
the author may choose to use structures because he doesn t want to bother the reader about oop principles and best practices he doesn t want you to say hey why he defined this field public and not private with setter and getter

7044689
nhibernate	automapper
i downloaded the source code i compiled myself and it s working now with the automapper in fluent nhibernate maybe can work for you meanwhile the people of system.data.sqlite relase a new version

7044697
draggable	droppable
if a user has a draggable move around the layout and change the position of the droppable

7044697
draggable	droppable
i have a sortable with a cloned helper that still fires the receive callback on my droppable even though it should only work with draggable receive callback works

7044707
yslow	pagespeed
you can use the gtmetrix tool yslow or google s pagespeed to see how all of these impact it but this gtmetrix tool is generally awesome and combines features for you as well as doing some auto-generations that give you the improved versions of css files etc

7044736
hide	show
hide and show them

7044797
post	put
lock the file briefly create a copy of the database file and upload it via put post to my server via an api

codeigniter	kohana
check out uhoh written by dan horrigan a port of kohana s error handling system for codeigniter

7044906
hash	salt
in my experience a salt sha1 hash is pleanty secure for 99 of web application situations

7044908
csv	tsv
surround your cell values with double quotes it will allow you to import the data in a tsv or csv format without having to worry about the carriage returns being interpreted as a new row

7044908
csv	tsv
you could also use the fputcsv function from php to export a tsv or csv file that excel can read

7044997
ant	maven
i could do this in about 5 minutes with ant and i havn t eliminated the possibility of simply writing a shell script to do it but i would like to give maven a chance first

7045005
getter	setter
however you can write custom getter and setter to use nsinteger properties

7045091
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome i get a ton of alerts saying attribute found but in ie i get nothing

7045125
mouseup	mousedown
to prevent this i only perform the logic once on the first mousedown trigger the logic s simple enough that i don t care if two invocations happen to race but you might then ignore any other mousedown triggers until a mouseup occurs

7045163
post	get
that s because querystring is for get requests not post

7045183
mouse	keyboard
the other qt virtual keyboard implementations that i ve seen don t need their keyboard buttons to gain focus since they are touch or mouse operated

7045215
springboard	backgrounding
i m not sure why it was looking like it was graphics related and involving the springboard process but as soon as i added a sleep 1 at the end of the loop the cpu usage no longer rose when the app was placed in the backgrounding

7045215
springboard	backgrounding
there is still a quick spike of cpu for the second or so after it s placed in the backgrounding and springboard spikes as well but just for a second then cpu usage drops back to the same as when the app is running

7045219
int	chars
i am padding int for barcodes with leading zeros so they have same number of chars for example

7045224

both simpleadapter and simplecursoradapter have an inner class named viewbinder with method setviewvalue

7045236
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

7045237
ant	maven
if you choose to use ant do it but maven is not the right tool for this job

7045237
ant	maven
if you really need this done by maven though there is a maven ant plugin which lets you run ant tasks in maven and you could bind this to your deploy step

7045266
width	height
when you set the width and height properties of the textblock control it will first horizontally increase in size to accommodate as much text as it can before wrapping the text if the textwrapping property is set to wrap

7045367
width	height
if you want to draw a texture with pixel accuracy 1 1 texel to pixel then you need to provide a width and height to the vertex positions that is equal to the texture s size not the screen size

7045373
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i think if you want to do this with a uinavigationbar that does not work in conjunction with a uinavigationcontroller you need to create a custom view for the button that is shaped like the back button

7045406
put	get
in my sql database the table.field corresponding to those workings is job.phase so when i put in my report details the field job.phase i get 3 rows for that job

sqldatasource	objectdatasource
use the approach in this article except with objectdatasource instead of sqldatasource

7045477
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i do the same in one of my app s and i use the viewwillappear and viewdidappear to accomplish this

7045489
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there are only 3 browsers that support websockets right now though google-chrome firefox and safari

7045498
post	get
i cannot get the parameters of my post because in ie it sends a get the firsttime then on subsequent calls it sends post and everything works fine

7045524
put	get
it s going to get some serious attention in the future but right now i need to put a band-aid on it

7045565
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear will be called each time that view will did show on the screen so this is where you d want to refresh your view or data

7045652
cos	sin
return sin 2 t cos p

7045775
aggregate-functions	sum
it might make more sense to use an aggregate-functions for orderdetail.quantity -- in other words set orderdetail.original_quantity on create then calculate orderdetail.quantity as orderdetail.original_quantity minus the sum of the relevant purchase detail quantities

7045820
folder	directory
i made a console game using visual c# 2008 express the entire game only uses stuff from the system namespace no fancy third party libraries and all it requires is 2 folder in the root directory for storing xml files that it creates

7045979
jobs	cron
if so is there a way to further prevent this apart from adding the address to some whitelists or setting up domain keys or unix cron jobs

7045984
google-chrome	safari
i ve managed to duplicate these symptoms on only google-chrome win safari win and safari mac

7045984
opera	firefox
i have validated the html and the same page tests fine in ie9 win firefox win and opera win

7045984
google-chrome	firefox
css google-chrome issue at footer cross browsers ie firefox google-chrome

7046028
jobs	cron
this is similar to the nix cron jobs approach you know of except that it is executed at run time - you create say one thread for every 5 addresses you are sending and then all the threads send out 5 mails one after the other

7046036
hide	show
showintaskbar exclusively decides show hide effect in this case thanks to pinowthebird for nudging me to take a re-look

7046036
hide	show
setting formborderstyle to fixeddialog also hide the maximize minimize buttons and show up in task bar although the default icon is now lost not sure why

7046044
width	margin
for example if the togglebutton has the width of 100 then the margin -50 0 50 0 would shift it to the left by half

7046089
unixodbc	iodbc
i ve tried with both unixodbc and iodbc but i can t seem to get it to work.

7046144
execl	fork
the harder -- but arguably more correct -- answer is to avoid system and do fork + execl yourself checking the execl to see if it results in enoent or similar

7046160
apache	nginx
now my question is whether i should use nginx purely or i should continue using apache with nginx

7046160
apache	nginx
so now the problem is switching to nginx means that i would not be able to use the rewrite rules that i am using in apache

7046184
acts-as-taggable-on	will-paginate
so instead of using kaminari and rolling my own tagging i ve switched to acts-as-taggable-on and will-paginate

7046218
backgrounding	multitasking
the only things you should do when supporting multitasking is saving the state of your app when it enters the backgrounding and reload it when it becomes active

7046218
backgrounding	multitasking
the only thing that would crash your app that is unique to multitasking would be trying to run code in the backgrounding for longer than the allotted amount of time which is 10 minutes. otherwise it sounds like you have got other problems with your code

7046243
int	boolean
where a a boolean b and c both int unequal to 0

7046264
projectile	angle
then from there take the rotation angle of the tank to determine which angle the projectile should go after it s been fired

7046271
width	height
making the width 100 is as simple as setting width 100 the height is a bit harder

7046293
ostream	istream
you can also define and to work with istream and ostream to serialize and restore your class as well if you want that syntactic sugar

7046318
apache	nginx
you could still use the rewrite rules from apache with slight modifications i took this from nginx primer

7046318
apache	nginx
i would also research any apache modules that your relying on and ensure that the nginx equivalents include the same functionality

7046318
apache	nginx
in the end if your goal is better performance then the migration from apache to nginx should be worth it

7046349
serializable	deserialization
an alternative is to use a delimiter and escaping but requires more code and is slower both on serializable and deserialization however the result can be kept human readable

7046368
heroku	engineyard
rspec engineyard heroku rails ruby commands bundlles

7046371
hide	show
now you can add the class to the body to hide everything and remove the class to show everything again

7046374
int	double
here s the version using _minval double instead of int side-effects and some twists of mine now that eric has done the hard work

7046425
int	boolean
if you were inclined to such perversity you could represent int as zero-padded binary strings using str.format and then coerce the string of the form 00101 into a boolean list by doing something terrible like this

7046427
std	ostream
you might want to give your classes void myclass serialize std ostream and void myclass deserialize std ifstream and call those

7046428
activemq	rabbitmq
rabbitmq is an amqp broker while activemq is a jms one

7046428
activemq	rabbitmq
besides that rabbitmq s system configuration is erlang-esque while activemq is usually configured in xml

7046428
activemq	rabbitmq
rabbitmq is usually installed with os packages while activemq distributions are archives you drop anywhere or maven deps you embed into something else

7046448
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i just had to make some minor modifications to the non-ie print stylesheet to get things working in google-chrome firefox and safari and then i was good to go

7046473
titlebar	window
so i finaly created a workaround i start glut on one thread on an other thread i created a fullscreen window with a transparent background and created a dynamic backgroundimage png with a viewport with just the size of the glut window without the titlebar

7046503
width	height
you could use a separate div positioned absolutely with width and height set to 100

7046535
post	get
problem is it seems mechanize isn t keeping the cookies between the post call and the get call shown below

7046535
post	get
i ve verified that click ing links on the page that returns from the post call works but i can t actually get to where i need to go without javascript

7046548
qlineedit	qlabel
since it seems like you don t need the true editing capabilities of qlineedit replace it with a qlabel

7046555
jhat	yourkit
in my memory profiling tool using yourkit and jmap jhat i can force a gc that sometimes will immediately get rid of my classloader but then other times depends on application usage but that s as specific as i can get when i force the gc the cl instance doesn t go away

7046602
put	get
remember to get vc9 version of xdebug for new php and if you put your new php in directory other than

iâ m currently working on www.liganet.net and it looks ok in google-chrome and firefox

7046693
stdout	stderr
distinguish stdout from stderr on pipe

7046727
email	dkim
dkim requires some configuration of the mail server that s actually sending the mail for you but can help greatly with deliverability especially to large email providers

7046728
folder	directory
just open iis configuration manager and create a virtual directory that points to the folder where you have the web.config and the bin subfolder

7046758
post	get
it took me a little time to get it right so i figured i d post it here

7046798
google-chrome	firefox
it works well in google-chrome and in ie but it fails on firefox

7046827
mouse	keyboard
however once in fullscreen keyboard focus is lost and the user has to click the mouse to regain it

7046834
backgrounding	multitasking
the same thing happens as well after your app goes into the backgrounding when implementing multitasking - when the app returns to the foreground nothing is animating

7046845
google-chrome	firefox
i have a method working for firefox and google-chrome but it doesn t work in ie

7046866
for-loop	arrays
it s just a dummy example you can run the for-loop through you record arrays

7046884
width	height
i have tried decreasing the height width but it dosnt seem to have an effect on memory usage

7046886
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to convert a google-chrome extension to firefox using addon sdk jetpack

7046907
width	height
changing the width and height doesn t mean much memory wise since the same image file is being loaded

7046955
mouseup	mousedown
i ll give you an example and let you decide assume you have a path drawn from a beginning point p m mousedown to an endpoint mouseup p n

7046955
for-loop	arrays
step through your arrays think for-loop recalculating the line with those points updating the curve from p 0 to p n-3

7047002
wordpress	joomla
i m trying to use dreamweaver with an existing code base not wordpress drupal or joomla

7047002
wordpress	joomla
8 tried designating the server ports as 8888 8889 and defining server route as like setting up a drupal wordpress joomla

7047002
folder	directory
after reinstall created new site with site manage sites and defined local site folder in site menu and the server folder in the server menu as the same directory

7047013
int	chars
i also can t just use the objective-c bool since it is an unsigned chars and not an int

7047028
rss	feed
for instance here is how i style one of the rss feed on one of my sites

7047056
put	get
it s useful to drop variable as a term it s just a label you put on an object a handle you can use to get through to the object nothing more

7047074
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with google-chrome firefox safari and ie8

7047125
junit	testng
you can use assert.assertequals on pretty much any collection with testng and probably junit as well

7047127
ant	maven
i m guessing you are new to both maven and ant

7047128
screens	tablet
on a tablet this is a waste of space and you often want to display several activities worth of content on a single screens

7047131
disk	ram
yes it is exposed in ram and unless the operating system supports protection of memory against paging and the application uses that feature the private key can be paged to disk in the clear. development tools and active attacks can look for it in memory

7047132
jar	manifest.mf
you just add the jar files into the main jar and then announce the libraries on your manifest.mf file

7047158
width	height
edit creating and appending an iframe and simply setting its height and width to 100 works but isn t the goal here

7047176
post	get
yes clicking a link creates a get request so wouldn t keep any of the post data

7047246
entities	entitymanager
entitymanager on the client that passes requests for entities to the server and at the end passes all entities back to the server for a batch persist action where classes can re- validate their data apply some transactional operations updating and stuff and be all persisted nicely by the jpa implementation

7047246
csla	devforce	csla	.net
now there is a shift to .net where there have recently appeared similarly-working but more advanced frameworks like devforce and csla

7047315
post	get
you might want to adjust your variables there to accept either get or post

7047315
post	get
then your php page will be better equipped to handle either get or post

7047340
filtering	grouping
i thought that if server mode lets you do filtering and grouping on the database there should definitely be a way to do it without paging support

7047354
int	chars
there are a couple of ways you can do this but they all pretty much rely on converting an int to a string reversing the order of the chars inserting a delimiter between every third chars and reversing the order once more

7047413
scheme	racket
it has a sophisticated type system designed to match the idioms of racket scheme code and it interoperates with untyped modules by protecting typed functions with dynamic software contracts also implemented via macros

7047437
post	get
i have tried createelement input and such from within javascript but i cannot ever get the form to post the input value

7047465
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade my solutions to vs2010 and i am also using the ultimate versioning

7047465
versioning	upgrade
so upgrade them to vs2010 versioning or disable them and see whether there is any difference.

7047488
put	get
get build number from user and put it in buildnum var

7047496
thin	webrick
however i would like thin to be the default instead of webrick and to be able to start it with rails s

7047513
move	drag
now if this data could be shown i also want to move the rows horizontal and also vertical a via code and b via drag drop

7047657
width	height
i don t know about what griffin said is true or not but what i would do is take the bitmapdata and draw it into another bitmapdata object with the final height and width to what you want then use matrix to scale in the original image while you draw to the new bitmap

7047666
innodb	myisam
if you want to be sure that the db won t get messed up use transaction innodb or lock myisam

7047671
inline	inlining
manual inlining declaring in c99 a function inline and

7047708
memcached	apc
this uses apc s cache but you could work similarly with memcached redis etc

7047738
punctuation	words
b words boundary space punctuation etc

7047741
hash	salt
in phpass they seem to go through great lengths to produce a salt that is as truly random as possible to be used for the hash reading from dev urandom

7047741
hash	salt
isn t the point simply to make sure that the salt used for the hash are different from each other rather than random

7047750
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
qmodelindex is not a model in the sense of model view controller mvc but an adress of an object in a qabstractitemmodel which is the datastructure under all of qt s itemview objects including your tree

7047786
hash	salt
i think it doesn t matter as the salt must be also stored alongside with the hash password so the attacker will get the salt anyway and the attack will be the same regardless how did you generate the salt

7047786
hash	salt
ot discussion i argued that i don t see big advantage of using salt for storing passwords - once the attacker gets salt for particular hash password he can do dictionary attack anyway .

7047786
salt	md5
edit - discussion conclusion salt makes a big difference in time needed to crack the passwords but don t use md5 for hashing passwords

7047808
width	margin
it seemed to be a combination of conflicting width and margin settings

7047829
opera	firefox
i can t find anything that says contains-element is specific to css3 but the styling doesn t show up in firefox or opera

7047841
versioning	upgrade
it was also an upgrade from r5b to r6 so maybe it s related to the ndk versioning

7047875
post	get
you cannot get an image to a url you are trying to post data into the url which you can t you need to post your image using the outputstream of your post request

7047893
gridview	detailsview
now i have no idea how to perform user to work i have gridview and detailsview in gridview user selects company and it displays in detailsview

7047915
16-bit	64bit
yes a 64bit processor has 3 size modes 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit

7047943
accessor	properties
i have thought of overriding the getstartdate accessor to update the sectionidentifier although this seems a little heavy handed and inefficient as it would perform this update every time i access that properties

7048013
hash	md5
to get the md5 hash of a file at .

7048018
hash	md5
use sha1 instead of md5 since many version control system like git use sha1 hash itself to identify uniqueness of file

7048028
hash	md5
with that in mind two entirely different files will produce the exact same md5 hash same problem with the other hash although you can have much less collisions by using a better hash method than md5

7048033
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you can place the usercontrol in a grid which binds its width height to the fixedpage actualwidth actualheight to achieve centering

7048038
put	get
if i put in a wait time after catching the socketexception and before resuming the loop it will typically recover but eventually i ll get the error again

7048051
folder	directory
this is easier than traversing through the directory and manually deleting a series of folder

7048066
devise	cancan
my application uses devise and cancan

7048102
opera	firefox
mdc says it is supoorted only in opera and firefox

7048105
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave
to answer your first question - use jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

7048105
children	parent
mouseenter will allow children to trigger their parent s mouseenter event

7048110
width	height
so i am trying to assure the image does not bypass the width of 600px and height of 410px but i do not wish for the image to be maxing out this dimensions and look weird it has to be displayed as it would be but just in smaller scale

7048130
hide	show
if you are disconcerted by watching images start off big then shrinking hide the image by default and then show it after resizing

7048158
firefox	safari
this method works but only safari will auto start my slideshow now and firefox needs interaction to trigger a start

7048158
firefox	safari
however i did find that switching the var to true at the start and switching around the order of the mouseovers it then auto starts fine in firefox and not in safari

7048161
width	height
giving the div 100 height and width will make it take up the entire of the window

7048170
jobs	cron
i am trying to make a bash script that runs on my remote server s daily cron jobs to automatically login through ssh to another unix box run a few commands and then leave

7048203
cydia	tweak
i ve developed my first tweak for the iphone intended for cydia distribution

7048262
folder	dir
i think i once got this error a long time ago - it had something to do with having sqlite.dll in my bin or lib folder in my computer s ruby dir or something like that

7048291
min	max
however if you make it two textfields then it s simplicity...just set the first one to have min 3 character max 6 only allow numbers

7052341
drawrect	touchesmoved
the problem probably is that you are doing all of your drawing inside the touchesmoved method rather than doing it in drawrect and calling the setneedsdisplay method to invoke drawing when you want

7052341
drawrect	touchesmoved
in touchesmoved you can simply save the points that were touched and you can the same to draw lines in drawrect

7053138
for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays on which i am iterating using for-loop

7053169
put	get
and also remember that there is no need to put .a files into a copy files build phase - as you will find yourself doing with cocoa frameworks - since static libraries get compiled into your app.

7053173
stdout	stderr
capture stdout stderr qx ipc system simple ipc run...

7053205
terminate	timeout
you can then use a timer in another thread with a timeout to check if the thread don t really want to terminate if the thread refuses to terminate in for example 30 seconds you can abort it

7053220
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended

datediff	difference
although using datediff does not calculate the age correctly it only gives you the difference between the years of the dates not the difference between the dates in years

7053720
hash	md5
if you enter the md5 hash into the binary the binary will change so the md5 hash changes as well

7053720
hash	md5
another way could be to create the md5 hash of the binary and then append it to the executable

7053720
hash	md5
if you store the 128 bit md5 hash in a raw format base 256 instead of base 16 you only need 16 byte

7053758
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and firefox but am having no luck in any version of ie

7053782
uiview	calayer
uiview geometry updates apply immediately to their calayer even in an animation block

this will work as the md5 string will be stored in the data segment keeping the validity of the precalculated hash of any other memory segment valid

7053843
istream	getline
if it were me i would copy using std getline or istream rdbuf

7053853

7054021
post	get
generally browsers only support get and post verbs

7054021
post	get
links by default result in a get verb and form submissions in post

7054021

in conjunction with the first column if you use messages_path with http get it would match first route and if you use it with post it will match second route

7054036
width	height
i have x y top left width height and rotation in degrees and i need to fast calculate minx miny maxx maxy of that rectangle

7054038
ubuntu	debian
the package would have been libxrender-dev for ubuntu debian systems

7054038
rpm	yum
for rpm systems the package is called xrender and you install it with yum

7054081
versioning	upgrade
the solution would be to upgrade to the latest versioning if you haven t already

7054096
post	get
i have a select element that does a post using jquery on a change event i was trying to post it to a snippet and get the results back however it seems that if the snippet is called directly from javascript there will be no notion of the object and i can t access the db using pdo my code is as follows

7054108

7054182
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
from there i use a variety of methods from htmlspecialchars to addslashes

7054225
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager is meant to be used with async postbacks which is why it works with the updatepanel

7054225
updatepanel	scriptmanager
so if you re going to be posting back from an updatepanel be sure to use the scriptmanager instead of clientscript

7054227
width	height
â containâ scale the image while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio if any to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the background positioning area

7054250
post	get
then by hitting this link 4 hello-world-love-you it will send to another file called post.php the id as 4 hello-world-love-you and by using then i can get the real id of the post back which is 4 and do anything i want that is exactly i m thinking about

7054305
ubuntu	linux
i have been running django and rails on my ubuntu linux system for a while and i recently had to install xampp lampp because i have to do some local php development

7054322
hash	md5
while in general md5 hash values cannot be used in injection attacks it s worth pointing out that raw md5 hash values can be exploited

7054322
hash	md5
raw md5 hash are hash generated with

7054325
innodb	myisam
would there be any difference between using innodb and myisam storage engines for this

7054331
innodb	myisam
and there will be no significant difference between myisam and innodb in this case

7054332
post	get
if you have an index on user field of post table you will get decent query speeds also

7054347
width	height
you need an explicit height and width on your control - background images don t cause the div to grow to fit them

7054354
public	protected
there are no guarantees about the order of members in different protected private public regions

7054361
width	height
if you want to avoid displaying the webbrowser you may be able to just instantiate it in code behind instead and failing that try just giving it a height and width of 0

7054376
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have developer tools but the console is lacking

7054376
google-chrome	safari
without having to place a breakpoint is the script is it possible to see the response within safari or google-chrome s developer tools

7054426
inherited	properties
for the inherited properties

7054463
put	get
well your program actually does nothing so if you were to optimize it put the -o2 back into the cops environment variable you would get this

7054469
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
since you get the nsdatecomponents with an nscalendar you can use settimezone on the calendar to get the components month day hour etc. for the time zone you re interested in

7054471
post	get
the single ssl_read will grab an entire get or post request

7054479
geocoding	geocode
performing 100 geocode each time your page is loaded will take tens of seconds so i suggest geocoding in advance

7054479
geocoding	geocode
if the addresses are always the same or rarely change you can geocode them in advance using the geocoding and temporarily store the resulting lat lngs on your server as long as they are only ever displayed on a maps api map

7054520
drawrect	layoutsubviews
if there are a bunch of calls to things like glgenframebuffers that are triggered as a result of layoutsubviews drawrect or some other method that isn t called directly by the relevant init then that proves it

7054521
submit	submission
no one is submission a form with their email clicking submit and triggering an e-mail it s just a daily email to all users that for simplicities sake we ll say should contain the receiving user s email address

7054535
gentoo	linux
jnlp-bin-1.2 is needed when installing netbeans on gentoo linux and for license problems i have to download it manually

7054543
uiview	uiwindow
it adds a fullscreen uiview to the uiwindow to intercept touches

7054543
portrait	landscape
i need to use it in a landscape ipad app but the view of my popover controller is still displayed portrait rather than landscape

7054545
post	get
also in your case you should not pass the textarea contents via get but rather via post as described in the jquery documentation

7054552
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i ve made a for-loop to loops through an arrays of all the contacts people but it only seems to work once

7054570
hide	show
controller hide the popover and then show it again at the end of the

7054570
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
so the uipopovercontroller isn t rotating the popover view that it maintains like a uiviewcontroller would

7054570
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
this makes sense considering that uipopovercontroller inherits from nsobject and therefore doesn t inherit the uiviewcontroller s code that handles the rotation

7054570
uiview	uiwindow
when you add your fullscreen uiview to the uiwindow the uiview exists within the uiwindow coordinate space

7054570
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
your custom uipopovercontroller could manage the rotation but it would be easier to get this for free using a uiviewcontroller subclass if possible

7054579
fadein	fadeout
you could just add a keyup handler and check the if the s value has transitioned from none to some or some to none and then apply a fadein or fadeout to the button

7054583
stdout	stderr
gui apps don t have a stdin stdout or stderr assigned automatically

7054598
margin	text-align
i have applied the text-align and margin using inline styles while i was building the page

7054692
int	double
and varargs functions can only take built-in types pointers to anything int double

7054741
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
tracking dynamically-allocated memory the memory allocation functions malloc calloc and realloc and the c++ new operator return pointer values

7054761
stdout	stderr
this would output a sorted foo.txt to stderr the number of lines in rot13 d foo.txt to out.txt and the number of non-duplicate lines of rot13 d foo.txt to stdout

7054829
children	parent
it creates a parent with two children saves them and then loads them and prints out the graph

7054841
persistent	transient
basically the unsaved-value on the id of the object determines if it s transient or persistent

7054848
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
nsinvocationoperation nsoperationqueue for easy clean threading code

7054861
mouseover	mouseout
you are both fading in and fading out the same element upon each mouseover and mouseout

7054869
width	height
although ie 8 doesn t recognise the updated width and height of the images you can mimic the new sizes by setting their margins

7054874
onmouseover	mouseout
if you pass only one function it will call it onmouseover as well as mouseout event

7054922
width	height
the first box on the paper is 5â in width by 2â in height starting at â œ new rectanglef 60.0f 200.0f 560.0f 200.0f â

7054925
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing does not add any ivars to the superclass you can actually get away with the following

7054932
client-side	server-side
from my limited experience and research this has more to do with client-side java bridge rather then server-side

7054974
typedef	struct
assuming that map.c is not including iohelper.c it only sees the typedef but not the declaration of struct filevalues

7055005
post	get
i was wondering what level of post format customization embedded ads i could get with wordpress

7055041
int	boolean
the first two are int the other is a boolean

7055041
width	height
you could make the above query into a stored procedure that takes rectangle width and height parameters and then call it with those sizes until you find a match

7055047
equals	gethashcode
and while you re defining your own operator do remember to go ahead and define and override equals and gethashcode

7055089
for-loop	loops
if your going to be incrementing a counter during your loops i would suggest using a classic for-loop as opposed to a foreach

7055122
debian	linux
the nokia n900 comes with maemo 5 linux and can easily run a full debian linux for arm

7055184
innodb	myisam
but the problem is i have to use myisam table type itself and not innodb

7055197
mouseup	mousedown
everyone s right that chrome doesn t capture the resize event and that chrome doesn t capture the mousedown so you need to set the init state and then handle changes through mouseup

7055208
children	parent
every node in a dom tree is fully aware of its parent and children

7055232
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseeventargs with coordinates receive only mouseup and mousedown

7055232
mouseup	mousedown
mouseclick can t recive you cordinates because click consists from mouseup and mousedown and it both can have different coordinates

7055239
mouseup	mousedown
chrome doesn t capture the resize event and that chrome doesn t capture the mousedown so you need to set the init state and then handle changes through mouseup

7055257
prepare	execute
in my insert function i would like to build a prepare pdo insert statement and execute it

7055266
innodb	myisam
have two tables ti and tm i for innodb and m for myisam

7055356

i have a datagridview i want to enable inline editing i can make that by setting the value of readonly to false but the editing is temporary when i close the form and re-open it the changes are missed

7055370
google-chrome	firefox
support for rgba isn t universal - firefox and google-chrome support it but ie 8 and below don t so remember to specify a fallback colour

7055388
post	get
post redirect get causes two lifecycle scenarios

7055400
width	text-align
if you don t put a width on the paragraph it will not work because it will assume 100 and your image will be aligned left unless of course you use text-align center

7055429
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
communications are packet-based and the concept of packets is implemented using a set of classes and objectinputstream objectoutputstream wrapper for socket streams

7055431
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
newer browsers google-chrome firefox safari etc have that capability built in

7055439
awt	swing
a problem arose however because the background thread was reading a card by poll ing the list that was serving as the data model for a swing component and raising lots of awt array index out of range exceptions

7055466
free	malloc
also it is preferable to use new and delete instead of malloc and free

7055477
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
in case of sqldatasource there should be insert update delete commands specified for linqdatasource there should be allowupdate allowinsert allowdelete

7055520
client-side	server-side
replace sleep in php with places the delay client-side instead of server-side

7055522
ienumerable	iqueryable
your result variable is not an ienumerable - it is an iqueryable

7055530
width	height
i guess you use this css attribute so that it match the width and height that you ve specified

7055533
int	double
random is a double so if you want a int multiply it by 1 000 000 000 then drop the figures after the decimal place

7055558
width	height
to render an bitmap image to a different size scale you simple use an image element and set its width height as desired

7055571
versioning	upgrade
i am using grails 1.4.0.m1 and i am trying to upgrade the versioning of gpars to use with my app

7055628
struts-tags	taglib
taglib uri struts-tags prefix s

7055632
iboutlet	ibaction
you can make your ui elements created in ib interact with your code by means of iboutlet and ibaction

7055637
width	height
this works fine the problem is that i can no longer use the width and height attributes in the html img tag they will have no effect

7055649
sql-insert	sql-delete	sql-insert	sql-update	sql-delete	sql-update
list of possible elements expected loader sql-insert sql-update sql-delete sql-delete-all filter in namespace urn nhibernate-mapping-2.2 .

7055654
put	get
there is no particular solution for this problem.i will suggest that you should put code on which is in inside onclicklistener in the begining of textchangedlistener so that the code that u want to get execute first will execute first then the code that you want to get execute last will execute last.hope this will help you

7055662
post	get
so if i search help me or help me i get the post however if i search me help i don t

7055662

7055719
mouse	keyboard
they are custom panels that i use mouse keyboard listeners on and use my own graphics to paint over them

7055875
addition	multiplication
all classes addition expression multiplication are defined and declared

7055897
spaces	delimiter
in scanf spaces and n is delimiter for the character i p

7055903
int	chars
the printf n d a will print a newline chars n and the int value 1000 which makes a total of 5 chars

7055940
try-catch	exception-handling
since does not throw exception-handling one of the try-catch blocks are completely unnecessary

7055949
super	abstract
the pattern is that of an abstract method and it works here because ruby is using inheritance on the class side as well so class methods may use super as well

7055966
gitolite	gitosis
note this answer is for gitolite as that s what i started using instead of gitosis as per the first comment to my question

7055997
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie7+ firefox 5.0 and google-chrome

7056024
implements	extends
the metallookandfeel extends basiclookandfeel which extends lookandfeel and implements serializable so there s no point in adding serializable again

7056036
iboutlet	ibaction
hope this helps to clear things up a bit on iboutlet and ibaction

7056068
folder	directory
your templates folder either needs to be in an app that has been listed in installed_apps or in a directory that has been listed in template_dirs - in your settings.py file

7056083
getter	setter
that is for a val x a getter method named x is generated and a setter named is generated

7056153
antivirus	mcafee
now i need to know how to unblock the firewall of my mcafee antivirus such that the error of connection refusal is not present

7056157
installation	upgrade
it seems like there is in fact not enough memory for this amount of gems i am using but again this seems very weird - it works perfectly fine on snow leopard and even at my company on mac mini with lion - the only difference is that the mini is upgrade snow leopard - lion whilst on my imac its a clean lion installation

7056169
codeigniter	cakephp
i tried codeigniter cakephp early stages and zend

7056196
ant	maven
i would not worry about compiling and running the project either but if you really want you can setup ant or maven to do it

7056220
maven	m2e
once you have sorted out building your project with maven and adopted the m2e plugin to get maven to work with eclipse you may want to check out the maven assembly plugin with which you will be able to produce a zip file that packs together your project with all its dependencies and possibly a launch script that takes care of setting your classpath without invoking your project s startup class

7056222
post	get
better late than never but i think you re after the iwsdlexportextension behaviour which allows you to modify the wsdl generated by wcf when the service is hosted - here is a good blog post on how to get started when implementing this interface

7056230
maven	pom.xml
also with maven you need to provide only pom.xml file containing definition of dependencies and project build configuration

7056230
maven	pom.xml
maven takes care about all of these things following your configuration defined in pom.xml file

7056234
maven	m2e
i ve installed maven and the m2e eclipse plugin

7056240
pull	push
to be able to push to another hg repository you have to pull git changes into your hg repo then push

7056278
mouse	keyboard
see how to simulate mouse and keyboard events in code

7056291
gif	png
that includes jpeg png and gif

7056301
put	get
if it s correct try put again before flash and see what you get

7056325
rss	feed
this is the way that you would redirect say an rss feed to an atom feed or something where you may have multiple input formats but only one output format

7056328
hash	salt
the method that calls for the salt is called hash

7056361
hide	show
i want to show different keyboardtypes when user clicks on specific uitextfields i can do that but then i lose the ability to hide the keyboard while pressing the done button

7056428
width	height
these find the width and height of the body element so unless you ve done something strange to the body element then this should work

7056431
for-loop	loops
in theory the while loops is quicker because the for-loop looks up the length attribute of foo every time though loops but in real-world use it s going to make an immeasurably small difference

7056435
for-loop	while-loop
it would be more meaningful to compare the above while-loop with the following for-loop

7056441
for-loop	loops
for your for-loop you can store the length before loops and work on that value instead of retrieving it every time

7056449
integer	unsigned
you should use a signed integer by removing the unsigned modifier

7056468
integer	unsigned
since the integer is unsigned the compiler will optimize this to an infinite loop

7056480
integer	unsigned
i will tell you an elegant way to do what you want to do with an unsigned integer

7056519
maven	pom.xml
with maven there s no logic in the pom.xml

7056541
implements	extends
make your class extends activity and not listactivity implements onitemclicklistener.

7056609
actionscript	mxml
but the problem i am facing is when i am trying to import one of the .mxml component in my actionscript of main file of mxml application then i am not able to do so .can some one help me in importing one mxml file into other mxml file

7056631
integer	unsigned
by defining the i as unsigned int you have made it a always non-negative integer therefore all the possible values i can have are all positive integers in its range and 0

7056674
config	ini
this seems like the cleanest solution to me as then all config data are stored in the one place regardless of their source being an ini file or the db

7056758
submit	submission
i am using the submit button onclick method for form submission

7056841
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as of today the library supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

7056844
subtract	add
so the rule for predicting keys forwards is to subtract the sum of all the smallest keys dealt with so far and then add the largest key value as many times as is required to bring the value into range

7056844
subtract	add
similarly the rule for deducing keys backwards will be to subtract the sum of all the smallest keys dealt with so far and then to add the largest key value as many times as is required to bring the value into range

7056844
subtract	add
i think that looking up values by order index 1st value 2nd value 3rd value is the same principle - keep track of a value to add or subtract that accounts for the total rotation so far and add or subtract the total number of items in the map to bring things back into range

7056849
hide	show
i have seen this done with a flag on the table to indicate whether to show or hide the record in case you are worried about showing the intervening layer when it is just a dummy record

7056859
hide	show
with oleg help i have been able to code a reconfigpermissions function that show hide default add edit and delete buttons

7056874
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
jax-rs is a standard that makes it easy to create a restful service that can be deployed to any java application server glassfish weblogic websphere jboss etc

7056896
super	self
i found a way to call super for self if there were a super

7057000
folder	directory
like an idiot this is what i was doing wrong 1 passed permission in as a string and not an integer 2 was including the file name in the mkdir so therefore the file name was within the folder but was set as a directory 3 did not include the file name in the fopen

7057116
int	double
and since converting from double to int cuts off everything after the decimal point you get 72

7057128
post	get
i m guessing that in order to get this to work you will first have to send that post request in order to get the select will all of the options

7057154
innodb	myisam
i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced

7057155
folder	directory
i have a directory in my folder

7057166
put	get
this seems very wasteful because i could have dozens of concrete classes implementing myordered and they would all get a copy of the same code when in fact it would be enough to just put it directly in the base class myordered

7057166
implements	extends
in that case it is still not implements in an abstract scala class that extends the trait but it cannot be implements in a java class that extends the abstract scala class because it is flagged as final

7057175
ia-32	x86
take for example the instruction that tells an x86 ia-32 processor

7057269
onresume	onpause
however lock mode works with the onresume onpause couple

7057296
ienumerable	iqueryable
how can we know which one is ienumerable and which one is iqueryable

7057318
ienumerable	iqueryable
as for whether it s ienumerable or iqueryable - that depends on the type of database.casetables

7057322
hash	salt
don t hash your salt like that

7057322
crypt	salt
crypt s blowfish hashing takes a 22-character base64-encoded string using characters . 0-9a-za-z for a salt which amounts to 128 bits of entropy

7057322
hash	salt
the sha-512 hash you re using to create your salt has 512 bits of entropy

7057368
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for instance run this one on google-chrome or a recent version of firefox or opera

7057368
google-chrome	firefox
you said for instance that a reverse loop is faster in google-chrome but a forward loop is faster in firefox

7057368
google-chrome	firefox
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

7057428
multiplying	add
my color class has methods for simple blend effects such as add multiplying etc

7057510
sorting	filtering
sometimes it can be simpler to use a flat file for data storage csv json but a proper database can provide better performance on filtering sorting and joining data

7057518
post	get
also i had to add copy app.config â œ targetpath .configâ to post build events and finally i get a test.exe.config file but still the programm doesn t run on a windows xp sp3 with the net framework 4 and the visual c++ 2010 redistributable.

7057526
int	chars
and even if i had incremented it earlier at least the printed chars and their int values should correspond

7057535
versioning	upgrade
i currently have ruby versioning 1.8.2 in my machine and i would like to upgrade it to 1.9.2

7057547
opera	google-chrome
this test case seems to work in opera 11.5 ie9 ff5 google-chrome 13

7057555
post	get
now i extract the code and make a post request to get the oauth token and if i get the token i make a request for the contacts

7057555
post	get
so it seems that the get request is not being made moreover i am not able to see the post request being made in firebug but surely its being made because i get the access token as the response

7057555
post	get
because i still dont understand why i am unable to see those get and post requests in firebug s net tab

7057569
vala	genie
one item missing from jacindas list you might want to know about vala genie is a compiler targetting c with the gobject library implementing objects written by gnome

7057569
vala	genie
vala is a c#-like syntax and genie a python-like syntax but for the rest they are the same system

7057620
width	height
i want to create a simple program that will convert a pdf to a jpg with the longest height or width set to a specific pixel amount and a 1px border applied

7057688
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to 2.0.0.m1 the dependency is gone and you can use whatever versioning of gpars you like

7057758
versioning	upgrade
it depends on what ubuntu versioning you are running you can get the ruby packages with this link searchon names suite all section all to get the latest ruby 1.9.2-p290 installed you have to upgrade your ubuntu to oneiric if you don t like to upgrade your system maybe you have to install ruby with rvm as fl00r answered

7057838
hide	show
updated in the comment you asked me how to hide or to show the buttons in the navigator bar dynamically

7057838
hide	show
the code just call or to hide show the add button

7057899
folder	directory
i intend to copy the compiled .o files into my project s lib or include directory but should the .hh and .cc files be left in the src folder or placed elsewhere to ease the cleaning process

7057935
atomikos	bitronix
there are many implementations of this api basically each java ee server has its own implementation and there are other ones like jotm bitronix atomikos for example

7057955
richfaces	tomahawk	versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade an app previously running on richfaces 3and jsf 1.2 to jsf2 and richfaces 4 the app was also using tomahawk for the spread radio buttons so we also upgrade to the jsf2 versioning for tomahawk i am getting the error below when i try to load a page

7057958
width	margin
in general you ll want to be conservative with setting width 100 on elements as with the standard box model that 100 does not include padding margin border on the element and will often push it outside the bounding box of its parent

7057966
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
modern 64-bit runtimes will generate an ivar for accessor properties so you don t even need to create the ivar

7057966
getter	setter
for every property there are two methods unless the property is declared readonly in which case there is only one there is the getter which returns the same type as the ivar and is of the same name as the ivar as well as the setter which is not declared with a readonly ivar

7057977
pull	push
i read it uses xerces by default which is what type - push or pull

7057995
super	implements
if you implements this method but are building your application for ios 2.x your dealloc method should release each object but should also set the reference to that object to nil before calling super

7058121
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been doing some testing on this it seems fonts from google are cached fine on google-chrome and opera only firefox has problems

7058127
post	put
now the der1 object pointer is put inside an event object and the event is post into a queue

7058153
innodb	myisam
strictly speaking mysql has only partial acid-compliance for tables other than those with the non-default storage engines innodb bdb and cluster and myisam does not support user-instigated transactions

7058165
children	parent
-s change the way the process time is calculated by summing all exited children to their parent process

7058176
integer	unsigned
this works as intended as long as null is represented as 0 and pointer comparison is compiled as an unsigned integer comparison

7058179
metaclass	subclassing
one thing i ve found metaclass useful for is to invoke a function whenever a subclassing is created

7058179
metaclass	subclassing
i codified this into a metaclass which looks for an __initsubclass__ attribute whenever a subclassing is created all parent classes which define that method are invoked with __initsubclass__ cls subcls

7058193
postgresql	mysql
we have a legacy schema file which has the following column names would like to understand if any of them would cause an issue if we port our application to h2 mysql postgresql or oracle

7058194
folder	directory
but you have to inform your kowmanager s index.php that the system folder is not located in the same directory

7058299
ffmpeg	avisynth
with ffmpeg overlaying images using the command line by far the most powerful and elegant way to do this is with a tool called avisynth

7058299
ffmpeg	avisynth
all videos on this ecard site are created with ffmpeg and avisynth

7058353
portrait	landscape
my pcture are full blade but i always get a kind of black borders both in portrait or landscape orientation

7058386
portrait	landscape
each subclassed view controller contains a device-specific xib with each xib containing portrait and landscape uiviews which are switched upon orientation change i followed for this

7058387
int	chars
just do a notice that i ve explicitly instantiated the int version but passed the chars parameters

7058424
pull	push
the original repo commiter owner will have to add your mynewrepoongithub as his remote and pull your changes and merge them and push them the original repo

7058444
put	get
2 if you put a static global in a .h file and include it then you will not get any error because for every different translation unit there will be a different copy for that static global variable

7058445
onresume	onpause
you could use the lifecycle events like oncreate onresume onpause etc to track loading unloading of details

7058454
content-length	content-type
are any http headers retrievable such as content-type or content-length

7058455
for-loop	loops
the while loops should encompase the for-loop - it doesn t

7058460
fgets	fread
start with standard c i o with fopen and fread fscanf fgets and so forth

7058462
viewdidload	dealloc
note that in the dealloc there s no need to set the variables to nil but it won t hurt doing so so we can use same method for both viewdidload and dealloc

7058517
uidatepicker	uipickerview
it seems uidatepicker is not customizable via a delegate like uipickerview

7058519
post	get
makholm a browser sends a trace request of course generally speaking browsers just use get and post then a web server responses the request

7058537
imageview	imageswitcher
i have tried using a baseadapter to update the textswitcher in a similar manner to how the imageswitcher updates the images in the imageview but i am running into a wall here

7058542
put	get
essentially i m trying to get my makefile located in the codeblocks directory to compile the files contained within src and have the object files put into the obj directory

7058570
ssl	https
what s wrong with ssl https

7058586
valgrind	callgrind
the valgrind suite has a tool called callgrind that will tell you what is calling what

7058619
pull	push
so once a push is made to the remote repo a pull has to be made on web server to get the most recent commits which in your case includes deletion of the file test.html

7058627
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
i am creating a hash using crypt with the password and the salt

7058627
crypt	hash
the problem is that the hash that is the result of the crypt algorithm is different

7058670
int	chars
the implicit instantiation just means the compiler can figure out the int and chars from the types of the arguments

7058671
int	boolean
you can store those checkboxes variables as tiny int or boolean in the database or you can store them in a single column text data type as json format like this beer 0 wine 1 .and that s in case of increasing those options in the future and also you can use json_ encode json_decode to convert array to json format in php

7058672
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for instance on my macbook pro with all the latest browsers safari firefox google-chrome this doesn t work

7058674
stdout	stderr
these file descriptors could also have been inherited from your parent process as usually happens for the first three file descriptors 0 stdin 1 stdout 2 stderr

7058674
integer	unsigned
the second parameter is a pointer to a buffer and the third parameter is the buffer s size as an unsigned integer

7058674
x86	64bit
be careful that it is completely different on 64bit x86 be sure you are assembling in 32-bit mode and linking a 32-bit executable

7058730
ssl	https
if you want to use https you must pay your hosting provider for buying and installing certificate for you or you must have plan which offers ssl or shared ssl directly

7058735
hash	salt
so i d guess the hash from your server is falling back to des since it contains only the first 2 characters of your salt

7058784
calloc	malloc
if you use malloc and calloc to make a linked list of structs there s no special reason to move over to an nsarray

7058829
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in ie firefox and safari - but in google-chrome the background image will only rotate once and no further images are rotated unless i refresh the browser via f5

7058829
setinterval	settimeout
i ve been pounding my brain on this one for the rotation function i ve switched between settimeout setinterval and for image-preloading good measure i ve swapped between window .load function document .ready function but nothing seems to do the trick - i always have to refresh chrome in order for more than one image rotation to occur

7058840
gif	png
post images photo content type is not one of image jpg image jpeg image png image gif which is perfectly fine

7058856
interpolation	splines
at the start i used simple techniques like polynomial and splines interpolation however even with a little noise the result still failed to appear sufficiently human-like

7058887
width	height
i like that i don t need to supply tablelayout with any fixed width or height values however i have had to use strange work-arounds like an empty between two buttons to create a fake 3rd column stuff like that

7058903
listview	gridview
thats impossible with a asp gridview but you can easily achieve this using an asp listview

7058916
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
if you set views distances and sizes with dp those distances in dp will be treated as pixels on an mdpi screens and they will be scaled so your layouts fill the space equally on ldpi and hdpi screens

7058924
int	chars
however getchar returns int and if it s in range 0 to 255 it is a chars but if it returns -1 then it s eof

7058928
int	chars
getchar returns an int which contains either a plain unsigned chars or eof so there is no problem

7058969
hide	show
i ve used jqery function showonlyone thechosenone to show and hide the part of the page that show and is hidden

7059005
google-chrome	firefox
here is a websockets protocol test report listing conformance of google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 8 to specific features of the latest protocol spec

7059017
equals	gethashcode
as a side note you may want to rethink your design and implement your equals and gethashcode using business key

7059032
google-chrome	safari
i tried your script in ie8 safari and google-chrome

7059060
min	max
aggregate functions ie count min max avg etc only work on column references but some accept table

7059096
filesystems	fat
i ve just got to know that some filesystems such as fat store filenames as upper-case regardless of the case used to create them

7059141
put	get
perform an implementation-dependent sequence of calls to the get put and delete internal methods of obj

7059153
listctrl	textctrl
now the user types h into the textctrl and the listctrl is narrowed down to hello and hi

7059168
pascal	delphi
as an example have a look at the so called qtpas wrapper that wraps qt for use in free pascal delphi

7059173
rss	feed
i am importing an rss feed from the noaa website which is returned as rss

7059174
post	get
i can post a full example if you do not get it right just say when

7059186
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
sortedset makes you implement icomparer in the same way that i implemented iequalitycomparer above

7059202
google-chrome	firefox
it displays correctly through google-chrome but in firefox the third right column wraps around to the bottom

7059212
google-chrome	firefox
websockets has sufficient momentum that browser vendors will improve support google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 8 support the latest protocol draft and that a broad range of client and server frameworks will support it

7059281
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s compatible with firefox 3.7 or higher google-chrome and safari 4 or higher and ie9 or higher

7059298
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 8 support the latest

7059337
put	get
in an attempt to get back the time you put into xml commenting your custom js to pay off fully

7059363
hide	show
one way to do this is to show a control with the default value in it...then then the user enters the control hide it and show the actual password control at that point

7059384
int	chars
when you read a chars the value is read as an unsigned chars and converted from there to int â 7.19.7.1 2

7059384
int	chars
chars converted to an int and advances the associated file position indicator for the

7059384
fgetc	fread	getchar	fgetc
this particular quote is for fgetc -- getc getchar and fread are all required to read data as if by calling fgetc

7059384
int	chars
this does implicitly at least sort of assume that chars has a smaller range than int so the conversion to int allows at least one value to be represented that couldn t have come from the file

7059384
int	chars
elsewhere the standard denies that as a requirement but i think that denial is unrealistic -- i m pretty sure an implementation with chars and int the same size would break vast amounts of code

7059403
min	max
in firmware have out of bounds min max values for each field year must be at least 2005 and no larger than 2030

7059469
backgrounding	multitasking
i can assure you that google latitude only updates the user s location when it s being run and visible or when it is running as a backgrounding process when multitasking is available

7059488
portrait	landscape
xcode only says its landscape or portrait as a simulated metric hence the title of the group in the inspector

7059488
width	height	portrait	landscape
to solve this problem simply change the width and height of the uiview in landscape make it 1004 x 768 and in portrait do the same 1024 x 748

7059488
portrait	landscape
as you mentioned the reason for this is that your main view was in landscape and when adding new uiviews xcode just assumes they are portrait so the size is portrait and mode is landscape

7059492
put	get
everything is an object and you could for example put in anything or get out anything

7059494
geocoding	geocode
moreover the callback that you specify in the above call is called asynchronously by the geocode when it finished the geocoding

7059529
base-class	derived-class
it s because one needs to define something that is not done in the base-class __init__ and the only possibility to obtain that is to put its execution in a derived-class __init__ function

7059529
inherited	base-class
when the aim is to keep the initialization performed by the base-class that is pure inherited nothing special is needed one must just avoid to define an __init__ function in the derived class

7059529
base-class	derived-class
when the aim is to replace the initialization performed by the base-class __init__ must be defined in the derived-class

7059529
base-class	derived-class
when the aim is to add processes to the initialization performed by the base-class a derived-class __init__ must be defined comprising an explicit call to the base-class __init__

7059534
touchesbegan	touchesended	inherited	subclassing
if you must use uilabel then you need to subclassing it and intercept the touchesbegan touchesended methods inherited from uiresponder to detect uicontroleventtouchupinside yourself

7059590
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the sluggish performance is only happening to me in firefox its fine in safari and google-chrome and i tried disabling all add-ons so dont think its anything like that affecting things

7059607
getter	setter
if you work with an ide then it will create getter and setter for you so in my opinion there is no real excuse for not keeping access to instance variables restricted

7059657
onresume	onpause
one broadcast receiver needs to be registered in onresume and unregistered in onpause

7059661
versioning	upgrade
as an option you can try to upgrade to latest versioning of nhibernate - 3.2

7059720
min	max
e 1 2â mâ v â² + mâ g â max h 0 + 1 2â k â min h 0 â²

7059743
post	get
just encode the bytes with base64encoder and pass it as just another post parameter and use base64decoder to get the original contents back

7059774
multiplying	add
i can t figure out how to get those numbers i need to do basic math like add multiplying etc into a new textview that updates simultaneously

7059786
g++	gcc
i suppose one might argue that the trailing blanks could be deleted in phase 1 but i m not convinced that that s a valid argument -- and i don t know whether the gcc authors have actually made that argument. in any case g++ 4.5.2 and sun cc version 5.5 disagree with each other

7059795
udp	tcp
i tried the following code to find out maximum segment size in tcp and udp sockets

7059852
udp	tcp
tcp has segments udp has datagrams

7059852
udp	tcp
check the return value of getsockopt udp doesn t have tcp segments so it should definitely return with an error

7059861
typedef	struct
the usual things to put in them are declarations of enums typedef struct and function prototypes so various c files can compile without having to have knowledge of the actual function or actual memory a struct basically is definition of how memory is laid out

7059872
mouseover	mouseout
the issue in this gallery is that if you mouseover mouseout fast during the animation

7059926
sudo	passwd
in addition consider that once you authenticate with sudo you don t need to provide a passwd again for the next five minutes

7059926
sudo	passwd
the -n option to sudo prevents it from prompting for a passwd the command runs or sudo quits with an error

7059926
sudo	passwd
you could use -n in combination with the -a option which causes sudo to run a separate program whose only job is to collect and output a passwd

7059940
int	chars
if string had a method such as setcharat int index chars value then it would be mutable

7059949
free	malloc
malloc and frieds must pair with free

7059973
memcpy	memset
if you want to overwrite the first element of the array with the last one and zero out the memory of the last element which is not used anymore you can use memcpy and memset

7059973
memcpy	strcpy
instead of overwriting the first element with the last using memcpy it can also be done with strcpy and assignment of the priority like in your remove

7059976
union	distinct
from 6.7.2.3 tags 4 two declarations of structure union or enumerated types which are in different scopes or use different tags declare distinct types

7059976
union	distinct
each declaration of a structure union or enumerated type which does not include a tag declares a distinct type.

public	protected
i m not sure what kind of asset files you are utilizing and how you might be protecting them now or even what you mean by reachable so it s hard to give input on that and it s also not clear if those assets are in the main app or the admin app but you could also use apache config or similar to alias the admin directory to a common app with common public web files or if you did use the yii bootstrap to load a common protected directory you could have separate public web files for each admin app -- but non-php served files would need some kind of access filter

7069290
put	get
known ways to do this include the usual accessors - get and put and containskey

7069290
put	get
answer so mark has pointed out that in release 9 eviction is invoked only by the get put and replace methods which would explain why i wasn t seeing an effect for containskey

7069303
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have 3 uiviewcontroller in my uinavigationcontroller

7069978
awt	swing	swt	swing
you should not use awt except you are confined to an applet otherwise prefer swing or swt

7069984
awt	swing
note first there is no combobox item in awt there is jcombobox in swing which is better to use than choice of awt

7069986
atomic	compare-and-swap
under an x86 processor i am not sure of the difference between compare-and-swap atomic operation and load-link store-conditional operation

7070012
implements	extends
not sure if the book had it that way or not but i usually create a separate impl interface as shown above that just extends the main one so that some of my classes can implements timestamping differently without acquiring the itd implementation

7070013
uiview	subviews
in these cells i add a subviews of a uiview

7070013
uiview	subviews

7070121
datalist	repeater
this second example article discusses only the datalist repeater and datagrid controls but i figure since i am using the itemplate interface here it should be the same thing

7070135
folder	directory
if you re not certain how to do this in practice say in flash builder you can work under one project directory with two flex applications project - properties - flex applications or have two separate projects containing only the top-level mxml file with the source folder containing the remainder of the application in the build path project - properties - flex build path - source path

7070157
post	get
to pass only the id through post get and get the needed data from

7070167
daemons	systemd
a more stable approach would be to take advantage of process control and spin off daemons for each connection from your parent script or implement a cache systemd that stores all data on the disk database so that you can detect a change in module version and instantly reboot the server

7070178
pull	push
i have two computers and i want both of them to be able to pull push from the same repo on github as well as deploy to the same app on heroku

supports ie 5+ firefox 2+ safari 4+ google-chrome opera 10.5+ iphone 2+ android 2+ and provides a consistent api to handle storage cross-browser

7070268
getter	setter
in other words if you use dot notation either on self or on some other object you access the property and in fact call either the getter or setter methods depending on the direction of assignment

7070268
getter	setter
you can also write your own setter and getter and then you ll also have to take care of memory management where it applies

7070269
put	get
if you can put some restrictions on what hello.mk can do you might be able to get this into one pass

7070429
awt	swing
edit for clear mind and enjoy from programing don t mixing awt components and with swing jcomponents in other hands sure that possible from jdk1.6_012 more here and here but for nice and correct output to the gui you have to needed lots of skills about java gui

7070453
screens	tablet
also it may be due to a different resolution in the emulator instead of the screens looking a mobile phone screens it had looked like a tablet screens

7070457
google-chrome	firefox
this works properly in google-chrome firefox and even ie8

7070497
put	get
the other answer says to put the logic as close to the db as possible which imo is a horrid idea although in this case i see nothing wrong with what you re doing but just remember that the database is already doing a lot of work to just get you the data if you re going to be doing a lot of logic on the database it s going to make it just that much slower

7070499
portrait	landscape
it works fine in portrait mode but when the user goes into landscape mode it doesn t work

7070500
post	get
and i get what i want domain.com 14 in place of domain.com post 14

7070507
maven	m2e
both approaches should be supported by both maven and the wtp addon for the m2e plugin but these things are evolving right now and you d better do some experiments before committing to this route

7070549
entities	entitymanager
entities as a rule of thumb should not know about the entitymanager directly or via some intermediary object

7070584
hide	show
this show the code that hide slides the photograph thumbails away etc when the button is clicked

7070611
maven	pom.xml

jdk1.6	jdk1.4
we are in the process of upgrading our j2ee application from jdk1.4 to jdk1.6 along with moving to a different application server

7070685
width	height
if you want to get the actual pixel coordinate you have to calculate that from the views width height and the image ones

7070686
setinterval	settimeout
this is achieved through either settimeout or setinterval which enqueues a function to be called at a later time while allowing other code to execute in between

7070692
width	height
if you do not want to make it block then width and height makes no sense

7070698
getter	setter
i ve also gone down the route of passing interim objects around and even accessing getter setter after creating the view controller

7070801
web.py	cherrypy
i am confused on how to go about selecting an http framework web.py cherrypy etc

7070857
client-side	server-side
you have to understand what php and javascript actually are a server-side and client-side language

7070864
opera	firefox
one problem for example is that firefox at least 3.6 and iirc also some version of opera has some rounding error when scaling so when you scale the parent-element holding the text and scale the text by the inverse of that scale then the letter-spacing will be slightly different compared to without any scale

7070893
post	get
so basically my desired class would post data to a page without reading the response and instead get the url of the page after the redirect

7070902
pop-up	dialog
that way you keep the functionality together and ensure the redirect happens when the dialog pop-up

7070907
bottle	flask
i d recommend bottle or flask both of which are very minimal and impose no constraints on you whatsoever

7070919
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
both uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are controllers of controllers they manage multiple uiviewcontroller

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
each tab controls either a uiviewcontroller or a uinavigationcontroller which in turn manages uiviewcontroller

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so you add uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller to your tab bar items

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you cannot add a uinavigationcontroller to your uiviewcontroller but rather the other way round

7070939
flex	robotlegs
i m currently using robotlegs with the presentation model pattern to develop a flex 4 project

you still need some mechanism to check for a total of 100 and add subtract percentages from certain values if need be

7071167
implements	extends
what i mean is that i want to allow any type of vertex structure that implements a certain interface extends a certain class. in order to do this i would need to convert that object into byte

7071170
put	get
put this together before i realised the question was for mysql but the principal should be the same this will get you the record for each personid with the most recent activedate from person table

7071171
bash	zsh
in bash and i m guessing zsh that would be

7071207
versioning	upgrade
if you are using this versioning or if it s possible for you to upgrade you can reapply your styles on the pagercomplete event

7071251
serializable	deserialization
the serializable doesn t put just the floats to the output stream it also puts some information about the vertex class so the jvm knows which class should be instantiated when the deserialization occurs

7071255
ubuntu	debian
i have been trying to set up a crontab list on a debian ubuntu server but have not been able to get it to work

northwind	adventureworks
for other databases i ve tested on like adventureworks or northwind that do have true fks in the database when i generate the model from the database i see that the edmx includes association and associationset sections in the ssdl

7071400
disk	ram
new considering that the objects are less than 1gb it may be easier to just copy the entire set to a ram disk and then access through that

7071400
disk	ram
just remember to copy from the ram disk if anything is saved or wrap save to save objects in two places

7071466
libevent	epoll
both libevent and libev has the functionality but i can t figure out how to do this using epoll

7071468
screens	tablet
i think you shouldn t check for tablet or else but base your app on screens size and sdk version

7071516
mousemove	keydown
you want to monitor events like mousemove keypress keydown and or click at the document level

7071557
mousemove	keydown
come up with a list of all the events you d consider to be activity from the user click mousemove keydown etc.

7071595
inherited	properties
he could be talking about the getvalue that comes when you inherited dependencyobject but the syntax still doesn t work it expects you to pass dependencyproperty as a parameter but i m using regular clr properties with onpropertychanged myproperty being invoked on the setter

7071613
sorting	filtering
so you have multiple items signing up for the same event one event handler to maintain and the ability to preserver that handling should your list be changed through filtering sorting etc

7071661
google-chrome	firefox
good day sir you can check wether your images are preloaded by using firebug in firefox or the developer console in google-chrome

the users can only add rectangles width height x y color text image and probably some form elements textarea button combo-box etc.

7071795
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

2 i have no idea about how good or bad the upgrade path is from vb3 to newer versioning of vb

7071853
vb.net	vb6
if you don t get an answer here the real long time vb classic not vb.net experts hang out in that said the vb6 ide works well in windows 7 once you know about one particular install trick which requires creating a 0 byte msjava.dll file in the windows directory

7071886
children	parent
i have a parent entity appartment with a list of room s as children

7071888

7072001
fflush	gets
pretty sure the avcapturemoviefileoutput appends to the file and does not use a in memory buffer maybe it does but it fflush it to the file before it gets too large ...some evidence of this can be seen in the moviefragmentinterval property here

7072019
firefox	safari
please note this works fine in firefox and safari

7072035
post	put
i must say that i read a lot of misguiding post elsewhere about various strategies for getting around .irbrc before this question and the post by rogerdpack put the issue to rest

7072065
google-chrome	firefox
my current solution works perfectly fine in firefox but google-chrome and ie are not working and it isn t giving any error messages

7072075
width	text-align
setting the left and right margins to auto for instance won t work for a div that doesn t have a defined width and setting text-align to be center won t work as expected for a div whose width has been constrained

7072076
google-chrome	firefox
check if the fonts are at all accessible by the browser in firefox using the firebug plugin or developer tools in google-chrome f12 and ctrl+shift+j respectively

7072187
width	height
i want a progress bar that i can specify the width the height and that has a percentage in the middle of it

7072197
children	parent
a cheap code-wise way to do that would be to insert the view into a parent view with autoresizing set to center it set the parent to clip its children and then animate the parent s frame

serializable	deserialization
i have searched the web for quit a while for a binary serializable deserialization framework that i can use in android

7073137
serializable	deserialization
msgpack s better at that since it doesn t require you to do any definitions and thus doesn t generate a lot of code for you to use its serializable deserialization functionalities and it s fast the bad thing is that it depends on some classes that exist only on j2se and some other open sources projects i don t really like to get involved too much code that are not directly needed in my small android project.

7073446
disk	ram
if your application does not fit into this model perhaps most requests are actually cpu bound or generally work in ram but only a few requests do disk io for file uploads then you will need to do some custom tuning anyhow for instance you might need to refactor your service into an asynchronous framework so that you can efficiently handle thousands to hundreds of thousands of concurrent but slow requests or just balance different kinds of requests across different application servers

7073456
repo	egit
i have cloned a project from a git repo into eclipse helios using the egit plugin

7075809
width	height
i suggest you check your layoutparams carefully or set a fixed width and height for the textview to see what is the problem

7075815

7075946
implements	extends	post	get
but google uses post method to send your variables and takes care of serialization for you what you are trying to do is send it via get method which is as far as i know not implements by google remoteserviceservlet .so i would say no its not possible unless you extends these services to work with get methods yourself but i don t know if that is possible

7075963
post	get
fql and graph api is tehre a way to get hidden post in a page #39

7076251
instances	transient
i thought adding the cascade property would fix that but now when i try to save forecast #1 for example i get an exception saying object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing with type forecast entity 1

7076251
persistent	transient
what i think is happening is that it tries to save the forecase and by doing so it also tries to persistent all the forecastcost cost objects linked to it but the forecastcost object also has a link back to the forecast entity that we are saving but is not yet saved thus transient and so it errors out

7076253
free	malloc
be sure to handle your errors correctly - if the second malloc fails you ll need to free the first one

example this works in ie and firefox but not in safari and google-chrome

7085002
unsigned	short
you can use any standard type with va_arg except char signed char unsigned char short unsigned short _bool and float

7085002
floating-point	integer
it s possible that an implementation defines additional nonstandard types that also have integer conversion rank lower than int or likewise nonstandard small floating-point types but you would not need to be aware of these unless you intend to use them so for practical purposes the list i gave is complete

7085061
min	max
try to write a fold to multiply the elements of a list then another one to find extreme values max min

7085079
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie9 vs google-chrome opera browsers

7085081
jobs	cron
i also thought of cron jobs and indeed they have been recommended for similar situations on this and other forums but since this is not a recurring event but rather a one time event to take place at an arbitrary point in time i did not know that a cron job is what i want either

7085093
int	chars
while using va_arg the chars is promoted to unsigned int

7085093
int	chars
c chars va_arg ap int

7085104
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari simply do not support the min-width property on table elements

7085104
google-chrome	safari
so it would seem that google-chrome and safari are the ones not conforming to the standard

7085116
children	parent
i need a solution where i have one master list array that has a number of sequentially ordered linked children each one representing a sub-segment of the parent list

7085122
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have developed an application that uses uinavigationcontroller to handle multiple instances of the same uiviewcontroller and it is working great

7085206
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on win7 in ie8 ie9 opera 11.50 safari 5.0.5 firefox 5.0 google-chrome 12.0

7085223
getter	setter
readwrite means that both a getter and a setter exist

7085231
des	aes
triple des or aes are much better options

7085234
getter	setter
atomic vs nonatomic primarily ensures that complete values are returned from synthesized getter and that complete values are written by synthesized setter atomic is default.

7085234
accessor	properties
readwrite vs readonly determines whether a synthesized properties has a synthesized accessor or not readwrite has a setter and is the default readonly does not

7085270
comparator	comparable
i m looking for best practice for the definition of the comparator method in the case where the class implements comparable

7085279
google-chrome	firefox
i am using the visualization library the charts works fine in firefox google-chrome however when i test in ie7 i am getting a different font showing up on the chart

7085279
svg	vml
also i am using the new corepackage in google charts so it utilizes both vml and svg when needed so it does render in ie

7085309
viewdidload	viewwillappear
however in a nutshell you have viewdidload and viewwillappear and their opposites methods that serve to alleviate your fears

7085320
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
ie9 firefox use a different technique to render text than google-chrome opera do

7085404
google-chrome	firefox
while i was writing i tested the page locally on google-chrome and firefox and the font size seemed to follow what i specified in the css file

7085437
jobs	cron
use cron jobs -- depend on yout cp you can follow the instruction and call your php program at the specific times

7085439
jobs	cron
as pete says you can manage cron jobs from within php

7085470
post	get
i believe your code will perform an post whereas you need a get to transfer your variables through querystring

7085473
xna	spritebatch
i have a very subtle problem with xna specifically the spritebatch

7085494
portrait	landscape
to get a different view for landscape as opposed to portrait you would place your layout xml file in both of the following resource folders

7085513
portrait	landscape
the layout from layout-land is displayed when device is landscape and layout from plain layout folder is shown when device is in portrait

7085574
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately on mac and debian i get a modal dialog that pop-up and tells me that the page load failed

7085593

then hide the panorama and show the pivot

7085612
hide	show
here s where i m usure after it sees that none are checked checked i want to have a div show up hide show i guess somwhere and disappear if any of the boxes are checked

7085627

i m looking to quickly hopefully without a for-loop generate a numpy arrays of the form

7085656
awt	swing
there are solutions available to use awt or swing on android

7085657
folder	directory
so i need to get the current folder that is in and delete the folder only if there are no other files folder within that directory after deleting the actual file as i am doing already ofcourse

7085728
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the configuration in httpd.conf not .htaccess looks like this

7085731
mouse	keyboard
however one major issue of hosting child windows from an external process is that if the external process hangs while responding to a user keyboard or mouse input the main application also freezes

7085741
client-side	server-side
the idea is that my ajax json objects can use the same template files to render stuff client-side like java is doing it server-side

7085781
getter	setter
i looked in the debugger whenever i change the property by using it s setter then the getter gets called in turn so the longlistselector reads the new template but doesn t apply it

7085786
winpcap	wireshark
it might be a good idea to see how both wireshark and winpcap does it

7085803
width	height
and i need to append px to the end of the width and height

7085816
for-loop	arrays
i was initially using a for-loop to go through just the vid_id arrays but now since i added the page element i am not quite sure how to handle it

7085818
accessor	properties
it creates an object as usual plus it returns a function handle that acts as a read-only accessor to a closure variable synced with the original object properties using a postset events listener

7085838
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
an ajax success callback is really an event handler for the xmlhttprequest object that does the work so in this case this refers to the xmlhttprequest object well actually a jqxhr object

7085858
children	parent
mouseleave on the other hand will only fire once the cursor is no longer over either the parent div or any of it s children

7085883
pull	push
mercurial will push pull all branches by default while git will push pull only the current branch

7085902
jar	manifest.mf
if it has and there is at least a manifest.mf with the right format in it it is a jar file

7085930
portrait	landscape
this may be a easy question but for some reason i can not seem to figure out how to get a page to automatically resize when changing from landscape to portrait in a flex mobile app

7085930
switching	screens	portrait	landscape
i have a page that displays a menu to collect customer information i have it laid out how i would like it for portrait but if i switching to landscape the formatting causes information to be left off of the screens

7085941
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and mobile safari this problem seems not existed and the audio player can play from the first audio to the last audio continuously

7085945
hide	show
the elements hide and show at the correct times and the links work if a different javascript action is put in place in the onclick field of the anchor

7085947
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout function and setinterval as well must be told what to do after the delay

7085970
pull	push
in git you have to pull push all the branches one by one

7085970
pull	push
you can specify each time which branch you want to pull push on git push origin master means you want to push your branch master on the one at origin which is often the default server

7085972
width	height
to #right manually set the height and width and then make #reflection #shadow and #iphone all position absolute

7086007
width	height	oncreate	onstart
i ve tried several different layouts and i ve tried setting the position of the imageview in my oncreate onstart onresume etc. but the width and height of all of my views are will 0 by 0

7086030
post	put
i put a post on forrst.com as i ve recently implemented something similiar in one of my projects

7086054
move	drag

7086065
hide	show
hide the grid and show the message

jobs	cron	daemon	cron
crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept

7086085
unix	aix
for day of the week field 5 both 0 and 7 are considered sunday though some versions of unix such as aix do not list 7 as acceptable in the man page

7086085
jobs	cron
vixie cron supports an extended time expression syntax where you can say 5 35 to run jobs at five past the hour and five past half

7086085
daemon	cron
will list the cron daemon if it s running

7086085
jobs	cron
you can also check syslog to see a list of recently executed cron jobs

7086085
daemon	cron
if your command is not writing output to a file the cron daemon will attempt to deliver any output by mail

7086085
jobs	cron
graphical programs x11 apps java programs ssh and sudo are notoriously problematic to run as cron jobs

7086085
sudo	passwd	jobs	cron
if ssh or sudo asks for a passwd it will fail in cron since the jobs run in the background with no user to interact with them

7086085
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
for sudo this means adding entries to sudoers to allow running a command without passwd and without requiring a tty

7086112
portrait	landscape
i have a page with an image and couple textboxes in a grid encapsulated in scrollviwer that supports both portrait and landscape orientation

7086112
portrait	landscape
i think it has to do something with a fact that in portrait mode without sip you can see all elements and in landscape you have to scroll down to see some textboxes

7086119
getter	setter
when you declare the type of a property you re declaring both the return type of the getter and the argument type of the setter

7086135
width	height
the button s height width or if the button s

7086138
antialiasing	transparent
if you make a big rectangle over the bounds of the view that is entirely transparent the line will draw with antialiasing

7086194
inherited	subclassing
the method i would want to use is handlekeyset which is protected therefore not visible.to get around this issue the only solution i can think of is to create a subclassing of resourcebundle and implement getkeys such that it returns only the keys of the current bundle and excludes the keys of the parent.the part where i start to doubt this solution is probably due to my confused understanding of inherited

7086208
pop-up	dialog
i have a button which on clicking pop-up a dialog box which then displays the selected ids

7086215
jobs	cron
you will need to run heroku rake jobs work or use resque-scheduler cron or something to run that task to to automatically run your jobs

7086228
google-chrome	firefox
you can easily see if you can reproduce the capybara error in-browser by clearing all your cookies as i m sure you know or by just switching to a new incognito window in google-chrome firefox which is a nice quick way to get a clean session

7086289
processors	hyperthreading
on new processors which support hyperthreading it is used as a hint to the processors that you are executing a spinloop to increase performance

7086293
margin	text-align
just for sure add text-align center to your #container and then add margin 20px auto

7086323
put	get
the code you put into either of those methods will get run on the main ui thread

7086344
atomic	compare-and-swap
this will involve leveraging platform-specific functions such as win32 s atomic compare-and-swap or cell s cache line reservation opcodes

7086345
rss	feed
i have a rss feed and it seems that has some errors in it

7086357
expander	togglebutton
probably overkill for you but if you really need this functionality to be reusable you could create your own custom control where you add four dependency properties togglebuttondownstyle togglebuttonupstyle togglebuttonleftstyle and togglebuttonrightstyle and copy the default style for expander into the default style for your custom control but change the staticresource for togglebutton style to a templatebinding

7086380
superclass	subclassing
every method needed for subclassing in the superclass seems a bit

7086381
chown	chmod
then you can chown chmod your files appropriately say you have your binaries in opt antoniod and data in var antoniod-data

7086444
glut	glfw	glut	qglwidget	glfw	qglwidget
qglwidget takes care of opengl context creation and management just like glut or glfw do

7086577
range	minimum
the minimum value overall in the range

7086577
min	max	range	max	range	min
the max and min values of a single-element range are just that element

7086577
min	max	range	max	range	min
the max and min values of a multiple element range can be found by splitting the input in half finding the max and min values of each half then taking their respective max and min

7086597
put	get	subtract	add
it d be great for this script to get the src attribute of the thumb you click on remove the last four characters to get rid of .jpg then add on _lg.jpg to display the correct large image put the new above the placeholder div and then subtract 500px from the margin-top so it slides up to show the new image

7086608
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i had to use the formdata object available in firefox 4+ safari 5+ and google-chrome and of course the filereader object

7086617
x86	64bit
probably when the platform is x86 the common language runtime applies x86 emulation in 64bit machines and apparently messed up in the comparison operator

7086621
express	node.js
the res object in express is a subclass of node.js s http.serverresponse read the http.js source

7086621
express	node.js
comprehensive list of node.js express response methods and when they must be called

7086633
opera	google-chrome
i m drawing video on canvas and it works in opera mozilla and google-chrome but in ie9 canvas is blank but video is playing

7086642
int	chars
remember to cast them to chars such that you get append chars rather than append int

7086655
boost	stl
i might use the stl to define a map between a boost thread id and an instance of the logger class

7086667
rss	feed
i use chrome most of the time and all i want is to be able to view a raw rss feed in the browser that is well formatted and easy to read so i can do some parsing for a project i m working on

7086669
int	double
it would probably make sense to write a wrapper for streams that can read double int singles etc

7086670
google-chrome	safari
basic maths tells me that 33 + 33 + 34 100 however in google-chrome desktop and safari iphone 4 ios5 i get some left over container div background colour

7086699
google-chrome	firefox
you can debug this quite easily in google-chrome or firefox by using a script terminal

7086699
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox you could install firebug or in google-chrome just press crtl+shift+j

7086714
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the solution in ie 5.5-9 google-chrome firefox opera and safari

7086742
msg	eml
i have a struts-action and when that action is called i would like to create and return a simple eml or msg file that can be opened in outlook

7086758
rss	feed
if you use firefox or ie they will detect rss feed and format it in a much more friendly way

7086769
google-chrome	safari
i really don t know why but when i try to display an iframe into google-chrome and safari it don t work

7086784
int	chars
but since chars wchar_t and int are all integral types and since values of any integral type can be assigned to an object of another integral type as long as the value is in range of the target type any of the following will work

7086787
post	get
but this will be post construction and you will not get any constructor injection

7086788
interpolation	splines
using double type i made cubic splines interpolation algorithm

7086796
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i am testing my website which works fine with iron firefox and opera now using internet explorer 9 and google-chrome

7086797
subclipse	rabbitvcs
svn clients subclipse rabbitvcs

7086797
subclipse	rabbitvcs
i ve experienced this behavior with both subclipse and rabbitvcs

7086830
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
you can use your favourite plain text editor for this for example notepad gedit vim emacs depending on the system you re using

7086883
ubuntu	debian
on any debian based system such as ubuntu you can use the excellent deb package metadata to do this for you

7086905
post	get
to check the value of a radio button in php it needs to have a name attribute which was sent in a form either by a get or post

7086949
uisegmentedcontrol	uiswitch
the behavior you are trying to achieve is better represented with a single uisegmentedcontrol for more than one option and a uiswitch for a yes|no option

7086968
equals	tostring
also the tostring maintenance could become an issue as it needs to change at the same rate as the equals method

7086971
jobs	cron
whenever s github wiki has a page for this output redirection aka logging your cron jobs

7086981
post	get
in order to determine is to submit a form as a post or get and query the value with the superglobals _post _get _request

7087046
post	get
i made a post about how to get the bounds of a display object even with tranparent areas here on my blog

7087050
post	get
the cookie is sent back with every http get or post to the server made from the domain path the cookie is set to until it expires

7087114
width	height
it is important to note that it only occurs in opera and as part of the css3 spec it is stated that box-shadow does not at height or width

7087148
g++	gcc
this system has a separate step for the linking of libraries and object files into the final executable but it insists on using gcc for this step instead of g++ because the program source files all have a .c extension so the result is a profusion of undefined symbols

7087148
g++	gcc
if the command line is manually pasted at a prompt and g++ is substituted for gcc then everything works fine

7087148
g++	gcc
there is a well-known to this build system make variable that allows flags to be passed to the linking step and it would be nice if there were some incantation that could be added to this variable that would force gcc to act like g++ since both are just driver programs

7087157
mouse	keyboard
i would like to implement mouse and keyboard listeners on the entire area an applet occupies

7087158
put	get
we now need to put that file on an s3 bucket to get it into our cdn

7087225
for-loop	loops
i thought since you had got that far with the code that you would be able to get it into a function if you re still working on this it might help to think of writing a for-loop to loops over your subjects and do the calculations required for that subject

7087227
g++	gcc
considering such a terrible build system write a wrapper around gcc that exec s gcc or g++ dependent upon the arguments

7087239
post	get
use the second parameter to which is the data querystring for get form values for post

7087278
post	get
ideally a step by step get one post as text kind of tutorial would be ideal and then i can dive into the docs and find the modules i need and so on

7087302
postgresql	mysql
i don t know of a way to do that with mysql but i mainly use postgresql so it might be possible and i just don t know

if it has been created used in osx leopard i get the 3 files unzipped but not in the folder zipfile rather in the same directory as the zip file

7087364
folder	directory
had a similar issue and it turned out to be the _svn folder in the vendor gems directory

7087370
shim	polyfills
here s a comprehensive list of polyfills and shim

7087371
submit	submission
as your button would normally submit your form but it appears not to be submission your client side javascript code in dostuff is probably returning false

7087385
stdio	gets
my guess is that this is something very low level and the ruby interpreter does not even gets the chance to show the exception and this message is stdio related

7087395
hash	hmac	des	aes
to ensure that that shared secret is always unique i will add the current date minute to the end of the secret then hash it using xxx algorithm protocol hmac aes des

7087404

you can also get your friends to install python on their windows machines and teach them how to run your programs if you re willing to put in the extra effort

7087555
webkit	gecko	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
only problems are i currently have no way of telling between safari and google-chrome both webkit browsers and between the versions of the gecko webkit and opera browsers themselves

7087563
codeigniter	cakephp
in my experience to understand mvc frameworks i would suggest picking out one that has a lot of documentations and howtos like codeigniter or cakephp then as you code the framework would probably serve as a guideline on how you would write the page web application

7087572
screens	tablet
well simply by using a wrapper with a fixed width somewhere around the smallest resolution you want to support for example 600px should provide an interesting amount of coverage although in such cases you usually make specific styles as the only screens with 600px width tend to be tablet phones etc

7087609
folder	directory
it is usually located in bin debug yourproject.exe or bin release yourproject.exe folder under your project directory

7087612
int	double
arraylist should work fine with int or double because they are as good as other object

7087615
portrait	landscape
an alternative approach that has worked for me in the past is to use two completely different layout managers - one optimized for portrait layout the other optimized for landscape - and toggle the visibility opacity of each based on the changes to orientation

7087664
clang	llvm
you can exec the compiler or when looking towards 10.7 investigate clang and llvm which provides the compiler as a library

7087664
clang	llvm
10.7 currently uses the gcc frontend to llvm though not clang

7087668
getter	setter
i already have the getter and setter

7087668
getter	setter
however the getter and the setter do not provide me with the correctly change the positions of the players each round

7087728
httpresponse	request
i would need this to send a request to then send the httpresponse to my extension

7087827
oncreate	setcontentview
to do that in oncreate of your activity call requestwindowfeature window.feature_indeterminate_progress before calling setcontentview then you can call setprogressbarindeterminatevisibility boolean anywhere from your activity

7087843
google-chrome	firefox
actually i dont want to embed any browser control with my window application instead opening a new instance of browser mostly firefox or google-chrome it self with web site url pass username and password and click on button to sing in

7087929
move	drag
i have seen many iphone and ipad note apps where there is a drawing canvas and if you use 2 fingers and drag the canvas itself move like it is endless

7087945
width	text-align
one way to get this to work is setting the outer wrapper to a certain width and having it set to text-align center

7087962
post	put
i found one post on this that agrees with my sentiment but mvvmlights default project creation seems to put them together so im wondering if i am missing the point.

7087990
stateless	stateful
when this questions comes up on the lift mailing list what the author of the framework usually replies with is a blog post he wrote some time ago which explains why lift is stateful but at the same time how you can use lift as a stateless framework

7087994
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this sample code in internet explorer firefox google-chrome the memory usage increases until the browser os runs out of memory and the browser crashes

7088045
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
datasource refers to actual data source object which can be .net provided data source controls such as objectdatasource sqldatasource or actual data objects such as datatable collection of objects etc

7088052
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is in google-chrome firefox the page looks like

7088069
google-chrome	firefox
however the code works properly in both google-chrome and firefox

7088072
inherited	properties
i want tabindex properties defined in the xaml implementation of numericupdown should be inherited in the textbox defind in style of numericupdown control

7088074
getter	setter
setter and getter are generated for you and are well done to keep you away from memory management

7088100
put	get
i would like to put something together that can get us all up to speed quickly in a matter of a day vs a longer learning curve and then allow them to grow into the shell and so forth over the next couple weeks

7088100
heroku	openshift
a lot of things have crossed my mind such as gitorious since we ll have a lot of small projects needing to be tracked and an enormous github account is not feasible heroku openshift and a lot of other things but i have enough uncertainty that i d like to get some input from the community as to the right mix for greatâ collaborative agile development

7088112
mouse	keyboard
my input method program does mouse keyboard hooking it does not predict text like usual mac s input methods

7088114
starttls	smtps
i suggest reading upon how to extend your existing protocol to support tls by looking at an example say the smtps starttls rfc 2487

7088122
int	double

uiview	subviews
all the tree nodes are uiview too which has label and uiimage as subviews

uiview	subviews
when a node is generated from the data source it will generate a uiview for the node and add to rootview as subviews

7088624

7115671
ubuntu	centos
i am using apache 2.2 on both ubuntu and on centos and i have built the module from scratch on both systems independently

7115671
ubuntu	centos
i have discovered that building the module on centos and then copying the binary over to ubuntu and it works

7115671
ubuntu	centos
therefore the code does not necessarily seem to be the problem -- or at least there is something being handled by the compiler differently on the two systems that is causing success with the centos build but not the ubuntu build

7115833
screens	tablet
one thing to keep in mind before you start is that there s currently a lot of code floating around the web that assumes you can judge a screens size by the platform version ie everything up to gingerbread is a phone and honeycomb and up is a tablet

7115833
width	height
don t do this also try to avoid a massive switch case that just executes different blocks of code based on width height values you pull from the system

7115833
screens	tablet	switching	screens
one common pattern this enables is to let you set up a nav fragment content fragment which sit side-by-side on a tablet where there s room but have the nav fragment switching over to the content fragment when an item is selected on a phone or smaller screens

7116090
post	get
if you understand the concept of a url being used to request a corresponding resource from a server and the difference between get and post then you really know all you need to about rest

7116095
width	height
for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be.

7116160
width	height
maybe instead of pulling then entire tag in the ajax response just get the image name and properties to change the targeted image src height width etc.

7116226

i wonder if including the image height and width in the style attribute of the img tag would help since it takes a split second for the browser to start downloading the image and get the actual image height and width

7117615

alternatively you can just put the button outside the panel so it doesn t get replaced

7118610
voip	rtp
my requirement is to find out whether the rtp packet received on my ip phone from a voip gateway is containing speech or some tone

7118622
rar	zip
but there are some simple ways to block the code you can create a rar or zip archive encrypted with password and after they get license you can tell them the password

7118689
client-side	server-side
i have two client-side ria services projects each mapped to server-side ria assembly for code-gen etc

7118702

use onfocus and onblur instead

7119007
hash	md5
the md5 algorithm is not a cypher algorithm but a hash generator

7119025
operands	scalar
it seems that the default is to add two single precision scalar 66 normally operands size override prefix selects the double precision version f3 repz selects the packed single version and finally f2 repnz selects the packed double version

7119045
x86	64bit
to note this may change depending if your using a 64bit machine or a 32 bit machine but the 64bit emgu version will not run on x86 machines

7119054
hash	salt
then when the user enters the password encrypt the user input with the same hash function and salt and compare the encrypted values

7119066
hash	md5
what you re doing here is getting the md5 hash of the password rather than decrypting it

7119066
hash	md5
one use of the md5 hash is to store the hash in the database instead of storing the user s password

7119066
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
have a look at this question for an example md5 hash with salt for keeping password in db in c#

7119099
getter	setter
you could achieve that using accessors getter setter to entrance and checking the type throwing an exception if the entrance is not a door but that would break the liskov substitution principle you would not be able to manipulate house s as if they were building s

7119108
fadein	fadeout
it works fine adds and removes the class to the element no problem but i want it to fadein the class and then fadeout the class here s the code

7119115
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the characters with more browsers and the long tail only appears in google-chrome and firefox on the windows platform

7119176
hash	md5
like the other users have said before md5 is a one-way hash algorithm

7119176
hash	md5
the best you can do is to guess the password hash it with md5 and compare it to the hash

7119176
hash	salt
and if a salt was used when generating the hash then it will take even more time

7119176
hash	salt
a good article on bad passwords hash salt rainbow tables...etc

7119216
svg	vml

7119500
int	chars
getchar returns an int which is the representation of the chars entered

7119500
int	chars
if you enter the chars a you will get a or 0x41 returned upgraded to an int and assuming you re on an ascii system of course

7119500
int	chars
the reason it returns an int rather than a chars is because it needs to be able to store any chars plus the eof indicator where the input stream is closed

7119505
textview	imageview
however i am not able to see imageview and textview

7119512
int	chars
the c chars type is 8 bits which means it can store the range of int from -128 to 127 255 distinct values

7119529
int	chars
every chars including numbers entered on the command line is read as a chars and every chars has an int value based on its ascii code

7119590
int	chars
unlike some other languages you may have used chars in c are int

7119590
int	chars
chars is just another int type usually 8 bits and smaller than int but still an int type

7119590
ord	chr
so you don t need ord and chr functions that exist in other languages you may have used

7119590
int	chars
in c you can convert between chars and other int types using a cast or just by assigning

7119590
getchar	fgetc	int	chars
unless eof occurs getchar is defined to return an unsigned chars converted to an int same as fgetc so if it helps you can imagine that it reads some chars c then returns int unsigned chars c

7119599
post	get
you are sending a post request but your php file is trying to get values from a get request

7119629

7123131
pop-up	dialog
if a modal dialog pop-up in that time the app will be blocked until the user attends the phone and dismisses the modal dialog

7123151
google-chrome	safari
iâ ve popped up a test page which alerts the value of the autoplay property on a newly-created element and both safari on ios 4.3 and google-chrome 13 on mac os x return false as opposed to undefined which is what ie 6 returns

7123173
width	height
transactions_label showeffect showview width 100 height 100 transactionscreen true

7123202
getter	setter
i have value with a getter and setter and it is bound to a control

7123255
put	get
i usually bumble for several hours and never get anywhere so i d like to put the question out here with my real-world example

7123273
google-chrome	safari
that works on all modern browsers ff4+ google-chrome safari ie8 and ie9+

7123303
width	height
i created a sample console application that calls this method and prints the width and height of the size object returned to the console

7123303
width	height
vista width 20 height 21

7123303
width	height
xp width 15 height 20

7123303
width	height
win7 width 7 height 21 --- width returned is wrong

7123334
button	checkbox
regarding your removal feature you could just use a checkbox or even a submit button like

7123396
jtextfield	jtable
why not using autocomplete combobox jtextfield and if you don t want to display jcombobox then there is autocompleted jtextfield and for somehow reduced autosuggestions would be better look for undecorated jdialog window with jtable with one tablecolum and without tableheaded in the jscrollpane just with plain rowsorter very simle job

7123412
width	height
if i understand correctly you need to check the modulo of px and py and set the width and height according to it

7123470
apache	nginx
whilst it is possible to make post request with node i think the pattern you re describing is better suited to using a a server like nginx or apache in front of both node.js and django and proxying requests to whichever port is appropriate based on the request

7123473
tunnel	vpn
suggest another secure alternative - the only thing i could think of is to set up the vpn with them on a non-azure server and then tunnel the requests through using azure connect - which is obviously extra work for us and also defeats the point of hosting the service on a cloud if it depends on a non-cloud service

7123544
floating-point	integer
contrary to dense factorisation sparse methods always include a non-negligible amount of integer work in addition to the floating-point work done though the floating-point is still dominant

7123586
post	get
when i try and post json data through the chrome extension simple rest client i get a 500 internal server error stating the document does not have a valid root

7123602
int	chars
many languages will either stop on the first chars that cannot be represented as an int the letter a will blindly convert all chars into their ascii value the letter a becomes 97 or will ignore chars that cannot be represented as int and only convert the ones that can - or return 0 empty

7123629
hide	show
i want to query the hide show status of parameters of a report

7123638
inherited	subclassing
i m trying to determine what the best practice is regarding the storage and access to class data so that it can be inherited and potentially extended by a subclassing

7123673
google-chrome	firefox
this is working in firefox and google-chrome but not ie 8

7123674
int	chars
many most languages represent strings on some level or another as an array or list of chars which are also short int

7123674
multiplying	add
starting from the left you multiplying your current total by 10 add the next character s value and move on

7123685
width	height
the following assumes that the width and height of the image is known

7123685
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
update in modern browsers margin auto will produce the desired result withing knowing the width height of the image

7123699
inherited	properties
the c in css cascading which means elements inherited properties from their parents

7123702
webkit	gecko
with enough patience you could take a look at some prominent open source rendering engines like webkit gecko chrome at find out how they render dropdown buttons as part of a combobox

7123710
int	chars
to convert a string to an int take each chars in turn and if it s in the range 0 through 9 convert it to its decimal equivalent

7123710
multiplying	add
now multiplying any previous results by 10 and add the new value

7123723
qhash	qmap
if you want to be able to reference items by name you re going to want to use a qmap or a qhash

7123723
qhash	qmap
qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through them

7123731
hash	salt
the user registration form has a few fields which i don t want to store in the database such as the password and password confirmation i m storing a salt and a hash instead

7123742
button	checkbox
in the javascript snippet below lays down 2 checkbox that i need to work like radio button

7123773
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
extend exception if you want it to be a checked exception extend runtimeexception if you want it to be an unchecked-exception

7123778
solaris	sunos
i was going to earn my credit with the supervisor for my quite advanced graphics program at a sunos solaris with instant messaging enabled where with zephyr.vars or whatever it was called you could make an image appear on your listed friend s screen like if you alowed me i could just send you an image that appeared on your display

7123801
mouse	trackpad
i am scrolling down using my mouse and then also using my trackpad

7123821
width	height
or if you wanted to keep the width and height of the box with the same proportion use and

7123824
tax	shipping
but for buyers outside of my state pa i did shopping car rule that gives discount in the amount of tax charge for those who chose regular shipping

7123961
children	parent
however removing the inverse statement would cause the children to be saved the parent to be saved then the children s parent id to be updated

7123963
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button you re rather interested in click event than the change event

7123969
width	margin
this solution doesnt care about outer div s width or innder div s width because i am using margin auto which takes care of centering the element perfectly

7123998
children	parent
if there s an item with children as the last item nsstring item will be the parent if it s not expanded or the last child if it is expanded

7124010
gif	png
if you can t do that create the symbols you need as png or gif images and insert them inline

7124014
equals	gethashcode
because the equals and gethashcode methods on anonymous types are

7124014
equals	gethashcode
defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode methods of the

7124056
x86	64bit
check the box for 2008r2_sp1_snac_cu2_2567714_10_50_2772_x86 if your web server is an x86 machine and 2008r2_sp1_snac_cu2_2567714_10_50_2772_x64 if it is 64bit

7124065
boost	eigen
when using header-only libraries such as boost or glm eigen etc

7124078
int	chars
the exception you re getting indicates that the stored procedure is trying to cast a chars value that is not a number to int

7124095
google-chrome	firefox
i have observed this happens in both google-chrome and firefox and it manifests somewhat differently

7124095
width	height
one solution would be to use css3 transform instead of height and width that would at least allow me to not have to deal with the coordinates of the elements while they re off screen but it doesn t change the fact that settimeout gets all bunched up and weird

7124108
put	get
8.54 had support for compile_ints 1 but it was not enabled by default so you may want to build with that so that the initialization files get put into the exectuable as compressed data

7124160
keydown	keyup
you bind the keydown event to the input box in order to prevent the undesired characters from being entered and bind the keyup event in order check the value modify the div s height

7124189
int	double
in your example you are providing a double constant which is not an unsigned int

7124189
int	double
change your unsigned int to a double if you want it to work the way you intended

7124218
post	get
i need somehow this value to reach my web application no mater trough post get method or by opening new ie window

7124284
vsto	add-in
i have a problem connected with office 2007 and vsto add-in

7124284
vsto	add-in
vsto add-in word excel

7124284
vsto	add-in
my vsto add-in is not shown in the menu

7124304
inherited	subclassing
and that would not be inherited anyway since changes to baseclass.__dict__ would affect all instances of baseclass and all subclassing that use its datamap

7124319
mongodb	bson
i naively assumed that i wouldn t see a difference because mongodb itself keeps the records as bson and there really shouldn t be much difference between having 600 fields each with an integer or a single string which contains a json record which in turn keeps 600 integers

7124365
post	get
i think that button_to uses post by default my ror route skills are a bit rusty but i think the route you ve shown uses get

7124383
mouse	keyboard
a conditional function to go off when a keyboard or mouse button is pushed

7124395
getter	setter
you can then access c.x and it will automatically call the getter for x and automatically call the setter for x when you assign to c.x

7124418
post	put
so to put it in a nutshell i want to delete every post that isn t on the latest 15

7124493
filtering	grouping
you use this class to store both an entire grouping the initial data and the result of a query content of a grouping after applying some filtering

7124543
gif	png
create an image of a div in javascript gif png

7124635
tolower	toupper
in addition to this i added three methods reverse toupper and tolower and to escape quit and it is not necessarily adjecent or not can be any spaces between the command and the string

7124736
width	height
the canvas has a width and a height

7124739
apache	nginx
if that is possible and provides a performance increase could you do something like cloudfront which routes to an elastic loadbalancer which routes to an ec2 instance which has nginx as a front still have some static content not on cloudfront which in turn routes all php to apache s mod_php

7124744
google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome firefox etc

7124794
google-chrome	firefox
it firefox and google-chrome console it find a match for the string d once every two attemps

7124813
implements	extends
extends to what jason said you would need to implements a code that works efficiently and not rely on the brute force algorithm that falconeyes suggested

7124822
int	chars
so chars + int 8 2 bytes

7124822
int	chars
for it to be 8 bytes you would have to declare an actual int 4 bytes and a chars 1 byte

7124836
qdatastream	qbytearray
i am byte-packing the string into a qbytearray using a qdatastream

7124836
pull	push
i would really appreciate some insight from someone who has some experience with zmq specifically with mixed pub sub push pull and req rep patterns

7124850
for-loop	loops
only when the while loops exits will the for-loop continue to the next value

7124864
portrait	landscape
they will be displayed on an ipad in both landscape and portrait modes

7124870
accessor	properties
it says that the properties accessor for the httpchannelbinding properties does not support the operation on this platform

7124873
comparator	comparable
i would avoid comparator and have object implement comparable so that i can simply use

7124934
nunit	nsubstitute
i am doing some unit testing with nunit and nsubstitute on a function that uses httpresponse i know you can t mock these objects so i have created interfaces to represent them and some of there properties

7125046
filtering	grouping
choose an application grouping filtering drop down choices recap filtering

7125214
dictionary	map
also for the reflection solution as long as your requirements weren t too complicated you could create your mapping definitions by creating a typed dataset with a couple of tables with column names matching those to map and then using the information in the datacolumn s of the tables to do your mapping definition instead of dictionary lists and tuples

7125220
children	parent
as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children

7125243
division	modulo
integer division and modulo should give you the values you need

7125271
phpmyadmin	adminer
using the adminer plugin phpmyadmin i have looked at the wp_options table and there are none of the custome settings fields that i have specified

7125286
spaces	delimiter
i need to write a query to select the data from col1 break up each value using the spaces as the delimiter and inserting the data on either side of the spaces into col2 and col3 respectively

7125288
google-chrome	firefox
the code behaves the same in modern browser google-chrome ie 9 firefox .and the result is

7125316
min	max
that said i don t know why the compiler isn t smart enough to use the sse min max instructions on the ternary operator when it seems to use sse instructions for all floating point calculations anyway

7125326
put	get
if i put the array definition in the function body i get the string value ran each time so the array always has only one value instead of having many strings named ran

7125334
vbo	vao
as you noted vbos are still shareable so you just have to create a vao for each context that binds the shared vbo

7125340
post	get
it is trivial to do this as post or get

7125351
google-chrome	firefox
the really strange part that might also indicate the problem is that this issue occurs in ie firefox and google-chrome

7125432
post	get
if this doesn t work you should post a new question about how to get it to work

7125451
width	height
this will generate the table like this without borders the last rows just increases in height if the text is longer then it fits in width

7125453
width	height
i know how to use jquery to assign width height etc

7125453
width	height
what i m building is a slideshow of images that occupy the full viewport recalculating the image s width height and left properties on resize so that the image is always centered favors width over height except when the viewport is taller than it is wide resizing does not reload the page just fires a function to resize the image

7125455
gif	png
similar result with png and gif

7125455
gif	png
note instead of png i tried jpg and gif but didnot make a difference

7125505
width	height
if you are working in 2d the main ones you ll be dealing with will be the width height aspectratio saves calculating it yourself and if you re planning to deploy to 360 the titlesafearea the rectangle safe to draw to on all tv s older tv s will clip 5-10 of some of the edges

7125505
width	height
you probably won t be changing the width and height of your window in runtime so if you store an x and a y for the camera position you can store the width and height of the screen and never have to look at the viewport again except maybe to place hud elements within the titlesafearea

7125538
width	height
if i forcibly set a width and a height of 400px on all of the anchor tags then everything would show up

7125538
width	height
if i set a width and height of 300px everything disappeared

7125620
tftp	telnet	ftp	telnet
zlib 1.2.3 protocols tftp ftp telnet dict ldap http file https ftps

7125620
ssl	ntlm
features gss-negotiate ipv6 largefile ntlm ssl libz

7125623
width	height
you also have to give the element with the background a width and a height to fit the background image

7125682
google-chrome	firefox
i have also seen that google-chrome firefox and even ie will gracefully handle a queue of about 100 requests

7125697
strstr	strcmp
now i ve tried strstr strcmp etc.

7125726
post	get
but all url s over 20 characters are automatically shortened and you can control what get s shortened by including on the post you send to twitter for new messages

7125726
twitter	bit.ly
twitter does not release an api like bit.ly does for url s but if you look through the sharekit library you will see the following file

7125774
stdout	stderr
you can test for stderr by redirecting it separately from stdout

7125802
children	parent
the children table is a way of mapping parent to the person table to associate the child-to-parent many-to-many relationship

7125808
mdpi	hdpi
on top of that aspect ratios don t match up with pixel density so using ldpi mdpi hdpi to decide on aspect ratio is probably not a good idea

7125865
system.in	system.out
i have created program that takes input from system.in and output to system.out

7125871
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp
i suggest you to use string functions like strcmp strlen strcpy to deal with strings because for that it s actually implemented

7125909
portrait	landscape
for example you ll see that each row contains some portrait and some landscape photos

7125909
portrait	landscape
the overall effect however is that g+ can pull from a large pool of images and therefore can choose a combination of images that meet the needs of the individual aspect ratio landscape or portrait aspect of the given image as well as overall aspect ratio of the containing rectangle

7125909
width	height
i would take images that are available in the pool and calculate their aspect ratio a simple width divided by height

7125909
portrait	landscape
2nd row 2 landscape photos 2 portrait photos and 1 square photo

7125909
portrait	landscape
3rd row 3 landscape photos 1 portrait photo and 1 square photo

7125909
width	height
the result is that since all thumbnails have the same height their combined widths in these particular combinations give you the desired resulting width for the layout rectangle

7125931
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari don t support changing the css of map or area elements

7125983
google-chrome	safari
i was having this same issue with both google-chrome and safari and found success by assigning a class .map to each area tag and giving the class the following style

7126015
maven	m2e
i suggest you using maven with m2e eclipse integration plugin

7126049
implements	extends
however if you want to create non-abstract class extends a base class you have to implements all abstract methods

7126062
accessor	properties
value assigned refers to an object then properties accessor prefixed

7126108
hide	show
an even better option would be to just create the second select outright and then show hide it when needed

7126133
client-side	server-side
server-side part maintains the state of the user interface component and the client-side widget renders that state

7126133
client-side	server-side
application developers typically only use the server-side components to build the application and they don t really have to care about how the client-side works

7126173
trie	tree
one common data structure for holding this data is a trie a 26-way tree where each node stores a prefix of a word and each edge corresponds to appending some letter to the current prefix

7126263
hide	show
i need a js script show hide with only show one div at time others closed

7126263
hide	show
if show will be added div will not be hided he will heve status show othervise all divs will be hide

7126270
google-chrome	firefox
my limited google research suggests that ie9 will execute scripts injected in this manner in a different order from other browsers notably firefox and google-chrome

7126308
hide	show
the problem is the default is visible and the trigger needs to show it when value 0 and hide it otherwise

7126331
width	height
keep in mind that there may be very wide pictures which need some workaround cropped or width of them should be width of row and height variable

7126341
google-chrome	firefox
though i suggested firefox and google-chrome those are really huge to understand in single shot

7126516
mouse	keyboard
i want to do for both mouse and keyboard focus

7126519
octal	decimal
its default behavior is to sense the base automatically so strings like 0400 are interpreted as octal not decimal

7126523
listadapter	listactivity	textview	listactivity	textview	listadapter
first just to make sure things were working when i wrote my listactivity i wrote my custom listadapter with a getview function which returned only a textview as follows

7126558
put	get
you might even get more concise answers if you don t put it in real cnf.

7126560
jstl	taglib
you can find an overview of them all in the jstl taglib documentation

7126632
pop-up	dialog
upon user clicking the link the dialog opens in a separate page not in a dialog box pop-up

7126632
pop-up	dialog
when user clicks on add item i dynamically change the text to remove item and when user clicks remove item i put up a dialog box which in this case opens in a separate page not a dialog pop-up

7126683
button	checkbox
i found the problem with just using input disabled disabled was that it also includes checkbox and radio button which i didn t want to handle quite the same way

7126692
width	height
there are multiple tables and each table has been customized for width and height

7126710
put	get
finally put a position absolute on the span and give it a top ..px to get it below the div

7126751
versioning	upgrade
some time ago i upgrade a magento store 1.4.2.0 to versioning 1.5.1.0 and the upgrade process was ok

7126757
textview	imageview
so i am doing it like this with 2 imageview and 3 textview in every row

7126765
implements	extends
to create a custom tooltip extends the cell renderer and override it s createtooltip to implements your custom functionality return a custom extended version of jtooltip

7126817
button	checkbox
when the user clicks the ok or whatever button you iterate all checkbox that are checked and build your object

7126894
google-chrome	safari
testing this code works great when testing in a browser google-chrome and safari but in the android emulator with phonegap the alert message is never displayed which makes it look like the event binding is incorrect

7126897
min	max
find the min max in 3 2 o n 2 comparisons

7127018
children	parent
thus you can update from a to b if there is a way to get from a to b moving along either parent only or children only

7127034
ubuntu	linux
in my case ubuntu linux it s in usr bin php

7127096
disk	ram
the flush operation forces the file data into the file cache in ram and from there it s the os s job to actually send it to the disk

7127112
implements	extends
if you want to change a whole bunch of things about their look and feel it is better to extends your current look and feel with a class implements custom tooltip look and feel

7127123
google-chrome	firefox
rails 3.1rc5 with jquery ubuntu 11.04 google-chrome 13 mozilla firefox 6.0

7127123
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got it working but it s laggy in google-chrome and very laggy in firefox - the header doesn t seem to actually move until the user stops scrolling

7127134
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
to add strings from the string items to list i use a for-loop to loops through the string arrays and add each string to list using command list.add items.get i

7127182
google-chrome	safari
in safari 5.1 and google-chrome 13 when resizing the browser window images aren t anti-aliased smoothly and artifacts are clearly visible

7127184
folder	directory
save the content in a protected directory ie above your http or www folder

7127226
post	get
an example of a simple post to test a login system is all i need to get going

7127251
int	double
when comparing double and floats to int or to each other you should always consider what is the acceptable precision and accept a range either side of your expected result

7127263
draggable	droppable
i m using a canvas to load a background image and then using jquery ui i call the droppable function on the canvas and draggable on a bunch of png images on the screen that are not in the canvas

7127294
hide	show
then when you get the double-click event you would hide the textblock and show the textbox

7127296
punctuation	words
splits words at punctuation characters removing punctuation

7127307
width	height
for example the devices which has maximum width of 480px in both orientation will never need the css code of written for the device with greater then 480px width or height even if the css is cached

7127313
minimum	max
look-up in the case of failure should be constant time if the current element is less than the minimum element of the heap containing the max m elements we can reject it outright

7127364
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

7127373
hide	show
you can put all pages in one html page then just hide show the correct pages when they navigate using javascript

7127384
punctuation	words
i m getting some good results with these regex but it s giving an empty char before all splits on punctuation at start of a words

7127416
explode	implode
first you explode your string and second step you use implode function

7127421
background-color	transparency
set the background-color to white but somehow use the alpha channel of the png to set its transparency

7127425
single-quotes	double-quotes
you don t need to escape single-quotes or double-quotes or like-wildcards for a table name

7127465
spaces	delimiter
if all of those lists will be the same length you can concatenate each corresponding entry delimiter by a spaces to create a list of the combined strings and then concatenate those delimiter by a newline to create the displayed list of results

7127511
phpmyadmin	heidisql
stop using phpmyadmin on your server use heidisql

7127570
int	double
to store numbers as large as 64 bits you will need to use the double or decimal type but will not have int precision with double and you have overhead with decimal

7127571
disk	ram
even after putting the db on the same machine 24 gb ram fast disk etc. we could improve scalability by 100 by implementing a cache based on concurrentdictionary - thus being able to serve double the requests with the same machine

7127582
width	margin
you could then specify the rule so that changes to the form or page width will automatically sort out your margin also

7127586
int	double
you tried to call a function that takes int by passing floats or double to it

7127598
google-chrome	safari
for ie and google-chrome safari which rely on the ie settings you can set a group policy to prevent a non-admin user from changing the settings

7127605
width	height
from python i want to access the properties of that image for example name width and height

7127615
int	double	int	chars
in short methods don t change the external value of primitives int float double long chars with the operations in the method you have to return the resulting value of those operations to the caller if you wish to obtain it

7127639
vsto	add-in
vsto applications office add-in only support certain bits of clickonce

7127655
hide	show
the article using internal com.android.internal and hidden hide apis by user inazaruk show you step by step a method to import hidden android apis

7127660
post	get
it doesn t look as if you have an input called user_pic which is what you are looking to get as a post variable

7127707

7132020
bmp	png
ms chart exports a binary image jpg png bmp etc.

7132049
width	height
i don t think however that an image can be created from a stream containing integers instead you probably need to create an empty bitmap of the same width x height as your array then loop like in the code snippet above and set pixels according to your values

7132064
portrait	landscape
in landscape orientation device-height evaluates to 1024px and in portrait orientation it evaluates to 768px

7132130

adding display inline-block should do it for firefox safari and google-chrome

7132455
move	drag
take the google map for example the map view is draggable when you drag the map slowly the map will move with your mouse however if you drag the map very fast and then drop the mouse the map will keep moving a limited distance it seems that it has a buffer distance

7132577
hide	show
so it should hide the image that the user has just clicked and show the one that was hidden

7132620
flip	slide
2 i want to move the contents of fgview to bgview which won t be animated and animate the appearance of a new uiview which is added to fgview using slide fade in out or flip animations

longlistselector	silverlight
longlistselector from silverlight toolkit for windows phone - august release.

7132702
accessor	properties
if the expressions you need to evaluate are limited to relatively simple arithmetic maybe some string manipulation and object properties accessor method calls then i would look into using one of the readily available expression language libraries and see if they suffice such as mvel or ognl

7132707
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking into creating an extension for firefox google-chrome that creates a button in the toolbar

7132759
calloc	malloc
calloc would be a better choice here as it is going to assign default 0 values whereas malloc will just allocate space having garbage values

7132781
tlistview	tlistbox
i know tlistbox renders like this but i require the use of tlistview for the data property also the tlistview handles icons better via a timagelist

7132786
valgrind	callgrind
but if i run the program with valgrind --tool callgrind the connection always times out

7132805
pop-up	dialog
however in order to achieve the effect that you mentioned you could use a customized dialog to pop-up within your main gallery activity and then set the rest of the screen as blurred with the use of window manager

7132881
width	height
yes as said above you need to put a # when referring to ids in css but you also need to specify a width and a height for your #twitter div so that is will have some dimension

7132896
put	get
the way i would get around this is to put this switching code inside of a rootviewcontroller that is on the window

7132944
min	max
i also use min and max for years which is quite helpful

7132944
min	max
max is in my case 99 and min 9

7132951
post	get
if you absolutely cannot use post or get you could use cookies or sessions...although i am pretty sure sessions are not supported in javascript

7132951
post	get
i would recommend using post or get depending on the variable size - cookies come with a lot of limitations and conditions

7132954
pop-up	dialog
trying i have approx 5+ pop-up dialog to show in the main page

7132958

x86	64bit
for some cpu-bound code using 64bit variables it is beneficial to use the amd64 instruction set rather than x86

7133090
sse	avx
you can only use mmx sse sse2 sse3 avx for accessing 64-bit alu and registers of your cpu when running in 32-bit os

use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine logcat and look at the stack trace associated with your force close

7133220
cpython	pypy
after yield chunk the variable value is never used again in the function so a good interpreter garbage collector will already free chunk for garbage collection note cpython 2.7 seems not do this pypy 1.6 with default gc does

7133246
tiff	png
tiff to png

7133246
tiff	png
system.drawing.image will allow you to open a group3 tiff and save it as png simply by loading the tiff as a normal image image.fromfile image.fromstream etc. and then saving it using the image.save method with the imageformat.png argument

7133251
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
and when you set the onclicklistener in your setitems call internally it will be assigned to the listview onitemclicklistener

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however in firefox ie google-chrome and safari are fine we have a problem

7133550
google-chrome	safari
on page load refresh the scrollto position should reset so it displays the first slider by default as it should and does in safari and google-chrome

7133689
for-loop	loops
i was thinking of creating a for-loop that loops through the number of rows in the text file saved in the code as height generating a new random number each time to select a different verb set or row in the two dimensional array. essentially i d like to get a loops to run through the entire verbrun class and pause for the actionlistener until all of the verb sets have been displayed

7133731
post	put
this is not answering your question directly but i feel i put it as an answer plus it is too big to post as a comment

7133745
super	self
the simplest way to do that is to call super s implementation which will return the view or any subview of itself if the point is within the view and then just return self if that method returned non- nil

7133758
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a rails 2.3.8 app on ruby 1.8.7 from mysql to postgresql 9.x and while it everything appears to be working correctly in development mode all of my tests standard unit and functional tests with yml fixtures immediately error with the message

7133969
post	put
put a breakpoint in your inner for-loop and inspect the values of j i and getelementsbytagname object .length as well as swf j .getelementsbytagname param .length after the first iteration and post the results

7133978
postgresql	mysql
example on postgresql since mysql doesn t support with

7133999
folder	directory
copy the fires directly to the folder directory in the workspace and then use file - refresh to refresh the eclipse view of the native system

7134006
getter	setter
in this case there is no need for getter or setter methods and so no need to use property or synthesize at all

7134006
getter	setter
then create getter and setter methods if you need them

7134054
int	double
beats the purpose of int doesnt it change the column type to float or double

7134058
charindex	substr
it is even easier if the tasks are 1-character long you can use left longtaskname 1 instead of the ugly substr charindex mess

7134060
int	boolean
instead of using an int use a boolean

7134116
folder	directory
i included the library by building it with maven and placing the directory in my web-inf lib folder and then including the jar netflix-client-2.3-snapshot.jar in my build path

7134122
cookiemanager	urlconnection
if you are using http urlconnection for the request then you can use cookiemanager to handle cookies

7134141
setinterval	settimeout
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

7134161
min	max
you may think of each input to the black box as an n -digit number in a max - min + 1 radix system

7134161
min	max
simply iterate over all the numbers from 0 to max - min + 1 n decode each number and feed the resulting vector to the black box

7134172
initializer	class-method
also how do i access this dictionary since these are class-method and cannot use a dictionary instance variable to initializer with the dictionary used in the plist

7134189
min	max
notice that right now we can read off the max and min of the stack by looking at the top of the stack and seeing that 7 is the max and 2 is the min

7134189
min	max
now if we want to query the max and min we can do so in o 1 by just reading off the stored max and min atop the stack 9 and 1 respectively

7134189
min	max
and as you can see the max and min are computed correctly

7134189
min	max
- however you may want to consider implementing the stack using one of the standard stack implementation techniques such as using a dynamic array or linked list of objects each of which holds the stack element min and max

7134226
switching	screens
this isn t switching the whole screens just a popup window where clicking outside of the bounds of that window will make it disappear leaving only my title screens remaining as it was visible behind this popup view

7134330
put	get
make sure that you are separating the classes for #1 and #2 and each of them put their data to normalized data format that then get feed to your view presentation layer

7134351
getter	setter
as jb nizet mentioned before i changed mappedsuperclass to entity after that i ve got another error mappedby reference an unknown target entity property org.blogsample.mappingbeans.comment.author this was solved by changing db structure removed author_id from message table added it to each of comment post and created foreign keys for this column and moving author and getter setter with mapping to comment post classes

7134388
width	height
i am trying to find out an image s width and height from the address url of the image using javascript and jquery

int	double
ld is a format specifier for a long int not a long double

7134588
ssl	https
so i tried changing the href of the tag to use https for the validator but then the page simply doesn t load i guess because the validator doesn t use ssl

7134603
put	get
it s almost unreadable this way but if you make a wrapper-class for parts pros whatever your names are you get niecer looking and reading code and can put some utility functions inside the classes while hiding the implementation-detail of using dictionaries

7134626
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
mappedsuperclass means that entities extends this class inherited columns and associations from the superclass but these columns and associations go in the table of the subclassing

7134655
int	double	int	chars
if you create a template class and then use it with for example int chars and double then the compiler will create methods for the template for those types

7134657
mouseout	mouseenter
it may be better to use the .hover jquery function which handles both enter and leave rather than mouseenter and mouseout

7134682
width	height
does not register height or width but an element with visibility hidden

7134688
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried making a link with an href containing the string but for long files the string get truncated in firefox google-chrome and does not work at all in ie 7 8 9

7134697
xslt	xquery
for example having named types is important for advanced use like if you want to exploit schema-aware xml processing in xquery or xslt but less important if you need the schema just for validation

7134699
opera	firefox
firefox the event is transitionend in opera otransitionend and in

7134741
children	parent
curious why you re getting the parent and then the children why not just jquery this .siblings .sub_div1

i understood this as you can show hide different design elements by changing the content value ie

7134840
ubuntu	linux
i have some trouble getting this particular kernel patch to compile correctly with my ubuntu linux kernel

i have three lists a parent and two children list that are linked through lookup columns

7134909
filtering	grouping
the client wants to see all the lists together in one view and be able to filtering and edit grouping of items

7134909
filtering	grouping
the business need is for the client to filtering the three lists based on criteria they select from either list a and list b and list c to get a grouping of items they make the updates and save the changes back to the 3 lists

7134921
swt	swing
i have already tried swt and swing but the gui layout lacks the polished look and feel of commercial applications such as the cd dvd burning software nero

7134931
hash	salt
salt || hash site || password || salt

7134931
hash	salt
where site is a unique identifier of my site password is the user password and salt is a user-specific random salt and the hash is a general purpose cryptographic hash function like sha-1 and || indicates concatenation

7134935
installation	upgrade
it was probably a isolation issue which was only addressed by the upgrade because it replaced the base installation

7134945
google-chrome	firefox
i seem to recall that there is a firefox or google-chrome plugin that allows you to run javascript based upon the domain name

7134993
stdout	stderr
but this 1 takes forever to start because it starts sbt 2 causes all stdout and stderr to go to stdout and 3 causes all output to be decorated with a logger info or error

7135007
put	get
to test this i put a config transform in my web.release.config to add an appsetting key if you do this make sure the appsettings node is present in your base config file or you will get an error

7135008
decoder	encoder
i had a need for a base32 encoder decoder so i spent a couple hours this afternoon throwing this together

7135009
int	boolean
because boolean in python is a subtype of int

7135080
ftp	telnet
my site is hosted on a unix server to which i have ftp and telnet access

7135092
addition	multiplication
since each output bit depends only on the input bits any function can be represented this way even things like addition multiplication or s-box lookups

7135131

min	max	margin	height
i found a good solution using autoresizingmask to mantain min and max y margin and allow height resize

7135247
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
my question is for performance reason dictionary is the best or should i go with sortedlist sorteddictionary

7135272
prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement	prepare	bindparam	bindparam	pdostatement
note that with pdo prepare you can either use pdostatement bindparam to bind parameters prior to calling pdostatement- execute or you can pass the parameters as an array to pdostatement- execute

7135274
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover is just short hand for mouseenter and mouseleave

7135307
ilist	icollection
mainly because ilist inherits from icollection and strings do not support the mutable beahviors icollection promises add remove clear - when you add or remove character elements from a string it creates a new string

7135312
gif	png
but if the url points to a single file resource like a png gif txt etc

7135315
lisp	scheme
try to forget about scheme if that is your main mental model of lisp -- it will limit you more than help you in understanding scoping funargs etc

7135377
post	get
i need to simulate the parameters contained in the url and i read that the post method will do that however when i get an error

7135467

in idhttpserver get and post commands are essentially treated the same and handled in the commandget event

7135469
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is not necessarily limited to images. the script works 100 in google-chrome opera safari ios but not completely in firefox and ie

7135485
text-align	height
as a guide make everything inside the article relative float left set equal widths declare height and text-align as you wish

7135492
validationsummary	customvalidator
my initial consideration is to send back a with failed validation messages and then dynamically create a customvalidator control since apparently you can only bind one error message to one validator control for each error to show in the validationsummary when there are any

7135519
implements	extends
you need to implements a javascript class which extends overlayview

7135605
post	put
i put the code in pastebin as i tought it would clog upp the post

7135610
public	protected
a class or struct in c++ has access specifiers public protected and private which control the access level to everything following the specifier

7135636
mouseleave	mouseenter
simply use the mouseenter and mouseleave events

7135653
awt	swing	swt	swing
if your program needs x uses awt swing swt it will need to wait for x to come up then etc x11 xsession.d would be the place to put the startscript

7135676
button	checkbox
decide which controls on the form you d like to have the delete key work from button checkbox etc. but maybe not text boxes and use the keydown event in those controls to take the appropriate action

7135718
jtabbedpane	jscrollpane	jeditorpane	jtabbedpane
in the center pane is a jtabbedpane with two tabs one with a jtextarea in a jscrollpane of course used for entering markdown code and the other a jeditorpane again in a scroll pane for displaying a rendered html preview

7135718
jeditorpane	jtabbedpane
the jtextarea and the jeditorpane do not have the same size and that jtabbedpane is resizing when i switch between them since i m resetting the jeditorpane text every time

7135757
post	put
but i also have code that i got from a post on another site that is suppose to put the progress bar value in the middle of the progress bar as percentage

7135784
hash	salt
from a pure hashing perspective unless i m reading your question wrong you re proposing creating a hash of the password concatenated with a user specific random salt which is the usual approach

7135784
hash	salt
when you look at the breaches we ve seen in recent times password disclosure is usually happening when they re either stored in plain text obviously very vulnerable or hash without a salt easily vulnerable to rainbow tables

7135784
hash	salt
sure the sha derivatives will be faster to work through particularly if it s a single hash but in combination with a cryptographically random salt it s not a small task

7135792
getter	setter
this generates bird_nests_attributes accessors getter setter for tree object

7135805
width	height
another alternative is to handle the wm_getminmaxinfo message that returns the minimum and maximum width and height for a window

in your case you would return the current width and height

7135824
ubuntu	linux
i m a ubuntu linux lucid lynx user

7135826
src	attr
doc.select div.box-art .select img attr abs src

7135839
ready	each
so it appears that you cannot solve this problem without either changing the jquery implementation so it doesn t unbind to allow multiple firings or changing each piece of ready handler code to use your own events that you can fire as many times as you want

7135860
firefox	safari
firefox 5 6 doesn t play well with quicktime 7.6.6 default under os x 10.6.8 which somehow is affecting safari 5.1 and quicktime interactions

7135860
firefox	safari
safari now ignores whatever firefox and quicktime had cooked up together

7135879
width	height
you can try to set the autoresizingmask attribute on the three buttons to have flexible margins height and width so that they grow with uiview b as you change the size of uiview b

7135893
draggable	droppable
i m using ajax to populate some thumbnails for search results and i d like to make them draggable and droppable

jboss	glassfish
my application worked fine in glassfish 3.1.1 but broke with this duplicate context initialization parameter resteasy.injector.factory error when i moved it to jboss 7

7135918
width	height
the height of the containing div would be ok to measure but the width would always be full width and the height would only fit that particular width

7135918
width	height
change the width and the height would be different

7135950
children	parent
this will remove the foreignkey between the parent and the children table

you could use cglib or javassist to do the same thing for an abstract class

7136021
draggable	droppable
yes you can define draggable and droppable objects using jquery ui where an object will revert back to it s previous position if not dropped on a predefined object

7136021
draggable	droppable
as for your second question yes you will need to call the draggable droppable methods on your dynamically created objects to give them those respective properties

7136037
width	height
make the width and height equal to what you want in

7136052
width	height
while the cropping is no problem i did notice that i had to swap my width and height values when creating a cgrect bound to crop on

7136056
oncreate	setcontentview

mdpi	hdpi
android has 4 densities either ldpi mdpi hdpi or xhdpi

7136085
for-loop	arrays
you can even assign them to an arrays and iterate through with a for-loop but jquery gives us the .each syntatic sugar so the idea is

7136141
folder	directory
you would probably want to place the package directory next to your other two application folder and reference it in my_controller __construct like

7136186
min	max
but i d imagine you could also do like it says on jquery s own docs and use the .data method to store the min max values

7136186
min	max
in other words make your code look for existing data on the elements so the first time you call it won t find any existing data so it ll place those min max values in an object and save them using .data

7136275
allocator	stl
i ve never really used the stl much but i knew you could use vector to deal with the allocator of arrays of objects and i could have sworn there was a way to use the default constructor to allocate the items within when the vector is created

7136322
post	get
try with post instead of get because your form has post method declared and checking the submit button instead of a variable

7136380
inherited	properties
it s a rare case you actually want to inherited a properties like margin you may be thinking it does something that it really doesn t

7136380
width	margin
...where 0 here can be any valid margin width value as documented here

7136415
super	self
super returns an instance of the base class so self gets implicitly passed to __init__ like in any other method call

7136441
int	chars
then when used in self.text_entry.insert insert chars text_entry is trying to insert an int into a str and causing the above error

7136481
ubuntu	linux

7136593
rss	feed
all i want it to do is parse a rss feed from a specific site and take the title and published date and put those items into a listview and when a list item is clicked it will open the browser to display the webpage containing the article

7136697
setinterval	settimeout
besides using setinterval you can also use a recursive settimeout pattern like the following

7136716
strstr	substr
your best bet might just be to crawl your input with strstr which finds occurrences of a substr and manually tokenize on those

7136792
post	get
you can easily get the embed code for a youtube vid and post it on your site but you don t want to allow users to just post vids without some type of validation otherwise everyone will write scripts to redirect the page etc

7136825
children	parent
the two children form columns within the parent div so are therefore floated to place them side by side

7136827
width	height
setting the width and the height of it still keeping the resolution

7136841
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy is not safe so you are much better off using strncpy it allows you to explicitly specify how many characters to copy rather than rely on null terminator of the source string also this helps avoiding buffer overflow since you explicitly specify a length

7136850
width	margin
you need to add the margin to the total width - the margin-left of the right column is not margin left from the parent it is margin left from the left column so if you total is 400px and your left column is 200px and your right column is also 200px there is no room for margin

7136857
ubuntu	linux
i m relatively new to linux only ever having installed ubuntu a few times and never really stuck with it

start by adding all the 16 column fields to the report filtering and the 2 you want to sum to the values area.that gives you the first grouping

7136962
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
the qtwebkit may have retrieve the content of the qnetworkreply a qiodevice the size of it would be 0 after readall .maybe the qtwebkit as a browser has read it for rendering i guess

7136983
subtract	add
change the value of to add subtract columns

7137002
crypt	hash
it seems like crypt is returning different hash on different environments with the same arguments

7137016

this argument list is passed to the main function of the executable command program as an int count often called argc and a pointer to a null-terminated array of nul-terminated 0 chars arrays

7137045
strstr	strtok	strlen	strtok	strlen	strstr
this is pretty much exactly the same as the implementation of strtok just calling strstr and strlen instead of strcspn and strspn

7137105
pull	push
you can do this either in a push or pull based fashion pull is probably simpler just poll for changes

7137114
jtable	jlabel
i start to add some jlabel s inside the object of array over the cells of the jtable using this code

7137116
width	height
for your example as you want them equal sizes you should make the -webkit-box-flex to 0 for all three children but set their width or height if appropriate to 33.33 each

7137117
openni	kinect
regret it now because i dont plan to use a kinect soon and openni is giving me headaches with normal opencv programs

7137148
post	get
the username and password are passed from html to php using either of two methods post or get

7137171

7137332
openni	kinect
primesense openni primesense makes the sensor inside kinect

7137341
oncreate	onstart
i think you do need to target the onsaveinstancestate and either onrestoreinstancestate or use the oncreate functionality to do it onrestoreinstancestate is called after onstart whereas oncreate is called before onstart - so you ll need to use the oncreate way of doing things although i ll list both below

7137379
submit	submission
a get is issued when you browse to a page normally not just when you submit a form with that method - if you want to use the same view to display an initial form and handle submission via get you should check for a value from the form having been submitted

updatepanel	scriptmanager
you can bypass any logic you have inside your page_load method by checking the scriptmanager.isinasyncpostback property with a scriptmanager and updatepanel

7137613
int	chars
as i understand it it takes four 1-byte chars starting from the memory location pointed to by from treats them as unsigned long int in order to give each one 4 bytes of space and does some bitshifting to arrange them as a big-endian 32-bit int

7137634

7138298
inline	inlining
having said so it is prudent to let the compiler actually decide whether to inline or not inline a function call even constructors and destructors most of modern day compilers will appropriately optimize functions through inlining

7138356
width	height
x y width and height must be glint not double

7138360
int	double
the code below as it is with only the cast to int without casting to double works and builds without problem

7138360
int	double
why without the operator cast to double it is used the one to int in a multiplication between double

7138363

7138363
punctuation	words
the problem is that in some sentence the words is at the beginning or followed with a punctuation characters

7138364
octal	decimal
arbitray precision octal to decimal conversion is rather annoying because there is no way to localize the computation

7138364
octal	decimal
in other words a change in the most significant digit of the octal number will change even the least significant digit in the decimal representation

7138364
octal	binary
the conversion to base-1000000000 is simple because you only need to support incrementing and multiplying by two just consider the input as binary with three bits for each octal digit

7138364
octal	decimal
on my pc the time to convert an 80 000 digit octal number to decimal resulting in 72246 digits is about 1.2 seconds

7138364
int	double	division	multiplication
i tried also using 64 bit int or the 53 bit int part of a double but the code was running always slower than in this case one reason is probably the division in the inner loop that can be converted to a multiplication in the 32 bit case

7138369
filtering	grouping
or perhaps filtering first then grouping

7138375
children	parent
each node in the tree contains a reference to a parent and a collection of children

7138375
children	parent
after the child has exited its constructor its instance is added into the parent s children collection and the child s parent property is updated accordingly

7138390
int	double
why without the operator cast to double it is used the one to int in a multiplication between double

7138390
int	double
when you provide both operator double and operator int for your class it creates an ambiguity whether to convert obj_2 to an int or double because there are two inbuilt operator overloads which it can use namely

7138403
int	double
the reason is that with both casts you have ambiguous code the compiler can t decide whether to use the int cast or the double cast both are legal

7138406
rss	feed
i m using an xml rss 2.0 feed from a third party site to import news to an iphone application

7138408
pem	pkcs#12
the should be some scripts out there to convert pkcs#12 files to pem files

7138432
equals	gethashcode
that s because your implementation of gethashcode is incorrect two different arrays with the same items in the same order usually won t have the same hashcode because the values are not taken into account so equals is never called

7138435
equals	gethashcode
to me seems that gethashcode have to be changed as it simply returns the hash code of array object considering the fact that you use new hashcode every time will be different even if content equals

7138444
folder	directory
for example os.path.walk will walk depth first through every directory below the argument and return the files and folder in each directory

7138980
google-chrome	safari
i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome

7139308
firefox	safari
you could opt for a platform inspecific default firefox would be a good candidate and if you have an exception opening it launch internet explorer instead there s no longer current safari support in selenium 2 however

7139388
int	double
try using the double literal - 157 32d which is int double which results in a double

7139416

first unpack the string to unsigned 4 byte integer and then use this function

7141234
many-to-many	one-to-many
i think you re asking for either a many-to-many relationship or multiple defined one-to-many relationships so it depends on the use

7141258
postgresql	mysql
if you re using a sql database such as mysql or postgresql test with union and union all instead of or

7141286

7141487
min	max

7141532
put	get
by default you ll get a new sessionid on each postback unless you put something in the session

7141535
disk	ram
for example if you query select from company where id 1 from a client 1 million times only the first query needs to go to disk the next 999 999 will come straight from the in ram cache

the layout s height is less than the height of everything else and the width of the layout is the same as everything else but when i use layout.getheight and layout.getwidth in my onresume they always return 0 so i can t really use that

7141720
carrierwave	paperclip
something similar to the paperclip and carrierwave gems

7141731
hash	md5
i want to encrypt hash some strings with md5 in my mac application

7141756
gridview	sqldatasource
if that s true the reason is because the same sqldatasource is bound to both your dropdownlist and your gridview and the select command for the sqldatasource retrieves all the employees - there is no where criteria to select a desired employee

7141756
gridview	sqldatasource
i would use 2 sqldatasource - one for the dropdownlist and one for the gridview

7141756
gridview	sqldatasource
then assign this sqldatasource to the gridview instead of the first one

7141777
int	boolean
if you take a look at this it explains that you can t change the type on boolean int and strings thus they cannot be subclassed

7141781
webclient	httpwebrequest
since you have one specific page you want to automatically populate it s going to be a lot easier to recreate the post message that is generated using either the webclient or a httpwebrequest

7141785
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption is just a unique string that you usually store in a hash table calculated from a stream that could your text image sound data etc

7141820
super	self
it s in the last line super snippet self .save force_insert force_update

7141823
folder	directory
furthermore i looked in each folder and could not find the fab file or directory

7141836
post	get
the test sounds like it is generating a get instead of a post though so it might be a problem with the link_to call

7141836
post	get
seems to indicate that link_to will generate some javascript to make a post call on click and that users with javascript disabled will get a normal get link unless you use href # so it might be because your test engine isn t running the javascript

7141837
super	self
super snippet self causes python to look in the mro of the class of self self.__class__.mro for the next class listed after snippet

7141837
super	self
super snippet self .save ... calls that class s save method with self bound to the first argument

7141837
super	self
so super snippet self .save ... will not call snippet s save method

7141837
super	self
which class super snippet self ultimately represents depends on self and in particular its class s mro

7141846
implements	extends
in addition to what everyone else said by implements an interface or extends a class you get compiler enforcement of the contract of the supertype

7141846

7141906
client-side	server-side
i typically utilize json as much as possible when trying to present server-side data to the client-side as it helps to separate the different layers

7141955
post	get
you should change the input code to populate it with the post data instead of get and you would avoid having that nasty looking url

7141965
system.in	system.out
however system.in system.out and system.err are final static fields that for legacy reasons must be allowed to be changed by the methods system.setin system.setout and system.seterr

7141981
extjs	mootools
facebook s js uses function.prototype.shield context args... mootools uses function.prototype.pass args context sencha nã e extjs has function.prototype.createdelegate fn args appendargs false and i ve even seen some called partial fn context args however partial usually has the added ability to pass around a placeholder to allow the passing of different default arguments

7142027
portrait	landscape
in landscape mode they properly stretch to fit the width..but in portrait the exit button is extending too far to the right

7142168

7142179
getter	setter
1004 to minutes seconds and i can successfully pull my seconds from the xml but i dont know how to work with getter and setter so i can convert my seconds to minutes seconds

7142179
getter	setter
i had a look at timespan and i know it can do what i ask but i dont know how to write the getter and setter so it will convert the integer values seconds to a minute seconds format

7142192
setinterval	settimeout
because of the nature of requestanimationframe you should never queue animations using a setinterval or settimeout loop

7142201
post	get
in the first case you are using http post in the other http get

7142202
post	get
without type post it defaults to get according to the docs which your server side code is probably not expecting

7142203
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

7142247
queue	fifo
basically i want a fifo queue that is thread-safe and will automatically throw out old enough items once it gets to a pre-specified limit

7142274
for-loop	arrays

pop-up	dialog
this is why when a user tries to delete an application that has an alternate entry point with a running process in the background a dialog box always pop-up letting the user know that the application will be removed on restart and asking whether they would like to reboot now

7142355
prepare	execute
the best way to ensure this is to prepare the query once then execute it each time

7142372
post	get
my form was posting via get method and the mvc just uses the culture for an action parameter when it s passed in the routedata or by the form via post method

7142388
interpolation	splines
it s meant for doing thin-plate splines interpolation 2d equivalent of cubic splines for spatial data but will take up to four covariates although it will expect them to be euclidean x y z + time so you need to be clear that you are selecting the correct options for your particular case

7142434
for-loop	loops
note that using dispatch_apply means that each iteration of loops may run concurrently with respect to one another so this won t be applicable if your for-loop requires to be run in a serial fashion

7142438

7142522
daemons	systemd

7142629
integer	unsigned
if you want a number larger than the largest 64-bit unsigned integer 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 then you will need to store it as a varchar or other textual field and hope that you don t need to do much mathematical manipulation on it

7142643
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in ios i would generally start with a rootcontroller which contains a uitabbarcontroller and fill this with 4-5 uinavigationcontroller

7142870
mouse	keyboard
i use a microsoft ergonomic keyboard and evoluent mouse which help but don t allow for hours of endless typing and mouseing

7142873
width	height
you could set the width and height directly

7142880
width	font-size	width	height
however as lalit has realized since each character appears differently in different fonts different fonts will take different width and height for the same string of characters of same font-size

7142881
post	put
obviously this post or rather put should be committing to shift id.

7142891
width	height
take out x11 and pass your height and width arguments directly to jpeg

7142983
imagemagick	magick++
i am using imagemagick or magick++ its library to render the final gif animation because it is relatively fast at doing so

7143022
union	distinct
in fact combining union and the distinct used in your first part of the union is redundant because the union is going to ensure that duplicates are removed from the final set both within sub-parts of the union and across parts of the union

7143043
setinterval	settimeout
in general setinterval bad and settimeout good for animations

7143058

7143233
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
for the operations you could do reference returns as in one of the other examples but i have implemented the multiplying without modifying the existing value which you could also do for add subtract etc

7143281
profiler	aqtime
when i attempt to run the application in aqtime with performance profiler the vcl rtl classes aren t show in profiling

7143291

7143434
accessor	properties
otherwise you ll need to use the accessor method for the asset properties

7143501
public	protected
others have explained and i like shelleybutterfly s suggestion to derive polynomial from the list except that i d make it protected not public so that outside code is not too free to mess with the contents of the list

7143505
postgresql	mysql
i am new to postgresql and to my surprise there appears to be no single function equivalent to utc_date from mysql

7143512
opera	firefox
opera and firefox offer mobile browsers as options

7143516
width	height
assuming a dynamic size the caller needs to get the image dimensions in order to allocate the array so i ve added a struct that has the width height and depth of the image which gets filled in by the c function get_image_info

code is tested with ie firefox google-chrome and works properly

7143610
getter	setter
yes getter and setter can be made private

the firefox safari google-chrome is ok but in ie8 value is no change

7143807
glut	sdl
there are game libraries that work on multiple platforms like sdl or glut

7143808
versioning	upgrade
in fact this versioning system should probably be used on all external script files so when you upgrade them you can make sure that viewers get the new versioning immediately and old new versioning of the scripts are never accidentally mixed by a caching system

7143828
typedef	struct
i would probably go with the first for readability and also for readability i d probably either set up a #define or a const in later versions of c with the value for your sizeof call and a typedef for your struct to compress the size a bit

7143852
free	malloc
this way you don t have the malloc free overhead for every single new allocation

7143870
width	height
i am given the amount of elements to populate a grid with but through this i need to know beforehand what the width and height in amount of elements the grid should be

7143870
width	height
i would like the aspect ratio between width and height of the grid to be 1 1

7143870
width	height
the width and height of the grid would then be 3

7143870
width	height
with 10 elements i would like either the width or height of the grid to be 4

7143879
google-chrome	firefox
i have an example which finds the difference of days between 2 specified dates and works only in google-chrome i think in firefox 6 and ie8 it does not support the format of date that i am using shows nan

i ve an application running successfully the application runs only in portrait mode only if i m going to change this to landscape it s also possible to change

7143910
hide	show
if what you ve done was show different forms with show showdialog then the equivalent would be to use different windows and show hide them

7143916
oncreate	ondestroy
if you only need a list of activities in your application you can create some kind of registrar mechanism so each activity registers in oncreate and unregisters in ondestroy

7143935
folder	directory
using qt qdir i m trying to display the set of directory in treeview as it is displayed in windows explorer when u select the folder icon

7143939
width	height
either way though you can take the square root of the number of items and then take either the floor or ceiling to get the desired width height

7143939
width	height
for example math.sqrt 11 is 3.3166 so which is your desired height width

7143941
hide	show
whenever you want to hide or show the div call these proxy functions rather than setting the style directly

7143951
width	height
if rectangle r1 is at x1 y1 and have width w1 h1 and likewise rectangle r2 is at x2 y2 with width w2 and height h2 then you can find the left edge of the red region like assuming the widths and height of both rectangles are positive so the positions are the bottom left corners

7143955
google-chrome	firefox
i have developed npruntime based plugin for firefox google-chrome and its working fine with ff3.6 google-chrome 10 but when i load any other plugin in firefox 4.0 or later after loading my plugin then firefox hangs

equals	gethashcode
so the efficiency will depend on how efficient your implementation is compared with which just delegates to equals and gethashcode

7144083
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
in regards to rolling your own you seem to have it figured out you ll need to create mouseover mousemove mouseout events for the divs

7144083
children	parent
as for performance jsperf - mousemove parent vs children

7144089
getter	setter
there is no reason why you can not make getter and setter private

7144089
getter	setter
in fact if you insert some convoluted code you can have code that can call these setter getter methods that can not modify the properties directly without using reflection

7144094
getter	setter
as far as the jls is concerned there is nothing linguistically different between getter and setter methods and any other methods

7144094
getter	setter
we want to combine some logic in this case enforcing of a constraint with the setting or getting of an attribute but we don t want the setter or getter to be visible

7144100
int	chars
let s say i have a table with two columns iu uniqueidentifier id int sel chars 1

7144101
content-disposition	content-type
finally if you want to have your users download pdfs instead of view them in the web browser in your http request response set the content-type header to application octet-stream and set the content-disposition header to attachment

7144101
doc	rtf
i suppose if you re willing to rely on your users having other plugins installed you might be able to fake it using a java pdf viewer applet maybe icepdf or perhaps another one from this list of java pdf tools or using flash pdf2swf as mentioned in how can i show doc or rtf or pdf in flash player or in none editble format

7144203
bmp	png
open a device using png bmp pdf or similar

7144203

7144542
portrait	landscape
to seemlessly support landscape portrait mode screen with different densities you need to put appropriate drawables with following naming convention res directory

7144542
folder	directory
res directory will be root level of you application folder

7144542
portrait	landscape
mode would be land port for landscape and portrait respectively

7144542
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
density would be hdpi mdpi ldpi for high medium and low density screens respectively

7144542
portrait	landscape
suppose i have a background image which needs to look differently for landscape and portrait mode

7144547
mdpi	hdpi
you can add folders with a postfix with -hdpi for hdpi specifics -mdpi for mdpi and -ldpi for ldpi

7144725
maven	pom.xml
maven allows you to define properties in the project s pom.xml

7144725
maven	pom.xml
now if you don t want to specify them from the command line and if you need to further isolate these properties from the project pom.xml into a properties file then you ll need to use the properties maven plugin and run it s read-project-properties goal in the initialize phase of the maven lifecycle

7144781
children	parent
you can use that tree to get the children the parent the type of the token etc. all you need to manually walk the tree

7144798
median	max	min	median	min	max

if the sentence is ç ã ãƒžãƒ¼ãƒˆã ãƒšãƒ³ã ªã ã œå è ã ã there is no way for the computer to know whether it s ç ã start sentence spaces delimiter or ãƒžãƒ¼ãƒˆ spaces comma delimiter that is the right it should choose

7145600
profiling	debugging
you should run profiling to spot the memory problem or debugging with a breakpoint after the save method and following a line by line execution until it crashes

7145611
pull	push
another option is to run hg serve on all the workstations and only pull from one another never push

7145640
pull	push
because mercurial is a distributed version control system you don t have to have a central server as you can clone push and pull between one another

7145656

7145859
integer	unsigned
u will output the unsigned integer value and

7145859
integer	unsigned
the value 255 is represented the same both as unsigned int and integer therefore you will see 255 twice

7145868
range	max
as the range is for unsigned char and unsigned xxx -1 by standard means - give the max value for unsigned xxx type

7145894
int	chars
this is all about implicit conversion from a signed int -1 to an unsigned chars which is defined by the c language itself in 6.3.1.3

7145917
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
problems appear mainly in firefox i m using ff6 but occationally also in google-chrome and safari but not ie9 the orange line above the menu item sometimes is too long and too much to the right when a page is loaded

7146305
pop-up	dialog
if you need to pop-up multiple dialog first read modeless dialog section of qt docs

7146319
super	extends
i can also add that the super instruction only works if the class you inherit from extends from object otherwise you get an exception

7146371
public	protected
all public and protected members are directly accessible

7146386
getter	setter
making fields public by using struct or publicly deriving from pair for performance reasons is not a good idea inline constructor getter and setter are just as fast as reading or writing the variable directly and they have the advantage of encapsulating the implementation

7146390
uiview	calayer
1 how would i apply this approach to a calayer object that is a sublayer of a uiview layer object like in the following

7146414
innodb	myisam
it s called full-text indexing but currently it s not supported in innodb only in myisam

7146428
post	get
change your form to do a get request instead of a post then you can use both the form and the url

7146491
hide	show
hide and show the container div because you don t want the form to hide when the user mouse s out of the parent and mouses-in to the form

7146518
typedef	struct
now as you ll notice both the struct and the typedef are named list which is fine as far as i know

7146557
datediff	difference
- if date x is earlier than today then difference datediff x now with the x year is current year

7146557
datediff	difference
- if date x is later than today then difference datediff x now with the x year is one year before

7146557
datediff	difference
then the difference will be datediff 6-6-2011 22-08-2011

7146557
datediff	difference
then the difference will be datediff 10-10-2010 22-08-2011

google-chrome	firefox
firefox obviously shows the google-chrome uri of the page and i was trying to figure out how to prevent that from happening just for aesthetic reasons mind you...

7146609
try-catch	exception-handling
if the filenotfoundexception occurs during a ftl or inside your main ftl template then i think you can catch the exception-handling with ftl s attempt-recover -construct similar to java s try-catch

7146614

7146641
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you can free only pointers returned from malloc or realloc

7146643
free	malloc
there s no way of testing a pointer before you free it so you will have to make sure that you only free valid pointers one returned from malloc etc

7146700
pivot-table	crosstab
i suggest using a crosstab - these are the crystal equivalent of pivot-table in excel or matrixes in ssrs

7146737
post	get
you can use url rewrite to issue 3xx redirect which will use get method but you will loose all post data

7146737
post	get
issue 301 or 302 redirect to the proper url it will have all post data sent as get variables

7146737
post	get
such rewrite to custom page should be easy -- you need to check what method is used post or get and only invoke it on post

7146737
post	get
the reason for all of this complexity is the difference in how post and get requests work with get all data is sent as part of url while post uses request body to transfer variable s data

but i m looking to install freetype libjpeg pil build to add image processing to my django projects i ve followed this installation which installs it site wide but i can get it inside my virtualenv project

7146820
hash	md5
the principal difference - md5 and other hash functions designed to verify data have been designed to be fast and bcrypt has been designed to be slow

7146820
hash	md5
an attacker with a copy of a password hash will be able to execute many more brute force attacks because md5 and sha1 etc are cheap to execute

7146827
imagemagick	magick++
i have a problem creating a tiff image with a jpeg compression using magick++ the c++ api of imagemagick

7146943
jobs	cron
or if you prefer to use cron syntax anyway just write export jobs to a user crontab using a wrapper which calls back to your running app or starts the job in a standalone process if that s possible

7146993
pull	push
for getting and setting application configurations or properties push pull

7147021
integer	unsigned
just stumbled in my mind over pthread_self which returns a pthread_t which is usually a typedef to an unsigned integer

7147046

ssms	sqlcmd
when i run this stored procedure from sqlcmd it s working and the stored procedure is created but when i execute the same from ssms it s failing with the error below

7147094
post	get
both get and post should have some kind of corelation id

7147134
free	malloc
you can t blindly design free without knowing how malloc works under the hood because your implementation of free would need to know how to manipulate the bookkeeping data and that s impossible without knowing how malloc is implemented

7147134
free	malloc
so an unswerable question could be how you would design malloc and free instead which is not a trivial question but you could answer it partially for example by proposing some very simple implementation of a memory pool that would not be equivalent to malloc of course but would indicate your presence of knowledge

7147148
free	malloc
malloc and free only have a meaning if your app is to work on top of an os

7147159
free	malloc
edit as sharptooth noted only makes sense to design free and malloc together

7147173
clang	llvm
for clang llvm c c++ complier build on libclang and llvm the translation unit created after preprocessing stage

7147186
int	chars
fputc converts its int input to unsigned chars and that conversion can t do anything too unpleasant

7147189
free	malloc
your malloc needs to check which areas of the right size of that pool are still free through some data structure and hand out pointers to that memory

7147202
free	malloc
there is an architecture that malloc and free are supposed to adhere to -- essentially a class architecture permitting different strategies to coexist

7147202
free	malloc
then the version of free that is executed corresponds to the version of malloc used

7147209
uidatepicker	uipickerview
i have a couple 4 uipickerview and one uidatepicker

7147210
subplot	imshow
i create a figure with 4 subplot 2 x 2 where 3 of them are of the type imshow and the other is errorbar

7147370
division	multiplication
division is a lot more expensive than multiplication

7147425
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if the data being monitored supports inotifypropertychanged and for collections inotifycollectionchanged then some behind-the-scenes observer pattern technology gets hooked up and you can get have portions of your gui respond to very precise changes in your data rather than having to refresh everything

7147447
int	chars
fputc takes the chars to write as an int argument whose value is expected to be in the range of unsigned chars not chars

7147528
postgresql	mysql
i m trying to change my db server from mysql to postgresql

its the same in firefox opera

7147553
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout are done asynchronously from your own code

7147553
fadein	fadeout
so for over 99 of its time it will be visible while for only less than 1 of the time from the precise instant the fadeout completes till just before the fadein starts it will be hidden so you will almost always see the speech-bubble-sun rather than speech-bubble-dark

7147580
initializer	class-method
the constructor behaves the same as any other class-method its only special property is that it s automatically ran when the class is initializer normal variable scope still applies

7147590
accessor	properties
as i can see from the stack trace calling sendpropertychanging causes system.data.linq.changetracker.standardchangetracker.onpropertychanging to fire which calls the get accessor of the same properties in order to get data copy of the properties before the change

7147593
free	malloc
malloc a single int and have the new thread read and free it

7147593
free	malloc
option 3 is immensely more efficient than either of the other choices both of which involve an extra synchronization step for option 1 the synchronization is in malloc free and will almost certainly involve some cost since the allocating and freeing thread are not the same

7147622
portrait	landscape
new android tablets with honeycomb have portrait orientation when held like in landscape on phones

rss	feed
what i have is a list of a few rss feed with an edit button in the naviagtionbar clicking edit takes you to a page which allows selecting which rss feed to show on the first page by using switches

7147656
free	malloc
after all in order to design your own free function you first have to know how malloc is implemented

7147656
free	malloc
but before you can write your own malloc free you first need memory to allocate free

7147656
free	malloc
it s only once you have access to a large contiguous looking block of memory that you need malloc free to manage it

7147656
free	malloc
they re all designed for different purposes too like limiting fragmentation due to small allocated chunks mixed with small unallocated chunks or ensuring that malloc and free run fast or sometimes even more slowly but predictably slowly

7147701
magnolia	alfresco	nuxeo	alfresco	nuxeo	magnolia

after that default data contract serialization was introduced so you don t have to place datacontract attribute on your classes and all public properties with getter and setter will be serialized

7147800
portrait	landscape
my app shows diffent views for landscape and portrait for that i defined 2 views one in layout and one in layout-land

7147800

7147953
memcached	apc
track down what component uses zend_cache and configure it to use a custom instance of cache with a defined backend which doesn t use tmp storage check for apc or memcached

7147953
memcached	apc
i would choose option 1 for better performances apc or memcached are faster storage than filesystem and for having more control on what s happening in your project

7147964

openni	kinect
emgu cv currently allows the use of the kinect with the openni drivers

7150940
openni	kinect
i ve also seen that there exists an mssdk-openni bridge application to allow the kinect running on the official microsoft sdk to emulate openni driven kinect

7150950
terminate	timeout
none means that the timeout has been reached and the function terminate

7150962

postgresql	mysql
then you can copy it from postgresql to mysql or sqlite locally without having to worry about timeouts

7151076
addition	multiplication
there s a lot more addition multiplication basically any commutative operation but xor is usually used for hashing anyway because it s easy to unhash

i tested this code in google-chrome firefox

7151097
google-chrome	firefox
i updated google-chrome and firefox results

7151100
min	max
other approaches i have ruled out are looking at the min max z values in the selection buffer and doing custom ray object detection outside of gl

7151112
coffeescript	haml
currently i am looking into dmsl for haml templates and recompiling sass compass and coffeescript files to css and js and compressing every time i change them

7151175
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
some applications use microsoft system.data.oracleclient to connect to oracle and some use the .net components provided by oracle odp.net

7151176
width	height
and the css for both simply floats the ad container left and specifies the width and height

7151189
wordpress	joomla
one other note and this is a personal observation after having worked with joomla drupal wordpress and various different enterprise cms and bbs solutions â design solely with you in mind

7151240
implements	extends
the only way to change this would be to extends the gregoriancalendar class in your own object and implements a custom tostring method

7151266
width	height
i tried to create an edittext textbox that will compute the width and height automatically by using the wrap_content way

7151303
width	height
i believe this is happening because you are using wrap_content for the layout width height

7151315
client-side	server-side
the basic flow of what is going on now is data is validated both client-side and server-side and if the data is correct the response from and ajax post will be the url to the next page to go to

7151395
google-chrome	firefox
as you saw from the difference in firefox and google-chrome google-chrome seems to optimize the array structure internally

7151416
folder	directory
this folder path may vary according to your java installation directory

7151434
int	chars
now suppose for whatever reason i don t want the users of class a to create objects with chars or class b which fortunately or unfortunately can implicitly convert to int then you can disable them as

7151465
spyware	antivirus
as for your second concern i ve never heard about antivirus detecting these api calls as spyware behavior

7151491
hide	show
i have a yes or no question and i wrote a simple jquery for showing a hidden div when i click yes radiobutton the problem is its repeating the hide show action when i click the yes button

7151498

i want to include themeindex.php in index.php so when you enter to root directory it will load the theme without taking you to or showing you the root folder folder themes path

7151523
cifilter	nsimage
i ve tried a number of drawing techniques that doen t use lockfocus on an nsimage drawing in cgbitmapcontext or using cifilter compositing and they produce the same results

7151531
hash	md5
it has the same output size as an md5 hash 32 hexadecimal characters or 16 bytes if we omit the bin2hex part

7151531
hash	md5
there now exist collision attacks against md5 it is possible to produce a pair of strings even with a given same prefix which have the same hash with quite some work but not impossible much work so you shouldn t use md5 for anything critical

7151531
hash	md5
what md5 and other hash functions build on the merkle-damgard construction effectively do is applying an encryption algorithm with the message as the key and some fixed value as the plain text using the resulting ciphertext as the hash

7151536
hide	show
slidetoggle will hide the element if it s already show and show it if it s hidden

7151536
hide	show
note that you could also use show and you could also use slideup in place of hide in your #d02 click event handler if you want the animation to take effect there as well

7151552
int	double
that is to say does jna produce a c-valid copy of the java data all int and double arrays by the way and pass that to the native library instead of the same blocks that contain the data in java

7151583
post	get
after adding ilmerge to my post build tasks and working out the commandline i sucessfully get a merged program mymerged.exe

google-chrome	firefox
site loads fine in ie8 9 firefox google-chrome

7151753
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
i am not sure about mono touch but if you are just using audio in a game i would look at the avfoundation framework and more specifically the avaudioplayer

7151776
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
in an ideal world i would be able to use sin cos sqrt in a type-generic way

7151788

it seems that this bug went away when i upgrade to the latest versioning of msysgit 1.7.6 from 1.7.3

7151800
implements	extends
3 public class text2speech extends activity implements oninitlistener to convert to voice

7151807
hash	md5
the hash ring sacrifices the eveness of your md5 test code to maintain mappings when the number of entries changes

7151807
put	get
the downside of the consistency approach is that it s not perfectly uniform it depends on the hashes of the the bins rather than on the hashes of the objects you put in the bins so you don t get the evening out you would expect as you add more objects

7151811
centos	linux
i have two identical installations on 64 bit linux centos using jetty 6.1.16 and 64 bit java 1.6

7151838
devise	cancan
you didn t post your devise config in applicationcontroller but it looks like the devise identity sign-in checks are loading up before the cancan authorization checks which makes sense

7151838
devise	cancan
because the devise identity check is failing it s never hitting your cancan authorization check

7151838
devise	cancan
this is why i think you ve got devise config in your base applicationcontroller causing this not to hit cancan

7151840
google-chrome	firefox
the webpage runs just fine in firefox and google-chrome possibly due to the fact that they doesnâ t strictly use w3c like internet explorer

7151881
tcpreplay	wireshark	packets	pcap
if you have the packets captured in pcap format tcpdump wireshark ... you can use tcpreplay to replay them

7151902
onmousedown	onmousemove
i ve built a javascript-heavy web app and recently tweaked it to work on ipad it needed tweaks because it allows drawing by moving the mouse around and onmousedown onmousemove would not get triggered until finger release

7151908
serializable	deserialization
deserialization doesn t invoke the constructor because the purpose of it is to express the state of the object as it was serializable running constructor code could interfere with that

7151951
google-chrome	firefox
i just start the server and then open the page in my own favourite webbrowser firefox google-chrome etc

7151977
pull	push
you d typically use this option when the purpose of the repository is to serve as a clone push pull point for other repositories

7151995
put	get
1 is there a way to get a copy of the unzoomed image from the multiscaleimage control to put into an image control or do i have to just use another multiscaleimage control with the same source

i m able to successfully submit text post with 201 responses but when i change my type parameter to video and add appropriate embed and caption parameters i get a 500 response from tubmlr

7152203
stdout	stderr
sometimes randomly one of the long running commands just halts printing firing the stdout or stderr events and never exits

7152367
client-side	server-side
less introduces variables and inheritance within your css at the expense of client-side or server-side processing

7152416
scheme	racket
i m guessing that #lang racket is a dialect of scheme with much more out of the box structures and common functions and perhaps would be more pedagogic

7152416
scheme	racket
is it best or even possible to use #lang scheme in racket to follow all the content of structure and interpretation of computer programs or even how to design programs

7152461
folder	dir
check if u can reach d dir there is no need in deleting it in temporary folder since it will be moved automatically the target destination is still within d file

7152463
filtering	grouping
having is intended to filtering out resulting grouping based on the aggregate result

7152507
setinterval	settimeout
there is hardly ever a reason to pass a string to setinterval settimeout

7152531
folder	directory
put a file in the root directory test.txt that iis lists as the root folder for your site

7152531
folder	directory
once you verify your root site folder works for ex. www.test.com test.txt then ensure you have a virtual directory phonebook that contains a folder phonebook within it

7152536
swt	draw2d
however if you only need to draw a static graph without complex user interaction i suggest drawing it by hand using either an swt canvas or draw2d

7152549
longlistselector	silverlight
another control you probably want to look at for this kind of app is the longlistselector from the silverlight toolkit link here

7152582
onresume	onpause
it is fine for short tasks within the activity life between onresume and onpause

7152632
scheme	racket
#lang scheme was used for a while before the name change and now #lang racket is used consistently

7152632
scheme	racket
but we kept #lang scheme around for compatibility as well as various scheme --- libraries that are kept and can sometime be different than racket --- counterparts

7152632
scheme	racket
no racket is very different from chicken scheme

7152642
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in both google-chrome and firefox

7152649
super	extends
even push the boat out a bit and extends this inner class nb to get super to work you have to change the class signature of mooble to class mooble object

7152679
accessor	properties
error the properties or indexer sportsstore.domain.abstract.iproductrepository.products cannot be used in this context because the get accessor is inaccessible

7152728
g++	gcc
gcc g++ implements more of this than they let on

7152789
dictionary	map
what iâ m doing here is a technique eilon showed me which is to map all urls to these routes but then restrict which routes to ignore via the constraints dictionary

7152794
ant	maven
if you re doing automated testing using hudson or something like that you ll need to make sure that your build process ant maven shell script whatever puts them in the classpath as well

7152808
width	height
i ve got a site that is using javascript to resize images to a max width height

7152838
repo	egit
problem is every time i try to clone a repo through egit it gives me the error cannot list available branches

7152849
children	parent
thus in the server the child processes can read from the client send that data back to the parent process and the parent can then using the entire list of pipe descriptors that it s accumulated for all the children write back to each individual child process the broadcast message which is then sent back to each client

7152863
hide	show
in my app i call the show method in the beginning of the function call then the hide method when the ajax call returns

7152889
width	height
i ve also tried putting the list inside a group with 100 width height but i m getting more or less the same behaviour except the list is flush to the top when it is taller than the container

7152895
post	get
currently i use delayed_jobs for people to get notifications when someone follows them or post a comment

7152913
prng	random
in order to generate these primes from 32 bytes of random data you need to seed the prng with this data

7152913
prng	random
you seed the prng with the first 64 bytes and then every time you call it you add one more byte of your random data to the entropy pool of your prng

7152923
fgets	getline
in c i would use getline fgets

7152940
pascal	delphi
i can t recommend lazarus as a good option for learning delphi because besides the languages are basically pascal they have some differences which could confuse you

7152962
stdout	fflush
it could also be that you are not waiting for data to be fflush if you print on a terminal data is fflush after every new line but if you print to a file it s only fflush when the stdout buffer is full 4096 bytes on most systems

7152976
rpm	yum
fwiw if you creaate a yum repo and used that to update you would find that updating one rpm would automatically drag in the other

7152984
boost	stl
i find placesc awkward to populate at the sametime avoid memory leaks i am looking for a solution that is both efficient as little string copying as possible and preferably uses stl and or boost

7153033
pull	push
compressing... phase during push and pull is doing

7153033
pull	push
setting it low should improve your push pull times

7153033
pull	push
packfile that will be re-used during push and pull

7153073
folder	directory
they will probably be in a proguard folder at your project directory

7153092
innodb	myisam
only if the storage engine supports transactions innodb does myisam does not and you are not in autocommit mode

7153099
awt	swing
if your app has a gui the standard way to select an input file would be to use a file chooser for example jfilechooser if your app is swing based or filedialog if you want to stick to awt components

7153127
inherited	properties
in your example though additemviewcontroller inherited from detailviewcontroller which has the properties customcell so you need to access the textfield from that properties

7153133
ord	chr
utf8 and uniord try to mirror the chr and ord functions on php

7153158
super	extends
one programmatic way of doing this that i can think of is to create a super class that extends activity and extends all your classes from there

7153168
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
i have tried many times but to call the method and delegates of the view but nothing happen viewdidload or viewwillappear or viewdidappear no method is catch for the second time

7153227
post	get
ie. use http with a post or get to a little php app on your server to take the id decrement it in a sql database and return a yes or no response

7153228
converter	multibinding
but i think you can fool it with a multibinding converter

7153253
hash	salt
specifically you should use an iterated salt sha512 hash

7153314
pop-up	dialog
i d pop-up a progress dialog and use an asynctask to do the loading of the view

7153315
int	double
when i do read a text file with a double and and int in each line separated by a space i am much slower than my physical disc speed factor 6

7153370
innodb	myisam
all of my tables are innodb and i d prefer not to lock the entire database with myisam

7153378
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
as seen here this is used by firefox google-chrome and opera

7153405
post	get
there is a comment by another user on the linked post that says you can move the using statement into the first tag and it works but i haven t been able to get this to work using asp.net mvc 3 and the razor view engine

7153436
sqldatasource	detailsview
detailsview can use sqldatasource

7153436
sqldatasource	detailsview
the above example creates a detailsview based on the selectcommnad of the sqldatasource

7153453
disk	ram
the hard disk has ram that it uses to cache recently accessed data and so does the operating system

7153453
disk	ram
i suggest a complete power down to ensure the disk s ram is also cleared

7153462
post	get
i tried calling tableview cellforrowatindexpath for the relevant row and modifying the variables but that didn t solve anything because that method seems to create a new cell every time is is called and doesn t get the existing ones i ll post the code for that method further down

7153495
google-chrome	safari
but it fails because it yields -0.000 tested on google-chrome and safari

7153498
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in ie google-chrome and firefox

7153556
vbscript	jscript
for scripting a dynamic property can be any legal jscript or microsoft visual basic scripting edition vbscript statement

7153574
folder	directory
so if your data files are in a tests folder which is just under the sources directory of your tests the path to use should be tests data.txt

7153582
iboutlet	ibaction
but if you actually set it up as a custom subclass of uitableviewcell and write the code files for the subclass you can write iboutlet declarations and ibaction methods in the code and wire them up to your custom elements in ib

7153583
cassini	iis
there is additional solution - install iis express and use it instead of cassini

7153587
wan	lan
i always thought that a query was entirely executed on the server and that only the sending of the results is slower on a wan than on a lan

7153597
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
data gets displayed but grouping filtering sorting don t work

7153597
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering fails also

fadein	fadeout
i want to incorporate either ralf stoltze s hoverflow plugin or brian cherne s hoverintent plugin to help the fadein and fadeout animations perform properly

7153640
hide	show
i m trying to move the keyboard to the bottom of the screen to hide the 35px menu bar that it show by default on windows mobile 5 6

7153652
maven	pom.xml
as expected where the current directory is that where my web app is for example where my maven pom.xml is

7153668
put	get
i wouldn t recommend using though at least as it is implemented in std map because this may make difficult to track elements added to the map for exapmle using with a value adds that empty value to the map and go for a more explicit get and put operations for adding and retrieving elements of the map

7153769
fadein	fadeout
when you use fadein or fadeout it s essentially changing the display property hence if it has not finished one vs other and you execute second effect object will no longer have appropriate properties jquery needs to run the effect so either decrease the time and or add stop instead of dequeue and if you like try this i am using fadeto which will not break even if your mouse enters and leaves abruptly and repeatedly on and off

7153774
width	height
use the view.getwidth and view.getheight as the desired width and height respectively for the bitmapfactory resize procedure

7153860
uiview	subviews
since the uitableview is a uiview you can add it as a subviews of any other uiview

7153863
integer	radix
parseint with radix to get the integer representation of the value

7153886
instances	transient
when i was trying to save an entity with a has-many relation i got the error object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

7153897
google-chrome	firefox
but both google-chrome and firefox starts using a lot of resources

7153963
jar	war
i speculate that because pomrefid on your first line has a value of war the valid value for type would be war and not jar

7153982
width	height
it seems that the sizetofit method is prioritising using the available height rather than taking up the width and shrinking the height

7153982
width	height
right now i ve set the width again after the sizetofit which works around the issue but it leads to odd spacing depending on the height of the label

7154002
gmail	hotmail
when i try to send emails to gmail it works but when i try to send emails to hotmail or yahoo it fails.

7154024
google-chrome	firefox
it happens more often in google-chrome than it does in firefox so my guess is that it has something to do with the page loading before the css has a chance to be added

7154046
serializable	deserialization
i use serializable deserialization technique

7154152
getter	setter
this way in order to set the state of the object you are forced to go through the property so that the references are more carefully managed by the compiler produced getter and setter

7154169
post	put
put these in and post the results

7154181
put	get
alright to put this thing to rest i ve created a test app to run a couple of scenarios and get some visualizations of the results

7154181
hash-collision	key
in other words the expected number of hash-collision per key is the collection size divided by the hash limit

7154181
puts	gets
the average time for puts and gets is calculated per 10 puts gets

7154181
puts	gets	put	get
for each test there s an output image regarding the average put time per 10 puts and the average get time per 10 gets

7154181
puts	gets
the colour maps are calculated separately for puts and gets but encompass all tests for their respective categories

7154181
put	get
remember the below maps are all relative to best worst get times the put times are no longer taken into account

7154182
next	except
you will not run in any problems except that the debugger doesn t catch the ivars directly anymore they won t display nicely next to your console. - but that s not really an issue

7154206
opera	safari
update after a hack i did for safari it suddenly works in opera as well

7154214
getter	setter
you can create an attached property that is bindable and has a getter and setter

7154230
width	height
check also width and height of layout container should be wrap_content also

7154237
int	double
where categories is an array that holds labor material etc. tots is an array of double or int if there won t be any dollar amounts and counts is the number of elements in categories

7154288
capitalize	uppercase
given a string of n letters there are 2 n different ways to capitalize all of the letters in that string since for each character independently of the rest that letter can be in one of two states uppercase or lower case

7154288
sequence	permutation
permutation of an n-element sequence assuming each element is distinct

7154288
sequence	permutation
6 permutation of the sequence abc

7154288
capitalize	capitalization	sequence	permutation
the fact that there are six ways to capitalize a three-letter sequence without giving all letters the same capitalization and that there are six permutation of abc is a complete coincidence

7154307
accessor	properties
if you re using the synthesize directive to create the properties accessor the compiler will also create any ivars that you leave out of the class declaration

7154310
getter	setter
you can create an attached property that is bindable and has a getter and setter

7154314
filesystems	hfs
i want to take in an image file probably a .dmg or a .bin which uses hfs filesystems

7154354
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
you can add a uitapgesturerecognizer instance to your uilabel

7154370
config	ini
as far as the reasoning for this approach is that down the road i want to define either by ini or some other storage method a config file that would be a list of fields elements that belong to a specific form that a non-programmer type could easily edit that the generic form class would read pull in the element info and create the form on the fly

7154387
hash	salt
i m looking at some existing code that is generating a salt which is used as input into an authentication hash

7154410
hash	salt
it seems that someone misunderstood the concept of salt or what input your hash needs and thought it only accepts hexadecimal digits

7154421
post	get
all i want to do is send the post request with the number and get the final page back

7154421
post	get
expected result send post get 302 and cookies back send cookies to url from 302 and get html back checked with firebug however i get nothing

7154422
post	get
you can work around the problem by passing the session id as a get or post parameter as appropriate

7154507
opera	firefox
in ie 8 nothing popluates but opera and firefox are just fine

7154526
tlistview	tlistbox
for a custom log viewer i wrote i use a tlistview in virtual mode not a tlistbox

7154560
int	double
i mean to say we are parsing a double and and int every microsecond one-millionth of a second which isn t bad normally

7154563
equals	tostring
i am using the jaxb2-basics plugin to create tostring equals hashcode copy and merge methods

7154595
width	height
i have multiple assets and multiple layouts but there are some parts of this app where i set width and height dip values within the java code

7154631
cpu	affinity
some may offer thread affinity to try and keep one thread on the same execution engine be that a core or a cpu but that s only for threads

7154644
dns	spf
spf relies on special entries added to dns records

7154644
email	dkim
dkim relies on digital signatures added to email

updatepanel	onclientclick
but now i m doing this in the onclientclick event of a button that sits in an asp.net updatepanel and it tries to bring me to the following address

7154667
submit	submission
some sites employ a mechanism where parameters such as the coordinates of the mouse when they clicked the submit button are added to the form submission via javascript

7154699
postgresql	mysql
however i would recommend you switch to another database that supports multiple connections like mysql or postgresql

7154706

if there is the structure would need to allow simple both load wise and code wise queries to get all children of a row and to get all parent of a row with the nesting level relative to the child first parent s level would be 1 parent of parent would be 2

getter	setter
you have declared an property â this is effectively a contract saying you will implement getter and setter methods but you haven t

7154791
getter	setter
synthesizing creates the setter and getter methods for you

7154791
getter	setter
you also have the option of defining the setter and getter methods yourself but unless you want to do something specific go with synthesize for now

7154794
filtering	grouping
then you would just filtering on objectclass inetorgperson memberof 0 where 0 becomes the grouping name

wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
ie9 s support for the tag is still in beta and right now the only formats discussed for the web are ogg vorbis mp3 and wav

7154808
getter	setter
using property tells the compiler that you intend to access the corresponding member variable through setter and getter functions functions which change the value of the variable or return its value

7154808
getter	setter
because you ve told the compiler that those variables should be accessible through setter and getter functions you need to define those functions

7154811
width	height
i assumed the width as 600 and my height as 800

7154923
put	get
this will cause a fatal error and php stop execution - you should get an error message to this effect if you are not it would be advisable for you to turn on display_errors in php.ini or you can put the line ini_set display_errors true

7154924
width	height
if you perform it on a 100 height 100 width element

7154973

i don t believe there is a way to directly get at the description several other post scattered around the interwebs seem to agree

7155050
libpcap	wireshark
wireshark sees all packets and i think it uses libpcap too

7155050
libpcap	wireshark
since wireshark uses libpcap too afaik i think the problem is the lib pypcap which does not provide me all packages

7155050
libpcap	wireshark
i thought wireshark uses the same base-lib libpcap

7155071
rss	feed
i have a very simple rss feed reader in my app that i got from a tutorial cocoadevblog.com iphone-tutorial-creating-a-rss-feed-reader and i added some code that was not in the tutorial to open the rss link in mobile safari

7155081
google-chrome	safari
i m just building a simple ajax site but running into a problem in safari and google-chrome

7155101
int	chars
int would be a good idea however chars would be an even better idea

7155101

7155174
google-chrome	firefox
there are two differences in the text between firefox and google-chrome

7155174
google-chrome	firefox
i ve set the font to 15px arial bold but it looks bolder in firefox than in google-chrome

7155174
text-align	text-indent
i set text-align center and used text-indent -1px to fix the horizontal alignment and messed with the line-height until the vertical alignment was correct

7155178
free	malloc
you have full access to the c standard library and can use c s malloc and free directly

7155189
rank	max
yes the full_matrices parameter to scipy.linalg.svd is important your input is highly rank-deficient rank max 3 241 so you don t want to allocate the entire 12 596 x 12 596 matrix for v

7155247
post	put
keep in mind usually such action would use post or put in which case you need to specify method with either post or put

7155276
sdl	xlib
i found out that any sdl calls that call xlib functions need to be the main thread so in this code all functions that rely on xlib are in the main thread

7155299
google-chrome	firefox
the reason for the differences is that firefox uses directwrite - a different technique to render text than google-chrome does

7155339
int	chars
and that method is the substring method which takes an int as its argument and slices off everything before the specified chars position

7155354
jar	war
i solved this by creating a war of my application and replacing the sfl4j jar in the glassfish installation with the jars from my war file

you could have for example and it would grow in height and width while fading from its starting value of 80 opacity to completely transparent all smoothly at the same time

7155370
printf	strncpy
as stephen has mentioned for most platforms running strncpy 12 times versus printf should produce a negligible difference

7155370
memcpy	strncpy
if you are only interested in handling const strings you may be able to effectively precompute the length of the strings and then use memcpy instead of strncpy to perform the string append

7155417
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i m working on making customized gridviews with the use of dropdownlistfor and checkbox

7155427
post	get
one reason it matters is that the protocol spec assumes that things served by get requests are idempotent and things served by post are not

7155427
post	get
we re a long way away from a world in which the above rule holds 100 of the time but i d encourage you to do your part - use get for cases where you re simply retrieving a document and use post when you re modifying a resource changing state etc

7155521
put	get
put another way just because the iv looks like abc123 doesn t mean the bytes java is writing to the iv buffer are going to be the same bytes you ll get if you strncpy from a c character literal buffer

7155527
pull	push
i then pushed my branch up to github git push origin bug_branch checked out the main development branch again git checkout dev and grabbed any changes that had happened since i d created my branch git pull origin dev

7155597
post	get
you should use _post not _get to get the post value

7155600
put	get
otherwise you just get exactly what you put which is currentrowid

7155689
printf	strcpy
on the other hand printf likely has to do extra work compared to a strcat or strcpy because it must parse the s on each call to figure out how to deal with the variable argument list

7155690
width	height
incase you want to set a minimum maximum height and minimum maximum width to a div css allows the specific feature

7155690
width	height
similarly for setting maximum width and height of a div or any other class id element use

7155690
width	height
for your div to expand freely in height and width after data is available for users

7155690
width	height
you will have to set the width height to auto immediately after you have set the min-width or min-height

request path reserved.reportviewerwebcontrol.axd type select the correct version click on request restrictions and specify one of the following verbs as get head post debug

7156282
post	get
you have to use either post or get back to this page check whether _post or _get exists and act accordingly

7156293
sorting	filtering
i was originally using pagination to make the inital load quicker however this means i need to do my sorting filtering server side otherwise it will only sort filtering the records on that page and not on the entire datasource

7156293
sorting	filtering
alternatively i can load the entire datasource into the grid which with 1000 records takes 20 secs to bind and then do all sorting filtering client side which is pretty much instantaneous

7156357
width	height
if you want your windowsformhost always have width and height like your parent control you can

7156357
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
2 bind to the actualwidth and actualheight of your parent control either grid or usercontrol with the width and height of your windowformhost

7156360
post	get

7156520
int	double
find out how how many bytes is the int and the long double in your case

7156534
int	double
on x86 32 bit sizes are as such int 4 bytes long double is actually 16 bytes at least it should be on some arch s its 8 bytes and on others 12 bytes and each cycle can only operate on 4 bytes at a time so int takes 1 cycle and long double takes 4 3 and 2 respectively for the other sizes mentioned cycles

7156535

now the problem which i m facing is that the timeout function is scheduled to terminate the threads after 10 seconds and it does so very well

7156703
int	chars
on the other hand suppose that the contents of stringbuffer is still an array of chars but we also store an int size which tells us how long the string is number of chars

7156724
width	height
although most html elements support unites when writing width and height i have never seen that this is supported in case of applets so remove px

7156726

7156842
memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc	realloc	malloc
in c i allocate malloc a and then as new buffers come i realloc and then memcpy so that i can easily copy my buffer to resized array

7156842
memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc	realloc	malloc
i can keep using malloc realloc memcpy but i m pretty sure that they are not recommended in c++

7156849
sorting	filtering
and its working.well i think this is more promising way to approach because you dont need sorting or filtering techniques but one unused column

7156855
post	get
to get the list of addresses that were selected you can add the control name as a parameter in you post handler and extract them during the save edit insert function

7156881

for-loop	loops
right now i am using for-loop to loops over all dates in given date range

7157866

post	get
when i get back the post from the form i only get back what the user has populated

7157946
getter	setter
should i use getter setter

7157946
getter	setter
a good code-completing editor will also be helpful here though really good javascript code-completing editors are thin on the ground. but you re right that getter and setter in the java sense methods like getfoo and setfoo would make it more obvious when you re creating accessing a property that you haven t defined in advance through a typo by causing a runtime error calling a function that doesn t exist

7157946
getter	setter
i say in the java sense because javascript as of es5 has a different kind of getter and setter that are transparent and wouldn t help with that. so that s an argument for using them

7157946
getter	setter
you can define a java-style getter with no setter

7158019
post	get
you may want to implement something like that in a weblog ince most of your visits will be looking at your homepage reading your post and then leaving all that is done in the same single pageview so it may be a good idea to fire an event when the user leaves to get the correct time on site or maybe fire an event when the user scrolls past some threshold in the end you ll be measuring the same ting if the user scrolls more he reads more and if the user spends more time then he reads more

disable the following code style option - project settings - code style - wrapping and braces - keep when reformatting - line breaks

7162624
integer	unsigned
the same applies to other signed unsigned integer types too.

7162624
twos-complement	modulo
on a twos-complement system signed and unsigned char types are completely compatible modulo the difference in how the values are interpreted and it s perfectly safe to access them as either type

7162624
int	chars

7162688
int	boolean
as we wish to track 140 states 1 for each queue true indicating that queue contains a task 140 bits are required and so as 140 32 4.375 we need at least 5 32 bit int to store all boolean states

7162701

but this again is wrong design because the chunk block is not shared by all children and shouldn t go into the base parent

7162703
int	double
as a side note if you come from a language like java in c++ the term object also refers to variables of built-in types like int double etc

7163527

however if you do not push until you have committed locally numerous times then the pull could be a large merge

7163549
pull	push
if you pull from a repo then immediately try to push and it fails with non-fast-forward then something else is going on

currently the page i am working displays fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie9 it is rendering in quirks mode

7168289
post	get
my post here should help you get started

7168303
rss	feed
i ve been trying to debug my rss feed with little success

7168333
getter	setter
you don t have to use the property getter of course - it s only the setter that s important.

7168350
hash	md5
i would rather not write my own so should i consider writing obtaining an md5 hash

7168374
width	height
so what i did is create a that is of 0px width with 170px of height and float right

7168386
versioning	upgrade
that is weird -- you probably want to upgrade to a later versioning

7168423
google-chrome	firefox
this is particularly true in the day where firefox google-chrome are putting out releases ever few months and mobile browser use is growing

7168429
dictionary	map
btw calling a list variable map isn t a good practice maps are usually dictionary

7168443
filtering	grouping
another solution is to find the tasks that have questions 2 or 8 and then use grouping by and having to filtering by grouping that have exactly two of those

7168460
hide	show
what you can do is bind a click event to the document that will hide the dropdown if something outside the dropdown is clicked but won t hide it if something inside the dropdown is clicked so your show event or slidedown or whatever show the dropdown

7168472
min	max
i then try and assign the min and max dates to a uidatepicker using jquery

7168482
getdate	dateadd
for example select getdate + 1 returns the same as select dateadd day 1 getdate and cast 40777.44281 as datetime is the same as 2011-08-24 10 37 38.783

7168482
getdate	datepart
datediff day 0 getdate 7 takes advantage of the fact that datepart day 0 which at the risk of overemphasizing the point is the same as datepart day 1 1 1900 returns 2 monday

7168485
hide	show
what you can do is bind a click event to the document that will hide the dropdown if something outside the dropdown is clicked but won t hide it if something inside the dropdown is clicked so your show event or slidedown or whatever show the dropdown

7168494
width	margin
i am working on a site design in which the main content area is centered via margin auto and has a fixed width

7168500
profiling	debugging
i know it was rendering properly in the first pass as i have a debugging window showing me the rendering results and in addition am using apple s opengl profiling and can see all of the textures

7168512
hide	show
what you can do is bind a click event to the document that will hide the panel if something outside the panel is clicked but won t hide it if something inside the panel is clicked so your show event or slidedown or whatever show the panel

7168545
ant	maven
but i m in the middle of converting a java project once built with ant to do so with maven instead

7168545
jar	war
when i open the war file for the project that i m trying to deploy with apache tomcat these are the only jar files i can find.

7168567
ant	maven
ant and maven don t handle dependencies in the same way so converting from one tool to the other requires a large amount of human work and you do it right

7168567
ant	maven
but your choice seems good it s much easier to my mind to use maven for dependencies although other tasks like deploy file copy etc. might be easier to achieve with ant than maven

7168576
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox but for some reason jquery is returning completely different positions for each of my .post-info pi items in google-chrome and is even getting the document .height wrong

7168585
crypt	salt
however as i understand it php has a crypt function which takes a salt as well as the number of iterations of a particular algorithm

7168585
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
supposed to pass the returned hash of crypt back into crypt as the salt

7168598
folder	directory
you need to publish the project to iis or copy the compiled output to a folder that is within your iis s site s directory path and change that folder to an application from the iis mmc console right clicking on the folder and selecting change to application i believe.

7168606
inject	interceptor
the problem is i m not sure how to inject a businessobjectinterceptor into a new hibernate session or the proper way to annotate my classes so that they can use the interceptor

7168626
crypt	md5
crypt is one-way hashing like md5

7168640
uiview	subviews
the way i see it is that the view controller retains the uiview object and the viewcontroller.view also retains the uiview object through adding subviews

7168645
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code below works well in safari but in google-chrome and firefox the form will not submit

7168660
war	manifest.mf
if your war is part of an ear file you may also want to check the project webcontent meta-inf manifest.mf classpath attribute

7168660
ant	maven
note that maven and ant are different beasts

7168660
ant	maven
maven can provision transient dependencies as necessary whereas ant scripts may have to define them explicitly

7168665
crypt	salt
when you pass this output als salt back to crypt it will extract the right algorithm and salt and use these for the operation

7168665
hash	salt
the hash part in the passed salt parameter is ignored

7168700
cardlayout	boxlayout	gridbaglayout	boxlayout	gridbaglayout	cardlayout
this uses various layouts including gridbaglayout boxlayout and cardlayout

7168711
portrait	landscape
my app is landscape only though and the login page loads in portrait

7168754
wordpress	joomla
i have it narrowed down to drupal joomla or wordpress

7168754
wordpress	joomla
from the information i have gathered drupal has a steeper learning curve wordpress has a large and ready set of theme resources and joomla brings a bit more simplicity for beginning developers

7168772
wordpress	expressionengine
i usually use either wordpress or expressionengine when an off-the-shelf cms is appropriate

7168796
getattr	subclassing
in which case you d probably be better by creating a simple helper to load all the classes from a module and put subclassing of testcase in the current module with different names should be straightforward doing this through a dir getattr in the module

7168796
folder	directory
still note that in pydev you may select multiple files folder and do a run as python unittest and it ll run all the tests it finds in the module or recursively in a directory so that may already be enough for you depending on your use case

7168843
exponent	addition
edit to ensure that the two exponent are equal requires the addition of the condition

7168847
textview	imageview
being z1 an imageview element and z2 a textview element

7168848
wordpress	joomla
from my experience working with a handful of wordpress and joomla sites i would suggest starting with wordpress

7168848
wordpress	joomla
the learning curve is much smaller and i ve found wordpress documentation more helpful than the joomla documentation

7168848
wordpress	joomla
unless the development you want to do requires the larger more flexible joomla or drupal framework start with wordpress for the sake of simplicity

7168949
width	height
google chrome set the height and width after document .ready

7168957
post	get
you should either disable magic_quotes or strip the slashes on all get post cookie data as early as possible following example #2 here

7168988
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
simply use valueproxy instead of entityproxy and you turn requestfactory into a simple rpc mechanism similar to gwt-rpc

7169035
for-loop	arrays
that s the only explanation i can see for both the for-loop and the i++ being placed inside of an arrays subscript

7169035
google-chrome	firefox	for-loop	loops
on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same

7169035
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	for-loop	loops
on os x the for-loop has a 10 advantage in firefox there is no difference between the two in google-chrome and safari prefers the while loops by 6

7169035
google-chrome	firefox
if anything then judging by market share you would probably want to optimize for google-chrome on windows before optimizing for firefox on mac in which case the while loop would be preferred

7169075
width	height
i need to compare each object of the list with all the remaining objects in such a way that if the currentobject.location x y falls in the rectangle x y width height of the other object i need to delete the other object from the list

7169080
post	get
as such i can t get the actual post id so i can t delete that post

7169096
webrat	cucumber
i m working on migrating a large set of cucumber features from webrat to capybara and i m running into quite a few issues

7169098
nszombies	nszombieenabled
anyway to turn on nszombies go to project edit active executable arguments tab then add a variable called nszombieenabled and set the value to yes

7169136
stdout	stderr
in a c++ program we have 3 streams stdin stdout and stderr

7169187
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
does it continue to animate in firefox safari google-chrome etc

7169191
addition	multiplication
this approximation can be had for the cost of a multiplication and an addition after reducing the angle mod 2 pi

7169196
int	chars
the two are also interchangeable but only if you re working with chars or int and only one condition is being tested

7169209
hide	show
what i want to do is hide or close the console application without terminating the whole application and show it later by pressing a button or something like that from form

7169210
getter	setter
you could write getter and setter that take the format you want and return the format you want

7169232
hide	show
basically seems like you need to call some windows api functions to show hide the console

7169245
google-chrome	firefox
so far everything works in firefox and google-chrome

7169269
gif	png
however the browser will only display documents that it knows how to either natively html text gif png jpg etc. or via a plugin pdf swf etc

7169273
express	everyauth
my authentication is done via the everyauth module i use the express framework

7169276
onresume	onpause
in that case you should implement your timer object as an instance member of your activity create and start it in the onresume method of your activity and stop it in the onpause method of that activity

7169297
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in current versions of google-chrome firefox ie safari and opera

7169312
children	parent
i am writing a web app that needs to quickly print a name tag and a parent claim check as we check children in

7169315
min	max
it takes min and max as two of its arguments

7169319
put	get
they load fine since i get the correct amount of rows put for some reason i can t the text printed

7169340
submit	submission
after clearing the cache and opening a new window submission a login request the first time wont submit correctly and the page reloads and nothing has changed but after the first time it works fine..

7169371
for-loop	arrays
you could make a function for this to remove an arbitrary element of an arrays have a parameter for the initial value of the for-loop

7169390
pull	push
as for tracking branches that s just an entry in your config file telling git where to pull and push a local branch to from by default

7169397
min	max	width	height
anyway..the problem with expressions seems to be that it gets evaluated constantly...so...watch for that...anyway a source for min max width height

7169426
button	checkbox
now lets you have a button with id show-message in your view and you want to load custom html base on the values of an input field id field1 and a checkbox id box1 into a div id put-message-here

7169441
many-to-many	many-to-one
essentially i have a many-to-one relationship for currentdog and a many-to-many relationship for pastdogs

7169511
subtract	add
once we found the starting point and assuming it was there at all we add the length of that substring to that starting point using pointer arithmatic and then find the resulting string s length by subtract the starting position from the ending position which is found with strchr position

7169512
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on my windows machine however refuses to render it firefox works just fine

7169512
ubuntu	linux
i m using font-face to serve the ubuntu font set to browsers which is the font that i m using by default on my linux machine i can t really see how this might be a font issue though as it works in one browser but not the other

7169521
put	get
i know i could use js outside but as you will see in my code...i m gonna try to put php values...so i need to have some control directly in the expression so it excecutes automatically just once and then i don t have to write js functions elsewhere....i think this should be very simple...but i just can get it...anyway...my code is something liek this....

7169535
portrait	landscape
this means that the first view controller in your setup must support landscape otherwise the child will only support portrait

7169545
put	get
ignoring the hardware side of things get better harddrives servers etc. there are ways to optimize put commands

7169562
uilabel	nsstring
this method and its multiple variations return the size that a nsstring instance will use therefore you can scale the uilabel to your needs

7169574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
almost all modern browsers support local storage meaning ie8 firefox 3.5 safari 4 google-chrome and above

7169586
jcomponent	bufferedimage
you can then draw this bufferedimage in a jcomponent s paintcomponent method with the graphics#drawimage ... method or even better for its simplicity and if you don t want to use the image as a background for a jpanel or gui draw the image in an imageicon that is displayed in a jlabel

7169619
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	put	get
i would love to not spend sometimes that much time in css and such...but unfortunately there are days in which i spend a whole afternoon trying to solve a little visual problem this is because of ie firefox google-chrome opera safari differences usually the one that gives more problems as we all know is ie...but sadly ...as we all know too it s the one that s typically used by the normal user...so...i spend a lot of time trying to get things to work the way i need in just one css sheet and without trying to make the exceptions for every browser...i know that s faster but for quality purposes...as far as i know there s usually a nice way to put everything in just 1 css sheet and work for at least ie6+ and ff3.6+ ..usually what works in firefox follows for the others ..

7169631
folder	directory
have another request that returns all the folder in the user directory and put them on the page

7169642
super	implements
please tell me your professional recommendations and some super simple tips on how to implements it which asp.net objects to use as well as how said objects provide the mechanism for managing my complex profiles

7169646
folder	directory
nb suggest making these folder in a different directory then your root directory maybe users obama

7169655
vb.net	vb6
so the natural progression says that more people will probably use c# than vb and vb.net s grandfather vb6 wasn t a good language...hence there are more resources for it

7169659
execvp	posix
as a possible contrast the posix specification for the exec family of functions specifically states that execlp and execvp should invoke sh in the case of an unrecognized executable type

7169700
decimal	ieee
as all know decimal fractions like 0.1 when stored as floating point like double or float will be internally represented in binary format ieee 754

7169724
hide	show
on initial load only one container will be visible then hide and show another container after you click the next li

7169741
cout	cin
the best way is to change the use of cin cout etc to parameters of type and

7169758
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
there is a subclassing with readonly properties inherited from the base class

7169761
int	double
in addition the return type of main should be int you should include stdio.h and you should have double quotes around your format string in printf

7169776
rcurl	libcurl
rcurl has an scp command based on libcurl not a system call

7169856
getter	setter
the exposed variable can be changed to a getter setter using simple search-and-replace

7169874
richfaces	tomahawk
the stacktrace hints that you re using both richfaces 3.3 and tomahawk 1.x

7169874
richfaces	tomahawk
the stacktrace shows that the tomahawk one is parsing the request body before the richfaces one

7169874
nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
the nullpointerexception which you re facing is just the unforeseen consequence of this the richfaces guys should have thrown a more clear exception instead something like an illegalstateexception with the message uploaded file is missing in the request body or like but ala

7169874
richfaces	tomahawk
if you want to use richfaces file upload functionality then you ve really got to remove the tomahawk extensionsfilter from web.xml

7169879
width	height
the html5 element does not accept relative sizes percent for its width and height properties

7169879
width	height
not dependent on jquery i use it to get the width height of the parent div

7169887
hash	salt
you can combine that temporary id with some salt and or encryption and or hash of some connection-specific aspects like client ip time etc.

7169891
postgresql	mysql
we re currently using mysql for storing all of our data solr for indexing and i m investigating postgresql with postgis

7169891
postgresql	mysql
i m going to be writing either an apache module or mysql postgresql extension in c++ for each of these tests and following implementation once we make our decision

7169910
mockups	prototyping
i ve searched and haven t found any flexible gui mockups prototyping tools for ipad that would allow me to create winforms like business interfaces

7169975
width	margin
at the time of writing this my last attempt was with margin + - but i tried left width etc

7170043
int	chars
it is very common to have natural keys which could be candidates for a primary key with varchar chars data but yet instead enforce referential integrity on surrogate keys usually some kind of autonumbering int which is simply an internal reference and often the clustered index and primary key

7170058
springboard	tweak
yes you could write a mobilesubstrate tweak that launches the app when springboard starts

7170061
jobs	cron
if this all works it will confirm that you can run cron jobs

7170061
jobs	cron
if it works from the command line but not from cron test.py might have some dependency on environment variables cron jobs run with fewer environment variables set than interactive commands typically do

7170069
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is 450 byte cross browser ie6+ firefox 3.0+ google-chrome opera safari 3.0+ script that unlimit s much of javascript s prototype property collision issues

7170087
post	get
try it and post any errors you get

7170097
width	height
the canvas width and height attributes are separate from the same canvas s width and height styles

7170097
width	height
the width and height attributes are the size of the canvas s rendering surface in pixels whereas its styles choose a location in the document where the browser should draw the content from the rendering surface

7170097
width	height
it just so happens that the default value for the width and height styles if they re not specified is the rendering surface s width and height

7170097
width	height
it s possible to check before setting width and height and leave the canvas alone if it doesn t need resizing which would eliminate some of the redraws but you can t get rid of all of them

7170130
min	max
a result from the query would look like doesn t matter which parent use as group as long as it is from one of those parent in the group min id or max id would do

7170132
getter	setter
it s perfectly ok to have a public getter setter when the object property should be exposed via the public interface so there is no rule such as setter is always private

7170132
getter	setter
if you have doubts over deciding whether to use getter setter over the class variables there are numerous explanations on the internet why getter setter are better

7170151
cos	sin
or at least alternative to replace the math operation of cos radians sin etc in gql

7170155
accessor	properties
in you viewdidload it should be self.flashsets this will insure the accessor method is used to set the value and thus the retain behaviour you specified on the properties definition will be implemented

7170172
inherited	subclassing
there is no way to really inherited from array or subclassing it

7170178
getter	setter
i don t know if this will help but you may want to use the setter and getter methods when referring to flashsets - the retain part of the property doesn t apply i don t think when setting the variable directly

7170211
post	get
probably the quickest solution is to just create a new app id for the site get the app access token for that app see app login on and then use that access token to retrieve the post

7170213
getter	setter
private getter and setter all make sense when the data in question involves several variables have additional constraints you want to make sure you adhere to and these operations are done several times in your class

7170276
dumpsys	adb
this could be easily checked by running dumpsys meminfo with adb shell

7170302
wtforms	deform
if you are building a stand-alone tool you have wtforms z3c.form deform .

7170350
uiview	subviews
actually you probably don t want to create a uiview you should create a uiscrollview then add the images and that as subviews of the uiscrollview

7170441
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction helped interface builder detect what outlet and actions you wish to connect to your ui controls at compile time these iboutlet and ibaction are ignored and have no use

7170441
iboutlet	ibaction
you can have a scenario where you don t need iboutlet or ibaction when you are building ui controls programmatically in code

7170546
getter	setter
you can mark dependencies by putting them as constructor parameters or as public property getter setter or using declarative syntax such as attributes

7170604
width	height
you have to change image size width height same as form size width height

7170626
codeigniter	cakephp
is a convention used in several web frameworks ror cakephp codeigniter etc. it s not a rule that anyone has to follow

7170677
post	get
i am trying to parse the webresponse i get from a multiform post

7170721
stdout	stderr
i used call because it only matters whether the call succeeds or fails but in general you can use subprocess.pipe to capture stdout and stderr using subprocess.popen

7170743
inherited	properties
remove all navigation properties between the base and inherited objects

7170743
inherited	properties
remove the foreign key from the inherited objects and also remove the properties mapping for the foreign key in the inherited objects

7170770
firefox	safari
in short the date-field is validated correctly on a pc but fails on a mac iâ ve tried safari and firefox the mac browser will trigger the validation claiming the date is in an incorrect format which it isnâ t

7170770
firefox	safari
but on a mac both firefox and safari the validation kicks in and claims the date is in an invalid format

7170791
maven	pom.xml
add this to your pom.xml in order to tell maven to use version 5 of java by default it uses version 1.3 see documentation

you could add this constant translate the time and then subtract the number of years chosen

7171113
profiling	debugging
your developer profiling should be set to the debugging and for the release you must set your distribution profiling

7171117
post	get
the string can be passed on to server as post get parameter

7171128
hide	show
i have a simple gallery grid with a nested span that show the title which i want to slide up on mouse over and hide on mouse out

7171175
children	parent
i am using the id in order to compare changes between parent entities children so it s fairly fundamental to the current way i ve designed it

7171181
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in ios you should use nsstring or its mutable version nsmutablestring to work with strings nsstring has a method named isequaltostring that helps you compare two string objects

7171183
portrait	landscape
you could use the rotateanimation on the textview but if you just trying to use a different layout in landscape and portrait specify different xmls in different folders

7171208
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead

7171225
ftp	smb
in this context you should use a file transfer protocol like ftp ssh sftp smb or any other suitable protocol to transfer the uploaded file to the directory

7171246
webkit	gecko	firefox	safari
with this setup both webkit safari and gecko firefox will enlarge the 16x16 canvas space and the small image to 128x128 with the nearest neighbor algorithm

7171246
google-chrome	safari
in fact as of 2011-12-24 it works with safari on mac os and google-chrome on mac os but not with google-chrome one windows safari on windows was not verified as stated on issue 106662 of the chromium bug tracker

7171288
put	get
you cannot put scrollable things in other scrollable things and get reliable results

7171291
jquery	simplemodal
using the simplemodal jquery api to show a modal external window in a iframe works good in firefox and google chrom

quicksort	mergesort
if you look little different is mergesort quicksort in opposite direction

7171329
ant	maven
i have an old java project which i need to rebuild from a maven ant task and which has a lot of dependencies

7171383
vim	emacs
as vim and emacs use entirely different syntax description and scripting system it s obviously impossible to get vim syntax colouring under emacs automatically

7171450
accessor	properties
in addition to the standard javabean accessor methods indexed properties may also have methods to get set individual elements in the array by specifying an index

7171450
getter	setter
the javabean may therefore have the indexed getter and setter

7171450
getter	setter
in addition the standard getter and setter for non-indexed access

7171450
accessor	properties
going by the javadoc description if you omit the non-indexed accessor you can obtain a return value of null for the properties type of the properties descriptor

7171450
accessor	properties
note while that you can implement the indexed properties accessor alone it is not recommended to do so as the standard accessor are used to read and write values if you happen to use the getreadmethod and getwritemethod methods of the propertydescriptor

google-chrome	firefox
i wanted to test how it will handle cross browsers google-chrome ie firefox

7173461
inherited	subclassing
in most of the cases you would be using private access specifier only for this field as the declaration normally applies only to the class declaring it and we don t really need to either inherited this field in the subclassing or to access it from outside

7173474
jsf	seam
we followed the seam manual for specifying the datasource deploying the jsf lib and configuring the necessary xml-files

7173580

ubuntu	centos
aside from the obvious differences in machine name and user and the # caused by being logged in as root centos has around the user machine whereas ubuntu prefers a simple before the prompt

7174316
accessor	properties
it is not really necessary as ivars can have the same name as their properties and their accessor

7174316
getter	setter
fwiw if you want to do more than the default implementation of the getter or setter do you can still code one or both of them yourself but then you ll have to take care of memory management too

7174371
google-chrome	safari
these popup windows appear correctly infront of my current google-chrome or safari windows

7174913
cassini	iis
i would use this utildev cassini as me embedded web server of choice it is based on the code from the embedded visual studio dev server and can run pretty much anything that runs in iis

7175005
google-chrome	firefox
it is working fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie8 the behaviour is quite strange

7175025
int	double
but for that i do have to have the corresponding object to that values in the example that could be an int int a float double a date

7175059
ironruby	ironpython
using ironruby ironpython you should technically be able to do anything you could do in c# vb .net

7175066
qstring	qbytearray
if you really must use a non-utf-8 encoding like iso-8859-1 typically for compatibility with unfortunate legacy applications you will have to use qbytearray topercentencoding on a byte array you generate from qstring tolatin1

7175085
portrait	landscape
by adding this code your oncreate will not be called when you change the phone mode to portrait or landscape

7175089

children	parent
here is what i m trying to do all parent and children must have a close button on the right in the future only the hovered item will be able to show the close button

7175371
hash	hmac
if i understand the code it seems the ruby code is hashing the key separately before feeding it to hmac which shoudln t be cryptographically necessary as hmac will hash a long key itself if necessary and feeds the hash key to hmac together with the original message

7175371
hash	hmac
on the other hand your c# code computes a hmac with the original key and a hash of the message

7175371
hash	salt
inexplicably the variables where you store the hash message are called salt and private_key_binary though the content is neither a salt nor a key...

7175401
perceptron	sigmoid
here weights is a n-length vector which also contains the weight from the bias neuron - threshold result is the result as computed by the perceptron and processed using the sigmoid when given the input correct is the correct result and is the input augmented with 1 the fixed input from the bias neuron

2 find out what the parameters are find out if the method is get or post

7175536

7175552
svg	vml
or use how do you detect support for vml or svg in a browser to detect vml support

7175575

your description says you should send a http put but your example sends a multipart formpost using post

7175690
strlen	strcpy
the answer is to do with the number of chars strcpy copies compared to the number of chars strlen returns

7175690
strlen	strcpy
hint strcpy strlen

7175704
put	get
you can manipulate this chain with various flags like singleinstance to keep its state or nohistory to ensure it doesn t get put to the stack meaning it will be skipped if the user presses back

7175705
strlen	strcpy
if strlen user is equal to 1024 strcpy will write one byte past the end of buf

7175738
mouse	keyboard
as i ve said to you earlier i would recommend to investigate the software installed in the system which can interference with a mouse keyboard window layout

7175738
mouse	keyboard
this could be keyboard loggers mouse drivers and even antivirus security software

7175743
mouse	keyboard
your mouse cursor can only click on one object and you can only send keyboard input to a single text box

7175792
children	parent
you can see that this is roughly equivalent to a database with three tables department subject and topic with fk relationships between the parent and children

7175796
post	get
it sets the post request encoding and this will fail whenever spring determines the request body before executing the action note that this line has totally no effect on get requests

7175826

7175983
cookiemanager	urlconnection
if using java 6 you can use a cookiemanager if you re using urlconnection

7175993
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my system.data.sqlite.dll from versioning 1.0.66.0 written by robert simpson to versioning 1.0.74.0 written by the sqlite development team and that seems to solve the problem

7176037
pop-up	dialog
use where 9 is the function number of sum if you re typing this into the sheet the intellisense dialog will pop-up and you can select it without having to remember the function number

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
some new browsers firefox and google-chrome maybe safari raise that minimum timeout by a whole lot more for unfocused tabs and windows

7176064
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest google-chrome s developer tools of firefox s firebug - check with them whether the requests for files and for data are sent to correct locations and check whether there are any additional javascript errors

7176070
int	chars
put your int into a string delimiting every int by a chars for example a comma and then save them as a string

7176095

getter	setter
if you re considering something like this you most likely would be far better off implementing something like the inotifypropertychanged and stick this as part of your getter instead of only caring about the setter like normal usage

7176772
filtering	grouping
the entities are grouping in an hierarchy and i can filtering using those

7176808
wtl	atl
this is caused by an incompatibility between wtl s atlapp.h and atl s atlbase.h

7176889
width	height
but it is better practice to place the width and height in the tag so the browser doesn t have to calculate these dimensions

7176899
width	height
as far as i know you do not add the px label to width height attribute values on the img tag itself and i believe though could be wrong it s because pixels are used regardless

7176899
width	height
in css however one may use different units to specify width and height therefore it is appropriate to add the label when using css

this eliminates the min and max macros completely

7177068
post	get
we found a solution for this perform a post request instead of a get request inside the flash

7177068

7177377
rss	feed
im using channel tags to display content for an rss feed

is there a way i can create a java class with a pair of general getter setter methods such as

7178217
implements	extends
your block file should extends mage_adminhtml_block_template and implements mage_adminhtml_block_widget_tab_interface meaning that you ll have to implements some methods and in the construct you can set the template file ie

7178234
prepare	execute
the more complex queries you want to execute the more complex your application will get prepare statements mysql escaping getting last insert id etc

7178276
put	get
the problem is that if i put the absolute loginurl in the applications web.config instead of login.aspx i put i m successfully redirected but the passed returnurl is not absolute but relative and so i cannot get back to the calling application

7178307
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
qnetworkreply is a qiodevice so you can read it the same way you would read a file

7178309
button	checkbox
for example i ve page called default.aspx which has 5 text boxes two checkbox 2 radio button

7178324
google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome and firefox will not load content from disk by default use the --allow-file-access-from-files flag while invoking google-chrome like so

7178337

depending on the package manager this might involve push solutions drop the package with configuration information into a directory or send it using an interface while others are managed with a pull solution

7178428
getter	setter
edit faulttype looks like this getter and setter omitted

7178457
mouseover	mouseout
this will call a timeout when you mouseover the #menu-navigation li element and that timeout will be canceled if you mouseout before the timer is called half a second in the above example

7178479
hex	binary
in fact since hex can be interpreted as a shorthand for writing binary you might even say that when you print out a decimal number using printf it has to be converted from hex to decimal

7178497
button	checkbox
when they press a submit button it will check to see which checkbox are clicked and remove them from the database

7178499
width	height
the itemscontrol would have it s itemspaneltemplate set to a canvas and each widgetbaseviewmodel would contain a top left height and width property

7178532
base-class	subclassing
revised by hiding with a more restrictive access - in this case private access - you will still see the base class member from a base-class or subclassing reference but it would defer to the new method when available from the new access level

7178543
cassini	iis
however running my application on my laptop computer a windows xp machine with iis 5.1 causes me to get an error every time i call the service from my silverlight plugin either in cassini or in hosted iis

7178672
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
yield and let aren t in google-chrome or opera or safari or ie yet

7178701
hash	salt
however i don t really see how that helps - if the attacker has access to the hash of the password as they do in the example i ve been reading they most likely they will also have access to the salt

7178733
min	max
simply change the min max swap stuff to

7178738
pull	push

7178789
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that is a subviews of uiscrollview

7178822
hash	salt
2- if two users have the same password the hash would be different if salt so it s harder to catch common passwords

7178831
inherited	subclassing
another and simpler possibility is to declare the annotation as inherited - thus it applies to the subclassing as well

7178846
gif	png
validate it s an image gif jpg png

7178890
hash	salt
increase the computational cost of breaking it because for each password in the dictonary the attacker need to try hash it with all possible salt

7178925
pull	push
we ve created some hooks where when we push to the dev branch the dev server automatically pull the new commit in

7178925
versioning	upgrade
also regarding your master branch - leaving this as the vanilla install of wordpress is awesome because you can actually test new versioning upgrade easily

7179001
uiview	subviews
note you may add one view controller s uiview property as a subviews

7179033
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
i solved this issue by using the mousemove mousedown mouseup selenium commands to move to a different field on the page which gets rid of the date picker

7179045

7179178
opera	google-chrome
for ie opera and google-chrome

7179203
post	put
windows mobile also supports httpwebrequest class and you can create http post put request to upload a file to a server

7179215
button	checkbox
when save button will clicked first three textbox values will go to listong table and the identity will then paired up with the selected checkbox from the list control and save to map table

7179229
int	double
as far as i can see the reason for this is that foo asdf does not have a well defined type it s either int int or double int

7179268
width	height
while i ve been developing happily along with a stage width and height of 930x270 the truth is that not every single site is going to be using those dimensions

7179268
width	height
everything that runs uses the stage.stagewidth property and same with stage.stageheight for this exact reason however i cannot seem to dynamically set the width and height values even with basic to advanced embedding techniques on the web pages themselves

7179268
width	height
or even if i set a specific width and height or not

7179282
width	height
the application crashes when you use the lower right resize action ie change the height and width at the same time

7179285
cout	ofstream	ostream	ostringstream
then you can call that function passing cout or any other object of a class derived from ostream ofstream ostringstream etc...

7179292
webclient	httpwebrequest
especially the link to upload files using an rfc 1867 post request with httpwebrequest webclient

7179326
post	get
post is not like get where you tack the variables onto the url

7179331

one large template some js ajax for validating input additional hidden inputs that hold current step-id and php deciding which fields to show or hide

7179364
std	ostream
have tried using std ostream o

7179364
std	ostream
std cout is a variable of type std ostream by the way

7179397
nsstring	nsdata
the object you are storing to the user defaults and all of it s children has to be a plist type of object or in other words nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

7179425
width	height
use surfaceholder.setfixedsize int width int height

7179443
pop-up	dialog
also its better to go with wix dialog as you can capture the option selected by user on the pop-up

7179449
pop-up	dialog
i am creating a pop-up dialog box uialertview

7179481
post	put
looks like the best one involves modifying post to put the value you want into the fields

7179490
implements	extends
the first reason that comes to mind is to make it easy to substitute with some other object one that implements a common interface or extends a common superclass

7179493
setinterval	settimeout
with the html5 side-specs no need to hack javascript anymore with settimeout setinterval etc

7179506
strncmp	strcmp
if this is a nul-terminated string the compiler must use strcmp or strncmp

7179523
width	height
there is a textblock in my statusbar which has width and height set to auto

7179523
width	height
so when i changed text of my statusbar textblock it s width and height gets recalculated and it s parent s recalculates it s layout

7179523
width	height
but setting scrollviewer.cancontentscroll false disables virtualization and i want to use virtualization to my listbox so i set fixed height and width to the textblock

7179535
width	height
if there s no universal functionality that will work for all i m ok better than nothing for partial functionality i mean supporting some of the browsers by that not setting window width height etc

7179535
width	height
don t come with answer telling to set window width height i know how to do it i m not looking for it too

7179545
ant	maven
you can then associate this ant task with the initialize phase of maven - the overhead would be minimal

7179553
subtract	add
i then add or subtract a certain amount of lat or long from the

7179554
width	height
that ensures the texture is allocated by the driver proper width height buffer ready for later updates

7179567
children	parent
i have two types of rows one displays parent and second displays children

7179596
crypt	salt
even with the simple unix crypt s 2-letter salt this already is a factor of 3 844

7179596
hash	salt
modern password hash algorithms use a much larger salt for example bcrypt uses a 128-bit salt which gives a factor of 2 128 .

7179596
hash	md5
to protect against dictionary attacks too you ll use a slow hash algorithm instead of a fast one like simple md5 or sha1 sha2

7179626
superclass	subclassing
any class may behave as superclass or subclassing

7179630
union	distinct
you can select the color of both column in two queries union the result and output the distinct colors

7179659
pull	push
another approach would be to use pub sub to fire off messages to the workers and push pull to harvest results

7179679
google-chrome	firefox
now i am facing a strange issue on firefox and google-chrome allthough it works fine in ie8

7179679
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the first time i click that link the success alert is shown once the next time i click the link the alert is show twice next time it shows thrice

ivar	subclassing
i ve subclassing uipangesturerecognizer and added an panenabled bool ivar

7179690
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
i know if you subclass the uigesturerecognizer you need to maintain the state yourself but i would think that if you are subclassing uipangesturerecognizer and for all the touches methods calling the super that it would be setting the state in there

7179729
post	get
or use php and check if there is any variable named mem_follow this is for post although it doesn t matter if it s get or post

7179794
hide	show
i need to be able to hide show multiple div tags on the same page via a drop down menu but i want them to use the jquery fadetoggle

7179829
button	checkbox
the correct way to set checkbox and radio button as of jquery 1.6 is -- or omit the second argument to get the value instead

7179855
post	get
this is happening only in firefox 3.6 and not in ie i ahve tried both get post methods i have tried adding and removing the code in beforesend but to no avail

maybe the only way to do so is customize a uitableview let it looks like a uipickerview

7179904
titlebar	window
ie opens a window with only titlebar and url bar

7179904
titlebar	window

7179904
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

7179942
portrait	landscape
i ve developed two separate layouts to handle both types of orientation portrait and landscape

7179942
portrait	landscape
sometimes when i flip the phone from portrait to landscape or vice versa the app will simply close

7179947
width	height
measure is not called when you explicitly set a width and height on your components

in google-chrome and firefox everything is fine but in ie the form shows but i cannot write inside the textboxes fields

7180570

int	double
i already found a similar question with answer best way to compare double and int but a and b could be any type of number or something else than numbers

7180782
versioning	upgrade
i also noticed that the upgrade build carries forward some aspects of the old versioning which is strange to me

specifically the old versioning of the app had a default.png which the new app doesn t yet have as part of the build yet the upgrade app displays the old default.png while it is loading

7180809

this lead to various workarounds for checkbox and radio button use onclick instead and text fields use keyup instead

7181367
rss	feed
if you look at the rss feed of an individual location the identifier you are looking for is in it s address

7181392
for-loop	loops
first there is never a length cost for using a for-loop over a while loops but you get additional functionality with the for-loop so some coders just always use the for

7181392
for-loop	loops
when you read this code you have to switch from the for-loop mode of thinking to the while loops mode of thinking

7181394
post	get
i can handle simple get and post requests even multipart form-data but i am having trouble handling application octet-stream

7181399

post	get
when i do the final post to get the access token it gives me an error system.net.webexception the remote server returned an error 400 bad request

you need to pass in the static visibility dependency properties itself which button inherited from uielement not the value of the properties on the button instance

7181485
distance	polygons
my simplest example is i place a cube on a table place a projector attached to a tripod some distance away measure the distance orientation between the two using gom photogammetry product open an existing obj polygons model that is exactly the same shape as the cube dimensionally very accurate but with some fancy coloring then project the polygons model to the lcd projector

7181698
post	get
i believe it could be done by sending all the required content through get or post and then make php stuff it to a variable however i m not exactly sure

7181708
post	get
if you want to pass a variable to the server you can use a form and send the data through a get or post

7181721
post	get
the php script you pinged with ajax either via get or post can then take the value you passed and push it into a _session variable

7181735
put	get
what i don t get is where do i put the php script that tells mysql to do the calculations and what the calculations actually are

7181752
min	max
i want to find out the min and max price from a list of item objects contains price using accumulate

7181850

i did not have the getter setter set up correctly

7181900
post	get
if you post a complete reproducer you will likely get a better answer

7181953
int	chars
i cannot tell you the answer in c# but i can explain what this expression does it takes the extension from a filename and then the last 3 chars and tries to convert these to int

7181968
int	chars
it replaces the extension of a filename with the empty string takes the last three chars as a string and tries to convert to an int

7181993
min	max
never optimize min max without benchmarking and looking at actual compiler generated assembly

7181993
min	max
i m writing this because you are assuming strong optimization and yet trying to outsmart the compiler on min max

7182025
min	max
you ll probably want to set a max for screen say 1260px and a min for mobile say 320px

7182031
hide	show
that s all working fine but what i want to happen is when the user selects a different school year i want it to hide the div that s open for the school year they currently have selected and then show the new one

7182090
preferenceactivity	listpreference
there is no code in my preferenceactivity that affects this listpreference

7182127
addclass	removeclass
this should be faster because there s half as many jquery calls and just setting an attribute is way faster than addclass and removeclass but it is also more brittle and a bit less readable for what changes you re actually trying to make

7182167
put	get
i generally create a constants class or some other appropriately named static class and then put static get only properties for the various constants

what i get so far is user presses button function starts and every two minutes post some data to a server and tries to display some text somewhere after each post but has a problem

7182315
width	height
but i want to do something like board.show and have all of the square objects that are members of that class that have a height width and color show up

7182343
pull	push
this way you end up with two unrelated repositories which mercurial will refuse to push pull without the use of force only containing the history of a single directory

7182356
move	drag
you ll notice that if you try to drag the image you can see the helper move but it won t leave the gallery box

7182573
folder	directory
uses third-party code for functionality that is included with the rest of the code via actionscript build path source path note that this folder must be included explicitly for this project even though the path included is already in the source directory

7182573
folder	directory
source and project directory contain svn repository folder and files probably irrelevant

7182575

apache	nginx
because php is ran through apache nginx

7182646
width	height
whatever you put inside that widget has better know how to compute its width and height or else.

because it creates a temporary int where the double is converted and mutable references cannot bind to temporaries whereas const ones can

7183019
min	max
i would decide on a resolution for the analysis the size of your closed interval call it delta x and then as jerry mentioned find the max and min of the function within that closed interval including the end points

7183019
min	max
that will give you n intervals or delta xs and you will have found the max and min of each interval let s call them the delta ys

7183036
invokerequired	begininvoke
if invokerequired is false you are in theory already running on the ui thread and can simply perform synchronous actions directly or still begininvoke if you need to fire them off asynchronously

7183085
hide	show
i think that it is cleaner to refactor it and have the form live inside a hidden div and use javascript to show hide it as required

7183228

the parent should list the children as modules they will then be executed as part of the parent build process

7183300

i m trying to access the last element in an array in c++ more specifically i m trying to convert an int into a chars array and then access the last digit

7183747
mouse	keyboard
i thought that you might be able to set any field on any kind of event using the mouse pressure field on a keyboard event since the system almost certainly won t have set that to pass along arbitrary information and so identify the events that you ve constructed yourself

7183774
post	get
when i post to update-levels sometimes i get the message

7183788

if you believe submit a form.php should contain all the logic related to submission a form and register.php should contain only registration logic that is fine too

7183907

7184127
versioning	upgrade
the downside though is that it will probably be at least a handful of years before my institution decides to upgrade to that versioning since they re pretty shy about being early adopters especially when it comes to microsoft

7184159
hide	show
although this looks like a hack it s the correct way you don t need to figure out who was the caller instead focus on the fact that if your view controller will appear animated you have time to do your own animations if not screw it show or in this case hide everything immediately

7184170
x509	pkcs#1
the structure that is base64-encoded is the generic x509 representation of a public key therefore also the difference in the headers and not the rsa-specific representation described in pkcs#1 which your headers would imply

hash	salt
passwords shouldn t be stored in plaintext but at least hash and salt

7184186
folder	directory
i m working with a project that is setup using the standard maven directory structure so i have a folder called resources and within this i have made a folder called fonts and then put a file in it

7184223
versioning	upgrade
yes you can force an upgrade for all customers by requiring a minimal versioning

7184231
min	max
this is contradictory - imples that you want min item.entrydate cutoff not max

google-chrome	firefox
as a result i was getting 2 responses on a single click when i tested with firefox and google-chrome allthough everything was working fine in ie8

7185901
prepare	execute
you should use prepare statements to build and execute custom query or you should write big case condition with all your queries -

7185936
multiplying	add
since there are 60 minutes in an hour you multiplying the hours by 60 and add the minutes to that which would give the value 240

7185998

7186214
clang	llvm
most assuredly you will have your llvm trunk checkout and under the tools path you have checked out clang trunk as well explained under building clang via

7186214
debian	linux
on os x the build set up is a bit different but on debian linux i m building it daily as follows

7186214
clang	llvm
note if you re at the top level you can svn update the llvm trunk project-test trunk and clang trunk as follows

7186214
clang	llvm
at the top of the llvm tree you build against running make build_examples 1 will build the llvm specific examples then going inside your build tools clang path you then must run make build_examples 1 again to build the clang examples

7186214
clang	llvm
verify the examples installing under usr local bin for llvm and usr local lib for clang

7186220
width	height
you will have to find the heightof the text you need to contain inside the uitextview of a particular fixed width and then set its frame height to that value so that it is not scrollable

7186233
move	drag
for example if my drag started on element1 and during the drag i move to element2

7186233
google-chrome	safari
while desktop browsers do reflect it google-chrome safari .

7186272
autofac	castle-windsor
you can also achieve similar results using an ioc container such as castle-windsor ninject autofac etc

7186283
dictionary	map
generally if you want to dynamically map strings to values you should use a dictionary of string of combobox or whatever

7186296
int	double
you can use the wrapper classes int and double instead int and double

7186315
hash	salt
however to create the hash of this guess word needs to be generated using the same salt that was used for the password hash

7186315
hash	salt
my question here is how can i extract the salt from password hash

7186327
onresume	onpause
if so i suspect you need to release the camera resources in your onpause and then start the preview again in onresume via the surface view callback

7186336
range	infinity
can only give me a generator for the squares up to and i can t see any obvious way to call range infinity so that it just keeps on truckin

7186340
hash	md5
md5 will produce a hash for password but it will always produce the same one

7186340
hash	salt
by not using just password but instead password + salt a different hash is produced and mrun is foiled

7186340
hash	salt
if you need to find the salt you will have to have at least one known combination of password and hash

7186343
sudo	passwd
although your passwd can show up in strange places so you might want to do a sudo grep passwd -r first to see if its anywhere else on the system and then clear out your history

7186344
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
a core data object is usually a subclass of nsmanagedobject not a nsobject

7186354
opera	firefox
in terms of supporting the html5 video tag i believe firefox and opera only support ogg vorbis and i don t see them getting .mp4 support in the very near future .3gp and .mp4 are patented

7186369
x509	openpgp
one of the options is to use detached signature using an openpgp key or x509

7186375
hash	salt
just pass the password hash as the salt -- it is smart enough to extract itself

7186375
crypt	salt
note the salt parameter of crypt is not the salt

7186396
int	double
now imagine you want to instantiate your template functions for types int and double

7186496
opera	firefox
this only happens with ie not with firefox ch or opera

7186508
onkeyup	onkeydown
but when i added ontouchevent onkeydown and onkeyup methods in the activity class application starts to work very slowly

7186519
put	get
one option is to put a delegate in your constructor so that whoever creates an instance can specify how to get at it

7186564
versioning	upgrade
the rails framework is improving at a steady pace and if there is a downside to that is that it can be a pain to upgrade from versioning to versioning especially as regards to major versioning changes which introduce tons of backward incompatibilities

7186564
put	get
why then would you want to put yourself in the hole at the get go

7186574
pdfbox	itext
itext is probably the best but if you cannot live with their license there is also pdfbox

7186586
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in internet explorer 7

7186586
google-chrome	firefox
when the text within the textarea is 12345 and all this text is selected firefox and google-chrome returns

7186606
post	get
also you want to make sure youre using post and not get to connect to the service as that would expose the username and pw stuff in the url

7186624
google-chrome	firefox
i got this code with js parsing from xml my output displays nan in google-chrome firefox ie.

7186639
keydown	keyup
i have tried keyup keydown and keypress

7186699
profiling	instrumentation
use instrumentation particularly the time profiling instrumentation

7186721
hide	show
to hide show rows you can do it on the template file with an structure similar to this

7186748
textchanged	keyup
you are adding the keyup event handler multiple times inside the textchanged handler

7186774
implements	extends
actually what i would like to have is something like class a implements hasastate and where b has a reference to a and can call a.addstate b only because b extends and where a can call b.setparent this

7186810
int	boolean
the approach uses as most others the fact that the result of a boolean expression when converted to int yields either 0 or 1

7186822
google-chrome	firefox
firebug with firefox google-chrome

7186839
width	height
now how to set the height width and source of the image in the control template

7186845
textview	simplecursoradapter
my instance of mergeadapter should include a simplecursoradapter which is correctly reading data from my db and as a footer a new textview or button which should be clickable

7186925
getter	setter
you may use constructor arguments or explicit getter setter or you could declare your properties to be public

7186939
hide	show
javascript hide show element

7186939
hide	show
how to hide the radio buttons the radio buttons should be show only when the user clicks on the show button

7186941
int	boolean
for example avoid mapping 2 value logic with boolean or for more values like the colours of a semaphore red green yellow with int 1 2 3

7186973
width	height
for width and height you can use and

7186973
inherited	properties
if you want the image to be customizable you should inherited the button class and add an imagesource properties

7186976
udp	tcp
summary mailslots are rather like udp but named pipes are closer to tcp

7187022
width	height
this page says that the video can be max 398px in width and height developers.facebook.com docs guides attachments

7187059
sse	avx
it s hidden away on intel s avx technology page but it s equally useful for sse programming

7187078
getter	setter
the only thing that comes to my mind is to put all the super-private members as private variables into an abstract base class with protected getter setter

7187078
getter	setter
and currently before setting any variable i search whether i created a getter or setter to find out whether i have to consider invariants

7187083
opera	google-chrome
a suggestion was made to try opera 11.00 or higher to see if google-chrome has a bug here or some security model that disallows this

7187086
put	get
in my mini.login.phtml which i put in the footer of my pages and the good news is it does get the item count in the cart

7187088
pull	push
i would like to create a git repo in which the users can only pull the files from the git repository and can never push into it

7187125
min	max
a simpler solution might be to implement a wrapper class for your integer and declare min and max in that class

7187150
google-chrome	firefox
following works in google-chrome ie9 and firefox on a .php

7187150
google-chrome	firefox
why will it work in firefox and not in google-chrome and ie

7187150
zclip	zeroclipboard
more info jquery zeroclipboard or zclip nothing in clipboard ie 8 and 7

7187211
fadein	fadeout
i should make a loop through the spans making fadein fadeout every 5s

7187211
fadein	fadeout
while untouched it is working fine but when you try do play with the arrows play forward arrow 5 times for example script goes mad making fadein fadeout constatly

7187228
wordpress	joomla	wordpress	oscommerce	joomla	oscommerce
i saw this with other systems like oscommerce joomla wordpress etc

7187242
bazaar	git
check out gitworkflows for the idea behind it or the bazaar workflows for a very nice graphic repesentation of the possibilities it is also possible to use git or any other dvcs like a cvcs

7187252
pull	push
a dvcs mixes version control branching and labels with publication push pull to from remote repo

7187252
perforce	svn	pull	push
i don t think you can summarize that way especially considering it would be difficult to emulate the push pull features since most of the vcs svn clearcase perforce ... have no local repo only local working spaces and depend heavily on their central repo

7187255
bazaar	git
that s why git and certainly hg and bazaar have strong merging algorithms

7187289
width	height
when i debug to everything worked fine in watch window i can see width and height with 640 and 480

7187289
width	height
but after excute the copy method it returns the bitmap to bmp but the width and height of bmp is -1 and -1 and it couldn t add the text

7187386
hash	salt
the salt of a password hash function is concatenated with the password and the resulting string is then hash

7187386
hash	salt
to get back the salt that would mean you d need to get back the string which was hash

7187398
subtract	add
in order to resolve the problem you can add subtract a small number to find an answer that is correct up to a certain accuracy

7187401
implements	sealed
personally i rarely implements idisposable myself and when i do it s typically from a sealed class as i like to seal classes where possible - and it almost never involves a finalizer.

7187427
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of ld versioning 2.21 that comes with mingw 4.5.2 works fine

7187479
yslow	pagespeed
you can utilise tools such as the mvc-mini-profiler from the stackoverflow team for server-side performance issues or tools such as yslow or pagespeed to profile any client side issues

7187492
nstablecellview	nsoutlineview
awakefromnib is called every time a nstablecellview is created by nsoutlineview

7187500
hide	show
the slide methods are members of the effects queue they will hide show the element s in a sliding motion

7187530
dependencyobject	uielement
this only works on a frameworkelement derivative though i can t think of a way to do this on a uielement or raw dependencyobject

7187542
slideup	slidedown
slidedown and slideup animates the hiding showing

7187556
button	checkbox
in addition quick movements performed may let the user click on the button rather than on the checkbox

7187588
inherited	properties
this rule applies the colors to every element so neither of the two properties is implicitly inherited

7187588
inherited	properties
because this breaks the inherited chain completely for any properties that is normally inherited such as color setting those properties in a rule is considered bad practice unless you have a very good reason to break inherited this way most use cases that involve breaking inherited require you to do it for just one element not all of them

7187640
slideup	slidedown
the only diffrence that exists between hide and slideup slidedown is the animation

7187644
range	minimum
please tell me how i can set the range of a text field to a maximum of six and minimum of one

7187658
hide	show
this script is used to show hide the qtp window

7187711
post	get
the post is using an ioc container but you could take the hard coded dependency if you re wanting to get something working

7187725
hide	show	width	height
the show hide methods animates width height and opacity while slideup sidedown only animates the height

7187725
hide	show
the default duration of show hide is zero so if you don t specify a duartion it will show hide the element immediately

7187735
maven	pom.xml
in eclipse indigo preferences maven user interface there is a check box for open xml page in the pom.xml editor by default

7187758
decoder	encoder
there s a json encoder decoder that looks like it would do the job

7187760
getter	setter
finally don t forget to add a getter and setter to user for the new field

7187772
jstl	taglib
take a look at the jstl core taglib

7187801
width	height
video x-raw-yuv width 352 height 288 framerate 30 1

7187802
hide	show
i set the display to none hide it and then attach an event handler to the click event of a the element with id thebutton not in html to show it again

7187829
super	extends
if b extends a you simple use a call to super int a in b s constructor and everything is fine

7187829
super	extends
for constructors not calling a super empty or not extends a super class the compiler will add a call to super

7187832
move	drag
there are some librarybaritems in a librarybar control when i drag horizontally all the librarybaritems move

7187839
post	get
if you post to album_id photos or page_id photos you still get the share link you can use this as an alternative if you are posting pictures

7187849
accessor	properties
if you have a properties with an internal set accessor and public get accessor it means that code within the assembly can read get and write set the properties but other code can only read it

7187869
button	checkbox
or the checkbox might not respond to clicks because the button swallows the event

7187869
button	checkbox
most users will think that your layout has a bug because they ve never seen a checkbox inside of a button before

7187869
button	checkbox
use the standard approach checkbox with text clear automatically above button

7187869
button	checkbox
maybe change the button text when the checkbox gets selected to close

7187897
serializable	deserialization
jsonbackreference is the back part of reference it will be omitted from serializable and re-constructed during deserialization of forward reference

7187922
int	double
there may be other scenarios around very large values where the exact target int can t be represented exactly as a double - i haven t checked - but that s certainly not the case here.

7187973
wordpress	joomla
since there is no automated ci installer like those for joomla wordpress etc

7187989
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
but it looks the way i want in windows but differs in macos and even worse it looks different in different window managers in linux lxde gnome kde xfce

google-chrome	firefox
after experimenting with the css3 flex-box proporty i quickly noticed some differences in google-chrome and firefox

7188085
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

7188085
realloc	malloc
the other reason is that some embedded systems must be high reliability and malloc realloc can return null

7188089
instances	transient
if you want a new instances of a component every time you request one from the container use transient

7188106
width	height
according to slider change value dynamically increase height and width of your label

7188110
kde	gnome
when it comes to window managers there is a lot more to it than just font size for instance the width between 2 controls are handled differently in gnome kde

7188129
post	get
in the ajax api you can specify the data property and set it a json and it will send the data to the server based on the type you have set that is get or post

7188249
gdal	ogr
fdo gdal and ogr are all implemented in c++ programming language

7188249
gdal	ogr
gdal ogr gives access to data stored in enormous number of geospatial formats lots of data processing algorithms and operators

7188249
gdal	ogr
fdo provides those features too interestingly thanks to integration with gdal ogr in some places like fdo provider for gdal but it feels more like a framework whereas gdal ogr feels more like a library

7188249
proj	ogr	gdal	proj	gdal	ogr
note gdal and ogr are bundled together under the umbrella of common software proj called simply gdal

7188277
memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc	realloc	malloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc	free	malloc
well it s better to avoid using realloc if it s possible since this operation is costly especially being put into the loop for example if some allocated memory needs to be extended and there no gap between after current block and the next allocated block - this operation is almost equals malloc + memcpy + free

7188310
hash	md5
i think a hash is what i want here perhaps something like md5 seed + seq max but javascript doesn t have md5 and if i m doing it in code there s probably a better choice of hash

in my application i have activity group in which i have a custom listview with imageview textview and a spinner

7188551
realloc	malloc
realloc can fail just like malloc can

7188551
realloc	malloc
realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

7188551
realloc	malloc
in other words you will need 2x the memory space of the original malloc plus any additional amount assuming realloc is increasing the buffer size

7188551
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

7188551
free	malloc
if you can do a single malloc and free without resizing it s slightly better yet still dangerous

7188556

gridview	rowdatabound
for example see this article where a gridview in extended to do the same or see this where rowdatabound event is used to apply the css class to column header classes will set back-ground sort image or see this that uses rowcreated event to actually add image control into header cell

get the window height substract height of heder and footer divide by the 1 element height and put as a parameter to the link

7190526

7190532
hide	show
the comboboxes work my problem comes when i want to show or hide one of them

7190532
hide	show
simply wrapping the source list boxes in divs will let you show and hide that div and all the controls within it including the autocomplete combobox

7190590

you need to put the clear both on the wrapper instead - but first make sure you get rid of the duplicate ids

7190705
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly fine in google-chrome safari firefox and ie

lets say i have a main page which has a link that opens a modal div which has position fixed and some width height

7190816
width	height
when you apply a zoom-in or zoom-out change this variable accordingly and change the size of each element on your page both width and height for elements displayed as block and font size

7190833
google-chrome	safari
there is the zoom css3 property which does exactly this the latest webkit browsers google-chrome safari support it

7190840

i d like to be able to list files from a distant directory on the network with rails for instance listing every pictures in a folder to move them and do some processing on them

i can use property and synthesize in objective-c so i do not have to write getter and setter methods

7190852
hid	keyboard
i don t fully understand hid usage pages so i didn t know whether or not to use generic desktop page 0x01 with the keyboard usage id 06 or the keyboard keypad page 0x07 with usage ids for the individual keys

7190863
sorting	filtering
local sorting and paging works fine but filtering does not

7190880
int	double
this is because the uniqueifier which helps sql server identify a row when there is no true key is only 4 bytes which means it can t exceed the capacity of an int it does use both positive and negative unlike identity unless configure it as such which is why you get double

7190883
equals	gethashcode
i have overridden the gethashcode and equals even put return true in the equals method

7190922
apache	nginx
my understanding is that the app role should refer to the application server thin mongrel whatever and the web role should refer to the frontend server nginx apache so i m rather confused by the choice of running all tasks on all roles even though capistrano separates them by default

7190944
getter	setter
in ruby you ve got the arr_accessible method who create for you getter and setter

7190944

then do your show hide

7191069
getter	setter
use a getter setter pair

7191069

the make getter setter pair is ok but it doesn t have the check for removing the listener off the old instance and adding the new onw

7191091

public class viewidentification extends activity implements onfocuschangelistener

7191100

if yes then try using debugging provisioning profiling

7191224

create your own stl allocator and track the size of the memory requests placed to it then jsut add the size of the container itself

7191226
google-chrome	firefox
in ie 7 google-chrome firefox etc

7191303
junit	mockito
junit combined with some mocking framework like mockito should get you a fair bit on your way

7191306
getter	setter
synthesized properties should provide setter and getter but that method would look like - void setmoney int money and - int money

7191307
submit	submission
you have to active ajax only when you submit the form and prevent the default browser form submission

7191327
onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart
so ideally you should run your code after calling the super in oncreate onstart onrestart and onresume and before in onpause onstop and ondestroy

7191371
firefox	safari
this vertical center alignment is working fine in firefox safari and ie8 but is not properly working in ie7

but when i perform deploy to my tomcat built-in web server 6.0.32 suddently in the build directory build web web-inf classes the deleted folder appears ok with no-content again

7191529
hide	show
depending on your layout you could try placing the second image under via z-index the first then show the second even though it will be covered still at this time then hide the first which will then reveal the second that was underneath

7191542
onresume	onpause
an activity is visible to the user in onresume and not visible whenever onpause is called

7191542
onresume	onpause
set the boolean to true in onresume and false in onpause

7191546
min	max
we need the max_password_length constant because we can t simply use either the max or the min of the two input lengths as that would also leak timing information

7191600
hash	md5
if you need a hash lookup table you won t need cryptographic-level hash functions like sha-1 md5 or sha-256 since you ll make a modulo according to the hash lookup table size and those functions are much slower than the following one

7191606
inherited	subclassing
you can try setting paddingbottom to see if the label will inherited that but you might have better luck creating your own subclassing of label and using it as the textfieldclass

7191625
hide	show
currently the span are not hidden and therefore do not toggle between hide and show as they should

7191657

getter	setter
all your entities extend an abstract class with magic getter setter that get from or update this array

7191985
width	height
you want to set the max-height and max-width properties to the values you said this will not force the image to grow further than their original height or width and will minimize it if it is larger

7191986
width	height
there s a method called createimagedata that you use to make an imagedata object which is really just an array of pixels with height width

7192031
width	height
adjust width and height of that div till it fits your needs

7192035

i m not very experienced with the swing library but if you could put a few lines of code regarding your menu menuitems i m certain you ll get a much better answer

7192044
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in ie though firefox safari and google-chrome don t behave this way

7192063

however after a push is performed and another developer pull the other developer only sees commits via git log upto the date of backup they cannot see the commits from morning after the backup

7192065
google-chrome	firefox
but in ie it doesn t seem to do it while in firefox and google-chrome it does

7192065

google-chrome	firefox
in browsers like google google-chrome and mozilla firefox when you put a maxlenght of 0 on a text input field the textbox lenght is unlimited

7192331
uitableview	reloaddata
after you add the object just call the reloaddata uitableview method and it will reload the table again

7192346
folder	directory
the path should be the folder that contains the extra package not the package directory itself

7192349
hide	show
if you re trying to load an image into memory for use later but you don t want it to be show to the user a better way is to put it into the body and then use css to hide it via display none

7192363
put	get
for example parse all the tags and put them in a list omitting any attributes so that you can easily operate on the list determining whether a tag is left open or was never opened at all to eventually get a good layout tree which will be an approximate solution for sloppy layout while being exact for correct layout

7192390
cos	sin
where 0.996.. cos phi and 0.0882.. sin phi

7192448
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
this allows you to perform aggregate-functions like sum min or max on each grouping

7192560
getter	setter
you show the annotation on the field but jaxb uses property getter setter method access by default

7192567
tabcontrol	tabitem
unless i m mistaken which i hope i am there is a bug with the tabcontrol related to the visibility of tabitem

7192567
tabcontrol	tabitem
ideally the tabcontrol have preselected it s first visable tabitem

7192570
firefox	safari
this works just fine in firefox safari and even ie7

an arraylist for example does not implements the interface you ll have to extends it and do the necessary plumbing to make it work

7192765

onclick	preventdefault
i have used onclick value to the submit button and have it run a function that uses preventdefault

7194676
children	parent
a table for children if they have always exactly two parent parent can be fields otherwise you also need a table for the relationship

7194676
children	parent
from your comments below i think that you are saying that children are divided into classes or types and that the possible attributes depends on the type of the child but that the values of those attributes depends on the parent

7194684

blowfish operates on 64bit blocks its key size varies but openssl which currently powers both ruby s and node.js cipher implementation uses 128bit by default that is 16 bytes

if you re setting the width and height you don t need to set cols and rows

7194742
dictionary	map
but i don t think that you can map a dictionary type with entity framework

wakelock	powermanager
where haswakelock simply returns the result of and wakelockmanager.newpartialwakelock debug_tag encapsulates the standard get the powermanager and then return a wakelock code

7194988
wakelock	powermanager
it means that i have three possible issues here 1 the wakelock is never retrieved at all from the powermanager 2 that i have a concurrency issue that on rare occasions takes effect just before the postcondition but after the call to acquire or that 3 acquire is sometimes faulty

7195108
int	chars
2 see friend you have declared variable n as an unsigned chars but you have used x which is for unsigned hexadecimal int

7195108
integer	unsigned
so at the time of printing the value of n is promoted or technically you can say typecasted as an unsigned hexadecimal integer

7195108
int	chars
in a 32-bit compiler it will be represented in memory as 0000 0001 as chars is provided 1 byte of memory.but afterwards when you typecast it as a unsigned hexadecimal int the interpertation in a 32-bit compiler is 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 well if you declare int n 1 or you declare unsigned int n 1 or you declare int n 0x1

7195153
width	height
glteximage2d gl_texture_2d 0 gl_rgba width height 0 gl_rgba gl_unsigned_byte data

7195155
width	height
the iframe implementation is limited and if you change the height and width of it to just fit the button the window will appear hidden

7195248
int	chars
in general it seems you can pass null as parameters into functions and that an empty vector is generally returned as chars 0 int 0 etc

7195260

7195384
disk	ram
since my app runs on embedded device with a limited ram disk size i would like write filehandle to wrap to beginning of file on reaching max size and the read filehandle to follow like a circular buffer

7195384
fseek	fread
however as soon as i do fseek of write filehandle to beginning of file fread returns error

7195426
sorting	grouping

you wont prevent sniffing http traffic using a captcha use ssl if you send your requests using https no one can sniff your trafic

7195615
for-loop	loops
if you need to care about this because you re in a very tight inner loops you re actually better off iterating with a for-loop on the list directly

if you look on this page you can find contact info and i can put you in touch with the appropriate people to get started on that path

7195907
post	get
you can see that your comment is submitted via url as you didn t specify the method get and post and get is default

post	get
it seems that you mix get and post data

7196122
post	get
in html you use get but in php post

7196122

7196300
portrait	landscape
how can i get view 1 to not rotate to portrait but get view 2 to not rotate to landscape

7196310

i have a custom usercontrol with a properties called parentnode of type optionsnode which inherited treenode

7196491
melt	reshape
i tried melt in the reshape package but that results in a data.frame where strings are treated as factors so i d have to do something like

7196523

opendj	openam
openam is embedding opends as its configuration datastore and can leverage opends or forgerock led opendj the continued open source ldap directory project derived from opends as the user data store

7196538
getter	setter
basically you would add a a field in your model say called mass_data and create getter and setter for it that convert to and from the mass_data format to four separate fields corresponding to your model

7196596
width	height
might consider changing the above logic to handle height width separately i ll leave that to you

7196661
hash	hmac
a next level up in sophistication is to pick an random hash function - hmac with an arbitrary key and of the n-grams you find keep only the one with the smallest hash value

7196699
unsigned	short
and treating them as an unsigned long unsigned short and unsigned

7196699
irssi	mirc
you may want to check what mirc and irssi do as they re more commonly used than chatzilla and xchat and may have come up with some sort of mutually acceptable solution

facebook have recently introduced a new fluid setting for canvas width and height thus enabling canvas dimensions that exceed the normal 760px width 12th august 2011

7196939
post	get
as an aside it looks to me like you are mixing the get and post methods for invoking url requests

7196997
free	malloc
one very common cause of memory corruption is deallocating memory with the wrong routine especially on windows it s something of a tradition to redefine malloc and free on unix so unix systems often go out of their way to make sure it s possible to do that

7197003
folder	directory
and for those who wounder how i perform the directory searches is that im creating xmlhttprequests to folder and get a html version displaying all the folder and then do a simple pattern match for each folder level

7197020

in google-chrome and firefox they are correctly prompted to do so at that point

7197085
filtering	grouping
both ie7 and ie9 display the expected behavior where child elements are overlaid onto the parent element first and the whole composite grouping then has the filtering applied

7197085
children	parent
ie8 is also broken when the parent element is position relative and when the children are either absolute or relative

7197097
viewdidload	viewwillappear
same for anything you create in viewdidload or viewwillappear or elsewhere such as data models if you can recreate it easily later when the view loads again or when the object is needed then it should be released in viewdidload to reduce memory usage

7197098
jtree	jtable	invokelater	invokeandwait

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in recent versions of google-chrome safari firefox

7198103
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found that unless you want the css re-ordering or the multi-line which isn t yet implemented in firefox and google-chrome what you think you want to use display box and box-flex for you really want to use display table and display table-cell

7198103
google-chrome	firefox
but back to your actual question i found firefox and google-chrome display identically if you set a width in pixels but not if you set a width as a percentage

7198106
lxml	beautifulsoup
i use similar tricks in some production code where simple checks like if somevalue in htmlpage are much faster and more understandable than invoking beautifulsoup lxml or other ml libraries

7198123
width	height
the parent div would be of width height 200 or if you want to get fancy you could simply have the height width be 100 and use some fancy math in js to dynamically size the divs as the port moves

maven	m2e
the m2e developers appear to believe that any resources will affect a maven build even in the case where meta-inf services is a functional part albeit a resource

7198348
m2e	pom.xml
if you want to hack around it you can apparently encode a special m2e profile into your pom.xml files to make the m2e incremental build filter and copy resources sonatype m2e wiki

7198359
rss	feed
my app is a basic rss reader which displays the items in the table view and i want to use the uitabbar to select from 2 or 3 different rss feed refreshing the existing table view in the process not switching to a different table view

i also tried to load it directly using the install new software ui and that failed added a directory where the toy plugin is and the response is a dialog box pop-up no software site found at dir_name

7198493
pop-up	dialog
at the same time in the name list area box behind the pop-up it says could not find file dir_name the directory is valid and the jar file is there - the other attempts are to load the jar file directly selecting archive instead of local in the add repository dialog - that too fails first the jar name is mangled somewhat to jar file dir_name toy_name.jar

7198524

after you just have to extends jdbcdaosupport spring class in which contain the getter and setter of datasource on your dao class

7198536
put	get
put it all together and you get

7198543
put	get	post	get	post	put
from the perspective of a restful application like rails there are four relevant request types get post put and delete

7198543
post	put
new gives you a form to post create a new object and edit gives you a form to put update and existing one

7198543
post	get
the important basic thing to understand is that links by default are get requests and forms by default are post requests

7198543
post	get
where i wrote get in the examples above you can use any of the four verbs -- get is normally what you do if you want to show a page and post is normally what i d use if you re submitting a form

7198577
post	put
what i would recommend is to put the code that uses result_url inside a continuation call back and call it after you know that the last post request has completed

7198743
folder	directory
in my project there was a folder called .settings inside the actual project directory tree having files named org.eclipse.jdt.core etc

7198824
width	height
i will need to request the exact height needed based on how much width the component will receive during layout

7198824
width	height
for example if the component will receive enough width to contain all the text on one line then it will only request one line worth of height

7198824
width	height
but if it will only receive enough width to have the text fit on three lines then it will request a height which will allow for three lines of text

7198824
width	height
then once it s received the amount of width it is allowed to request the amount of height to fit the text on multiple lines if necessary

7198824
awt	swing
edit to clarify i d gladly use a jtextarea but the pbp doesn t have any swing and limited awt components

an and operation with the inverse of 2 n -1 can be seen as a division by 2 n a truncation and a multiplication by same

7199654
