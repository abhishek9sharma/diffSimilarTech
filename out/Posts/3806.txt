11049949
width	height
whereas when i used uikeyboardframebeginuserinfokey the width and height values were interchanged

11049957
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring will save some memory as nsstring objects are always constants

11049968
getter	setter
i could easily find the solution by implementing the applicationcontextaware interface which has the getter and setter method for context

11050027
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the other solution i provided isn t even perfect across all of the browsers with some combinations of font sizes because google-chrome opera round inexact values differently than firefox ie so even with my solution you d need to use some browser-specific css

nsmutablestring	nsstring
so the simple rule is that if you need to modify the string in any way use a nsmutablestring and if not nsstring

nsmutablestring	nsstring
you can also cast a nsmutablestring to a nsstring but not the other way around then you need to make a copy

11050145

post	get
when i print r.ok and r.request i get 200 ok so the post worked

11052285
post	get
when i remove the from data r.content returns a html error page that the search type is missing so i know that if something is wrong in the post i get an error

11052291
sudo	passwd
than you will be able to run sudo command without any passwd

11052301
fadein	fadeout
i think what you are looking for is to queue it so it runs fadeout - new queued - fadein

11052309
width	height
the way i am traing to make it works is by embeding a wmplayer object with 100 width and height and placing on the top of that layer another layer with a background and some php code to load the tweets

11052322
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if using apache putting rewrite rules into either the directory section of the httpd.conf file or into an .htaccess would probably be the easiest way to do this

11052367
folder	directory
i have an .net 3.5 application as a parent application and in the same folder i added a virtual directory which runs a .net 4.0 application

11052415
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven then add this dependency to your pom.xml here i m using jersey client v1.12

11052441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie

11052491
post	get
without timeline most of the distribution is likely lost as there s no aggregation units on timeline and news feed distribution of a single action is unlikely but your calls should definitely result in something appearing in your activity log and the post id you get back should be retrievable from the api to verify the details at action_id

11052505
int	chars
now the the situation is like this with the help of xml-rpc-c i can transfer chars and int but now i want to transfer some binary data

11052507
button	checkbox
this class can obviously be anything but in the example i m setting type to either 1 or 2 any object in the bound list that has a type of 1 is given a button to represent it and anything with a type 2 is given a checkbox to represent it

11052520
super	extends
here means that a extends someclass and you can use to express than b should be a super class of someclass

11052531
devise	cancan
im using devise cancan in my rails app

11052533
put	get
i feel that the html5 version will ensure good ranking but i wanted to put it to the community and get an opinion

11052539
codeigniter	yii
purely subjective answer but codeigniter and yii are pretty well known and support starting points

11052637
vbo	normals
the first fact i recognized is of course drawing images is much faster than imagelines beacuse of vbos but also i cannot pre-put vertex-data into a vbo for imagelines because imagelines have no static shape like normals images varying linelength varying linewidth and the vertex positions of x1 y1 and x2 y2 change too often

11052637
vbo	normals
that s why i use a normals floatbuffer instead of a vbo

11052642
post	get
we observe that browser is making a lots of get and post requests

11052642
post	get
can you please help me how can i get all the requests get post and responses

11052650
google-chrome	firefox
here is the code sample that works both on firefox and google-chrome

11052675
width	height
set the table to 100 width and height and set its text align and vertical align to middle

11052689
implements	extends
testgui extends frame which in turn implements serializable

11052776
width	height
i have requirement showing div as popup in my site i load the div with iframe the iframe has https content but the div is in http content i need adjust the iframe height but my script failed here due to the https content not able to call out side script which is increases the ifram width .it says permission denied error message

11052781
hide	show
so you can handle the show hide logic of your steps and for validation you could just do this

11052833
int	boolean	int	double
here s my current solution i ll create enumerations for each type of member variable i want to access one for double one for int one for strings one for boolean etc

11052835
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so i subscribed my parent view controller to uiapplicationdidbecomeactivenotification and re-execute manually the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods of the controller containing the uiimagepickercontroller

11052841
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but the result renders totally different in ie 9 vs opera firefox and google-chrome

11052873
textview	imageview
you could easily extend the view class and replicate this with two textview and an imageview

11052878
.htaccess	httpd.conf
basically you ll want something like this either in the section of httpd.conf or a local .htaccess

11052904
folder	directory
in unix you don t see the network directory because you need to use a protocol like samba to access folder over network

11052909
google-chrome	firefox
returns undefined in ie 9 but works in google-chrome and firefox

11052921
serializable	deserialization
if the number 1332856031313 is being serializable as 1.33286e+12 there is no way to get it back in the deserialization process

11052977
x86	64bit
there are very few things that intel amd don t want to continue supporting or already chose not to undocumented and duplicate instructions and some instructions and instruction encodings in 64bit mode but 64bit mode is not your normal x86 and for that reason is commonly referred to as x86 64 or x64

11052988
google-chrome	firefox
this seams to work on google-chrome and firefox but doesn t work as expected on ie

11052992
google-chrome	firefox
compare google-chrome to firefox note how the editor is apparently missing in firefox.

11053075
punctuation	words
lastword is of course defined as __block so we can set it inside the block and see it outside and it s initialized to nil so if the string has no words if it s empty or is all punctuation we don t crash when we try to use lastword

11053120
addclass	removeclass
in this case i d track what s been clicked with classes using the jquery addclass removeclass and toggleclass so once clicked you add the class clicked to the parent li element

11053121
highcharts	highstock
i have implemented the same with highcharts but when i looked at highstock compare i was pretty much impressed by the way it is doing

11053127
hash	salt
the database then re-encrypts it with the salt and compares the hash s

11053127
hash	salt
in this situation the salt needs to be passed from the database back to the web server for the hash to be created

11053127
hash	salt
should the web server be compromised salt and hash can be requested from the database and easily cracked

11053151
np-hard	np-complete
i was using backtracking algorithm so it explain a lot why it was so much faster with bitwise operation since sodoku is a np-complete maybe np-hard problem

11053158
min	max
by default the functions max and min do not count null in their evaluation of your data

11053175
devise	cancan
i ve been looking into cancan to run alongside devise but i m not sure if this is the answer

11053176
draggable	droppable
you could use the droppable s over and out methods to detect when the draggable was over it and then implement the grid parameter only at that point

11053202
qevent	qcoreapplication
call qcoreapplication sendpostedevents 0 qevent deferreddelete

11053202
qevent	qcoreapplication
call qcoreapplication sendpostedevents mpage qevent deferreddelete

11053225
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction of nodes links

11053225
infovis	sigma.js	d3.js	sigma.js	d3.js	infovis
i ve looked into many existing js frameworks including infovis jit dracula d3.js sigma.js etc

11053283
uiview	subviews
then when you have your two points you can add a new uiview as subviews which is aware of the two cgpoint and will draw a line in its drawrect method

11053298
for-loop	arrays
if it is a reference problem how do i get two hash tables in to different arrays elements withouot creating multiple hash tables i have to run the code inside a for-loop to add multiple hash tables.creating separate hash tables every time does not sound good

11053314
width	font-size
for the people curious to know why i need this very font and font-size it s because it is such that the width of any character and the width of a dash - are the same

11053324
oursql	mysql-python
if i use mysql-python instead of oursql it takes about 2 seconds

11053335
primefaces	richfaces
okay i m currently migrating a richfaces 3.3.3 jsf 1.2 project to mojarra 2.1.7 snapshot 20120206 and primefaces 3.3 which is imho revelation to jsf

11053367
folder	directory
the classpath determines where to find classes the working folder defines the starting directory of your application.

11053383
google-chrome	firefox
use something like firebug firefox addon ie development tools or google-chrome dev tools to find out the fonts used

11053388
sudoers	passwd
in order to use bin mount without a passwd i must add this line to sudoers

11053388
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if i give the passwd it accepts it and runs - so it must know which user is running it and allow the user to use sudo so it does honour part of sudoers but it doesn t honour the nopasswd keyword for bin mount

11053418
hash	salt
a salt is used to prevent a dictionary attack against hash passwords

11053418
hash	salt
furthermore proper randomly-generated salt prevent an attacker from knowing that you and i have the same password without the salt we d have the same hash

11053418
hash	salt
they are not public information but an attacker getting access to the salt values + the hash does not necessarily mean that the passwords have been compromised

11053483
hash	md5
sure it probably has md5 and sha1 but these are cryptographic hash functions

11053483
hash	salt
the hash and salt are never held in the application

11053483
hash	salt
in this case the hash and salt are pulled from the database into the application and the hashing of the raw password and comparison is done there

11053483
hash	salt
i would consider the raw password to be more sensitive than the hash and the salt together

11053484
rss	feed
i have a rss feed in an xml file at the root level

11053503
hide	show
i would also like to hide show some child elements of this div

11053549
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview and sqldatasource

11053550
getter	setter
in java i use getter setter when i have simple models pojos

11053550
getter	setter
problems rise when using languages where getter and setter start feeling clunky like in python and i often hear people saying that they are bad

11053560
post	get
a few searches yielded me these two blog post on how to get scite to print javascript test to its output rather than just opening a web browser when you press f5 to test the code

11053564
int	double
i get a compiler error that it can not choose between the number number and int double method.

11053588
ssl	socks
if i remember correctly ssl will work across http and socks proxies

11053590
sin	sqrt
you can probably implement constexpr sqrt or sin but they would have to use a recursive implementation that the compiler can evaluate at compile-time whereas at runtime these would be better implemented in one assembler operation

11053590
sin	sqrt
since constexpr uses of sqrt and sin are few and far apart its better to maximise runtime performance instead which requires a form that isn t constexpr able

11053627
away3d	papervision3d
that being said it s been a while since i ve touched the pv3d stuff but i remember i had to be very specific in how my collada geometry was written - the parser in papervision3d only reads a subset of the spec if it tried to read the full spec the parser would be enormous - part of why away3d does not support it

11053649
mouseleave	mouseenter
use .on mouseenter ... and .on mouseleave ... instead of .hover ... otherwise only the elements that aren t active on document ready will be targeted

11053683
getter	setter
whether you use getter and setter to access the defined attributes of a class is a little more fungible to me

11053683
getter	setter
and others by getter setter

11053689
innodb	myisam
if your table uses innodb engine no support for transactions with myisam transaction is the most efficient solution but also the most complex

11053690
post	get
for example in some cases after post or get request i want to redirect user not only to specific page but to a specific part of page

11053694
message-queue	messaging
we now have to provide a message-queue interface to the application for some high throughput internal messaging from c++ producers

11053703
width	height
i m not gonna edit off the position absolute portion as it might be helpful for those who are thinking of making a div inherit the window s height and width without the use of jquery

11053705
integer	unsigned
i imagine the methods would look similar to an unsigned integer divided by its maximum representable value

11053711
apache	lighttpd
not as simple as using something like apache or lighttpd in front but likely just as effective and allows you to keep everything within tomcat if that s really what you want

11053725
google-chrome	firefox
aside from api incompatibilities between at least two major browsers firefox and google-chrome the ie10 implementation has yet to be released to the public

11053737
versioning	upgrade
microsoft.net 4.5 is coming and i want to upgrade my clickonce app when ms releases the final versioning

11053793
int	double
the int double function doesn t match at all

11053793
int	double
convert 5 to an int and convert 1.2 to a double

11053793
int	double
leave 5 as a primitive int but convert 1.2 to a double

11053793
int	double
as an aside if you had a method that took int double there would be no ambiguity at all that method actually matches the existing types of 5 and 1.2 so it would be called

11053799
acs	adfs
2 other than some special knowledge around hooking up acs adfs i m not sure what seeking someone with azure experience will get you

11053799
put	get
people put all kinds of crap on their resumes just to get in the door hoping you won t notice

11053820
width	height
i m looking for an efficient algorithm that for a space with known height width and length given a fixed radius r and a list of points n with 3-dimensional coordinates in that space will find all the points within a fixed radius r of an arbitrary point on the grid

11053820
addition	multiplication
i thought this would offer a speedup as it only needs addition instead of multiplication but it actually slowed the program down by a little bit

11053822
post	get
i get how you do post and sending but little lost has to how to pull from that

11053846
portrait	landscape
if i start my device in portrait mode rotate to landscape mode and rotate back to portrait mode it prints 989 989 565

11053891
mef	prism
i m trying to build a wpf mvvm-based application with prism and mef not unity and i just can t get any decent examples on the web anywhere

11053898
opensuse	linux
i ve been assigned to develop a software on linux opensuse 11.4

11053975
allocator	stl
now in regard to the forward allocator point that anthony-arnold mentions all stl containers make promises about amortized operation time

11053993
int	chars
you can enumerate the chars of the string and use the character.isdigit method you can even intertwine the verification and the transformation into an int

11054009
put	get
however i cant put values in or get them out

11054017
cpu	affinity
the only way i know of for code to force a strong memory model would be to have each thread set its cpu affinity

11054017
cpu	affinity
if there were a way to set a process option so .net would only use one core at a time that might be useful especially if it meant that the jit could replace bus-locking interlocked operations with faster non-bus-locking equivalents but the only means i know of setting cpu affinity would limit a program to using a particular selected cpu for all its threads even if that cpu was heavily loaded by other applications and some other cpu was sitting idle

11054024
implements	extends
now if someone would be interested in implements that in pydev it d be a matter of extends the method getchildren from for the use-case where it s not a dir or zip-file to try to parse it and create the proper nodes

11054028
google-chrome	firefox
it is working in google-chrome but not in firefox

11054053
getter	setter
struts2 provides a clean way to put your request response data in valuestack and its ognl system provides a very clean way to access those data from the value stack.all you need to have a list in your action class with its getter and setter and at ui use build in struts2 tag to access those data.here is a simple code to accomplish this

11054079
opensuse	linux
of course other linux distributions have similar setups opensuse has obs

11054081
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work for me in ie7 in windows and google-chrome firefox though i haven t been able to test it in ie6

11054113
width	height
you need to set the width and height of the canvas in javascript too

11054126
matplotlib	colormap
colormap class in matplotlib has nice methods set_over and set_under which allow to set color to be used for out-of-range values on contour plot

11054128
puts	gets
when it gets to 5 the second if statement causes it to go to 4 then the first if statement puts it back to 5

11054171
getter	setter
it will at least let you nix all your getter and setter

11054185
opera	google-chrome
at least this did work for me when using icsÃ¢ default web browser google-chrome beta and opera mobile

11054206
swt	swing	awt	swing
the two obvious choices for a java app are awt swing java s standard gui frameworks or eclipse s swt rcp

11054206
awt	swing
if you re looking to stick with awt swing then eclipse also has tooling to help with that

11054208
min	max
i want to for each level of gene_id get the min start max end mean pctat mean pctgc and sum length

11054208
do.call	lapply
i tried using lapply and do.call for this but it s taking forever +30 minutes to run

11054223
justmock	typemock
will i have to end up using a mocking framework such as typemock or justmock

11054231
listview	gridview
the gridview listview expandablelistview gallery classes in android provide important optimizations that allow you to display long lists or grids of content without drawing the entire list at the same time

11054318
pop-up	dialog
i am developing a small app wherein a dialog must pop-up when the user touches anywhere on the screen and if the dialog is already being displayed then on clicking anywhere outside the dialog box it must disappear

11054320
portrait	landscape
i can rotate my phone and it switches to landscape but if i rotate my phone back to portrait the video rotates as well

11054353
post	get
sorry i just saw you re after post not get something like this should work

11054398
installation	upgrade
you might try logging the installation and reviewing the log file to see exactly what is happening during the install upgrade process

11054398
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade earlier versioning it would seem that the com interop components are not registered properly

11054398
installation	upgrade
i would log an installation that you know works without issue on a clean machine and then log an installation that you know will fail an upgrade and then compare the two log files using a tool to see if the output is identical

11054445
subtraction	addition
2 s complement makes sense because it can be used in natural addition and subtraction arithmetic without any need to change the bits

11054445
subtraction	addition
the bit number promotion and addition subtraction arithmetic is a bit mess with this notation

11054450
hide	show
nb - these variables are used else where in the script to perform some show hide behaviour so i am keen not to redefine elsewhere

11054542
client-side	server-side
the problem lies when the client-side validation is bypassed and fails on the server-side validation

11054560
maven	pom.xml
positive side effect when adding or updating a library dependency only one place maven pom.xml needs to be updated the rest can easily be regenerated

11054586
button	right-align
you probably found out by now but you have to add a uibarbuttonsystemitemflexiblespace to the left of your button to have it right-align

11054624
client-side	server-side
you need to separate your server-side and client-side code

11054645
range	minimum
you could use the numpy where function to replace values in a specified range to the overall maximum or minimum value and that would effectively whiten or blacken those values in your plot

11054678
setinterval	clearinterval
you can use setinterval capture the intervalid and use clearinterval to cancel the loop in a click handler on the div containing the rotating ads

11054701
ant	maven
ant and maven integration see second half

11054724
int	chars
if that uid only contained int values you d use int whereas if it was a 6-character alphanumeric value you d use chars 6

11054775
width	height
the density screen width height have not change

11054784
noscript	meta
so if you wrap your meta element in a noscript element it should only be parsed if javascript is disabled

11054785
button	checkbox
also i d like it to be a checkbox - the button s worked great but i m trying to keep the ui simple and i already have a lot of button i m trying to get rid of.

11054850
for-loop	loops
if you had a for-loop running then it would block your main thread until it has finished looping in the meanwhile if the connection finished while the for-loop is still running then your delegate code will not execute until after loops has finished

11054861
folder	directory
so in the . classification folder i m going to generate classification.so and thus to the other directory

11054870
post	get
also what http protocols will you be using for specific requests like get post etc

11054870
post	get
furthermore you will have to decide at what url s on the server will it be useful to get or post to depending on the data you want to send or receive

11054877
portrait	landscape
althought the device orientation was in landscape mode the interface turns always to the portrait mode

11055036
bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh you can simply -2 1

11055039
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do no let you click the radio button as the .shield is positioned over the top of it however ie9 and i assume older versions does even though developer tools shows .shield is correctly in place

11055041
filesystems	ntfs
you can preserve permission specials files across filesystems usefull when you backup your a ext folder to an ntfs filesystems

11055068
junit	easymock
i m getting some inexplicable behavior from easymock and a junit test case

11055068
junit	easymock
i m using easymock 3.1 to mock mycollaborator in a junit 4 test class that is testing classundertest

11055068
junit	easymock
i ve used easymock and junit extensively in the past in exactly this manner and have never run into anything like this before

11055123
hex	binary
if i understand correctly i would have to convert this array into string then into hex and then into a string of binary

11055214
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
in a qgraphicsscene i have a background set with a few qgraphicsitem s on top of it

11055243

11055258
tiff	bmp	tiff	png	bmp	png
i want to save it as one of 4 formats bmp jpeg png tiff

11055329
width	height
if i modify the meaureoverride so that i set height of rowdefinition s to minimum and width of columndefinition s to minimum then it works

11055329
width	height
but i saw some videos and they say you should not be explicitly setting height width properties of anything

11055332
min	max
to find the min or max value for a specific indexed column key_col

11055332
min	max
in this case mysql does a single key lookup for each min or max expression and replaces it with a constant

11055332
min	max
select min key_part2 max key_part2

11055332
min	max
note in particular that the where clause must refer to columns that occur before the column for which you wish to calculate the min or max which is why your current index is not used efficiently

11055357
hash	md5
but i haven t got no password neither md5 hash i have only md5 md5 pass+salt

11055370
min	max
to find the min or max value for a specific indexed column key_col

11055370
min	max
in this case mysql does a single key lookup for each min or max expression and replaces it with a constant

11055370
min	max
select min key_part2 max key_part2 from tbl_name where key_part1 10

11055372
portrait	landscape
so you are either having one view controller for a tab that returns no for all orientations or you are having conflicting orientations one view which only supports landscape and another that only supports portrait

11055383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if they do and their terminology includes the saving action for the editor on one side most scriptable document based apps do so in the form the page refreshing for the browser s on the other google-chrome has safari gets the same result via a javascript detour Ã¢ i donÃ¢ t use firefox you are set

11055423
post	get
while i still cannot get it still does not work via the -sslv3 flag with curl this post saved the day

11055460
post	get
the value of foo.bar in the get and post method is but i am expecting string test

11055495
kerberos	ntlm
note if you re using ntlm and not kerberos or another delegatable protocol it will not work as the middle server the iis server needs to have a token that it can pass along

11055509
hash	md5
i store close to 2 million images that are stored in a simple folder structure xx yy filename where filename md5 of file + optional number should a hash collision happen xx first 2 characters of md5 yy 3rd and 4th character of md5

11055517
integer	unsigned
it generates an unsigned integer seed on program startup and then produces a 256 uint array based on that seed

11055519
int	double
currently only int are supported but i would like to add support for double too

11055602
src	attr
html not used script scr + ipt attr src src .html added processing script

google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine with firefox and windows explorer but issues arise with google-chrome and ie haven t tried any other browsers just yet

11055965
google-chrome	firefox
looking at the output it seems that firefox actually saves the image to the clipboard whereas google-chrome is just grabbing the html of the image while ie doesn t do anything with it

11055965
google-chrome	firefox
a couple of workarounds i ve found are to parse the html google-chrome firefox for an image source then download from the source using something like the webclient object

11055986
imagemagick	im4java
under the hood we will be using imagemagick and its java adaptor library im4java

so anyway a class boyjumpstate would obviously need to extends implements this class interface to ensure that the public methods are there for interaction however this is hindered by the fact that actionscript will not allow me to extends with say this

11056400
implements	extends
i m figuring my original interface is the problem and that i should be specifying that the parameter should instead extends pawn and not actually need to be one however i m not seeing any way to implements this in actionscript

11056403
int	double
the simple answer would be to define an variant type that can hold ether int s or double s

11057369
int	boolean	int	double	int	chars
to add to michael s answer the reason why you should not use for string comparison hopefully this will help you navigate similar difficulties in the future is that when you call a simple on an object such as a string or really anything other than an int double float chars long short or boolean in most languages what you re really comparing is the address in memory of each object that is the pointer value

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
i ve fiddled with this for days comparing google-chrome with firefox mostly

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome agree about the left and bottom but they do not agree about the top nor the right of the parent container

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has an extra column or two of pixels on the right when compared to google-chrome

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
it also appears when you put a border around the foo span that firefox moves the text up a pixel when compared to google-chrome

11058260
google-chrome	firefox
the descenders in firefox do not touch the border while they do or very nearly do in google-chrome

google-chrome	firefox	fontfamily	font-size
after adding font-size and fontfamily i still see a difference between firefox and google-chrome

11058368
width	height
you need to calculate the frame after you call sizetofit to make sure it is placed in the right spot after it changes the labels width and height

11058368
width	height
you subtract the width of the label from the width of the superview plus its x origin and do the same on the y axis with the height

11058380

11058892
width	margin
since the .arrow element has a default width of 100 setting margin 0 auto has no effect horizontally

11058892
width	margin
you need to either set an explicit width on the .arrow element or set display block and margin 0 auto on the img element

11058992
width	height
set a width and height to your image

11058992

11059575
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
the listeners that i use are mousedown mouseup mousemove

11059587
width	height
but rather than set the child object s width height directly you should use one of the flex lifecycle methods setactualsize or setlayoutboundssize

11059587
width	height
when you set a flex component s width height the component will invalidate itself so that on the next update cycle it can be re-rendered

11059587
width	height
the setactualsize and setlayoutboundssize methods set the width height on a flex component but do not invalidate the component

11059587
width	height
it will most certainly execute less code than if you set width height properties directly

dividing a double by an int will result in a double value

11059750
min	max
the code works regardless of min letter or max letter it has the same output it gives the same output

11059750
min	max
again using min or max on letter doesn t matter as long as your keep dense_rank get the prioritized preferred row

11059783

if you need only 2 decimal places you can multiply your double by 100 convert it to an int and then divide it by i

you can make certain attributes readonly writable via specific getter setter options keep count of how many times it s accessed and whatever else you can think of

11059917

you can use any existing restful php mvc framework like yii or kohana both are very light and natively support restful applications

flac	ogg
this is pretty easy with the two examples above but a file named .flac could be either an ogg flac or a raw flac and could have vorbiscomment metaflac id3 or ape tags. taglib has stuff to help there as well but it s still not trivial

11060064
min	max	range	min	range	max
well the days of the week are fixed so day range max and day range min refer to the days of the month and day of the week is just figured out..

11060070
width	height
landscape because the width and height parameters passed to sublayout will already reflect that

11060084
width	height
its width and height is the same of the view that is using it

11060084
width	height
then if this view has no width and height it ll have no width and height too

11060084
width	height
basically i think that your imageview has no width and height then it s invisible

11060090
fish	bash
my actual solution is to reset bash as the main shell and always run fish to use it

11060091
hash	salt
so far i ve included a createnewuser class that prohibits duplicate user names checks new passwords for specific formatting requirements salt and hash it and saves it to an accounts table with the username email address and an auto-incremented user id

11060168
width	height
you need to set an explicit width and height on the canvas

11060168
width	height
the default dimensions of a canvas are a width of 300 and a height of 150 see the spec here

11060168
width	height
by setting the width and height via css you are just stretching the canvas

11060168
width	height
or set the width height via javascript

versioning	upgrade
so i updated the versioning of spring-data-neo4j to 2.1.0.build-snapshot upgrade neo4j versioning to 1.7 also

11060240
versioning	upgrade
i think you may have some problems if you change from python 2.6 to 2.7 or 2.7 to 3.x but if you just upgrade inside the same versioning staying at 2.7 as you want you shouldn t have any problem as all the packages are held in the same folders for both python versioning 2.7.x and 2.7.y packages are inside your_env lib python2.7

hash	salt
if you are trying to derive the original algorithm that generated the hash of a giving set of values and hash you could try mainstream algorithms and see if you get any hits if not it maybe impossible or simply take to much time to find the most common homegrown algorithms tend to be a combination of a world wide salt + unique random salt + multiple iterations of a common hashing function sha256

generally it shouldn t matter if it was get or post response is returned from server the only thing you need to do is catch it and perform actions based on response content

so in short why do i have to use the -operand when calling the enter_path function and can t define enter_path as int enter_path chars path

11063154
macports	homebrew
probably the biggest gotcha is that everything has to be compiled 32 bit which means passing -arch i386 everywhere so you can t just install dependant libs using homebrew or macports

11063165
int	chars
think of the pointer as your data just like with int etc. by passing a pointer you can modify the pointed-to chars

when you click on the resultset table header in toad or mysql-workbench you actually telling mysql to order on max timestamp making things work fine

11063528

webclient	httpwebrequest
using microsoft s webclient or httpwebrequest objects have known bottlenecks that limit the number of requests that can be made asynchronously through multithreading

11063585
children	parent
bouncing back and forth between parent and children to set different css makes little sense

11063585
children	parent
just combine the css properties for parent and properties for children and only make one css call for each

11063585
children	parent
i suspect you are expecting the italic only on the text in the parent in which case it will be now obvious that you would need to set children to normal font as well

i don t know cdi but in ejb each stateless and stateful session bean is pooled which means you cannot really call method of the same ejb from multiple threads in the same time

11063714

that being said injecting entitymanager is safe at least into stateless and stateful session beans

11063766

searching first for the full set of keywords naturally without punctuation and similar then searching for the same set of keywords with stemming applied then searching for the same set but with stop words stripped and finally searching for this same stripped subset with stemming applied seems to give a reasonable approximation from best to worst

redhat	fedora
2 i dont know about amazon but this error was common in older versions of linux distros from redhat and fedora

11064609
width	height
it has something to do with the width to height ratio

11064609

in fact the gap doesn t appear at all when width is greater than height only when height is greater than width

11064631
filtering	grouping
afaik this is not possible you can t both grouping on one column employee and filtering the entire table on a different column

11064631
sorting	grouping
grouping on employee create a running sum and forget about sorting in ssrs

11064639
opera	firefox
alternatively and more simply just create elements as children of the polygon shape elements and put the multiline text directly within that and the tooltips will be shown by most uas as multiline tooltips it certainly works in firefox and opera

11064648
rss	feed
you just have to provide dynamic rss feed

11064686
std	ostream
there are quite a few things that inherit from it meaning they are std ostream s as well and so this works with them too

11064726
width	height
after experimenting i found that the size of the gradient must be related to the standard width and standard height of the pathshape when it is created and has nothing to do with the height and width of the shapedrawable

11064726
width	height
this means you must keep track of the standard width height you assign to your pathshape for the entire life of the shapedrawable in the event it is ever resized

11064739
implements	extends
all you need is to implements the callback api in the class that extends imycallback

typedef	struct
the modulated output is generated in the fprm of a typedef struct which is a consists of two float variables real and imaginary parts since the modulated data is a complex baseband signal

11064965
children	parent
with a tree each parent node could store the total rle length of its children so insertions can be done without having to recalculate the rle length of the total structure and retreival would be just as fast

11064973
hide	show
ok so first you want to hide something and show your ajax loader

11064973

emacs	gedit
lastly add source home chad .local share dolfin dolfin.conf to .bashrc using gedit or emacs if you want to use a powerful text editor

11065099
boost	stl
i think this is because boost libraries depend on stl but don t have it statically compiled in so it needs to be mentioned explicitly like that

11065114
width	height
i also see from reading around here that #wrapper should have fixed dimensions so assuming fixed height and width

11065136
quicksort	shellsort
do your own benchmark but i can tell you will have better results with insertion sort than with shellsort or quicksort

11065192

however i can open a browser clear all cookies for the host site in fact a rarely-used browser which i ve never used for visiting the host site and use the same rss uri and the expected rss feed is received

11065528
nsmenu	nsresponder
nsmenu does not derive from nsresponder so it is not possible to detect it by overriding one of the mouse methods

11065564
int	chars
you should be able to use system.convert.tochar to convert an int to a chars value

11065574

google-chrome	safari
the webkit engine just implemented first css variable rules so cutting edge versions of google-chrome and safari are already to work with them

11065584
google-chrome	safari
see the official webkit google-chrome safari development log with a onsite css browser demo

11065589

11065837
width	height
initialize your array in onsurfacechange by using height and width of onsurfacechange function

11065839
width	height
for this you have to create a two layout inside one main linear layout and give layout width and height both fill parent

11065866
uiview	subviews
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards

11065871
median	minimum	range	median	range	minimum
they are generally used to do range minimum maximum and range sum queries but you can change it to do range median

11065871
range	median
example of median in range segment tree

11065871
range	median
a query for median for range indices of 4-6 would go down this path of values

11065871
range	median
doing a search for the median you know the number of total elements in the query 3 and the median in that range would be the 2nd element index 5

11065871
range	median
doing a search of the median of the range 3-6 is a bit more complicated because you have to search for two indices 4 5 which happen to lie in the same node

11065871
range	minimum
range minimum query on segment tree

11065885
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
variables allocated via malloc last until explicitly free d or the space is reduced via realloc etc

11065909
post	get
parse the get post list of foods that was sent via ajax by index

11065931
free	malloc
every malloc in c needs to have some corresponding free which is reachable before termination

folder	directory
many windows apis and applications accept as a directory folder separator although some require a backslash instead

i need to it be mousedown rather than click which is more like mouseup because of the effect i m trying to achieve

wordpress	joomla
..without a popular platform such as wordpress or joomla etc. that allows you to integrate with it and everyone who is integrated with it to use your plugin there is no other way but custom integration with custom communications

11066206
hive	hdfs
just leave the data sitting hdfs hive tables and run mapreduce jobs on them then load the data to hbase tables pre-prepared so that you can do super fast random reads from it

11066208
i2c	spi
for 30 it seems like a no-brainer especially since it supports more than just jtag spi i2c etc.

11066346
google-chrome	firefox
i get the same results using these browsers ie8 google-chrome firefox

11066350
width	height
the images are actually pulled into the div as a background that covers 100 width and height of the div -and then the div s obviously control the aspect and size.

11066350
width	height
my thoughts would be to set the width based on the percentage of the page - but then i m not sure how i would set the height and keep the correct aspect ratio due to different resolutions etc...

11066371
inherited	properties
the constructor s associated prototype can be referenced by the program expression constructor.prototype and properties added to an object s prototype are shared through inherited by all objects sharing the prototype

11066414
post	put	post	get	put	get
if you need more powerful mappings you can use regular expressions in the first parameter of app. get post put del to filter for specific paths instead

11066441
put	get
put those back together and you get #dd0806

11066459
put	get
i know that node.js operates as a giant event-queue all http requests and their callbacks get put into that queue together with some other events

11066497
draggable	droppable
i want to have several classes of draggable each one corresponding to a class of droppable

11066497
draggable	droppable
but in addition i want to have a separate waste bin where all the draggable can be dropped until a suitable droppable can be found for them

11066497
draggable	droppable
however i may have up to 20 classes each one with 30-40 draggable droppable

11066497
draggable	droppable
so if i use an accept function for this the moment i pick up a draggable my chrome freezes as it runs tests for every droppable on the screen

11066510
hide	show
how do i perform show hide of the tr s by clicking the corresponding visible rows

11066510
hide	show
i have seen examples where one row next one is removed but how do i show hide tr within the parent table of the visible row and hide all child row not in 1 st positon

11066527
width	margin
it is based on the fact that vertical padding margin use the width of the parent box when it is set to percentages so it is possible to resize a div relative its parent box

11066544
put	get
you can make get put and getrandom all be o 1 average time

11066563
put	get
i know that node.js operates as a giant event-queue all http requests and their callbacks get put into that queue together with some other events

11066585
width	height
here ive used padding-bottom to maintain its height relative to its width

11066596
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
what you have to do is change the method from viewdidappear to viewwillappear

11066601
textview	imageview
i am trying to display an imageview with 4 textview

11066656
postgresql	mysql
historically sqlite3 doesn t perform as well as mysql or postgresql for large datasets which is the reason i recommend switching

11066686
disk	ram
for 1000 simultaneous calls i think the most concern would be to have a fast enough disk system and enough ram for i o cache

11066691
google-chrome	firefox
but it seems to work fine in firefox google-chrome and ie9

11066697

in google-chrome firefox and opera this works fine

11066724
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this all works with firefox and google-chrome and opera

11066759
min	max
you can eliminate those by removing the two select statements and insert the min max values directly into your temp table instead

11066798
decoder	encoder
you are trying to use the divx codec on a platform that has neither a native encoder nor decoder for it

11066815
uilabel	uibutton
should also work but is probably overkill as it will affect all uilabel not just the ones contained in uibutton .

11066884
public	protected
again it could and probably should be a different implementation for different language plugins - in php you work with classes methods and variables and have to care about visibility private public protected

11066886
folder	directory
i moved the css to one directory above my application folder

11066888
int	boolean	int	double
when it is allocated on stack only reference counted variables are initialized others kind of variable like int or double or boolean or enumerations are in a random state probably non zero

11066893
voip	sip
there are hundreds of voip providers which sell you an us number for a few bucks per month and the incoming calls would be delivered to you via sip

11066925
addition	multiplication
i could use a two dimensional array but a complete matrix library with multiplication addition etc. would be much more convenient

11066933
nsstring	nsdata
from memory which means you should go look it up in the docs it s nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdata nsnumber and.

11066934
asterisk	freeswitch
there are already lots of rtp media proxy solutions kamailio freeswitch asterisk and some other open-source projects

11066935
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
right now i m using avfoundation but have started reading the docs for core audio and there s also audiotoolbox

11066942
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
the library covers the usual basic linear algebra operations on vectors and matrices reductions like different norms addition and subtraction of vectors and matrices and multiplication with a scalar inner and outer products of vectors matrix vector and matrix matrix products and triangular solver

11066943
mouse	keyboard
i m getting raw data from both the keyboard and the mouse - the keyboard data is being received to my application perfectly i m having no trouble at all

11066952
portrait	landscape
i ve got the images to float left and line up quite nicely within my div but i would like the images to align vertically as some are portrait and others are landscape

11066965
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian the log files end up under var log apache2 .

11066983
portrait	landscape
most of the app is locked to portrait mode but one section makes sense to be in landscape

11066983
portrait	landscape
currently is looks ugly as the status bar just switches to the top of the landscape view and shows a little black bar on the portrait one as it slides in

11066995
stdout	stderr
i also redirected the output from stderr to stdout so it could be processed in the pipe by perl

11067032
coalesce	isnull
i always considered isnull and coalesce to be equivalent except for the number of possible parameters

11067195
width	height	portrait	landscape
do they all have the same width same height or a certain size depending on whether it s a landscape or portrait image

11067231
subscript	superscript
basic formatting such as size bold italic strikeout subscript and superscript

11067248
quicksort	mergesort
in cases where there are a small number of values bucket sort can be much faster than the more commonly used quicksort or mergesort

11067264
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
objectoutputstream accepts a fileoutputstream as argument which can append to a file

11067288
width	height
width and height are overruled if the overflow isnt set to none or scroll

11067288
width	height
the browser will use your width and height as starting point not end point

11067312
folder	directory
my static folder is in project with 2 directory like so

11067318
button	checkbox
i m implementing a php 5.4.4 class for including class definitions in a dynamic fashion for html rendering so if i have a form with two button four text inputs and a checkbox i just include the .php files corresponding to a form a textbox and a button and not anything else each html object is represented with a class

11067326
google-chrome	firefox
the image map loads in google-chrome but for some reason it doesn t display in firefox

11067335
post	get
but you must consider on how to add the parent id on the table how to get the parent post child post data out from database how to design the rewrite rules for child post etc

11067343
addition	multiplication
for example integers along with the operations of addition negation and multiplication form a ring

11067360
setinterval	settimeout
i used setinterval instead of settimeout for reasons given here

11067389
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
startswith is case-sensitive if you want to use case-insensitive use istartswith

11067397
postgresql	mysql
alternatively databases like mysql postgresql and others allow you to use regular expressions as well but that s more costly in terms of processing power

11067412
cpu	processors
the graphics card has a special purpose processors or often more than one so the compiler takes the input in the shader language and turns it into the assembly language for that processors much like a c compiler does for the cpu

11067413
width	height
the image is height 60px and width 30px

11067414
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is being nice by ignoring your error the # in the name attribute firefox is being nice by forcing you to stick to the specification rather than trying to guess what you mean

11067448
3des	aes
desfire offers aes and 3des for maximum flexibility with encrypted maced or plain communication your choice

11067472
opera	firefox
firefox internet explorer opera accept following code

11067481
onresume	onpause
step #2 have your activity register a broadcastreceiver with localbroadcastmanager in onresume and unregister it in onpause

11067482
mouseup	mousedown
i think the problem was that when the native drag event that dragged the image was fired on mousedown it was preventing the mouseup event to be fired

11067500
stateless	stateful
since http essentially works over tcp ip which is stateless hence http is stateless but when i switched to https my api became stateful

11067557
google-chrome	firefox
which seems to work just fine in google-chrome and firefox what i have access to

11067618
serializable	deserialization
however the classnotfoundexception was a result of incorrect serializable deserialization of the enum type

11067665
config	ini
working view helper ini config

11067665
config	ini
non-working action helper ini config

11067688
ssl	https
strictly speaking https is not a separate protocol but refers to use of ordinary http over an encrypted ssl tls connection

11067688
udp	tcp
and the http protocol is stateless by design not because it is used most frequently over tcp ip nothing stops you to use http over udp for example

11067700
post	get
i went through numerous post to figure out ideal setup inputs settings to get pass initial login screen but i had no luck

11067711
momentjs	datejs
i d like to recommend momentjs - a very lightweight yet surprisingly capable datejs library

11067714
addition	multiplication
since strings and any other reference types are stored in arrays as references finding the right element of the array requires one multiplication one addition and following one pointer the notion of a pointer here is at the implementation level not the programmer-visible level

11067730
gif	png	gif	ico	png	ico
the icon needs to be in ico format for it to work gif or png do not work

11067738
post	get
change get - post

11067817
portrait	landscape
i designed the application so in portrait mode it is two activities the chooser and the details while in landscape left is chooser right is details on a tablet

11067838
post	get
facebook has a bug making get behave differently than post

11067838
post	get
if you re experiencing the same problem i am and using a get switch to a post and it should work

11067858
put	get
i ve already created a headercontroller and a applications views scripts headers index.phtml - all i m trying to do is get that data and put it in my layout by default

11067865
gtk	cairo
for graphs cairo will be enough it s the library used by gtk for drawing

11067865
gtk	clutter
you may also use gtk and clutter

11067875
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if your app is just a url it would then be picked up by whatever browser is setup to listen to urls like the stock browser google-chrome firefox opera dolphin or whatever

11067879
ddms	adb
usb debugging enabled connected to win7 x64 - adb devices would not find the tablet nor would ddms which i need for screenshots don t want to root the tablet

11067881
onresume	onpause
i m observing in my code that if i don t call onpause and onresume then the context is not lost when i press the home button so i can switch between applications and then go back to my game and everything is working

11067881
onresume	onpause
if i don t call onpause and onresume can i assume that it will never be destroyed

11067885
hackage	hakyll
now hakyll starts reinstalling pandoc and gets the new version from hackage i guess thereby overriding the local changes that i made in pandoc

11067897
mouseup	mousedown
here s a demo that will alter the style values with mouseup mousedown

11067898
google-chrome	safari
the above code works for at least the safari and google-chrome desktop browsers but doesnt work for mobile devices

11067900
google-chrome	firefox
if you have google-chrome you ve probably used the inspector if you don t firefox has similar addons so you can use something like firebug

11067907
width	height
this point is going to change it position randomly but thats not the point so lets assume that it has its own velocity and its moving on plane with restricted width and height

11067939
writetofile	nsdata
i m saving some nsdata with writetofile atomically and then want to use that file very shortly afterwards

11067958
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
so all you need is to create a uiviewcontroller which implements shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation and sets this controller as a rootviewcontroller to your uiwindow

11068013
prepare	execute
you create an sql statement to prepare in our case since the create database statement will not work with a variable and then you just execute it

11068014
qtreewidget	qtablewidget
qtablewidget items are editable by default qtreewidget items are not

11068032
post	get
i hope to get an answer before i m done but if not i ll post the code

11068033
portrait	landscape
you ll need to have two separate layouts one in a layout-port for portrait and one in layout-land for landscape

11068056
free	malloc
of course there is a memory leak for every call to malloc there sould be a corresponding call to free in your program

11068056
free	malloc
in your program malloc is called several times but there is only one call to free

11068067
margin	height
the best i could think of is to use jquery to get and set the container height and then set the margin according to the height

11068070
width	height
when you set your width and height in the extended textview the view hasn t been measured yet

11068070
width	height
its width and height are zero

11068070
width	height
override onmeasure in your extended textview and set your width and height there

11068076
post	get
i am trying to post and get a cookie

11068097
chunked	transfer-encoding
you can see here that an http response can either contain content-length or transfer-encoding chunked

11068097
chunked	transfer-encoding
however when transfer-encoding chunked is used in the header after the headers you ll get a hexadecimal string which if converted to decimal will give you the length of the next chunk

11068102
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything looks good in the latest google-chrome and firefox browsers however in safari it is fairly choppy

11068104
free	malloc
you have to call free for every malloc call you have done

11068104
realloc	malloc
also to store the characters in a continuous buffer you have to malloc an amount of memory at the beginning and use realloc if the characters you read become more than those initially allocated memory for

11068128
autocomplete	omnicomplete
after literally days of tweaking i think i got vim s autocomplete omnicomplete + acp plugin to work acceptably

11068138
google-chrome	safari
play with it google-chrome or safari with this jsfiddle

11068139
xfs	ntfs	xfs	btrfs
is there a book explaining the design of fat32 ntfs reiserfs ext2 ext3 ext4 zfs xfs btrfs .

11068150
width	margin
horizontally centering a block-level element like a div simply requires specifying a width and setting the horizontal margin to auto

11068180
width	height
the view will not be measured again and its width and height will remain the same

11068180
width	height
you can call requestlayout on the view to get the width and height recalculated

11068185
ubuntu	linux
this problem only occurs on ubuntu 12.04 lts ghci 7.4.1 when i tried this on windows haskell platform and other linux machines i worked

11068216
button	checkbox
as shown in this table on quirks mode the change event on radio button and checkbox is quite buggy in ie7 and ie8

11068220
portrait	landscape
in particular if you do not use different resources for landscape and portrait then the second method handling the configuration change yourself may work well

11068236
superclass	subclassing
creating a subclassing that creates a new tostring is impossible since they made all of the members private in their superclass

11068239
post	get
it is perfectly viable to use post and get inside a class method

11068244
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in safari and firefox google-chrome for mac and firefox for pc

11068251
google-chrome	firefox
latest firefox seems to be unable to inject google-chrome urls into the host page unlees the corresponding resource has additional contentaccesible manifest attribute

11068255
nsstring	nsdata
the object types are nsstring nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsarray or nsdictionary objects

11068267
hash	md5
generate a uid as a md5 or similar hash of the user s account name and the machine s mac address

11068271

then you put the db in your assets folder and copy it to your apps data directory on startup

11068322
folder	directory
here is a list of files and folder that showed up in my installation directory only after the directory was given ownership by and the program was run

11068326
subtract	add
the compiler may rearrange that and do a single subtract rather than negate add negate which reverses the direction of rounding

clang	llvm
i have gcc 4.1.2 and like to build clang llvm using this gcc compiler version ony

11068393
clang	llvm
initially i faced issues regarding usr lib64 libstdc++.so.6 version glibcxx_3.4.9 not found during llvm clang make

11068393
clang	llvm
i am not sure for which purpose compiler-rt module is required but it seems llvm and clang has compiled well

11068393
clang	llvm
build llvm and clang only

11068393
clang	llvm
is it right to set my shared library path to use libstdc++.so.6 of gcc 4.5.0 and is compiler-rt is a madatory step to download and build it with clang llvm

11068396
fink	macports
fink same problems as macports

11068396
macports	homebrew
immediately when you want use some perl-dependent software you will must compile them itself and sometimes they will not compile - so you need the patched version for osx so start uses macports or homebrew and .

11068398
children	parent
this also has problems in that the role changes depending on who is asking - by definition a male_grandparent of his grandchildren is also a male_parent of his children who is also a child of his parent

11068398
children	parent
this gives a much simpler structure without the point-of-view contradictions but still results in problems evaluating further relationships because a given person s links only go up - a given person knows who their parent were but can t identify their children

11068398
children	parent
instead you can make each relationship two-way - each parent has a list of all their children and each child has a list of all their parent

11068436
for-loop	arrays
and then have my mouse check if it is clicking one of the items in the arrays using a for-loop

11068450
int	chars
the main problem is to translate string bunch of chars to int

11068461
put	get
a simple question i hope the binary package defines two types get and put

11068461
put	get
both state and writer have reasonable monadfix instances so i d expect that get and put also would

11068471
put	get
if you pass bardel to another function or return it you ll get a closure unless the function it s passed to takes the delegate by scope in which case that function guarantees that the delegate will not escape its scope because that state needs to be put on the heap so that it continues to exist even if the function call that its state comes from has completed when it s called

11068498
iboutlet	ibaction
i was able to connect my ibaction and iboutlet easily but this is proving trickier

11068501
folder	directory
iÃ¢ m finding models and helpers load fine from the shared directory however iÃ¢ ve added a config folder with database.php and this doesnÃ¢ t get loaded

11068505
blaze-html	hakyll
i realized that by default pandoc builds with an old version of blaze-html while hakyll requires blaze-html 1.5

11068512
folder	directory
that is the directory containing the fitness folder so you can import the module without any problem

11068513
put	get
but if you only put one index between the brackets you get the same result

11068520
draggable	droppable
internally jquery ui will run the following code whenever you start dragging a draggable to determine which droppable s are eligible to receive the draggable

11068520
draggable	droppable
jquery ui does not support adding multiple scopes to individual draggable droppable elements but you could roll that functionality on your own

11068524
post	get
i can use all the resources fine authentication get post calls to retrieve and send simple text data etc no problems there

11068524
post	put
for one part they have a non-oauth api through which you can also send a file in plain binary simply pass some params in the url and put the entire binary file in the post

11068531
post	get
as it stands this doesn t work - if won t post the data but rather sends a get request

11068623
folder	directory
as i suspected the using of recursion makes the code to crash when the hierarchy tree is too large i ve tried with 400 directory and it failed so i guess that after something like 50 folder one inside to other the overhead of the recursion makes the code to crash

11068637
inherited	subclassing
now i want to write a number of subclassing that inherited the protected fields and only differ based on the initial values that are assigned to those fields - for example if i wrote two subclassing b and c the only difference between those two subclassing would be that the values key and dmg would have different values

11068643
inherited	subclassing
this is not a place where you should be subclassing and in fact is a gross over-use of inherited

11068668
getter	setter
if i instantiate an instance of city i can see any public getter setter perfectly fine

11068677
hide	show
the callback of hide show in jquery does fire even if the function itself didn t do its thing due to the parent elements

11068677
hide	show
using the above method with jquery the elements will hide regardless if they are in a hidden parent element or not while also performing the usual smooth transition if they are show

11068694
ienumerable	ienumerator
however implementing ienumerable will automatically get you the entire set of linq methods on the enumerable class almost for free -- you only have to implement getenumerator and an ienumerator class

11068699
button	checkbox
i started using button but i switched to checkbox because the state of the box is easier to find out than a button

11068729
post	get
i want to get a set of tag counts for the post that the user has tagged but the method doesn t seem to be available

11068729
post	get
for a standalone post i can use post.tag_counts_on thoughts to get a tag cloud for the context of thoughts

11068776
superclass	subclassing
on the other hand the subclassing itself can call the overridden version of the method in its superclass

11068815
int	chars
the problem is that characteratindex seems to send an int and not a chars

11068824
updatepanel	ascx
the whole listview is part of an user control it s on a ascx file and the control is inside a master-page layout i m referring to the jquery library from the master page and the listview is inside an updatepanel

11068862
google-chrome	firefox
i found out that this tags work on ie8 firefox 11 and google-chrome but not sure whether this is valid by standards and work on all major browsers

11068907
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior has been tested on both firefox and google-chrome

11068929
post	put
it takes care of deducing whether to use post or put for a model object

11068935
post	put

the reason it is less common to extends thread is because then the class can t extends anything else and if you re only overriding the run method then it would be kinda pointless to extends thread and not implements runnable

onclick	onmouseup
but if you reset this to false directly from onmouseup you will not be dragging any more when you receive your onclick event because onmouseup fires before onclick does

11074515

11075611
children	parent
when you change the state to modified it affects only the parent entity the children are still in state unchanged

11075667
implements	extends
you have to extends scritableobject class to implements load and print function

11075672
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested it with google-chrome 18 and firefox 13 and can confirm that it works with firefox but i didn t have success with -webkit-selection on google-chrome it ignored it and according to this so question it doesn t exist and the answer says that selection should also work on all browser but doesn t for me too

11075820
maven	pom.xml
also recheck your maven pom.xml file so that you are not missing any other spring library like spring-web spring-webmvc you may have these since the dispatcherservlet class if found spring-orm if you use an orm like hibernate spring-jms if you use jms etc

11084480

that s what radio button are meant for not checkbox

11084500
udp	tcp
in your case i d use tcp unless you actually have hands-on experience with fragmenting and re-assembling udp packets manually and you re willing to maintain the overhead introduced in your code like having a re-assembling buffer and controlling the latency that this implies

11084500
lan	localhost	wan	lan
is it localhost only a lan a wan or even the internet

11084500
udp	mtu
as a rule of thumb udp is great when all data necessary for an instant defined below fits in one packet mtu is guaranteed to be 1280 in ipv6

11084500
udp	tcp
udp will outperform tcp substantially if the nature of the network is stable and remains stable

11084500
udp	tcp
but on the same note udp will not win when the network segments are very far apart and qos is used in some of the intermediate segments qos that is configured to favour more or less known tcp services over other stuff

either return-value-optimization or nrvo happens i am happy

11088029
stdout	stderr
with you are redirecting the error messages from stderr to stdout

11088029
stdout	stderr
without this redirection your error messages to stderr would have continued to go to the console creating clutter in the output and only stdout was getting processed by the pipes

11088029
stdout	stderr
based on use of the tcsh sometimes i think i m the only one using it it is possible to redirect stderr to stdout with the following construct

11088039
floating-point	integer
unlike the integers int32 byte uint64 etc where each value is easily determined from the status of each bit in the integer s bytes there is no intuitive representation of a floating-point number in binary so the ieee defined a specification for floating point numbers ieee-754

mef	prism
i ve seen some postings about mef prism and the event aggregate but it appears fairly complex

11088239
return-value-optimization	nrvo
in this case since the return value has a name f it would be nrvo named return-value-optimization that would apply

11088239
return-value-optimization	nrvo
so the technical answer based only on wording is that the absence of return-value-optimization won t prevent copy elision since nrvo could still allow it

11088259
int	chars
anyway this code works fine for finding int chars and text categories but completely fails on datetime and decimal categories

in any case you can see how the unit type is used in different languages as in haskell unit in ml unit in scala and tt Ã¢Å¡ in agda

11088793
haskell	agda
in languages like haskell and agda with the io monad functions like putstrln should have a type string Ã¢ io Ã¢Å¡ not the string Ã¢ io Ã¢Å¡ since this is an absurd logically it states that there is no strings that can be printed this is just not right

so after extensive research and tons of jquery and javascript solutions i simply could not find a way in which to dynamically scale images to a specified size both horizontally and vertically i found tons of information on scaling to fit width wise and keep the aspect ratio or scaling to fit height wise and keep the aspect ratio but couldn t figure out whether the image was too tall or too short and adjust accordingly

11089640
width	height
so in my example i had a with a set width of 460px and a set height of 280px and i need the image to fit all of itself into that area without stretching maintaining its aspect ratio

ps instead of fadein fadeout you can of course use animate with opacity

11091233

then you can loops through with a for-loop and update the order field for each record using the for loops iterator value

11091276
hash	md5
all you have to do for your example is run each password through the hash which i recommend is not md5 since that one now has known weaknesses and store the hash back

if the text were allowed to follow the normal flow then it would look ok in every browser though google-chrome would still do some minor jumping around like you see in firefox and the wel_txt element might get very large relatively speaking due to the text not shrinking fast enough

11091935
width	height
note that you probably want to detect if the mime type of the image and change accordingly and set alt width and height attributes using the file s metadata

11091965
width	height
the way i fixed it was simply made the overall width and height of the cell s frame larger and that did the trick

the closest i could get to is to specify explicitly x11 window as output device specify width and height of the window via -g and specify rasterization resolution via -r

11092065

11092204
getter	setter
use a scripting language or the llvm compiler to isolate the synthesized property setter and getter and generate ocunit tests

11092204
clang	llvm
maybe there are commands in llvm clang i can use to extract the class property and method names

11092270
spaces	linefeed
i admit we are doing something silly by using a url encoded form to send an xml document in a single variable linefeed converted to spaces and content escaped but this is to accommodate a client that can only send form data

11092285
subtract	add
using the datetime add method seems to work whether we are adding or subtract time from someotherevent

11092285
subtract	add
i know there is datetime sub used for subtract time but it seems that as long as the dateinterval produced by the origevent- diff has the inverted flag the datetime add knows to actually subtract time

11092288
onresume	onpause
an activity is always paused before it receives an intent so your approach of binding unbinding in onresume onpause is always going to produce this behaviour

11092303
folder	directory
in cvs only files are versioned and not directory we ll use that term instead of folder

11092329
antialiasing	transparent
for reference of future coregraphics explorers putting a 1-pixel transparent border did make for a noticeable improvement in my experiments but it appears that as eonil mentioned you end up with multiple stages of antialiasing smoothing interpolation working against each other

rss	feed
i m working on an app that relies heavily on rss feed

11092422
google-chrome	firefox

11092702
post	get
the parameters passed as object ensure we do a post and not a get call

11092750
prepare	execute
this is by no means a comprehensive example since there are several ways to alter it that will still work prepare statements allow you to execute multiple statements on the server in one statement and i don t have a working server at the moment to test to make sure it s exactly what you need but i hope it gets the point of across

11092757

jqplot appears to have the ability unlike flot at least as i understand it to add to an existing plot

in my previous experiences i just put what ever data blob i get over the webservice into a string then create the image using this method and it works great there is a great discussion on the details of base64 encoding and decoding here which is what i used to create my class but nick s code on github is much better as its arc compliant

right now i m using an outer div with a specified width and margin auto

11095006

so replace type get with type post and it will work

11095269
post	get
not to mention it appears as though jquery is stripping out the submit button variable...for instance i check for the existence of one or another submit button - html specs say if a submit button is clicked - it gets passed as a value but my firebug console shows the ajax form submit - with the post showing no sign of the button variable this is a side issue which i think goes away if i can get the form to submit normally into the tab .

qscopedpointer	qshareddata
if you were going to do it in a single container i think the easiest way would be to use std is_copy_constructable to choose whether your data struct inherited from qshareddata and to replace qshareddatapointer with std unique_ptr qscopedpointer doesn t support move semantics

11095549
httphandler	pagemethods
if you are using ajax look in to pagemethods which would even free you from creating a separate httphandler and you could call your code behind methods directly in your javascript

width	height

11102077
free	malloc
you can not free a address that is not allocate by malloc it will cause a problem

11102128
integer	unsigned
by using a dword_ptr and not a dword64 there was probably an attempt by the original developers to ensure later programmers view the result as a unsigned hex sequence and not as a signed integer and furthermore this type results in sizing the mask appropriately see next paragraph

11102171
post	get
no rest web services are expected to follow an object pattern where a get request to www... company would return all the companies a post to www... company with some data would add a new company to a list db a delete would delete and so on

you re converting a chars to int

11102243
int	chars
a chars is a utf-16 code unit - an unsigned 16-bit int the range is

11102258
int	chars
when you cast a utf16 chars to an int it merely copies the 16-bit utf16 chars value into the 32-bit int

11102291
hmac	md5
a minor thing but if you are looking for an equivalent to hmac key message then by default the python library will use the md5 algorithm so you need to use the hmacmd5 algorithm in java

11102329
textview	imageview
just to extend userseven7s answer you should return the relativelayout instead of imageview so that the gridview have relativelayout as it s direct child instead of imageview and relativelayout can have textview and imageview etc

11102339
hadoop	ambari
ambari is an open source management system for hadoop

11102356
int	chars
c# can cast a chars to an int and will give you the chars code.the code above is taking a string hashstring and turning it into an array of int keybuffer

11102356
int	chars
the code above will produce an array of int one per chars in the hash string and each int will be the chars code of the corresponding chars

11102362
int	chars
to expand on jon skeet s post your decimal int values will map to the corresponding chars values like in the chart below which i have had on my development pcs for years

11102362
int	chars
so casting the int value 0 to a chars will return a null

11102392
int	chars
the code actually cast the chars normally ascii into an int not 0 to 0

11102392
int	chars
in c# there is another variable type called chars which represents one unicode chars and can cast directly into int

11102434
converter	multibinding
note in the above datatemplate i have a multibinding currently so i can see what values are being passed into the converter

11102440
button	checkbox
i have a load once jqgrid that uses a custom formatter to display checkbox for bool values that are persisted only when a save button is clicked

11102442

if i check hide system library option it doesn t show me a leak

11102445
awt	swing
keep in mind that doing so will make things harder confusing if you ever try to write awt swing code

11102452
google-chrome	firefox
i had intended to use jquery for ajax which works correctly in google-chrome backgrounds scripts but firefox addons have no xmlhttprequest object so jquery is pretty useless here as well

11102596
width	height
width height is of cgfloat type

11102648

firefox	safari
all the time in safari and sometimes in firefox and windows7 getuser return 0

11102791
ggplot2	aesthetics
so you re sort of missing the fundamental idea behind ggplot2 which is that you always put all your data into a data.frame and every aesthetics that you map corresponds to a variable in your data frame

11102856
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari respect

11102869
hide	show
when you click on the link show one if you then click on the question mark hide that one then show the other.

11102987
postgresql	mysql
this won t work in my scenario though because of deployment issues so i ll have to abandon sqlite altogether and switch to mysql or postgresql

11102987
implements	extends
i wish sqlite had some kind of plugin mechanism to extends it with custom functions without recompilation like the way udfs are implements in mysql

11103046
geocoding	geocode
i m working with google maps geocoding in order to geocode some addresses and i ve realized that certain addresses appear in google maps search engine but they can t be reached with google maps geocoding

11103048
for-loop	arrays
the enhanced for-loop works on arrays as good

11103049
inherited	subclassing
my views are mainly composed of viewflippers and many nested layouts that inherited from a subclassing of linearlayout

11103067
hide	show
first you have to receive the main div float_content and then play with the show hide to the inner divs

11103091
int	boolean
however the function is sort-specific here int and not applicable to lists of boolean or custom sorts

11103147
post	get
take a look at post redirect get pattern

11103229
hide	show
this hide and show controls just change true false

11103233
nsstring	nsdata
by using the simple property list-related i o methods you can write out objects of classes nsarray nsdictionary nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate and any combination thereof arrays of dictionaries

11103238
width	height
uitextview should be the same width and height as uitableviewcell

11103238
width	height
so this problem is fundamental i just can t get cell contentview frame width for constraining because i should return this height before cell layouts contentview

11103239
google-chrome	firefox
the below snippet is working fine in firefox google-chrome .but the jqgrid related libraries is not loading in ie there by its not allowing to make normal ajax call

11103268
nsstring	nsdata
then remember that can only write datatypes that can be saved in a plist file nsstring nsdata nsdictionary and nsarray - and those will be validated recursively

11103318
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox 3.6 safari 5 google-chrome 6 opera 10 ie 9

as only public functions seem to be found this is no problem as long as the function is private or protected

11103475
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m making a overlapping screen like facebook photo-viewer and for now it works fine in google-chrome safari and firefox but i do also need it to work in ie

11103492
filesystems	xfs
i use xfs filesystems and simply use xfs freeze to halt the filesystems

11103532
octal	decimal
in this case it is crucial that you do specify the radix as otherwise it may be interpreted as either a decimal or an octal number

11103591
serializable	deserialization
however when the communication is performed over a network the bottleneck is often the network rather than the serializable deserialization itself

11103608
hide	show
the effect is that the main screen moves 320 to the left which hide the main screen and show the other screen because it s a subview

11103640
int	chars
i then strip all non numeric chars to get a single int from the response

11103648
nsurl	nserror
- bool writetourl nsurl aurl options nsdatawritingoptions mask error nserror errorptr

11103651
onresume	onpause
i suggest you populate your arrayadapter in onresume and save it in onpause

11103750
put	get
when you put in your controller class you will not even need any view file gsp to get full edit screens for your model domain class

11103793
nsstring	nsdata
those types are nsstring nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary

11103801
implements	extends

backbone.js	javascriptmvc	spine.js	backbone.js	spine.js	javascriptmvc
in my research for this i stumbled upon javascriptmvc approaches like backbone.js and spine.js among others

11103893
spine.js	backbone.js
i ve read through them and am comparing them to my approach above and am not sure if why i would need something like backbone.js or spine.js

11103893
spine.js	backbone.js
i want to check with the experts out there if my approach seems appropriate and to see if i really need backbone.js or spine.js

11103985
debian	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	linux	opensuse	debian
this is a modern linux kernel tracer works in user land too that installs in seconds available as packages if you re using ubuntu fedora arch linux debian or opensuse

11104017
width	height
and since your jpanel added to this rootpanel has nothing inside it hence it will take it s size as 0 0 for width and height respectively

11104022
ostringstream	std
but in your code a copy of the internal string in the std ostringstream is performed before the function completes as part of the return statement and before t gets destroyed so it is fine

11104044
datediff	difference
since datediff only ever returns a difference in days you might as well just use a string operation to do your formating

11104096
hide	show
i am trying to hide a keyboard and show up a uipicker instead for textfield

11104130

if you want the parts of string copied into a fixed length string 100 then you need to malloc 100 chars for each args inside the loop and strncpy the result of strtok into it

11104182
multiplying	division
to do matrix division by multiplying a and b s inverse

11104189
kerberos	ldap
we have there a webadmin based on gwt and a rest-api web application that performs authentication against ldap servers using kerberos as authentication protocol it supports also simple authentication

11104196

11104354
tabcontrol	tabitem
i am experiencing a very weird problem in wpf i have a tabcontrol which contains 3 tabitem

11104394
post	get
if you want to stick to primitives i guess you should set the opacity of the line primitive see this post which explains how and then you could create a sequence of action that set the opacity level start with opacity at 100 then 75 then back to 100 like i did with my images but using the method in the link above to get the blurring effect

11104443
maven	m2e
we are experiencing an issue with eclipse indigo and the new m2e plugin for maven support

11104443
maven	m2e
i can select an alternative maven installation the embedded is 3.02 but for resolution and plugin management m2e uses no proxy and not the selected maven installation

if var lenght is not possible than atleast one int or one chars and atmost 15 int or chars

11104458
hide	show
this is my code if the image has an height higher than 100px then show only the first 100px of the image and hide the rest

11104481
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass is under your control you can refactor it and use the template method pattern to pull the object into the constructor instead of pusing it from the subclassing

11104498
inherited	properties
a look at the docs shows that get is inherited and returns object whereas getproperty is a member of properties and returns the string

11104575
int	double	division	modulo
you should go over each digit starting with the least significant one double it and add the carry from the previous one store the result modulo 10 as the new digit value and if the result is more than 9 set the carry to 1 otherwise set it to 0 or just perform int division of the result by 10

11104637
pull	push
once you have the repository cloned you can pull and push from to the central repository same as you would if you were using the command-line

11104685
button	checkbox
moreover since checkbox can be checked and unchecked independently it may be better to check their state only at the moment when the button is pressed instead of attempting to keep track of them all the time

11104692
button	checkbox
also you did not have this problem as each selection of the radio button overwrote the previous one but you will need to remove items from the set if their corresponding checkbox is unticked

11104733
cvs	rcs
i am doing a whole bunch of conversions of cvs and rcs repositories into subversion

11104754
sorting	grouping
as long as you know how it s constructed you have native mysql equivalents to get your sorting grouping working and the representation serializes gracefully this will work

11104766
rpm	yum
as an aside for a yum command to work without using the --localinstall option you will need to have a web server set up the new rpm copied to the right folder on the web server and the indexing files rebuilt repobuild is the script to do so if i recall correctly

11104769
innodb	myisam
note that mysql myisam tables are not transactional you need to use innodb type tables see here and here

11104774
spaces	delimiter
there s also the matter that if i split the string using the spaces character as delimiter countries like west indies with 2 words will be split and there won t be any uniform way to parse that

11104835
portrait	landscape
i ve found lots of people asking for information on how to have the master view displayed both in landscape and portrait orientation but what i am trying to do is to having the right master view hidden regardless of the devices orientation and popping in from the side by using a navbar button

11104866
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see in firefox google-chrome or other modern browser on hover over the top menu the submenu items should be vertically centered regardless of one or 2-lined items

11104877
button	checkbox
ok the gui is ready but has no functions yet it contains 10 checkbox yes they are all neccessary and 2 button and a jtextfield so nothing special

11104877
button	checkbox
so i just drag n dropped the checkbox and button into the window i haven t coded anything yet

11104877
button	checkbox
now the user should check or uncheck the checkbox and then finally press a button

11104886
width	height
give your div that holds mycanvasl2 the same height and width as the canvas

11104904
accessor	properties
this is supposed to take an expression left which is the properties accessor and expression right which is a constant of the string to search in and return an expression representing essentially

11104913
ienumerable	ilist
the answers in question is an ilist please don t advise to change ilist to ienumerable

ienumerable	ilist
note can pass ilist to ienumerable if we are not using reflection

11104978
ant	maven
while using the maven ant task artifact deploy i m encountering the error java.lang.outofmemoryerror java heap space

11104978
ant	maven
it turns out that i m not getting the java heap error when i run my maven ant task on a different machine which probably has more memory allocated to the jvm heap

google-chrome	firefox	xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
i ve implemented cors access-control-allow-origin on my wcf service and my code works fine with xmlhttprequest in google-chrome and firefox but i m making calls cross-domain and so for ie i need to use the xdomainrequest object

11105495
post	put	post	get	put	get
my xdr works fine when i get or post to a method that has no args and i can even use the get verb successfully to a method with args using a querystring but when i try to post to a method with args my xdr throws an error even though i put a breakpoint in the beginrequest method and i see that the response from the server is 200 ok

google-chrome	safari
the following prevents the thinning of text in webkit safari google-chrome

11105516

11105579
put	get
when i put the string from a get method to an string object i get the replaced with

11105584
int	chars
this way you create a four-byte int out of alex then you store it in a chars -- of course it doesn t fit into a one-byte chars so only its less significant byte the x gets stored which is then output

11105630
persistent	transient
jpa s transient annotation prevents a serialized property from being persistent

11105679
lxml	elementtree
gpx is an xml format so use a fitting module like lxml or the included elementtree xml api to parse the data then output to csv using the python csv module

11106031
google-chrome	firefox
this is supported in google-chrome 18 and firefox and webkit nightly builds

11106047
superclass	subclassing
so i created a superclass called resource and many subclassing

11106047
superclass	subclassing
of course the subclassing is overriding the superclass initialize so the values cannot be accessed

11106067
width	height
it basically resets width and height on most annoying parts and then 80 of your job is done

11106087
hash	salt	hash	hmac
hash bcrypt hmac userpassphrase pepper salt

11106087
hash	salt
hash bcrypt userpassphrase salt

11106087
hash	hmac
my assumption is that the hmac does not meaningfully strengthen the resulting hash and the burden of storing pepper outweighs any supposed benefits...but i would love to hear informed opinions

11106132
xna	slimdx
i m attempting to load an fx file in slimdx i ve got this exact fx file loading and compiling fine with xna 4.0 but i m getting errors with slimdx here s my code to load it

11106266
addclass	removeclass
you should ideally use a class and addclass removeclass

11106273
superclass	subclassing
the only reason i can think of is when you want your subclassing to void serialization while the superclass is already serializable and then you can just simply throw exception there in both methods in your subclassing

11106281
versioning	upgrade
as a side note i upgrade 4 computers in my company to the new versioning of python and arcgis and only one of them is throwing this error

11106288
versioning	upgrade
mid is the machine s id from the machines table sid is the software s id from the software table which contains the software s name and software s versioning slid is the softwarelist id from the softlist table a table with just lists the software being run and is used for unique constraint so that when software upgrade are performed i don t have an entry for one machine running two different versioning of the same software

alternatively a simple way of doing this is setting a repeating background image and altering div width height based on your counts

11106571
realloc	malloc
one strategy for out of memory checking in c is to use wrappers for malloc and realloc you could possibly call them xmalloc and xrealloc that check for out of memory and if so take an error action .

using findviewbyid in an activity searches in the layout xml file that was used in setcontentview in oncreate

11106777
serializable	deserialization
on a separate note if the objects you are serializing have references to non-serializable services you would first mark those members as transient to prevent serializable but then use the writeobject to capture enough information so that readobject can re-establish the references upon deserialization

11106783
gson	jackson
you should use json streaming either with gson or jackson

11106796

firefox	safari
in ie this is working correctly but in firefox and safari the page refreshes due to the window.parent.location - but never calls the dopostback i was able to tell this using tracepoint and the sub that is called stores values to the database the values are not being stored as well sub is never hit

11107178
children	parent
the set of rows i m trying to insert contains parent and their children

11107186
postgresql	mysql
sqlite is a rdbms like oracle mysql or postgresql i think that s what you mean by dbms based tables so yes normalization applies to databases stored in sqlite

inherited	properties
tbuttoncontrol which is what tcustomcheckbox inherited from has the properties clicksdisabled

11107512
public	protected
unfortunately it is protected and not made public by tcustomcheckbox but you can use a small hack to access it

11107773
translation	localization
translation text is stored appropriately in a database maintained by native partners in another application therefore i do not want to use a file based resx equivalent like jquery localization jquery localize jquery-i18n-properties approaches instead i am after a solution similar to extending the resource-provider model that localises asp.net controls which i don t have to get the translation from the database

by top i mean near top and also i am not sure how you defined this slider js but when i change the height of header the visual width seems to change

11108771
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
anyhow--the behavior was strange and specific to the webkit browsers and i couldn t find a really logical reason for safari to do it but this workaround seems perfectly valid and now everything looks great in firefox safari and google-chrome

11108798
primes	modulus
after factoring the modulus and getting the primes p and q you need to find the totient which is p-1 q-1

11108812

11108952
datamodel	relational-model
as i said before when relational-model was invented in late 70 s one of its main benefits over one of the reigning paradigm hierarchical datamodel was the ability of look for related data regardless of their dependency

11108958
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview and sqldatasource

11108969
comparator	comparable
but i think if you want to sort the way you have it you need to add a comparator and make sure your class implements comparable

11109014
fseek	fread
what you might try is instead falling back to more c-like but still php constructs in particular fopen fseek and fread

11109024
google-chrome	safari
this seems to explain the bug that webkit engine of both google-chrome and safari has

11109045

i used the selenium ide in firefox to record a test suite in selenese and i d like to run these tests on the command-line using google-chrome

11109045

i thought the following command would do want i want but it runs the tests inside of firefox instead of google-chrome

11109110
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the viewcontroller that is actually added into your uitabbarcontroller viewcontrollers array since i see you have a tabbar as your lowest level of navigation should be an uinavigationcontroller

otherwise if the floating-point number is not an infinity the floating-point value is rounded to an integer value v rounding toward zero using ieee 754 round-toward-zero mode Ã¢ 4.2.3

11109137
int	double
note that math.round double is still declared to return a double as it may be outside the range of int or long - but i would expect that not to be a problem in your case

11109203
google-chrome	safari
i need to match safari browsers but not google-chrome browsers using one regex

11109259
google-chrome	safari
is that right before safari zero width so starting with the cursor before s there cannot be the string google-chrome which doesn t make sense

11109323
width	height
the resizing is accomplished by changing the scale attribute also not changing the width and height

11109374
profiling	instrumentation
if this doesn t work try to use the instrumentation app from xcode to profiling what your problem is

11109410
google-chrome	firefox
you can also use built-in tools in google-chrome f12 or in firefox ctrl + shift + k

11109506
inherited	properties
you should read more carefully about inherited inherited is used to share methods and properties between multiple objects and it doesn t really apply to this code

i want to do things like profiling the service behaviour in a real environment or use various debugging settings debugging code that is otherwise unavailable

11109687

one strategy that i ve kicked around is subclassing uiimageview only for the purpose of benchmarking and having overridden draw methods in my subclassing log something and then call the superclass s method

11109687
profiling	instrumentation
i know instrumentation can provide some profiling in terms of frame rates in this area but i don t see a solution to my problem with my limited knowledge of the tool

11109722
post	get
try change you re php c# to receive send get requests instead of post requests

11109748

intersect	contains
i would like to cull the list so it only contains non-intersecting members and each member that remains was greater than any other members it may have intersect

11109993
superclass	subclassing
my understanding is that you can create superclass and subclassing with the use of extends

11109993
superclass	subclassing
this is already sufficient in creating superclass and subclassing

11110015
spaces	delimiter
you can then use a smaller regular expression to validate based data between the spaces delimiter

11110025

11110116
jlabel	jlayeredpane
so in the following code i created a jlayeredpane and a jlabel

11110116
width	height
probably a part of my previous questions answer the label had an initial height and width of 0 before setting bounds which might be the reason setbounds is important

11110145
getter	setter
+ standard getter setter as you would expect

11110166
google-chrome	safari
the api relies on the user using a browser which supports local storage so provided your user base is using google-chrome or safari it would work on a desktop as well as various mobile platforms

11110184
post	get
if you have a bunch of potential libraries you could use something like lib.exe as per this post on so to search for matching symbols and then try pointing the linker at those files but again there s no way to get the linker to find this information for you

11110191
pascal	delphi
i m currently trying to work with a delphi pascal translation of the ati adl structure

11110203
width	height
although as i stated in my other answer the width and height attributes do not interfere with fluid images fluid images do interfere with not-yet-loaded images taking up the proper amount of space in browsers other than chrome

11110203
width	height
however it does provide the same advantages to apparent loading speed that the width and height attributes provide

11110208
decimal	ieee
a double which is usually implemented with ieee 754 will be accurate to between 15 and 17 decimal digits

11110283
x86	64bit
64bit x86 systems know also as amd64 or x86-64 or x64 require double values to be 64bit aligned otherwise a misalignment fault occurs and the hardware does an expensive fix-up which considreably slows down memory access

11110287
bottle	flask
but this is dangerous and takes a fair amount of assumptions im not sure which framework you are using bottle flask theres many please use the appropriate call to post

inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
now i have run into issues requiring me to remove the inherited and instead place a userid properties on each subclassing which is a foreign key to a user s id properties

11110309
inherited	properties
i ve removed all the inherited associations using the edmx designer i ve added all the userid properties and their associations made sure all the other user types now have their own entity keys and gotten the association and navigation properties for the user set up on each specific

11110339
client-side	server-side
you can re-use the client-side code and replace the server-side with the java implementation

11110385
children	parent
to illustrate let s take a simple and completely relevant example we are all familiar with parent and children in the context of family

11110385
children	parent
children however require a parent in order to exist parent_ssn must reference to an existing ssn in the parent table

11110385
children	parent
you cannot query for an individual child based only on the name field because multiple parent may have children with the same name

11110385
children	parent
likewise you cannot query for an individual child based only on the parent_ssn field because one parent may have many children

11110385
children	parent
taking that into consideration children are partially identified by their parent hence identifying relationship

11110385
children	parent
although the parent_ssn field still references the ssn of the parent table it has no part in the unique identity of the child thus parent have a non-identifying relationship to their children and both tables can now be considered strong standalone entities

11110385
children	parent

either way you can use twoway binding which will be the default anyway if your view model property has a getter and setter

11118502

if i m correct firefox is the only browser that supports padding height margin or any other kind of modification of the size for the option element

11118766

at least google-chrome doesn t allow any sort of size altering and you can t ignore google-chrome users so the solutions mentioned above work mostly for firefox and maybe for some other browsers

11118783
post	put	post	get	put	get
to help diagnose the issue i ve tried changing existing working non-nested post of sales that don t include an id to be put requests and in that case it does break the functionality and i do get a 404

11118961

11119184

however when the user opens another program let s say a web browser i want the always-on-top frame to move to the background making way for the other application to fully show on screen

backtracking	greedy
as .++ is greedy possessive it will match everything to the end of the string without backtracking so n will always fail

11119331
postgresql	mysql
will work on mysql and postgresql but is likely to perform terribly on mysql mysql won t use its indexes because of the lower function

11119331
postgresql	mysql
on postgresql you can add a functional index on lower bar but mysql doesn t support this

11119331
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
mysql will unless you have set a case-sensitive collation do case-insensitive matching automatically and use its indexes

11119373

11119415
min	max	minimum	max
min max sets minimum maximum axis value

11119415
min	max
pad padmin padmax defines padding around min max value

11119419
width	height
what i was expecting is the container should preserve width 32vw and height 50vh as given in the css

11119419
width	height
the outer container should be of given width and height

11119419
width	height
container width height shouldn t increase after padding

11119428
many-to-one	one-to-many
what this means is when you make a one-to-many relation in shelf many-to-one relation is not automatically created in book classes

11119480

11119595
folder	dir
the switch added to dir tells dir to show files folder with the attribute hidden

11119602
hash	salt
if the attacker relies on finding a collision with a given hash of your database thanks to the cryptographic weakness of the hashing algorithm the salt will not have any effect i have a bunch of bits and i d like to find some input to the xxx hash algorithm which give me the same bunch of bits in the output

11119660
hex	binary
the arithmetic is done in binary and then the result is printed as hex

11119663
hash	salt
the position of the salt has no impact on the security of a particular hash

11119663
hash	salt
as for the security of the hash if the user has the same email and password two different places this negates one of the benefits of a random salt in that the same hash will be visible both places

11119688
width	height
also if you are using and you know the size of the div you may want to specify the height and width of the chart as well

caveat the current version of google-chrome and semi-recent versions of firefox but not the latest currently punt on security and taint the canvas when you draw any svg preventing you from getting a data uri

i am developing a web application who needs to get the folders and sub folders who is on sharepoint and put on a treeview representing the hierarchy

11120725
google-chrome	firefox
so i am now thinking of using the word object model it would have to be via javascript but most of the users use either firefox or google-chrome so would for eg

11120747
post	get
in this situation any solution will be hack-ish because you can not get total control over the swing thread and who post events on it

11120747
invokelater	invokeandwait
so you should do step 1 and 2 in one invokelater call or even invokeandwait and then post another event with invokelater to unset the flag

11120777
min	max
i then expect it to output the mean min and max values of the list of data in each file

11120777
min	max
however whenever it runs it outputs the mean min and max values for only one file

11120786
yacc	bison
have a look at yacc or bison they should be able to do this for you provided the licenses are compatible with your work

11120786
yacc	bison
and as gahcep pointed out in his answer there are other alternatives to yacc and bison as well including commercial alternatives

11120872

i can post some class such in tutotials or get any data and everything will be ok but i can t post xmldocument

11120996
post	get
you can get the session cookies by sending another post request first one that the browser would send when you log in

11120996
google-chrome	firefox
to see what the browser sends you could use a firefox addon like httpfox or just use the built-in features that both google-chrome and firefox have these days

11121012
min	max
each price number will represent its graphbar s height by respecting min and max heights

11121012
min	max
what i want is that graph bar s height wouldn t go below or above the min and the max value

11121012
min	max
so the min and max values from the price list will be and

11121028
screens	hdpi
this works but the value i get is multiplied times the screens density factor 1.5 for hdpi 2.0 for xhdpi etc

11121078
mdpi	hdpi
i take it you are talking about the gt-p1000 and it is the only exception to have hdpi density instead of mdpi for that size

11121109
children	parent
if your goal is to delete the children when the parent is deleted then all you need is

11121114
box-sizing	border-box	width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
if you use box-sizing border-box the box you apply this will have the width and height you applied in the styles without problems about margins and paddings with undesirable effects on the box sizes

11121125

instead og defining them as public you should use protected

11121169
mouse	keyboard
in update method it interacts with a mouse and keyboard and raises various events

11121171
mouse	keyboard
so the boundary of a system does not have to be a defined by screen mouse keyboard

11121180
range	min
x-min max-min gives a number in range - 0 for min

11121180
min	max
note for max min - the above fails because of division with 0 take care for these cases manually

11121203
width	height
the problem though that you can t generate thumbnails of certain width or certain height - pil will pick up either width or height depending on the original image and there s no way to change that

11121273
cos	sin
you d just have to generate the data that will represent a sin cos wave and pass it in to the chart engine

11121282
min	max
test is a googolplex and mylist is a huge list starting from min to max

sorting	filtering
this showcase example demonstrates nesting a subtable in a larger datatable there-by achieving filtering and sorting combined with columngroups in the headers

11121844
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
ilist implements icollection and icollection implements ienumerable

11121844
ienumerable	ilist
therefore ienumerable will work for any well designed type of collection or enumeration but not ilist

11121844
ilist	icollection
for instance does not implement ilist but icollection and therefore also ienumeration

width	height
i want to scale an iframe through css to width 100 and the height should scale proportionally to the width

11122249
width	height
both the image and the iframe have defined width and height in the html

11122256
width	height
here s the primary challenge with that goal to discover the width and height of the source image file you must decode it - at least partially

11122256
width	height
the format of the source file allows you to parse the width height without loading the entire file into memory

11122256
tiff	png
jpg png yes tiff - no 30+ formats supported by the freeimagedecoder no

11122860
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
note i took the easy away out by setting the pattern as case-insensitive but you can omit that and change your expression to check for the appropriate case for example if your attribute value is case-sensitive you can change the tag literal to be tt aa gg in order to allow matching the tag to be case-insensitive

11125351
portrait	landscape
if you want to change its size depending on portrait landscape etc. you could use css media queries

11125390
post	get
the right way is to use get instead of post searching is an idempotent operation which doesn t cause any change on the server and such operations should be done with a get

11125403

the select element is a different case though where is behaves more like an element with box-sizing border-box enabled where it takes into account borders and padding into its width specification

if you add box-sizing border-box to your input element it will behave exactly as you expect want

11126271
google-chrome	firefox
the following code with alternating background i have shows up fine in google-chrome and firefox but not ie9

children	parent
you don t have to use virtual if you adress children s overloaded methods but you have to when you adress parent s methods

11126351
public	protected
you say you are familiar with java so then for a real world use of virtual functions think of any place in java where you would have used an interface or used override on a public protected method

11126375
integer	unsigned
i know that in .net a byte is an 8-bit unsigned integer but only because i ve read about it

11126381

i want also a cross-browsing answer please ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome opera

11126569

i ran into this issue recently except i needed checkbox instead of radio button as having both options unchecked was a requirement

11126619

11126643
google-chrome	firefox
but i was also writing tests via buster.js and i noticed that all the tests that had reliance on sinon.spy were producing internalerror too much recursion firefox or rangeerror maximum call stack size exceeded google-chrome

11126673
rank	max
normally i d use rank for this and just select rank 1 but that seems pointless when i know i just need the max of a column

11126680
post	get
another way to get the post and page id is to use a plugin

11126685

put	get
basically i need to get most of my information from the first table but there is one id that needs to cross two tables that i would like to put into the first query

11126759

11126767
qgraphicsview	qlistwidget
i try to drag drop from the qlistwidget into a qgraphicsview

11126858
inline	inlining
-o1 probably included inlining in which case even if there is a non-inlined copy of the function emitted the two calls may still be inline which gives the erroneously expected results

11126860
width	height
the other way is to hardcode the dimensions on the imageview in dp or assign its height width programaticaly after getting the screen metrics and calculating some percentage of the width height to fill although i think using just the fixed dp in the layout will be sufficient if needed you can use values dimensions to mark the size of the view

11126909
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
afaik neither opera nor google-chrome recognize the blur method on the window object so it s likely that the kiosk will use firefox

11126950
xargs	zcat
xargs zcat terminated by signal 13

11127052
libjpeg	libpng
libjpeg libpng etc

11127074
integer	unsigned
there s a theoretical possibility however that if the value of database_entry exceeds that you ll end up multiplying a signed quantity by an unsigned type raising the possibility of bugs or integer overflows

works fine in google-chrome and firefox

11127451
mouseover	mouseup
capture mouseover events on the spans until the mouseup event is registered

11127451
mouseup	mousedown
note these events may need to be attached to document instead of the div to ensure that a mousedown event outside of the div but entering the div is handled and with mouseup as well in case the mouseup event is outside of the div

11127456
mvp	presenter
edit 2 in response to your updated comment there are no hard and fast rules but one common trait among mvp implementations is that the presenter retains at least partial control

11127458

11127483
superclass	subclassing
however if you wish to have a superclass select actions based on its subclassing rather than letting them decide for themselves you should use match rather than the clunky instanceof tests

for example perhaps you want to treat drag and move of the mouse using the same interface with only a boolean flag distinguishing them

11127496
mongodb	bson
mongodb uses bson a binary object format similar to but more expressive than json.it is a nosql database that stores structured data in bson format with dynamic schemas instead of storing data in tables as is done in a classical rdbms

the .htaccess file needs to be in modules as its subdirectories are user provided they are plugins to a cms each user provided folder might have a public directory and only files and folder in public should be accessible

11128152
draggable	droppable
you likely aren t using appropriate plugin and would do better with droppable and draggable

width	height
the second pair tells it that you want to position the figure with the lower left outside corner at 0 0 with a width and height of 1 1

width	height
according to the supersized docs you can preset both minimum width and minimum height so it will not resize smaller

11128755
int	double
in case of casting a float double value to int you generally loose the fractions part due to int truncation

11128770
floating-point	fractions
casting to int truncates a floating-point number that is it drops the fractions part

11128770
floating-point	integer
integer value in floating-point format rounding halfway cases away

width	height
in this example the text is spread across the width of 100 and leaves lots fo empty space in the fixed height

11128964
width	height
when we have a fixed width it continues the height to fill the div

11128997
cifs	smb
you could try mounting the remote filesystem as cifs instead of smb

11129196
uiview	calayer
just to make that clear a 3000x3000pixel uiview has a calayer behind it does not matter a lot if tiled or not which uses 3000x3000x4 bytes space so that is approx 34-35mb

11129208
rss	feed
consider the apps that large blogs have which work pretty much like an rss feed but for your phone

11129227
width	height
you can make the overlay fixed positioned with width and height 100percent and a big zindex

11129249
width	height
the trick is to use a helper within which you let the browser flow the content to a specific width and see what height it comes up with

11129249
width	height
if the height of the helper is more than that of the outer adjust the width to compensate

11129285

so do i need to write something about the for-loop that as soon as i find the duplicate elements i should break loops

11129443
folder	dir	folder	directory
basically i need to copy an item that is up 3 folder from a folder called dir into my current directory

11129447
hash	salt
futhermore it requires the use of a salt which protects against the use of pre-caclulated hash values rainbow tables

11129447
hash	salt
even if an attacker gets your password hash and salt as long as your use of bcrypt is using a high number of iterations it won t be possible to quickly find the matching password

11129476
post	put
since i have not enough room to post it in the comments i ll put it there

11129476
width	height
as soon as the zoom reach a certain level which depends on image ratio you update the css of your image with a height 100 and set width to auto

11129476

you can basically constrain width or height depending on which one is 100

11129479
pop-up	dialog
right now i have a file open dialog box that pop-up when the project is executed so that the user can select the files

11129603
post	get
you could either just get the data that you need from each table or a slightly cleaner way may be to do a union of the three tables after limiting your query to only those post by selected user and order by the date posted

11129629
int	boolean
first of all i m pretty sure programmers have been using 4-byte int s for boolean variables since the beginning of programming on x86

11129638
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari and other browsers this works just like it should

11129641
client-side	server-side
an established connection is uniquely identified by the combination of client-side and server-side ip port pairs

11129641
client-side	server-side
multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side ip port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side ip port pairs and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to

11129665
int	boolean
the processor is 32 bit and has a special flag when it operates on a zero int making testing for 32 bit boolean values very very very fast

11129685
pull	push
beyond that they are using stuff like alarmmanager for pull or c2dm for push neither of which require you to have launched the app any more than you need to keep the gmail activity open to be able to get new email messages

11129924
width	height
the horizontal fov is not the same unless the canvas is square but the width and height ratio of the line area will be proportional to the width and height ratio of the screen

11129935
build.gradle	gradlew
we would like that file to import or is it called something else the real gradlew build file from bldfiles build.gradle

11129984
sorting	filtering
i found that if i did iterate through the queryset and tacked on rank manually and then further filtering the results my rank would disappear - unless is turned it into a list which made filtering and sorting a bit of pain

11130037
for-loop	loops
starting with an empty dataframe i need to fill the dataframe as follows a for-loop generates a fixed number of values in each iteration and i need to add a new column with the values in that list and giving the column a unique name col_i where i is the ith iteration of loops

11130058
width	height
basically loop the width down until the desired height is reached

11130082

11130156
stdout	stderr
i ve tried redirecting stdout stderr via

11130156
stdout	stderr
i ended up taking the method outlined in the selected answer below and writing a context manager to supress stdout and stderr

11130156
stdout	stderr
i think it has something to do with when these messages get sent to stdout stderr i think it happens after my context manager exits

11130169
rsa	aes
its probably encrypted with aes under a random symmetric key and the key is then encrypted with rsa

11130179
csv	tsv
i think that generally csv are supported more often than the tsv format

11130180
csv	tsv
the way i look at it is csv is for loading into spreadsheets tsv is

11130185
csv	tsv
tsv is an alternative to the similar csv comma-separated values format

11130185
csv	tsv
however unlike csv tsv defines no means of escaping the separator

11130199
readonly	temporary
may be implemented as a pair of pointers or pointer and length and its storage could be automatic temporary or static readonly

11130205
width	height
i think it has to do with your css width and height declarations not having px at the end of it

11130276
width	height
you need to add px to the end of all your position height and width numbers

11130310
post	put
this post shows how you can do this with bxp which is the function that boxplot uses but you need to put your data in the right order with the first row being the minimum and the last row being the maximum

11130351
for-loop	loops
note that i used the range-based for-loop just to make this shorter but you should use a regular loops if you can t use c++11

11130420
post	get
so either you ll need to update the source yourself and re-compile deploy post a jira ticket to ask this to be fixed in future version if it already hasn t been actioned in 2+ or perform some nasty nasty reflection hackery to get to the underlying inputsplit

11130459
fontconfig	freetype
so you would include the freetype and fontconfig bins in your application structure and adjust the path to include this dir

11130471
put	get
in order to get this to work put your float into a float wrapper as such

11130480
post	put
then you would do the same thing watching the net tab to find the parameters sent when you post to your facebook wall and put it all together

11130485
firefox	safari
i need a way for that specific website to detect that this browser is unique to itself and not firefox safari etc

11130534
memcached	apc
i just came across jlinq a js library to query data arrays in a similar fashion to that of a relational db and it just occurred to me that a library to query data like this in php would be extremely handy to work with cached subsets of a rdbms where the cache itself has no querying capabilities such as apc or memcached

11130587
portrait	landscape
my problem is that i don t want a static width because i believe different phones will have different widths in pixels and because i want to later add support for landscape and portrait orientation

11130651
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome can handle it but firefox often crashes

11130769
pop-up	dialog
if you call the odbc api function sqldriverconnect with an incomplete connection string like for example one that only contains the driver keyword and set the last argument to sql_driver_complete it will pop-up with a dialog generated by the driver that prompts for any required information that wasn t included then return the finished connection string once it s closed

11130789
mouseleave	mouseenter
to fix this use mouseenter and mouseleave events

background-color	transparency
to position it correctly use position absolute and for the transparency background use an rgba background-color property see below

11131206
multiplying	add
obviously for add theres no actual gain in terms of the code size i think it might be slighly more readable than v1.add v2 but something such as multiplying would be

11131207
chgrp	chmod
chgrp chmod the file so it has the initdebug group and is group writable

jobs	cron
you can see the date time user and command of previously executed cron jobs using

11131533

inherited	properties
and the baseconcept html li is almost identical to the role listitem definition except for the fact that it does not inherited any properties

11131838
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
so when we use the which is supposed to be a private ivar as per the naming conventions and we want to have the accessor methods look like the ones without the _ eg and not we map the _ivar with the to the properties

uiview	subviews
as such i added an uiimageview as a subviews to the generic uiview to hold and display the image and maintained a reference to in the view controller and made the view controller the first responder in order to receive the touch events

11132006
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my preferred method of doing this programmatically together with the storyboard is to make a subclass of uitabbarcontroller have my tab bar controller scene in my storyboard use the new subclass with 3 uiviewcontroller relationships from the tab bar controller to the desired view controller in the case below and then override viewwillappear

actually tcp between pc and sip client will probably be accurate for signalling but not for media as rtp media stream is often sent over udp

11134567
rtp	sip
in my opinion the first step is to make sure that your softswitch will accept sending rtp packets to an ip address which is not the same as sip client i think most of them refuse for security reasons

11134567
rtp	sip
if it accepts and if you have no nat between your sip client and your pc you should be able to send rtp stream directly to your pc

11134567
rtp	sip
if your softswitch does not want to send rtp packets to an ip address different from sip ip address then you have to forward your rtp packets from your sip client to your pc

11134567
rtp	sip
to test whether your softswitch accepts sending rtp packets to an unintended ip address you can use sipp and specify a remote media ip address different from sip signalling ip address

11134597
getter	setter
what are actually getter and setter

11134652

11135215
packets	pcap
i am using pcap.net to read the original pcap files and extract the packets

11135215

11142117
implements	extends
so the possible causes are at least that the servlet class cannot be found or that the servlet s default constructor does not exist or threw an exception or that the init method threw an exception or that the class does not implements servlet read extends httpservlet at all

11142191
post	get
i m developing a .net 3.5 webservice using .asmx pages but the fact that i cant use optional parameters in the get and post requests is making me think

equals	gethashcode
you need to handle both because gethashcode is used by many collection implementations like dictionary in concert with the equals method

11142338
equals	gethashcode
the important thing is that if you override the implementation of equals then you must override gethashcode in such a way that any two objects that are equals according to your new implementation also must return an identical hash code

11142363
equals	gethashcode
it is necessary to provide an override to gethashcode when your custom class overrides equals

11142383
post	get
ok the way to get results similar to ci within ee for all elements of a post while still leveraging the security features of ee is the following

11142401
draggable	droppable
if i understand your question correctly you do not have to use draggable and droppable in conjunction with sortable in your case

11142428
google-chrome	firefox
after our tech services team looking into this it appears it was partly to do with google-chrome firefox not sending winauth correctly and also the settings were the wrong way around

using safari or firefox when i launch the app i get the following error

11142884
min	max
because the object i have is huge and i need to get the min max value every two seconds

11142971
min	max

11142981
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the border

11142981
width	height
as the content width and height cannot be negative css21 section

11143018
fflush	gets
readmode 3 turns stdin into cbreak mode meaning stdin kind of gets fflush after every keypress

11143018
put	get
strictly speaking the readmode 2 isn t needed but i put it there so the screen doesn t get cluttered up with text when the user bangs on the keyboard

11143054
min	max
it s also possible to do it as a subquery to get the min and a subquery to get the max but don t think you need to do that here

11143057
opera	firefox
like in this case where it seems that firefox intreprets two br tags as two lines whereas at least opera take the first one as a line break after the map and the second one creates this empty space

11143096
stdout	stderr
there are other file descriptors that can be used for communication stdin is fd 0 stdout is fd 1 stderr is fd 2 but there is no conventional way to specify them instead of files

11143374
puts	gets
and then the user clicks on john the string that gets puts into the input box looks like john jane john

int	double
the worst one is that floats and int return false from isdate even though date serials are frequently passed as double for datetime and long int for dates

11143404
super	extends
when extends such a fluent style class one could do this rather easy in the first inheritance step via a generic type and casting the return type to this generic type in the super class

i have seen lately a couple of programs that can be launchd as daemons linphonecsh but also offer a second invocation method that will exchange information with the running daemons

11143556
daemons	launchd
in the linpohone case linephonecsh with one set of parms launchd the daemons but if invoked with a different set of parms it can query the status of the daemons call in progress call duration hangup exit etc.

firefox	safari
on my local copy the video work perfectly on every browser ie...chrome - version 19.0.1084.56 safari - 5.1.7 and firefox - 13.0.1. however once i push the video to the live site firefox seems to stop working

sorting	grouping
the reason that an index is not used for sorting here is the differing grouping by and order by clauses

google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome everything seems to work correctly

11144005
google-chrome	firefox
i should mention that i had to add code to call fb.init in order for the firefox google-chrome code to work so perhaps i m not doing something that ie requires

11144023

mouseup	mousedown
i ve built a webapp and for a little bit of polish i wanted to add mousedown and mouseup handlers to swap out images in this case to make a button look like it s being pressed

my server gets data from post requests and serve json files on get requests

11144373
post	get
i m considering creating a json model and storing instances on my database for each post request and pack the instances into json files dynamically and serve them on get requests

the same reason you ever write a getter and setter for any private value to help aid encapsulation and allow you to manipulate the inner workings of your class without having to worry about outside members breaking since they were manipulating variables directly

11146889

i ll let you the js functions to hide show a div pretty easy i must say

11147271
vb.net	vb6
i have two third-party dlls that work great in vb6 but not so much in vb.net or c#

11147631
hide	show
idle timer which displays auto-logout warnings again just show hide not an alert

11147648
int	double
consider using the term polymorphically in two contexts without the monomorphism restriction where in one context you show div x 2 and in another you use show x 2 in one setting you get the integral and show constraints which causes you to default to int in the other you get a fractions and a show constraint and that defaults you to double so the result of the computation isn t shared as you are working with a polymorphic term applied to two distinct types

11147658
width	height
your application s heap size is 30mb device dependent but that s a good rule of thumb and a bitmap will take up width height 4 bytes in memory once loaded

when i click on search it doesn t do anything but when i put alert i get alert

11147782
google-chrome	safari

width	height
the submit button has no text and is styled using css white background no borders no margins no padding 100 width 100 height

11147985

11148142
width	height
for example in the article you referenced the op uses height width and depth

11148142
width	height
in some applications those dimensions are not interchangable--you can unambiguously identify which dimension on the real-world object is height which is width and which is depth

11148142
width	height
one example might be a shipping container on a pallet where height is obvious width is the edge a forklift is expected to fit under and depth is the remaining dimension. in other applications they re interchangable which means you re liable to find duplicate primary keys like 2 3 5 and 2 5 3

11148192
width	height
for some reason i can not load any image that has more than 200 pixels in either width or height without getting a oom error

11148225

going beyond haskell to languages with dependent types as in agda coq among others types are much more often useful as a complete specification

11148686

maybe hide it first then only show it if funct 1

11148722
int	chars
the fcgi_steambuf class is defined using char_type but the int underflow method downcasts its return value to unsigned chars it should cast to char_type

11148842

also had to add a macro for the property declaration to customize the getter setter names which gets around the issue of capitalizing the name of the property

11148889
rvm	bundler
per my understanding installing libgdal-ruby via apt would install everything in the system paths which wouldn t be automatically loaded by default by a ruby installed via rvm nor your rails application using bundler which isolates gems

11148912
express	node.js
i have an express server that has a button that issues a post which activates a function in my node.js server

11148913
mef	caliburn
a lot of the examples for bootstrapping caliburn micro use mef as the di ioc mechanism

11148921
mousemove	mousedown
although i can just easily capture the mousedown mousemove event on the form itself to implement the above feature i feel like using the mousemove event to consistently update the position of the textbox is a very inefficient way of approaching this problem and will result in poor performance

11148928
entities	entitymanager
in one world i think it is better to put all the entities in one entitymanager domain and isolate them from other thread

sorting	filtering
bear in mind you ll have to mimic all the existing functionality you want to keep from the admin people page eg exposed filtering and sorting and make sure you set the access permissions on the view to ensure only admin users have access

11148953
margin	height
if you were to append a child into a container that already contained a child just subtract the same height as the existing child from the new childs margin

11148990

vbo	vao
i m looking for something similar to what glgetshaderiv does but for vao and vbo s that will tell me if i have..say

11149040
children	parent
the thing is when pulling these child objects from the application i don t want a copy of the parent being loaded with each of the children in the collection

11149040
children	parent
again my goal here is to be able to persist children individually but not to have to store the entire parent object inside

11149044
width	height
you could set a div with position fixed to the top left corner height and width 100 z-indexed higher than everything and css transition or jquery animate the div into view

11149076
width	height
you need configurewindow request to change x y width height and changewindowattributes request to change gravity

kde	gnome
besides those based on xterm there are kde s konsole and it s variants like yakuake drop-down terminal and gnome s vte and offsprings like guake drop-down terminal display update speed can be very different

11149228
versioning	upgrade
once i upgrade versioning this problem went away on it s own

11149241
folder	directory
for all the tutorials found online one would simply need to specify the source code path understood to be the path where opencv folder was extracted and then the binaries path understood to be where the opencv source code is to be built possibly a new directory

11149286
post	put
except the failing client tries post whereas the older working client does a put

11149299
maven	pom.xml
you should be able to handle this by saving your project in your maven project and pointing to it there map to it based on the location of the pom.xml

11149325
sequence	permutation
you can apply the permutation to the vector by applying the same sequence of swaps

11149325
sequence	permutation
you can reverse the permutation by applying the reversed sequence of swaps

11149326
filtering	grouping
another possibility grouping by the columns that identify the award take the min awarddate of each grouping and filtering out values before this year in the having clause

11149455
hash	salt
the hash password from the existing database is hash with the salt when it is inserted into the vbulletin database like this

11149461
google-chrome	firefox
you can check it by right-clicking the rendered page s frame and selecting in firefox similar methods for google-chrome and ie

11149462
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this appears to render fine on firefox google-chrome and safari will check ie next week plus gives you a bonus of adjusting margin-top to slightly shift text position

11149495
hide	show
a far better way of doing this is to hide the div in css which would mean the div is hidden before the document is even show

11149544
gson	jackson
jackson or gson

11149563
inherited	properties
for objects which inherited from flash.display.displayobject setting their x and y properties will suffice

11149573
portrait	landscape
i have two views jumpbarportrait and jumpbarlandscape i would like to animate between the two so in other words i would like portrait to fade in while landscape fades out.

11149639
addition	modulo
you can also probably depending on implementation do the addition before or after you modulo for the beginning of the day--your preference

11149658
folder	directory
you would simply access the tool named keychain access in the utilities folder of your applications directory

11149685

scatter	graphing
i have actually written code which allows a user to query out the data from five fields and plot a scatter graphing using two of the five fields

11149723
std	ostream
i used boost.iostreams to implement connection streams so that request handlers could use a std ostream interface to write results back to the connection

11149723
post	put	post	get	put	get
in each handler get the request type get put post etc. and parameters

11149734
google-chrome	firefox
i can get the method working on firefox and google-chrome but the iframe won t fill the div on ie9

11149773
google-chrome	safari
it seems that for every one of these rich text editors you need to have a message from the beginning in the box inside p tags for it to work properly in google-chrome and safari

11149788
many-to-one	one-to-many
i needed to add an isowner field to the association table so i changed it to a one-to-many many-to-one relation

11149790
hash	md5
if the plaintext password was sent it passes it through md5 md5 pass+salt and is compared with the hash password from the database

11149790
hash	md5
if the password was hash by javascript it is passed through md5 pass+salt and is compared with the hash password from the database

11149790
hash	md5
if the password was hash by javascript and utf is being used it is passed through md5 pass+salt and is compared with the hash password from the database

11149835
hide	show
i m trying to convert my app to arc and the converter is throwing up an error when i try to show and hide the mbprogresshud

11149841
fgets	fread
the wrapper reads in chunks of 8192 bytes but the fread or fgets may not read all data at once which is why there s an unread meta data field you could query

11149843
min	max
it wasn t part of the question but i needed both the min and max from the array and that changes things a little

11149865
rss	feed
personally that s why i use sax.js -- a pure javascript sax parser -- in my feedparser library if you re parsing rss atom rdf feed please consider trying it -- comments and pull requests are more than welcome

11149865
rss	feed
and honestly when parsing something as big as an rss feed there is no discernable speed difference between sax.js and libxmljs

11149913
folder	dir
to avoid in relative path confusion case i copied compiled program folder to var www root dir with yii lib var www yii framework but nothing change

11149951
versioning	upgrade
it s dangerous to upgrade your preinstalled python because some mac programs rely on that specific versioning

11150031
int	chars
you are passing pointers when printf expects chars s same for the floats and int

11150031
int	chars
when you use d f and c printf expects an int not a pointer to int a float not a pointer to float and a chars not a pointer to chars

11150050

it looks fantastic except - when the users submits the form - or enters their custom search and continues to the next screen

11150061
ant	maven
you can use build tools such as maven or ant

11150077
post	get
the reason you see the variables when you enter them in the browser is the difference between get and post

11150077
post	get
or you can use request to get post and get vars

11150133
width	height
i can set the width and height of my canvas by setting the width and height attributes like so

11150133
width	height
i d like set the internal width height to say 100x100 and then draw everything in those coordinates and have the canvas scale it out the same way i do in opengl

11150133
width	height
i figured out that if i set the css width and height on the canvas i can make it larger but keep the same units but i found that it actually stretches the result and it blurs and looks terrible i thought it still render like a vector nice and crisp

11150179
put	get
once you get these working they can be cut and pasted into other code or put into a personal code library so you don t have to remember how to do it

11150245
libpcap	pcap.net	winpcap	pcap.net	winpcap	libpcap
the unix folks at work indicate that libpcap which winpcap and therefore pcap.net are based upon provides the ability to write directly to a pcap file

11150260
children	parent
this is the code i m using to insert a parent with three children and one children with an item

11150340
maven	pom.xml
i found a few filters like this but since i use maven i would like to have a filter that is available in the maven repositories that i can add dependency in my pom.xml and start using in my web.xml

11150344
getter	setter
this could then be simplified to use attr_accessor instead of defining the getter setter methods manually

11150364
int	chars
which is only 1 byte assuming this to be the size of chars in size but you are trying put 4 bytes assuming that to be the size of int into it during fscanf thereby potentially overwriting the memory around it

11150388
portrait	landscape
you are not required to support both landscape and portrait orientations for an ipad app although apple recommends it

11150388
portrait	landscape
this includes portrait portrait upside-down landscape left and landscape right

11150394
listview	gridview
check the links for lazyadapter example lazyadapter which is good for getting images from net to show in either gridview listview or gallary view check it

11150414
ienumerable	ilist
the use of ilist and ienumerable in the getteams method look to be used just because

11150429
int	chars
if each call to fscanf works each will fill in one int but buf points to a sequence of unsigned chars s

11150429
unsigned	short
the same mistake is repeated at many other points in fill_cotp fscanf with a d directive is used to fill in temp which has type unsigned short rather than int

11150429

11150529
textview	imageview
you should make use of framelayout and then add your imageview to it in this post given example how to set image just add textview with background transparent after it framelayout displays it upon image and you can also position it just write your textview in relativelayout

11150546
achartengine	mpandroidchart

folder	dir
used dynamic linking by copying the libopencv_java.so and the static library files into the project dir libs and project dir obj local folder and changed static block of java source code to

11150606
public	protected
the only way an object of type a1 can access the a2.m2 method however is with the public or protected access modifier

11150653
stdout	stderr
it is as if the verbose output is neither stderr or stdout

11150679
unsigned	short
depending on what data type word is since you haven t provided it i assume it is unsigned short the first comparison is always true since no negative integers fit in an unsigned short

11150682
integer	unsigned
it seems that word is typedef -ed somewhere as unsigned integer type so it will always be positive number

11150686
unsigned	short
i think the warning is for the comparison which is always true for hour is of type word which is a typedef of unsigned short usually which means hour is always greater than or equal to 0

11150686
unsigned	short
note that it doesn t matter whether is unsigned int or unsigned short

11150726
int	chars
in c chars literals such as a have type int and hence sizeof a is equal to sizeof int

11150726
int	chars
an int chars constant is a sequence of one or more multibyte chars enclosed

11150773
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
the easiest way to upgrade python is probably homebrew it s basically a great package manager for osx like macports fink but better

4 create a folder of the zip file in application directory or the application data directory

11150782
folder	dir
.a library files into the project dir libs and project dir obj local folder and changed static block of java source code to

11150889
queue	fifo
or as is common with packets you might eventually want to store them in a fifo manner which can be done with a stl queue

11150889
put	get
with the queue they come out in the same order you put them in so if you queue up packets 1 2 and 3 and later go to access two of them you will get packets 1 and 2 in that order and 3 will still be left for later

11150909
google-chrome	firefox
afaik desktop notifications are available only in google-chrome chromium and firefox browser

11150972
google-chrome	firefox
while this works relatively well in firefox google-chrome handles this very poorly

11151000
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup would be yet another dependency as i use lxml based version

11151010
stdout	stderr
to direct stderr to stdout so that grep can process those warnings

11151021
put	get
i get my required xml elements in block.but at the same i also put block for catching other xml elements.but it is not worked for me.

11151037
hide	show
in many cases you have an option in the text editor to show hide line ending markers

11151059
google-chrome	firefox
i have to do something like does.i made it work on firefox google-chrome and ie9 by using canvas element which is unfortunately not supported by ie8

11151099
hide	show
i want to lay out a layout using static cells but i want a portion of the table view to show hide itself based on a switch in another table view cell

11151165
google-chrome	firefox
that s why as you see from the answer by kciebiera the clients that can make notifications possible are google-chrome and firefox

11151165
google-chrome	firefox
what you do is run code on the client javascript in this case that looks for something a message from the server for example and then instructs the browser google-chrome or firefox to launch the notification

11151203
hide	show
and then show hide them with an on off bool

11151263
mdpi	hdpi
1 put the images of suitable sizes in xhdpi hdpi mdpi and ldpi folders

11151287
int	boolean
now consider database i will have a table allowed_zipcodes with five columns zipcode int varchar 6 abc_cod boolean abc_net boolean def_cod boolean def_net boolean

11151300
hide	show
i have a statusmodule which basically show statusmessages but can also show the user that some work is in progress indeterminate show different icons show hide the control and so on

11151334
int	double
but what happens here is that the typically 64 bits of the double value is sent to printf and then it interprets typically 32 of those bits as an int value

11151366
integer	unsigned
unix_timestamp if called with no argument returns a unix timestamp seconds since 1970-01-01 00 00 00 utc as an unsigned integer

mp3	ogg
i went and tried on an example site and it worked for ogg but not mp3

11151425
pull	push
but i don t want the service to pull for every changeset in the push

11151432
hide	show
i have added javascript function to checkbox to hide show it

11151437
client-side	server-side
what goes on the server-side is irrelevant here as the notifications happen client-side

11151437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
desktop notifications are currently part of a w3c working draft and are implemented in the current version of google-chrome and the next release versions of firefox safari ie

11151458
freemarker	velocity	gson	xstream
if you use case is rendering arrays and other object graphs in human readable form you may go for templating solution like velocity of freemarker or convert them to json or xml and rpetty pring it - i would recommend gson xstream for this task

11151544
xslt	xquery
variables in xquery and xslt xpath represent values not fragments of program text

11151568
pull	push
so on b i copied all the targets so that they d overwrite the symlinks. then i d commit this push it to my central repo and then pull it on a

11151598
versioning	upgrade
so try to upgrade httpclient jar to at least 4.1 versioning

11151606
put	get
once you have it working you ll probably want to put it in a thread and add an uploading dialog but this will get you started

11151613
decoder	encoder
thanks coder decoder encoder for your time

11151617
width	height
the images i added have no set width or height and have max-width 100 css applied to them so they scale within a fluid grid

11151631
jdom	xom
there are much better alternatives such as jdom and xom

11151646
calloc	malloc
dynmically allocated memory using malloc and calloc will be in heap

11151699
pull	push
with this git push will update the same remote ref as the one which is merged by git pull making push and pull symmetrical

11151728
width	height
what i really want is something like the form elements input or textarea where you can simply specify the height and width by lines characters

11151807
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
nsdateformatter doesn t specify a way for you to set the minimum maximum dates for the user input unlike nsnumberformatter

11151807
range	minimum
all you have to do is create a nsdateformatter subclass change the getobjectvalue forstring range error method and apply the date checking of your minimum date

11151825
folder	directory
i determined that the problem was caused by a control that writes and deletes some files in temp folder that it creates near bin folder so the web directory looks like this

11151828
ready	each
another option would be to give each of these div a class then use javasript to count the number of classes present multiply this by the required width of each div then use javascript to set the page width with the on document ready event

11151830
margin	height
you still can set height margin on each div of course

11151830
children	parent
using overflow hidden on the parent and an extra margin-bottom on children if you only use background

11151842
jboss	glassfish
embedded in a application server i have read some article on how to deploy camel to a application server such as jboss and i have even read about people deploying to glassfish

11151863
width	height
i dont know why would you want that..but you could fix the height and width of the div class according to the size of the font you are gonna use

11151870
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
trigger an update of the updatepanel by a control that is in different contentplaceholder

11151906
width	height
put a in your page with height 0 overflow hidden and the desired width of your elementÃ¢Â¹

11151911
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode the images look vertically stretched and in landscape mode it looks horizontally stretched

11151921
rspec	capybara
currently i m using rspec + capybara + phantomjs driver

11151938
width	height
it may adjust the height but it wont adjust width..you could use the min-width property to set the minimum width of the content-right..

11151945
client-side	server-side
actually i have do a test with the server.c and client.c in the android emulator ps they both runs sucesssfully and are compiled with the android genric cross-compiler .and then i go further i rewrite the client-side via the jni.but in this case the client fail to connect to the server-side though new client is very similar to the client.c

11151969
apache	nginx
i m using nginx in front of node.js not apache

11151970
windbg	mdbg
you may use mdbg or windbg to debug your process

11151989
google-chrome	firefox
i can edit the startpage by opening omni.ja with izarc and going to google-chrome browser content browser abouthome abouthome.xhtml and editing the file but when i save the omni.ja file to the firefox directory it fails to launch the programme

11152028
post	get
i have been able to get around that by specifying ignore options in the unmapping as recommended by ryan niemeyer in that post

11152040
g++	gcc
i would like to know if the following piece of code is going to throw an error or a warning upon compilation with any kind of gcc g++ optimizations enabled

11152050
stdout	stderr
thus i have redirected the frame output into the dev null otherwise it would save each frame as jpeg and i redirected stderr to stdout using 2 1

11152059
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works good in ie opera and firefox but on google-chrome instead of the small thumb enlarged it shows a grey screen and it drives me crazy

11152082
verilog	vhdl
can go into an fpga chip vhdl or verilog as you wish out of the back end

11152137
subtract	add
that error usually occurs when you try to subtract an interval from datetime.minvalue or you want to add something to datetime.maxvalue or you try to instantiate a date outside this min-max interval

11152146
16-bit	64bit
furthermore this calculation mismatch did not happen debug mode because all the variables were written to memory into 64bit double variables and reloaded from there afterward nullifying the additional 16-bit

11152153
jobs	cron
there should be a section there for adding cron jobs using the interface

11152161
submit	submission
the reason i want to switch to dopost is that it shows another panel when you click the submit button so the user knows that there submission went through

11152204
post	put
so it would be better to take the http post code from the second answer and put it inside the run method of a runnable object you could run on a background thread

11152206
cells	tablecell
i have already managed to implement this by using my own subclass of tablecell and using a webview for each cells htmleditor would of course have been another choice but my guess is that for my requirements webview should be sufficient

11152375
width	height
that would explain why when height is not the same as width you get an exception and why it flips your picture when they are the same

11152375
width	height
also a tip for you if you rewrite it as a 1-dimensional array of size height width you will get a drastic speed increase

11152382
width	height
you pass x and y values across on the command line and then ignore them and use the width and height of the screen to set your x y values

11152441
serializable	deserialization
in general a good approach would be to maintain a high-level description of your structure somehow and then write code that generates the serializable and deserialization functions

11152454
integer	unsigned
6 the type size_t is an implementation-deÃ¯ ned unsigned integer type that is large enough to contain the size

11152501
inherited	properties
after that all other loggers will inherited those properties and you will not get any more messages

11152503
hide	show
thus in your situation the only solution appear to be use jquery and grab the ticks and hide them yourself just after you finish your plot - just like i show it here

11152669
margin	height
you could just apply a 140px top margin padding to the body or other container element which would make the topnav s height and offset accounted for

11152677
x86	64bit
they are in ntddscsi.h found at c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows v7.0a include on a 64bit system

11152680
width	height
w h and m are width height and margins respectively

11152695
qtcpsocket	qbytearray
i am using qbytearray to store all the data before writing to the socket using qtcpsocket write

11152801
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
wrap the socket streams by using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream to be able to use serialization

11152810
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
currently this is only implemented in firefox and google-chrome not mise don t know about safari and opera etc but it s a w3c standard so expect everyone to join in eventually

11152830
submit	submission
passing event argument here e to submit callback you can stop form submission using .preventdefault method

11152882
submit	submission
a properly implemented ajax form is exactly the same as a regular form except that if javascript is enabled a submit handler will be bound to it that will prevent the normal submission of the form and send the data using the xmlhttprequest object

11152889
keydown	keyup	keydown	mousedown	keydown	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown	keyup	mousedown	keyup	mouseup
instead of .live mouseup mousedown keyup keydown i would use the .change event which works the same way and would probably catch the ctrl+v changes too

11152899
column-count	height
the problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scroll

11152899
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome but not in opera

11152928
post	get
set up an endpoint url that receives both http get for subscription verification and post for actual change data requests from facebook

11152944
width	height
when i set width of the div to 70px the content still over flow the div what i want is the height of the div will automatically adjust when the content of it exceeds the width of the div

11152975
google-chrome	firefox
works for me tested on win 7 - ie 9 firefox 13 google-chrome 19

well i looked into the project directory under release and found it generated this wonderful folder structure

networkstream	sslstream
when using an sslstream to send a large chunk of data 1 meg to a already authenticated client the packet fragmentation dissasembly i m seeing is far greater than when using a normal networkstream

11159496
post	get
from your post you may be looking for a way to get large files more than one and do what you want with them if so this is not a good method to do that since every time you add a new file via the market it would tell your users you have an updated version and overwrite the older file though you can use the patch extension to avoid that if you are updating the original but that only moves it back one step

11159511
getter	setter
in c# properties represent your getter and setter

11159511
getter	setter
1 you don t have to specifiy both a getter and a setter you can omit either one

getter	setter
basically getter and setter are just means of helping encapsulation

getter and setter in c# are something that simplifies the code

11159713

this creates a getter and setter for my foobar property

11159716
getter	setter
i think a bit of code will help illustrate what setter and getter are

11160225
screens	tablet
for example instead of having a newsreader that has two screens one to display a list of articles and one to display article content you can use fragments to have a side-by-side two-pane view of articles and content on tablet while still having two separate screens on phones which are more narrow

11160235
google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in google-chrome and safari

11160260

int	boolean
an int and boolean with 100k elements each will use about 500k of memory and is two objects

11160314
int	boolean
but if that not an option youc an use a long which can store all possible int and boolean values

11160439
for-loop	loops
instead of incrementing k each time you go through your inner for-loop increment it once per iteration of your while loops

11160494
wtl	atl
you will find great samples for both atl and wtl at

11160502
width	height
each control s height and width is based off the others

11160506

i need help about softwares like mamp wamp server .

11160611

11160834
charts	pie-chart
in the second tab i want a pie-chart build with sencha charts 2.0 beta with the total number of three possible values of my vote field values can be yes no or ab so what i expect is three pie-parts

and it works gracefully in google-chrome aurora firefox opera and safari i ve tested each one but ie9 refuses to accept the response

11160851
hide	show
although i am only using show and hide here you can use .remove as long as you bind your action with .on and not just .click

11160879
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that there is a 2px difference between google-chrome and firefox that is breaking the effect in the latter

11160905
folder	directory
i think you could still share the working folder itself however so that you could switch to the other os and try out the current state of the working directory on the different os

11160966
hide	show
but in this way it will execute the second bat showing its output however i want it to hide the program.bat output and show instead the phrase please wait .

11161132
post	get
posts_per_page 10 it will get json with 10 post and all the attributes you want

11161300
rss	feed
you need to get an rss feed of videos you want in your list

11161300
rss	feed
so from there you need to parse the rss feed into a list of objects that have a title description thumbnail and link to the video

11161312
width	height
this screws with anything attempting to get the width or height since those functions in jquery eventually expect the passed element to be a dom element i did a lot of tracing

11161328
yourkit	jprofiler
profilers like yourkit and jprofiler won t help - and actually nothing will

11161338

pop-up	dialog
your going to have to provide the intent with more information or make your action default using the pop-up dialog

11161417
for-loop	loops
the rest of your code seems a bit suspicious as well you should always avoid manipulating the control variable of a for-loop within loops

11161432
free	malloc
with those messages valgrind is telling you that memory has been allocated and showing you a stack trace of how the call to malloc came about but that memory from those allocations have never been free

11161459

heap anything that has been alloced with malloc calloc realloc etc

11161555
memcpy	strcpy
check strcpy memcpy and array access first where you write to a memory which was not allocated

11161578
typedef	struct
you should actually be able to define an anonymous struct and then typedef it so

11161594
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
a quick check that can do is replace onclick with onmousedown or onmouseup and see if you alert become visible

openscenegraph	blender
from what i remember the blender 2.49 was able to import collada files and export openscenegraph files

11161600
onchange	onkeyup
i m seeing several examples online of using onchange or onkeyup but they re both old examples and they seem sorta kludgy

11161622

the parent-div for example 500x250px has width height position relative needs this and left 15px overflow hidden

11161628
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox s and google-chrome s consoles this works alerts script content

11161628

now if want to add a private method do to test it is not working anymore in neither firefox google-chrome console nor in a greasemonkey script

11161628
google-chrome	firefox
it throws an error from the firefox google-chrome console

move	drag
the spheres rotate around the point using controls but i can t get the spheres to move when i attempt to drag them

11161712
strncpy	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strncpy
you need to malloc +1 byte for a string so it can append the zero when you do strcpy but the strncpy will not append zero as well you need a extra byte for it

11161724
onchange	onkeyup

11163385
onresume	onpause
i am registering my reciver in onresume and unregistering in onpause is something is wrong with my code

11163395
daemons	systemd
garbage collection is usually a process invoked by the systemd and not invoked by the user and since this garbage collection thread usually called the daemons thread as it has lowest priority is invoked as needed by the systemd and it might thus be invoked multiple times during the lifecycle of an application if it were present in ios it would lead to a very bad battery life for the iphone as gc would sap the battery life and hence we use alloc and release commands while working with ios applications

11163436

i m running apache as my web server on linux centos

11164016
boost	stl
when i build boost 1.42 1.46.1 1.49 on os x with gcc 4.6.1 and toolset darwin i find that the resulting libraries statically include a lot of stl code such as std basic_string char and std basic_string wchar_t

11164016
boost	stl
on the os x side this is how i know that stl code has been included directly in the boost library

11164098
serializable	deserialization
the serializable works ok but the deserialization is not working

11164138

google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly fine in google-chrome firefox and ie

11164206
cos	sin	cos	exp
i may be way off track here and you may already have investigated this possibility but it could be possible that there are differences between c++ and matlab in the way that the mathematical library functions sin cos and exp that you mention are implemented internally

11164210
ienumerable	icollection
same goes for the generic ienumerable and icollection interfaces

11164225
realloc	malloc
and if you can t make assumptions about line length you can use the same technique but you ll need to malloc and realloc your buffers as you encounter lines longer than your initial size

11164240
opencv	emgucv
if want to develop with c# then take a look into emgucv project which wraps opencv for c# .net

11164245
onfocus	onblur
you don t need to put onfocus and onblur to clear the value because placeholder will do it for you

11164274
width	height
however i am not sure how the last two values work they are either right bottom or width height but neither seem to make much sense in the example provided

11164301
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg s mov.c in libavformat might help

11164310
min	max
since xlim always returns an ordered pair as long as xdir is not set to reverse you can access the elements directly using the min and max functions

11164310
min	max
use min xlim to access the first element and max xlim for the second element

11164310
min	max
if xdir is set to reverse max xlim will return the first element and min xlim the second

11164387
onfocus	onblur
i don t think that onblur can be detected but this is a code to detect onfocus

11164405
range	minimum
at each step if both indices are in range i m and j n choose minimum of a i b j and write it to c k

11164410
min	max	range	min	range	max
eg for a slider with a min max range

11164433
children	parent
the parent s to-many relationship to the children should be optional

11164451
put	get

11164473
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the not yet released 3.8.0 svn versioning of valgrind

11164475
width	height
the best solution would be to specify the width and height of each image inside a popup manually but if you can t determine the size a somewhat hacky solution would be something like this

11164494
versioning	upgrade
you ll notice that if you ever use nuget to upgrade to a newer versioning of nunit or fsunit your hintpaths will once again be stripped from the .fsproj file

11164518
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview which is programatically filled from the db not a sqldatasource or such

11164522

technically you can do it dynamically but that would require doing the registration unregistration somewhere more permanent than onresume onpause which i don t think is really what you want.

11164533
post	get
i am thinking that the dropdown list needs to be in a form which will post and the table of results needs to be in a form which will get

11164538

1 put padding on the element surrounding the text and minus the padding from the height width of the element

11164722

cydia	tweak
i m kinda new to ios developing i know c some java and beginning obj-c and thought i d try my hand at making a little tweak to be hosted on cydia

11164821
vim	emacs
i suggest alt+8 instead of because if you wanted to bend your hand in unnatural ways to press more than one modifier keys to perform a command you would probably be using emacs instead of vim

11164824
width	height
your second option doesn t mix the height width with the padding

11164824
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
internet explorer versions up to 6 and quirks mode didn t and used the alternative one which included padding as part of the width equivalent to box-sizing border-box

11164829
int	chars
i have an app set up where i convert an nsstring into an array of chars variables and i m trying to convert some of the chars to int basically to parse the numbers out of the string

uitableview	uisearchbar
i m having trouble programmatically creating a uisearchbar and uisearchdisplaycontroller for my uitableview

11164898
virtualenv	yolk
however in your case i suspect the yolk script is probably installed to usr local bin or similar - which will still be accesible after activating the virtualenv

11164898
virtualenv	yolk
if you were to install yolk in your virtualenv then that version of the yolk script would get priority in the path and everything would work as expected

11164936
vmware	virtualbox
if you are in virtualbox vmware or the like you will need to use the usb icon usually lower right of the vm window and connect the device virtually into the virtual machine

11164943
for-loop	loops
you wrote a triply-nested for-loop so the larger n gets the slower these loops get

11164982
ostringstream	std
i m trying to use std ostringstream to convert a number into a string char but it doesn t seem to be working

11165007
post	get
is it okay for me to change the new action to respond to post instead of get

11165033
udp	tcp
another caveat is that websockify only supports tcp targets websocket is tcp only right now so supporting udp targets would be a little odd anyways

11165033
irc	telnet
the websockify project actually includes two proof of concept html javascript pages to communicate with irc and telnet

11165039
google-chrome	firefox
i tried on firefox as well and it changes the url the same way google-chrome does

11165049
getter	setter
it doesn t take a json data structures for creation but the domains are very easily created using groovy and it autowires getter setter service injections etc as it is based on the spring framework

11165055
int	double
i would like to ask whether it is possible to draw a line using double variables instead of int

11165254
button	checkbox
essentially i wish to disable upload button if user has not checked the checkbox

11165310
typedef	struct
typedef are helpful because they allow you to shorten declarations so you are not always having to type the word struct

11165355
getter	setter
properties allow setting the visibility for the getter and setter individually as shown above

11165360
accessor	properties
changing from a field to a properties requires a recompile in assemblies referencing yours since the get and set accessor are actually methods. as pst s comment showed you can also assign different access modifiers to the get and set protected set

11165394
margin	height
you also need to set a height that is greater than the negative top margin so part of the element will be visible so the user can hover over it

11165404
hash	md5
md5 hash and filesize is a good not to mention small comparison

11165414

considering that the lab sql server was a virtual machine with relatively weak configuration 4gb ram shared with other vms disk sybsystem i was expecting to get significantly better throughput on the physical machine but it didn t happen or lets say the performance increase was negligible

11165835
opera	firefox

everyauth	node.js	express	everyauth	express	node.js
i m successfully using node.js + express + everyauth to login to facebook twitter etc

11170506
express	everyauth
the problem i m trying to wrap my head around is that everyauth seems to be configure and forget. i set up a single everyauth object and configure it to act as middleware for express and then forget about it

11170531
folder	directory
i found the solution the images folder should be placed in client bin folder that is located in the website directory

11170538
folder	directory
i want to upload a single image with carrierwave the thing is it is uploading the file and saving it into the directory uploads in this folder it creates another folder called tmp and in the tmp folder it creates another folder which includes the image

qobject	qmetaobject
whenever you want to use signals and slots in qobject derived classes or need something else which uses the qmetaobject you need to add

11170579
express	everyauth
basically i just had to create my own custom express middleware to switch the everyauth configuration before the everyauth gets its grubby paws on the request so.

11170591

google-chrome	firefox
this works in the google-chrome browser but if firefox it takes me to the index

11170878
google-chrome	firefox
the reason that it works on google-chrome but not on firefox is due to google-chrome s behavior of removing the last slash when submitting the request

11170885

you can use other operators such as min max etc. in a similar fashion

11170915
width	height
i need to height to fit my screen too as width do

11170993

divs or any element which has display block by default have 100 width and auto height defined by its content so when you say you want 50 height that doesn t mean anything because 50 of auto is 0

11171015
centos	linux
i m new to linux centos and i m not having the most fun using it

11171029
google-chrome	firefox
for example it s about 50 faster to access an object s key through the dot synthax obj.key than the asociative array like one in google-chrome while in firefox it s the other way around

11171037
fgets	feof
alternatively you can use the standard file functions fopen feof fgets and fclose to open the file and read it line by line keeping a count as you go like so

11171037
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you will need to parse it yourself with something similar to this function which checks each line in a file given by its file pointer against a specific case-sensitive using strpos you can use stripos for case-insensitive searching

11171043
folder	directory
or if you just want to copy the folder without deleting the first directory you ll need to do it manually

11171115
versioning	upgrade
yes on linux systems it is not a good idea to upgrade default python which is 2.4.x versioning and linux package management and many other tools require it to function correctly

11171115
rpm	yum
since you can not use yum or rpm to bootstrap your packages i suggest that you use your os installation cd or iso image to install the rpm yum packages directly

11171132
ssl	https
turn off 443 if you need https ssl access

11171152

for example a performance oriented language might decide to implicitly convert the double to int because it prefers performance by default

11171520
put	get
it s very simple when i put an id in img and get this src very easy

11171522
pull	push
a slightly deprecated way to store shorthands to be used to specify url to git fetch git pull and git push commands is to store a file in branches and give name to these commands in place of repository argument

11171549
jar	war
everything is bundled in a war file containing jsp files other web resources class files under web-inf classes and jar files under web-inf lib

11171551
hide	show
if you use a uisegmentedcontrol you could have two uiview objects for your two screens you can create them in interface builder or build them programmatically and then you could just hide show or addsubview removefromsuperview as you jump between them

11171572
postgresql	mysql
one way to get around this is to create your own interfaces interface query interface access for all the queries accesses that you plan on doing and then have a query factory which can instantiate based on the db dialect mysql postgresql etc and create mysqlqueryimpl and postgresqueryimpl both implementing the query interface

11171608
mp4	h.264
minimally you must use mp4 + h.264 with aac or mp3

11171608
google-chrome	safari
mp4 video plays natively in safari google-chrome and ie9 vista windows 7

11171608
vorbis	webm	vp8	ogg
beyond that use either webm + vp8 or ogg + theora with vorbis audio for other browsers

cassandra	accumulo
i ll also note that accumulo hbase and cassandra all have essentially the same data model

11171821
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
surprisingly on google-chrome safari and opera the value is false unfortunately i don t have accees to machine with windows to check what ie thinks about it

11171821
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
apperantly google-chrome s safari s and opera s element object doesn t contain such a method

11171826
fadein	fadeout
to view some plugins that showcase the fadein fadeout slide effect view

11171838
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has an entirely different extensions api to firefox so you can t take code from one and expect it to just work in the other

11171846
int	double
file a is main.cpp while the other two contain a function each file b contains foo file c contains foo int double

11171846
int	double
what i would like to do is link the 3 files so main in file a can call foo in file b which in should call foo int double in file c

11171908
dumpsys	adb
output from adb shell dumpsys alarm show this so it seems the intent is being called

11171959
width	height
i m not sure if the width and height calculation in the first half of the showpopup method is correct

11171977
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this page works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie i have ie9 and opera updated last night the text-area shoots the boundary significantly

11171984
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
so all you need is to create a uiviewcontroller which implements shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation and sets this controller as a rootviewcontroller to your uiwindow

11172019
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox but when i view it in google-chrome and safari the and elements jitter up and down a bit

to do this i will be using json api to get all the latest post content in a json format

11172111
express	node.js
i am trying to make my android 4.0 app accept cookies from a node.js express server using mongoose-auth for authentication

11172123
integer	unsigned
since the biggest integer that can be stored is 2 32 -1 assuming unsigned and you are exceeding that value you get scrambled numbers

11172179
int	chars
interface a has a method public int data and interface b has a method public chars data

11172179
implements	extends
as i presume this is one of the major reasons why we are not allowed to extends more than one class then why are we allowed to implements more than one interface when this problem still persists

11172186
awt	swing
don t mix swing awt components without good reason

11172208
typedef	struct
usually in c you would typedef the struct to avoid typing struct everywhere

11172219
typedef	struct	typedef	typename
or use a typedef to make a typename that you can use without saying struct .

11172225
super	implements
the multiple inheritance in java is not allowed as there is complex problems such as define which implementation should take place when method is implements by two or more super classes

the way i did it it works flawlessly in firefox but doesn t work in any webkit-based browser google-chrome safari

11172344
width	height
but these image objects would perhaps only contain height width imagetype and a path to where the cached image should be

11172384
innodb	myisam
although you might be tempted to use a myisam table to be able to use a fulltext index this is possible in innodb too

11172384
innodb	myisam
it will be a bit harder to implement it this way but it will combine the high-performance text searching that myisam offers with all the benefits of innodb transactions row-level locking etc.

11172386
screens	tablet
when tablet is connected by the wire charger usb the wifi doesn t sleep when the device is unpluged the wifi goes sleep and when i ulock the screens the icon of the wifi is blue but i don t have internet connection sometimes the icon is grey and i dont have internet too

11172570
children	parent
i assume you re using storyboards. you would have your parent view controller with two children list map

11172579
folder	directory
at the very least there will be files and folder specific to the theme located in the following directory

11172582
mdpi	hdpi
it is in res drawable and in all the other folders mdpi hdpi etc.

11172593
width	font-size
what i think is happening in internet explorer is that the font-size is being changed to 1.2em before the width of #pad is calculated

11172593
google-chrome	firefox
so the width in firefox and google-chrome is where as in ie the width is

11172617
stdout	stderr
stderr of the inner command group is redirected to stdout so that it applies to the inner substitution

11172617
stdout	stderr
next the stdout of out is assigned to y and the redirected stderr is captured by x without the usual loss of y to a command substitution s subshell

11172720
min	max
probably well after the fact but - based pretty much on what you show above respects jqm themeing min max values

11172724
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
you must have imagemagick or graphicsmagick installed

11172726

11172847
np-hard	np-complete
this problem is known to be np-hard by a reduction from the np-complete problem of decomposing a graph into cliques the clique cover problem

11172847
np-hard	np-complete
consequently the known np-complete problem of clique cover can be reduced to your problem in polynomial time so your problem is np-hard

11172851
int	boolean
other primitive data types such as boolean number int and uint

11172851
int	boolean
null to variables of type boolean number int or uint

11172903
youtube	vimeo
you could parse the youtube and vimeo links and replace it on your side with code that properly embeds their ios html5 versions

11172983
boost	stl
second i would try to check whether qt stl boost this particular version of whatever can handle strings that large

11172984
min	max
no min max blending there may be an extension for this

11172995
post	get
so for instance when you click on things it is passing in the url to get the specific relative post

11173028
qgroupbox	qcheckbox
i am designing a custom widget which is basically a qgroupbox holding a configurable number of qcheckbox buttons where each one of them should control a particular bit in a bitmask represented by a qbitarray

11173032
udp	tcp
i know few mechanisms from low-level solutions - shared memory c c++ linux pipe sockets tcp udp etc

11173119
addclass	removeclass
i ve tried using addclass and removeclass so it s known which to start from but still wont work

11173150
google-chrome	firefox	mp4	webm
the solution is...if mp4 is supported by ie then you will also need to have a webm or ogg version of the same video file to ensure cross-browser support of the video firefox google-chrome

11173249
width	height
however when i changed my screen orientation to landscape my appwidget s width and height changing automatically by the home screen launcher and the problem is in landscape mode my widget s height is not set properly by the homescreen launcher

11173299
gesturedetector	motionevent
i would recommend either a gesturedetector this supports double tapping and other gestures or a basic touch listener uses motionevent which doesn t have double tap but you could implement this yourself

11173302
min	max
setting the icon size and or the button s min and max sizes isn t helping

11173314
post	get
or get post that have ids greater than 9 id 9

uiview	subviews	uilabel	uibutton
for some reason the mysterious reordering animation from apple cant capture simple uiview but with uiimageviews uibutton and uilabel as subviews of the custom tableviewcell the animation works like expected...creepy

11173460
min	max
to do that first convert your colors to hsv and run the same algorithm as above but with h s and v instead of rgb but keep in mind that s and v have a min of 0 and max of 1 while h is represented in degrees between 0 and 360

11173477
comparator	comparable
i m working on implementing a hierarchy which deals with comparator and the comparable interface

11173484
switching	screens
in order to prevent automatic switching to a newly created window try altering your invocation of screens to something like the following

11173530
post	put
i would not create post method inside the model although having it in the controller is perfectly fine simply because you just put code model in such a frame that is not re-usable plus less readable

11173571
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
you would need to write getter and setter accessors and mutators if you prefer in the library class which will allow the item variable to be read updated by other classes even though it is declared as private

11173572
mongodb	bson	hash	md5
if you re just looking for a unique server id you could take the mongodb bson approach and use the first n bytes of the md5 hash of the server s host name

11173688
width	height
i would like both boxes to be the same height but want the div width height to be determined by their content not specifying a width height in pixels

11173692
g++	gcc
the last thing that might cause issues is the version of gcc and g++

11173692
g++	gcc
long story short make sure the pointers gcc and g++ in usr bin and subsequently usr local cuda bin are pointing to gcc-4.5 and g++-4.5 can get these with apt-get since they are the most recent versions supported by nvcc

11173731
children	parent
so you can compute the children from the index of the parent node without actually needing to store the index

11173732
folder	directory
and we only want 100 files per directory it will download them to folder something like

11173741
draggable	droppable
when i drag the draggable the element containing the droppable keeps getting triggered because it s also a droppable even though it s behind the droppable and they re stacked right on each other

11173817
hide	show
to do not show this again set your cookie to never show this again check if this cookie is set when page loads and hide the noification if that s the case

11173851
subtraction	multiplication
i am flexible in the return type but i will doing a lot of subtraction multiplication using another list

11173860
inherited	properties
in the get section of the inherited properties you could throw a notimplementedexception

11173868
uniq	grep
for a file of a million entries which i pass through a grep sed combination to remove parameters - resulting in about 150 unique lines - i spend about 3 seconds grepping sedding and about 15s sorting uniq ing

11173870
cpu	processors
cpu speed dependent assume that on a ghz class processors preemption of the garbage collector is less than 1 microsecond

11173871
int	double
edit since the value can have decimal places as you ve commented you need to parse it to double round it and then cast it to int

11173882
folder	directory
assuming you have in your header search paths - the solution is just to move the boost folder to your include directory

11173897
g++	gcc
g++ is a program that calls gcc and treats .c .h and .i files as c++ source files instead of c source files unless -x is used and automatically specifies linking against the c++ library

11173897
g++	gcc
run gcc on c files and g++ on c++ files

11173897
g++	gcc
in both cases you will need to link with g++ or gcc -lstdc++

11173926
firefox	safari
you can probably do it like this works in ie8 and better in firefox in safari

11173937
quicksort	timsort
you ll likely find that quicksort isn t as attractive as the built-in timsort

11174007
post	get
for content running in adobe air when using the navigatetourl function the runtime treats a urlrequest that uses the post method one that has its method property set to urlrequestmethod.post as using the get method

11174046
width	height	client-side	server-side
content can then be applied to correct columns either server-side getting image height width is trivial just balance how dynamic it has to be or on the client-side w ajax before appending content

11174054
x86	mips
in place of use one of armeabi armeabi-v7a x86 or mips - depending on how .so file has been built

11174063
screens	hdpi
when i have small screens but hdpi resolution buttons fonts are going out of shape

11174063
screens	hdpi
because i have bigger font size for hdpi screens and it goes smaller with ldpi screens

11174063
screens	hdpi
but when small screens has hdpi resolution android picks font size from hdpi folder and messes up font size

11174063
width	height
it becomes big and outgrows the screen width height

11174087
inherited	subclassing
let s say that class a1 a2 and a3 all inherited from class a with some additional methods that may be unique to each subclassing

11174093
apache	nginx
many people find that running nginx as a proxy in front of apache to be an ideal middle ground

11174093
apache	nginx
in short you get the low-resource benefits of nginx coupled with the wide feature-set of apache

11174117
slideup	slidedown
just use by default it uses slidedown and slideup

11174150
g++	gcc
if you are going to compile both c and c++ you are better off compiling always with gcc it will choose the language based on the file extension than g++ will always compile as c++

11174150
g++	gcc
you will need to change your linker options to include c++ standard library and -lm if you use it as those are automatically added by g++ but not gcc

11174150
g++	gcc
alternatively a better option is to call the g++ for c++ and gcc for c files

11174152
onstart	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
implemented lifecycle methods oncreate onresume onpause onstart onstop ondestroy

11174225
post	get
for a blogging app i m trying to get a list of all months in which post have been published but find a wrong set of months rendered in the template

11174248
versioning	upgrade
now when they try to upgrade to your new versioning of your library they get a bunch of real errors because they can t call those private methods anymore

11174266
couchbase	couchdb
i ve been flip-flopping between using couchdb and using couchbase server for an android game that i m developing and the lack of documentation is frustrating

11174266
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase mobile - a mobile implementation of couchdb --legacy

11174286
implements	extends
to do that i create custom classes that implements some interfaces or that extends the default classes spring uses

11174307
getter	setter
and of course i created the appropriate getter and setter

11174320
min	max
setup two doubles one for min one for max

11174320
min	max
then in each iteration set each to the min max of the existing min max and the current object in the iteration

11174331
getter	setter
best practice is to make fields private and defined getter and or setter methods as required for external classes to access modify them

11174332
sorting	filtering
for many object types for batch editing you can quickly generate a script for multiple objects using object explorer details and sorting and or filtering within that view

11174336
pull	push
before you can push your local changes to github you need to fetch or pull your remote changes merge the changes locally merging is automatic with pull and then push to the remote

11174355
winpcap	libpcap
neither tcpdump nor tshark can arbitrarily choose a link-layer header type for a device as the devices and thus libpcap winpcap don t allow arbitrary link-layer header types to be chosen as informed you

11174355
packets	pcap
for example if you re capturing on a device with a dlt_ value of dlt_en10mb ethernet just throw away all packets that don t have 0x0800 or 0x86dd as the ethernet type value and strip off the first 14 bytes of packets that do have those ethernet type values and write the resulting packets out in a pcap file with a dlt_ value of dlt_raw

11174359
google-chrome	firefox
the issue should be easily reproducible using the below xul and simply entering the path to the xul in the firefox location bar given its google-chrome url similar to this

11174381
post	get
submit function updates values in a mysql database and returns the results i ve been told to use json for this but every json function i ve tried i cant get it to post the data and receive it

11174405
fadein	fadeout
inside settimeout use fadeout and fadein to create a little animation effect

11174447
children	parent
i want that the bounding box of parent includes its children s bounding boxes regardless of their position attribute

11174451
cifilter	uiimage
the original image stores absolutely fine with my code but when i try to filter it with cifilter the resulting uiimage filteredimage is 0x0 pixels in size

11174482
put	get
a direct buffer holds the data in jni land so get and put have to cross the jni boundary

11174510
mouse	keyboard
i haven t found a clear answer on google and the reason i ask is because iv e heard the preferred method of getting keyboard and mouse input is by using the window event system..

11174521
post	get
there are a number of post on how to get set the height of hidden elements this and this

11174524
submit	submission
with some hacking i did manage to get firefox to see two forms but submission the inner one submit the outer one

11174536
int	double
because youÃ¢ re trying to put a double into an int array regardless of being accessed through a number reference

11174536
put	get
get put principle

11174536
puts	gets
it only gets items from the source and it only puts items in the destiny

11174543
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
however i need to present the same view as a model and it does not have a uinavigationcontroller or need one so i just add a uinavigationbar like so

11174546
postgresql	mysql
it works fine in development on a mysql database but i uploaded it to heroku which uses postgresql

11174563
jobs	cron
i have read in blogs that passenger kills threads specifically around cron jobs

11174574
google-chrome	firefox	put	get
especially bad is that both google-chrome and firefox not only ignore put and delete but send a get request in its place exposing all the form variables in the uri

11174591
super	extends
the use of wildcards super and extends is for type arguments that is you declare them at the call site when you re actually defining the corresponding value of a type parameter

11174591
super	extends
whe you a declare a reference of type list at the call site you are allowed to provide a type argument for t which can be an invariant or a wildcard with super or with extends

11174598
for-loop	arrays
i have 2 functions running in a for-loop because i want to find the solution of the functions in random arrays

11174602
inherited	properties
so then i made them inherited abstractlistview which would in it s turn inherited from abstractview which would be the new class holding all the common properties for these tables

11174745
min	max
the biggest obstacle for me is that each variable has a different min max and step value

11174760
width	height
i have the same code for a full screen graph the hosting view is the same size as the parent uiview and its height and width are both fine

11174761
clang	llvm
apple s clang llvm distribution is customized as ildjarn pointed out.

11174762
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller keeps a list stack of the uiviewcontroller s you have pushed onto it and the automatic back button it displays takes you one step down in the stack

11174766
put	get
i ask for to put it on the list but if i ask for more than one all the list items get the last one

11174777
client-side	server-side
the distinction here is between server-side and client-side code

11174780
width	height
particularly the width because often times the stylesheet denotes the height already

11174796
awt	swing
this is done for awt but should be avoided for swing

11174800
public	protected
i have a page or set of pages that are not intended for public distribution i just make sure to make them password protected

11174862
hide	show
to hide and show controls i would either recommend using expanders as your comment says you ve done or grids and setting their visibility as needed

11174895
crypt	salt
the short answer is use crypt with a salt beginning with the characters 2a a two digit cost parameter and 22 digits from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

11174900
serializable	deserialization
if this is the case you ll have to add actual methods to mypoint do the serializable and probably the deserialization too

11174911
mocha	node.js
this is probably due to the fact that mocha was first meant to support node.js

11174955
folder	directory
anyway enough pretense what i want to do is take sub1.domain.com and make it automatically use another folder outside of root as the default loading directory

11174992
min	max
it seems from your comments and code that the sorting routine is just supposed to print the min and max values of

11174997
preorder	inorder
python 2.7 i need to print the bfs of a binary tree with a given preorder and inorder and a max lenght of the strings of preorder and inorder

11175000
lxml	beautifulsoup
try using mechanize or beautifulsoup or lxml

11175006
capistrano	rvm	ubuntu	linux
my environment rails 3.2.x with rvm passenger apache on linux ubuntu i am not using capistrano and not intending to do so for the time being

11175098
apache	nginx
you probably already have apache or another instance of nginx bound to port 80

11175102
preorder	inorder
i guess essentially the question is how to get all the parent-leftchild pairs and parent-rightchild pairs of the tree from given preorder and inorder

11175102
preorder	inorder
for your example preorder abcde inorder cbdae

11175102
preorder	inorder
b is right after a in preorder and b is in front of a in inorder thus b is the left child of a

11175102
preorder	inorder
d is right after c in preorder but d is also after c in inorder thus d is not the left child of c

11175146
keydown	keyup
try to set the value on keyup keydown and blur event of the textbox

11175163
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari can t use the tags for swapping between songs but google-chrome can

11175163
google-chrome	safari
just changing what gets loaded into the src attribute on the tag works on both google-chrome and safari but then there is the ogg vs

11175163
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	mp3	ogg
mp3 issue is to use modernizr does feature detection to load the ogg mime-type in firefox and the mp3 in google-chrome safari

11175230
16-bit	64bit
one transaction for word of size 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit 64bit or two

11175230
cpu	processors
both cache and local memory - are closer to the processors or gpu than dram main memory - whether that be the gpu s private dram or the cpu s system memory

11175265
throttling	throttle
since i assume you won t need the flexibility for the blacklist but might for the throttling use iptables to blacklist and use nginx to throttle

11175275
filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
unfortunately there s no support for sorting a collection view in win8 nor filtering or grouping

11175301
uiview	subviews
or if there are a group of subviews that are always going to move together you could put them in a container uiview and thus move a whole bunch of them by just moving their container view

11175326
width	font-size
i think i know the drill for regular screens set body s font-size to some percentage mark your main content element with width being 70em and min-width 40em.

11175346
datalist	repeater	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist
nested gridview or datalist repeater is what you need

11175346
gridview	rowdatabound
handle the rowdatabound event of parent gridview to bind its child elements controls

11175360
division	addition
in addition to be shown above i want to display the total number of employees in each division and the percent completion in each division too

11175378
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

11175429
getter	setter
you need to add getter and setter in your java bean

11175452
put	get
where to put the select scope_identity statement if i want to get the last inserted identity i put it inside other insert into query but i get nothing

11175477
put	get
you have to use the let statement to get the list out of the listbag so that you can put the tuple you didn t touch back in front of it

11175478
quicksort	heapsort
introsort begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the number of elements being sorted

11175485
post	get
in my post json call i get id s for the categories like this where 1 and 4 is the ids

11175485
inherited	properties
i have a custom post model object that inherited from nsmanagedobject in it i have a properties for categories like this

11175487
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

11175489
folder	directory
or do i need to copy the sound file out of my www directory and into my resources folder and access it there

11175513
atomic	interlocked
these operations are not atomic that s why the interlocked class exists in the first place with methods like increment int32 and increment int64

11175638
nhibernate	queryover
i want to update only some columns say n-1 columns in a table containing n columns using nhibernate queryover syntax

11175640
quicksort	heapsort
the point at which the introsort algorithm switches from quicksort to heapsort is determined by depth_limit

11175640
quicksort	heapsort
when depth_limit reaches 0 it switches from quicksort to heapsort

11175664
quicksort	heapsort
algorithm switches to heapsort from quicksort to keep the worst case

11175681
post	put
if i put self loaddata after the line with the post the app crashes probably because the post is not yet finished and there is a conflict

11175681
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
i am using an nsmanagedobject to save the data but sending a newly created nsobject communityotherprofile back to the server

11175778
post	get
this way the user can get a post in the normal way

11175814
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using a responsive caroufredsel works like a charm in google-chrome firefox but in safari it is suddenly producing top and bottom margins of 800px throwing everything off

11175841
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then uiviewcontroller has a property navigationcontroller to access this uinavigationcontroller and push pop other view controllers to the stack

11175862
put	get
here s my take on it with caching of the selectors that get recalled and the obvious closure scope which is why i put the in there you will have better overall performance

11175908
free	malloc
another reason is this might try to free something which is not allocated by malloc

11175958
firefox	safari
this works in safari but not in firefox where it gives me a invalid range in character class

11175966
button	checkbox
the activity starts you disable the first checkbox one button button 2 is added to the layout you change the screen orientation and button 2 added in the onclicklistener method disappears

11175981
crypt	hash
here s how i hash my password using phps crypt method

11175995
floating-point	integer
the finite nonzero values of any floating-point value set can all be expressed in the form s Ã¢ m Ã¢ 2 e - n + 1 where s is +1 or -1 m is a positive integer less than 2n and e is an integer between emin - 2k-1-2 and emax 2k-1-1 inclusive and where n and k are parameters that depend on the value set

11176020
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
take a look at the php documentation for crypt as you are not supplying a salt value you will get strage results often ending up with the hash of one value not matching with another hash of the same value

11176068
cvs	svn
you are suffering from cvs svn habits in your work-flow and especially from the big patch mindset

11176068
pull	push
so instead of code code code code push pull merge scream you should do something more manageable

11176068
changeset	cherry-pick
if you start treating git commits as patches and branches as patch queues you ll end up with a work-flow where people can cherry-pick or merge small changeset among repositories without getting a migraine

11176071
qabstractlistmodel	qmodelindex
this is the most important thing to realize when working with qabstractlistmodel in qt mentally replace qmodelindex with int row ignore everything else it has an invalid qmodelindex has

11176071
qabstracttablemodel	qmodelindex
same for qabstracttablemodel mentally reduce the qmodelindex to int row int column

11176071
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
the only time you need the full qmodelindex including its internalpointer or internalid is when you implement a tree model qabstractitemmodel

11176112
submit	submission
also for submission the form i am using a link as i have added some effect to it and if i use input type submit for this it will get formatted with uniform

11176146
firefox	safari
i try to align a button and a text input on one level but i get different results in firefox aligned properly and safari not aligned properly

11176229
uipagecontrol	uibutton
during loadview i am creating 20 uibutton s that i would like to change the title text of depending on the state of a uipagecontrol

11176264
webkit	gecko
webkit and gecko render the heights of the text field differently that s for sure

11176344
rspec	minitest
personally i use rspec at work because the majority of the team likes it and use ruby 1.9 s minitest for my private projects

11176349
implements	modifiers
since the properties do not support async await modifiers as far as i know iÃ¢ m struggling to implements a proper solution

11176387
nsstring	nsdata
this class is intended for storing only small amounts of data using the property list object types nsnumber nsstring nsdate nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary

11176431
cat	tee
assuming you can cat your input from a file or just using the tee part if you want it interactive-ish you could use something like this

11176450
inherited	properties
in experimenting with this i noticed that if you want to make a baseviewcontroller that implements this functionality to work for everything that inherited from it you have to attach another view on top of the uiviewcontroller s view properties in order to get it to work

11176501
foreground	tray
the former is used for something more than just an icon and in most cases which is very system dependent a background process and placed by the user into the tray bar where your tray icon is put in the system tray bar by a foreground application.

11176523
submit	submission
examples include html form submission and the jquery submit function

11176566
put	get
if you want to role-your-own the simplest way would be to simply put checks in your controller that makes sure they get redirected if they try to look at a profile that isn t theirs

11176664
uitableview	reloaddata
all fine but now i would like to change the displayed data using the reloaddata method of uitableview

11176698
int	chars
in my program i compare chars against hexadecimal int and i get different results for

11176735
int	chars
although int promotions will still happen to both operands of at least they will happen in the same way and you will not be depending on the signedness of your chars of the size of your int or unsigned int

11176735
int	chars
i believe that it is common for arm compilers to make chars unsigned which means that when xcc is promoted to an int you get the value 0xcc not 0xffffffcc

11176777
integer	unsigned
the equality operator performs integer promotions of both operands so the difference of the behavior when is considered as signed sign extension is performed or unsigned no sign extension is performed

11176784
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x12df1810 pointer being free was not allocated

11176819
post	get
it was looking so odd simply because the cache is only parsed on get calls and ignored on post calls

11176834
opera	firefox
it won t make a big difference in firefox and webkit but will show up correctly in opera

11176863
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried see code below but of course at least in google-chrome and in firefox it doesn t work as expected

11176885
spaces	delimiter
in freeswitch arguments passed to lua scripts are spaces delimiter see

11176913
stdout	stderr
you use handles for stdin stdout and stderr

11176938
width	height
i am trying to get the height and width of an image in windows phone...but there are few syntax errors

11176985
hash	md5
i have a python program that takes the md5 sha1 hash values of passwords and searches for them on the internet using google s custom search api

11177014
button	checkbox
also avoid using variable names such as checkbox label submit button etc since they would create problems which becomes hard to find

11177017
put	get
next we want to get the response and put it into an object model that makes it easy to work with

11177020
voip	sip
it is not possible because voip call pass through internet and via sip server

11177065
google-chrome	safari
as tim pointed out webkit browsers safari google-chrome rely on this being console in this case

11177088
hide	show
i have the following unordered list i want to hide when not hovered over and show when hovered over

11177118
debian	linux
downloaded play-2.0.2-rc2.zip and extracted that to my debian linux box

11177137
16-bit	64bit
if the result of an 8-bit or 16-bit operation is intended for 64bit address calculation explicitly sign-extend the register to the full 64bit

11177149
unix	aix
note that this is just the generic unix crypt that aix tries to emulate

11177189
submit	submission
i have a web page when i click to submit button that will submit an redirect to second page meanwhile i am updating that record during submission proccess

11177194
post	get
so they do not get bored reading your post and leave half way through

11177201
hide	show
in fact if i use the first syntax to hide the nav bar then i cannot use the second syntax to show it it simply won t do anything

11177201
hide	show
moreover the first syntax to show hide the nav bar always works for me while the second syntax works some times but not always

11177239
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
since uinavigationbar is a subclassing of uiview it inherited the hidden bool properties no way of changing it to protected or private

11177239
hide	show
you can hide and show the navigation bar

11177252
width	height
seen as the table has thousands of rows i d like to not set the src width and height of the image in html and instead do this with css using a class

11177252
google-chrome	firefox
however while this work fine in google-chrome it doesn t in firefox

11177278
put	get
if you put them in the end they will only get whatever couldn t fit the regular arguments

11177317
pthreads	fork
ps i should use only pthreads and not fork as required by an university project

11177321
rtp	rtcp
also you should take a look at the rtcp protocol for controlling an rtp stream

11177356
translation	localization
check if you have translation and localization enabled in your settings.py

11177385
width	height
i found height width solution square shaped layout in linearlayout in square form

11177419
for-loop	loops
i have a batch file that have a for-loop in it in loops i must wait for process to end

11177456
opera	google-chrome
opera google-chrome

11177456
opera	google-chrome
in opera google-chrome it shows me a warning when i exceed value 6 and i can t proceed

11177456
firefox	safari
in safari ie firefox it does not show any warnings and proceeds to checkout

11177466
xlwt	xlutils
if you easy_install pip xlutils you ll get both the xlrd reading and xlwt writing libraries

11177486
perfview	xperf
use xperf or perfview to capture managed stacks

11177503
width	height
i have emoticons in a css sprite image that i want to display within text so i have spans inserted with background definitions but as these spans are inline elements i can not define the width and height

versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade resharper from 5 versioning to 6 versioning

11177518
multiplying	transpose
it contains matrix multiplying inverse transpose and determinant

11177519
versioning	upgrade
i was using eclipse when it said that my versioning 10 sdk needs to be upgrade to above 17 so i upgrade to the latest vestion on sdk tools versioning 19

11177595
children	parent
i don t think it s a bubbling issue because the event is bound to the parent element and not to the children

11177643
int	boolean
as i said in my comment the reason your current example won t compile is because file.mkdir returns a boolean and comparable.compareto comparable returns an int

11177681
put	get
i get no out put

11177699
mouse	keyboard
when i physically click on the arrows with my mouse everything works just fine but for some reason when using the keyboard it doesn t work

11177722
width	height
create a wrapper with a fixed size lets say width 200px and height 100px i use a wrapper so that its easier to adjust the position of the divs inside it

11177774
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i use the setinterval function in a website and it works fine in ie google-chrome firefox and safari

11177788

11177853
pop-up	dialog	button	checkbox
i have a program where you click a button and a dialog pop-up with a bunch of checkbox

11177864
hash	salt
is a combination of the salt and the hash

11177864
hash	salt
the remaining characters are the hash when used with the 2a algorithm cost of 10 and the given salt

11177864
hash	salt
the reason for the salt is so an attacker cannot pre compute bcrypt hash in order to avoid paying the cost of generating them

11177866
hash	salt
bcrypt stores the salt in the password hash

11177866
hash	salt
those are two different hash of the same password with two different salt

11177866
hash	salt
when verifying the passwords bcrypt will read the salt from the hash field then re-compute the hash using that salt

11177874
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception
no value but no nullreferenceexception and then oops invalidoperationexception

11177885
folder	directory
you can also check it by finding the apk file in the bin directory unpacking it it s just a renamed zip file and ensuring that lib armeabi folder contains the gdbserver file

11177894
onfocus	onblur
as answer to you and to mageek comment you should check the onfocus event and the onblur event it is possible prefered using jquery

11177942
postgresql	mysql
this backend can be csv mysql postgresql sqlite and other databases through the cdr_odbc module

11177954
folder	directory
now there s folder in my users directory and the node version still isn t up to date even though nvm says it s using 0.6.19

11177987
setcontentview	findviewbyid
please note that setcontentview must be called first in your activity before you can use findviewbyid

11178013
google-chrome	firefox
notes this works for me in firefox google-chrome and ie9 which is all that i m supporting

11178026
implements	extends
i don t want to make a class that extends by basicgame or basicgamestate i just want to implements it straight into my main-class

11178097
inherited	subclassing
any subclassing will inherited nearest up its hierarchy

11178106
folder	directory
check your home directory for any local or lib or include folder and delete any node or node_modules from there

11178114
post	get
but when you redirect you obviously cannot invoke the post action because redirect means get

11178130
jgit	egit
if you user name and email are correctly set then it can be an egit or jgit bug

11178164
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
what happened to me was that i had move a properties in a table per hierarchy inherited from one of the subclassing to the base class and forgot to update the model

11178168
pop-up	dialog
i ve been creating a video games website in mcv 3 using visual studio and am having trouble figuring out how to pass a id from my page to a pop-up dialog to display the correct developer from my database

11178203
hide	show
when you click the button it actually hide the element at first but the event propagate up to the parent element at which you catch the click and show it again

11178204
hide	show
you should use jquery .show and hide to show hide elements

11178209
draggable	droppable
these proxy elements are made draggable and droppable

11178248
google-chrome	firefox
i get identical results with firefox google-chrome and ie so i guess it s somethign related to the generated kml file but i have no clue what s wrong

11178257
getter	setter
as far as the second question about properties consider that the role of synthesize is to create for you the setter getter methods based on the attributes you assigned to the property

11178257
getter	setter
the advantage of this approach with respect to the default one is that you cannot confuse accessing to a property using the setter getter methods and the ivar directly that is you cannot make possible mistakes like

11178356
groupbox	panel
a label panel groupbox can contain other control like button but textbox cant

11178398
folder	directory
it s more probable that you have created the folder in the web directory somewhere such as var www img uploads photos or home caboone public_html img uploads photos

11178416
ubuntu	linux
i am running this on a linux os ubuntu

11178417
width	height
where the actual image can be upto maximum height of 300px and width of 225px

11178417
width	height
the width and height of the item box including the image and the text is 190px x 190px i m using this image

11178417
hide	show
i tried using overflow hidden for the image item to hide it s height below to show the image text

11178444
readonly	temporary
while on the grub menu line of the kernel you wish to boot press e to temporary edit it and delete options such as quiet and splash but leave the readonly

11178467
put	get
how you get it into a namespace i m really not sure - perhaps put it in a module then making names up now from random_testing import random instead of the normal import random

11178485
winbugs	openbugs
winbugs or openbugs can be called from within r. i will append the code to this answer as i go along

11178488
width	height
try this for variable width and height you will need to use some javascript

11178505
directx	directwrite
i m considering maybe using directwrite for a project that will be coming in a directx 11 version and a opengl 3.1+ version

11178505
directwrite	direct2d	direct3d	directx	direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	directwrite	directx	direct2d	directx	directwrite
from what understand directwrite uses direct2d which sits on top of direct3d 10.1 until directx 11.1 is released

11178505
direct3d	directwrite
this means that to use directwrite with direct3d 11 currently i would have to create one direct3d 10.1 device and a direct3d 11 device and then share the resources between these two devices which comes with some synchronization overhead it seems

11178505
directwrite	direct2d
i m not that familiar with either directwrite and direct2d as you can probably tell

11178543
post	get
you could pass request parameters as a query string in the get request url or in the post request body

11178564
rar	zip
in one of my applications a user can upload images and archives zip rar

11178582
jena	rdflib
jena and sesame are you best bets for implementations both in java but for prototyping python rocks and rdflib is the must use tool there

11178597
unsigned	short
because server sent 149 as unsigned short 2 bytes

11178597
unsigned	short
instead of this i would like to receive unsigned short ofc after restarting my application

11178625
hide	show
right now when the page loads the default drop down is show however once you hover over other menu items if they dont have a drop down menu it show the default one and hide and if you quickly go over the the menu item it will keep repeating the animation

11178671
post	get
render that action in your view based on the panelid and call that action via ajax to get the new html rather than doing a full form post

11178672
codeigniter	yii
my projection is to build a web service that can be read on my android apps and any web framework like codeigniter or yii but i want it to be implemented on android first

11178725
ada	pascal
it s forgotten in java but i think java is wrong because in all block structured languages it is authorized to do this not only in c++ but also in pascal ada c and so on... and sometime we want to hide a variable of the enclosing block

11178734
ant	maven
ant is a good start but you may also want to look at apache ivy or maven as these will help a bit with managing your build outputs and dependencies

11178736
free	malloc
of course if you malloc some pointer inside a loop you usually want to free that pointer at the end of the body of the loop

11178736
free	malloc
you could use boehm s conservative garbage collector to avoid them by using gc_malloc instead of malloc and not bothering for free -ing explicitly memory

11178763
interbase	bde
you have other installers around like interbase and bde on windows 7 or bde installer on these embarcadero days

11178771
getter	setter
there a getter and setter for string response and query have been written not showed here

11178811
width	height
finally my layout is just a textview with nothing special just width and height

11178837
width	height
and call this drawable to a relative layout or something as background also specifying its layout height and layout width in xml

11178857
jobs	cron
so what i was thinking about is a proxy script so instead of doing the above cron jobs i would do something like

11178858
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to use a php captcha to validate a contact form on a site and i ve hit a brick wall for the past few days where the form works fine on firefox google-chrome safari but not ie

11178896
backgrounding	multitasking
behaviour of threads when entering backgrounding in ios multitasking

11178915
accessor	properties
you can pass a properties accessor to the method

11178925
min	max
i find the max and the min of the 50 images and then pass each image into the formula to normalize the image

11178925
range	max
although the range of the images is 0 1 but the max of the image is

11178925
min	max
find the max and min between them

11178972
folder	directory
the easiest way is probably to set up a project directory and within it a jni folder with an android.mk and your c sources - use the hello-jni ndk sample as a guide

11179004
realloc	malloc
a safer solution would be to use a dynamic array with malloc and realloc

11179043
apache	nginx
maybe you could through a reverse proxy in front of twisted and use http auth from the web app and delegate authentication itself to kerberos via an apache or nginx module

11179085
box-sizing	border-box
for example if your has padding you will have to account for it or use the css property box-sizing border-box

11179119
viewdidload	viewwillappear
then declare their properties in viewwillappear or viewdidload the code you wrote basically

11179130
serializable	deserialization
so i would recommend you use a proper serializable library like binary or cereal to do serializable and deserialization

11179175
ienumerator	idisposable	implements	extends
that s simple for which extends idisposable but as ienumerator doesn t the compiler inserts a check to test at execution time whether the iterator implements idisposable

11179175
ienumerable	ienumerator
as noted in comments a type can also implement ienumerable or explicitly but have a public getenumerator method which returns a type other than ienumerator

11179253
toggleclass	slidetoggle
toggleclass will not animate you should go for slidetoggle or .animate method

11179324
vmware	virtualbox
from this iso you can create either a vmware or virtualbox image

11179358
jobs	cron
examples of cron jobs

11179380
post	get
here the userregistration function is called when a user post a form and under this function i can get the post data what i want is to pass that data to create_user_account method so that it fills in the fields in the account model

11179391
post	put
i m developing a website where i want to give users possibility to put smiles on post

11179395
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am creating a userscript and in opera it works like a charm but in firefox and google-chrome it gives the following error

11179439
post	get
i agree to get any blame here for such incorrect using of the sending post and waiting for more then 2 hours for response

11179446
int	double
the idea is to use big int math to compute the power of the int part of the exponent then use double 64-bit floating point math to compute the power of the fractions part

11179455
post	get
first of all you don t need to use a session var one alternative to do this is passing the post id using a get argument something like this

11179466
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have also tried saving the page with safari and google-chrome and firefox the same thing happens

11179496
google-chrome	firefox
userscripts in firefox and google-chrome are sandboxed the page context and the script context are completely different

11179526
pop-up	dialog
device address and channel are correct as i can tell since when running this test android pop-up a dialog asking if i allow the other device to access it s contacs

11179547
google-chrome	firefox
the above snippet works fine in firefox and google-chrome

11179635
jobs	cron
as an alternative to a cron job polling your mysql database every minute you could try using a task queue like beanstalk which allows you to launch asynchronous jobs

11179635
jobs	cron
really for this purpose if there aren t many many jobs that are going to be scheduled this way and your mysql table is relatively small it s probably simpler to go the mysql cron route

11179698
for-loop	loops
also you should probably remove the do loops as it is redundant the for-loop should be doing what you want i think

11179712
hide	show
this code just cuts more characters but i want to hide them and show in expander

11179737
folder	directory
in my rails 3.2 models directory i have a folder foo containing two classes

11179739
typo3	fluid
environment mac os x lion php 5.3.10 mysql 5.x typo3 4.7.1 extbase 4.7.1 fluid 4.7.0

11179741
fadein	fadeout
try using fadein and fadeout from jquery to make things disappear progressively

11179761
width	height
instead i engineer all of my master images to have width and height dimensions that are a multiple of at least 24 - the lcm least common multiple of the integers above

11179797
width	height
setting the width or height of a canvas even if you are setting it to the same value as before not only clears the canvas but resets the entire canvas context

11179825
pull	push
push pull

11179827
alarmmanager	wakelock
in terms of the available timing methods a major consideration should be if you intend the device to wakeup from sleep to accomplish events in which case you should use the alarmmanager if you intend to keep the device awake in which case you should use a wakelock or if you are okay with your events happening only when the device is awake and your service or activity is running in which case you can use a simple timer

11179860
hide	show
iÃ¢ m letting the user show hide the statusbar at will and i want all the views to slide down up with it

11179867
width	height
text-overflow ellipsis only works if you have a defined width height constraint and overflow hidden

11179942
webkit	gecko
i guess you ll have to then set up your own service and host a layout engine gecko webkit or trident in a way it can generate page thumbnails for you

11179945
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

11179954
x86	64bit
you need to install the x86 version if the target machine is 32 bit or the x64 version if the target machine is 64bit and your application is built with configuration any cpu

11179964
distance	polygons
one possible cost function could calculate for each point the distance to its closest neighbor or the boundary of the polygons whichever is less and calculate the variance of this sequence as a measure of non-uniformity

11179972
bsd	xnu
the class can be mach bsd or something else see here in the xnu source and is shifted 24 bits to the left

11179987
ffmpeg	handbrake
it seems that in my research using programs like handbrake ffmpeg it is recommend to check of web optimized there is also a similar type of setting when exporting from other types of software like imovie

11179998
air	flashdevelop
i m using flashdevelop with flexsdk 4.5.1 en air sdk 3.0

11180028
hash	md5
my goal is to use the result of an md5 result to index a hash table

11180028
hash	md5
when i printed the result i got a different number every time for the same md5 hash

11180028
hash	md5
the md5 hash is initially an unsigned char

11180084
int	chars
int chars ...

11180140
free	malloc
note take care of null check for the malloc return value and also dont forget to free the allocated memory after printf in main function

11180141
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a 128 bit number

11180141
int	chars
given that your function takes the 128 bit hash as a chars string you need to parse that string into a series of 4 int

11180158
explode	implode
i would suggest using implode explode with a character that you know will not be contained in any of the individual array items

11180161
range	minimum
for your case double the range is 0 1 not because that s the minimum and maximum value but because that is conventional and double data types have a special representation that make this range quite reasonable

11180161
min	max
if you have data is small or larger than the min and max will be quite different than what matlab thinks is good for pictures

11180161
min	max	range	min	range	max
this should demonstrate why the matlab range is 0 1 but your min max is different----that is fine and your normalization code will fix everything between zero and one

11180176
jobs	cron
now when the cron jobs crash while working there is the risk that a time slot contains wrong data when the jobs restarts next time

11180209
spaces	delimiter
i d probably strtok each line using spaces as the delimiter then do some validation on the data to make sure it is what you think

11180235
calloc	malloc
we use to allocate dynamic memory malloc or calloc for each nodes separately

11180235
calloc	malloc
if we call malloc or calloc frequently for small small memory may affects to performance of the system

11180238
hide	show
what i m trying to do is make it so that when a main category is clicked on the list underneath it hide or show

11180249
union	distinct
the union is the merge part of your mergeanddistinctlist and the distinct ehh the distinct part

11180256
min	max
this value will between min and max which defaults to 0 and 1 respectively

11180256
min	max
you should set min max and sliderstep to what you want

11180277
stdout	stderr
the code below works for reference but relies on the fact that wget generates output to stderr and pscp to stdout

11180316
hide	show
this is the code for show hide

11180389
post	get
assuming redmine is available at i can use curl and post with params username and password and get an answer

11180395
int	double
note that this is somewhat different though instead of an array of double s followed by an array of int s it gives you an array of one double followed by one int then the next double next int and so on

11180397
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
i only create the sqlcommandbuilder passing it a sqldataadapter

11180397
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
from the msdn -docs i get that the sqlcommandbuilder registers itself to the rowupdated event of the sqldataadapter

11180412
google-chrome	safari
remember also to use the -moz- prefixes for your css3 declarations otherwise this is only gonna be working on google-chrome safari

11180491
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
based on what you are trying to do you would probably be better off creating a wrapper around everything with a 980px width and margin set to 0 auto then instead of forcing the header and left sidebar to be fixed just set a height on the content and make it overflow hidden and scrollable

11180516
put	get
i am easily able to get it installed and running however when i went to use it i found that i didnt have sufficient rights to put content there

11180528
oncreate	setcontentview
you shouldn t call setcontentview twice in your oncreate

11180542
move	drag
now when i drag the uipicker it works perfectly and the scrollview does not move at all unless i am clicking on that and dragging it

11180543
int	double
in our example there will be very many int giving the same double 123456.78 because the factor where epsilon is the smallest positive number such that 123456.78 + epilon has a representation as a double different from the representation of 123456.78 itself is big enough that there will be very many int between the true answer and the true answer multiplied by m

11180544
for-loop	arrays
i have created 5 instances of the class in an object arrays as well and would like to print the attributes out with a for-loop

11180584
children	parent
a category may have a parent and many children

11180606
rspec	capybara
i m just getting started learning rspec and capybara

11180633
int	double
for example i would like to generate the following code from the definition of the structure sensor_t that contains one int and two double

11180633
typedef	struct
the code displayed is the direct conversion of a typedef c struct to a c hdf5 structure

11180686
min	max
just remember that you should be normalizing each image on its own i.e compute the min max in the formula for the image itself not from the entire group of images

11180686
min	max
if you look back at the solution i proposed the images were stored in a cell array and the computation was done using cellfun to get min max of each image separately

11180686
min	max
i should add that the type of linear transformation we performed above is called min max normalization but it s certainly not the only kind see this answer for other examples

11180722
scrollable	panels
i am trying to load some images in a scrollable panels

11180788
int	double
linearstep is a double but your x is an int

11180791
shadowbox	lightbox
now i want to open links which are in this post in shadowbox lightbox like

11180828
pull	push
perhaps create a new branch starting at the point at which your code diverges from that on the company server then pull ranges of commits from your branch in stages and push after each range is pulled

11180863
jar	war
when zipped the jar and war into a zip then try to deploy to cloud foundry it gives me an out of memory error

11180887
ssl	https
standard http request over ssl https

11180926
textview	simplecursoradapter
i have a simple listview with a textview and an editview that is populated using the simplecursoradapter from a sqlite query

11180930
for-loop	arrays
what is the correct way to init the entire arrays instead of running a for-loop

11180940
put	get
we can use put and get methods just like map

11180941
google-chrome	firefox
my code is perfectly working in google-chrome but not in ie9 and firefox

11180980
jar	.war
services depend on code which is currently packaged into .war file so in pom.xml for jar file i specify the following dependency

11180980
jar	.war
but to package the .war archive i also need to specify a dependency for the jar like this

11181004
implements	modifiers
...and you wouldn t need to write the ugly override modifiers when implements lteq

11181009
getter	setter
as for getter setter - just use the normal map manipulation functions

11181009
getter	setter
there is often no need for getter setter in cases when you are just manipulating standard clojure data

11181068
children	parent
since i wanted to delete all the children for a particular parent from the database i wrote the following function in childrepository

11181068
fflush	gets
our code is setup so that the fflush gets called at end of request

11181089
post	get
note you should also be able to get away without passing the post id as get_post_custom calls get_the_id id post id is not passed

11181113
google-chrome	firefox
but in firefox and google-chrome it actually showed an error with method 1

11181134
implements	extends
if a behavior needs to be attached to a model it may also extends from cmodelbehavior or cactiverecordbehavior which implements additional features specifc for models

11181134
getter	setter
the properties include both the public member variables and the properties defined via getter and or setter of the behavior

11181142
postgresql	mysql
though it s not essential for the question context is sometimes useful i ll be building this with django and the db backend will be either postgresql or mysql suggestions about choice here also welcome though not main focus of question

11181162
free	malloc
that said i can t find a c function that allows me to malloc and free from an arbitrary buffer

11181181
free	malloc
this allows it to detect some errors that regular free does not normally detect though the gnu c library version of malloc et al does seem to do some sanity checking that others do not necessarily do

11181198
oncreate	ondestroy
for all activities that want to use the socket connection bind your network service in oncreate then after the activity is finish ed unbind it in ondestroy

11181254
bash	zsh
when you install a gem with a bin directory it is automatically added to path in zsh and bash

11181254
bash	zsh
to manually edit the in the manner alluded to in the question would be platform-dependant and somewhat difficult to achieve bash vs zsh vs tsch startup files for example and windows vs os x vs linux vs environmental variables all vary quite greatly and would also be in my humble opinion slightly rude

11181319
free	malloc
itÃ¢ s so simple itÃ¢ s really silly but its performance will scream in comparison to simply using malloc and free all the time..

11181319
free	malloc
you could modify the approach above to not start with any global static array at all and use malloc at first when the user calls particlealloc but when particles are returned don t call free but instead add the returned ones to the linked list of unalloc ed particles

11181319
free	malloc
then the next caller to particlealloc will get one off the list of free particles rather than use malloc

11181430
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is

upon completion of the required asynchronous server stuff the facebook twitter whatever auth dialog pop-up

11181661

mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
i m using a combination of mousedown mousemove and mouseup to try to track the drag

11181731
mouseup	mouseleave
the drag starts well enough but soon after the mouseleave the tag it just seems to baulk and mouseup doesn t register as it should

11181731
mouseup	mousedown
the logic works as it should if i return false after mouseup and mousedown - ie

11181731
move	drag
i can move the mouse far and wide after mousedown and watch for event.y being 10 and there s no baulk - but then the code does not have the desired effect of the user being able to drag the tag

11181786
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i used eclipse to deploy my java web application on amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk which uses a unix 64-bit environment

11181975
stdout	stderr
these streams are represented by numbers 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr

11182005
setcontentview	findviewbyid
as aneal says you cannot call findviewbyid before the setcontentview the reason for this is that the xml layout has not been loaded yet and so findviewbyid will return null

11182014
int	double
you are trying to print an int with a format for double s or float s

11182134
superclass	subclassing
i m declaring it in a superclass and i want it to be useful in all subclassing

11182143
put	get
if you want to do it like this you will definitely want to put your procedures in modules because that way you automatically get explicit interfaces which are required for passing around such arrays of user defined type

11182145
put	get
this fine because if i put an uiiamgeview below table view to see if it works or not it seems i get the correct image it works

11182156

11182295
hash	md5
md5 generates 16 bytes 128 bit hash

11182312

11182390
hash	md5
shortest useful hash algorithm would be md5

11182390
hash	md5
md5 this string will be hash

lwjgl	slick2d
to keep it short sweet i have written an ant file that compiles my source code unjars the libraries for slick2d nifty etc zips that up into it s own jar and then copies the lwjgl native dlls into the same folder so the folder layout is something like this

11182615
oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
instead of using ondestroy oncreate you d better use onpause onresume because these are always called but a call to ondestroy might be missed here and there

11182616
google-chrome	safari
it does not work in google-chrome correctly but if you check for the browser you could just load it for safari

11182644
width	height
add table-layout fixed and you can reliably specify the width and height of the cells leaving no downside so far as i can see

11182667

11182696
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my versioning of jquery ui though and this one particular image doesn t want to work

11182713
mouse	keyboard
for example if you or a library you use use random from an event handler for mouse keyboard or network events the nondeterministic ordering in which these events are handled could alter the sequence of numbers generated by your otherwise mainline code

11182719
subtract	add
with good consistent sign conventions on the transactions no ambiguity on whether to add or subtract - always add the values and appropriate constraints with limited number of types of transactions you can specify with constraints that all deposits are positive and all withdrawals are negative you can let the database ensure there are no anomalies like negative deposits

11182812
jqvmap	jvectormap
jvectormap comes with more pre-generated maps than jqvmap

11182820
getter	setter
the model class also has some convenience getter setter so that you don t have to refer to the parameters by their row column

google-chrome	firefox
it s works in firefox mozindexeddb but not in google-chrome

11183258

typedef	struct
to create a recursive type definition like this in c you need to use a struct somewhere along the line because you can t forward declare typedef

11183425
width	height
for many of its uses this is because the string you get by concatenating the number and unit is used directly in styling by setting it as the value on css width height etc properties in other cases the maps api calculates what those sizes would be in that context if it wants to for instance use absolute units or draw to a canvas

11183434
svg	vml
the people who write your site s content might find it challenging to insert line breaks because there is no such thing as a line break using canvas svg or vml

qtp	loadrunner
afaik generally qtp is not used for load testing though it is possible to measure transaction time for a business scenario using start and end transaction.you can execute qtp scripts which would in-turn be a part of the load testing.but to go deep into load testing you need to use other load testing tools like hp loadrunner

11183585
qtp	loadrunner
it is obvious as both tools qtp loadrunner are from hp this also signifies according to hp for load testing you should use different testing tool both tool can be use together for load testing

11192957
folder	directory
if you re using a local copy of jquery you need to include the jquery library file in your extension directory and refer to its relative path in the extension relative to the html page jquery.min.js if it s in the same folder or lib jquery.min.js if it s in a folder called lib

11193002

to get all the children of a parent with your structure you will always need to do two queries

11193158
comparator	icomparer
well first off on the surface equals is a method present in every object while comparator and icomparer are interfaces

11193158
equals	gethashcode
equals is present in any class and can be overriden to provide equality testing depending on the context of the class it s a good practice to override gethashcode as well

11193158
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode are usually given a different implementation in the context of searching or hashing

11193158
icomparable	compareto	equals	icomparable	equals	compareto
implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

11193158
comparator	icomparer
icomparer is similar to comparator except that it works from the outside

11193161
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit it does work in firefox but it has problems in safari and google-chrome

11193163

11193219
width	height
i am configuring xmonad and since i have to start a couple of dzen instances i decided that it could be better to use a function that takes the parameters for x and y position width height and text align

11193221

icomparer does pretty much the same as comparator except the logic is contained in separate class

11193257
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and google-chrome in firefox the javascript onsubmit works but the action of the asp never fires

11193257

this works fine on google-chrome and safari but on firefox the 1 8th column wraps under the 1 2 column

11193404
width	height
for each of these difference images add all of the pixel based differences into a combined single numeric difference and store that into a 2d array sized to the dimension of x and y locations the thumbnail can possibly be placed within the scaled avatar image this will be smaller than the total avatar image size infact it will be width avatarwidth - thumbwidth and height avatarheight - thumbheight

11193413
post	get
although i have them both working with a default english post i.e logs on update i cant get edited translations to be logged.

getter	setter
this would be an example for you making one player although you asked for something like an init a getter and a setter

set your screen backbuffer width and height to the 16 9 resolution

11196922
width	height
usually one sets up their game and their textures to work based on the relative dimensions of the current viewport or backbuffer width and height

11197216
int	chars
the problem is that i have declared instead of into the client and so the maximum value i can read with chars is 127...changed chars to int solved my problem

11197232
range	min	range	minimum
to set the minimum scale to the lowest value in the range use the min function

11197269
put	get
there are hacks you could put together on the receiving machine to get the ownership right -- run chmod -r apache website out of cron would be an effective but pretty kludgey option -- but instead i d recommend securely allowing rsync-over-ssh-as-apache

11197270
express	node.js
if you re trying to do this synchronously than you re defeating the whole idea behind node.js and express

11197325
int	double
double can exactly represent all int which fall in the domain of the power function

11197350
keydown	keyup
first to avoid the keypress repeat delay you have to wrap your program in a loop and make the state of the keyboard available inside the scope of that loop secondly to monitor multiple keypresses you need to keep track of individual keydown and keyup events

11197398
subtract	add
so on keypress add or subtract from x or y velocity

11197398
subtract	add
to move diagonally just add subtract from the velocity of both x and y simultaneously

11197404

post	get
there could be many different ways to go about doing this on the server side the way i usually do it is to have one sql stored procedure for get requests and one for post requests for any given store

11197612
post	get
i include the store name as an extra param and then my server side controller runs the appropriate stored procedure based on whether it is a get or a post request

11197615
put	get
usually you put extra info in the intent with putextras so the service will get any needed information to do its job

11197648

disk	ram
the limit is approximately your free ram plus the space allowed for swapping to disk

11198630
realloc	strtok	spaces	delimiter

the contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready handler only executes for the

11198663

uiview	subviews
this would be loaded in that normal uiview subviews on top of the tableview

11198731

problem happens in both google-chrome and firefox

11199076
width	height

11199122
folder	directory
it is still displaying the sub directory in unicorn folder

11199145

synthesize doesn t set the variable it simply generates getter and setter so that you can set it from outside

11199175
memcached	apc
i have replaced the regular session with a singleton that stores session data in apc memcached as well as in db

11199175
memcached	apc
session data is saved in db only if i request it or if during handling of the request apc memcached stored session data indicates it wasn t written for a long enough time

11199175
memcached	apc
with this replacement you d be just forcing session save from db side fetch session ids of sessions that haven t been updated for x minutes from db fetch info from apc memcached for each of those and if there is no update info there either indicating session will end soon save it to db

what i have is some questions and associated with each questions in their possible answers in checkbox button and three text inputs showing questionid option type and number of marks for each individual answer

11199381
versioning	upgrade
it looks like you need to upgrade your versioning of webapi from beta to rc

11199382
folder	directory
if you want to load from a directory you first gotta add the directory to the project with the create directory references so that in copy bundle resources you get a blue icon with the main folder name and not individual files

11199410
touchescancelled	touchesended
otherwise you need to override touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent

11199426
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the solution is only working on firefox and not google-chrome

11199465
nsinteger	nstimeinterval
i suspect that nstimeinterval values from nsdate would overflow an nsinteger

11199465
nsinteger	nstimeinterval
it looks like an nsinteger can store an nstimeinterval at least for the next couple of decades

11199479
equals	tostring
so if you want to use a default method from an interface that supersedes one of the methods from object like tostring or hashcode or equals then you have to call it explicitly with this new interface.super.method syntax

post	get
check out antirez s post on taking advantage of redis in your stack and you should get some ideas on how it could be used

question 2 i have 4 positions how to put every item the 4 vruchtitem randomly in one of those positions like appel at position posup banaan at posright etc etc next time they randomly get other positions

11199525
submit	submission
in fact it can be even simpler if this form is submission normally rather than being validated by javascript or sent through ajax then you can simply disable the input and not worry about reenabling it since the form will refresh or navigate away when the server completes processing the form submit

11199525
submit	submission
you shouldn t use the click event on a submit button to block form submission

11199540
gif	png
not being an expert on digital images i m still deciding on whether to convert uploaded images into jpeg or keep their original format jpeg png gif - gif will be converted into a still image in case the format gets converted

11199573
children	parent
for example here are sample parent children

11199573

the children of parent 27 would be 5944 2065 2066 2067 6248 6249 6250

11199578
gif	png
for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

11199589

what i want to do is place my class files in folder within my class directory

11199591
pseudo-class	visited
use the link visited and active pseudo-class on the

11199592
gif	png
png and gif are better at compressing certain types of images basically blocky graphics while jpeg are better for photo-like images

11199592
gif	png
if your usage of the images can accept either type jpg png gif than i would suggest keeping them in the format that it receives

11199641
put	get
if using queues make sure to get after you put

11199685
google-chrome	firefox
it works ok on firefox but it doesn t work on google-chrome neither wind or ubuntu chromium

11199690
hash	salt	hash	hmac
if you re wondering why i m calling the function poorly salt hash that s because this isn t a good way to salt a hash you should use a construct like hmac which is provided by the python hmac library

11199712
google-chrome	firefox
here is a screenshot of how it appears in google-chrome and firefox which is as i expected it to appear

11199712
google-chrome	firefox
so in google-chrome and firefox the yellow background of the active item will stretch past the grey gradient box

11199715
width	height
for example let s say you have an image which is width 500px and height 250px

11199718
getter	setter
the getter and setter of id is never called

11199737
uiview	subviews
the second problem is that i want these buttons and form elements to actually be added into the uiscrollview that s contained within the mdpopovercard view and not just right into the uiview s subviews array

11199740
width	margin
the selector #nav_mod_list div.current has a width of 210px as well as padding and margin where as the container is 200px

11199768
width	height
note that the height width are set explicitly to the width height of my imagesource

11199840
exponent	modulo
i m given public key exponent and modulo as well as the message and signature

11199840
exponent	modulo
when i list the resulting modulo and exponent from the key itself they have become reversed

11199843
width	height
in order to find the correct height and width of the picture you ll want to define a function to compare the max x and y values and update them based on the largest x y values found in the array

11199843
width	height
so now you ve got the max width and height for your image

11199863
width	margin
-the columns with medium data should be the size of their content with some margin on both sides i don t mind just throwing in a fixed width if it s too difficult to accomplish this

11199875
memcached	apc
if it is absolutely imperative that the data be generated every time that this gets called you could chunk the query into blocks of 100 rows caching the data on the filesystem or much better in apc wincache xcache memcached then on the final ajax call finalquery true loading the cache generating the pdf and clearing the cache

11199928
width	height
the imageview is inside a scrollview with only vertical scroll bar enabled which means the image should be resized with maximum width equal to that of the screen imageview in the mean time keeping the ratio not constrained on the resized height

11199965
punctuation	words
i wasn t taking into account punctuation after a words

11199987

11200012
children	parent
i m adding data to a tree and then when it is a parent node need to add its children but selecteditem is always null

11200031
comparator	comparable
if it does not make sense for you to implement comparable though you will need to specify a comparator to sort by

11200036
post	put
some other solutions are mentioned in this forum post entitled http error 405 with asp.net mvc and http put on iis 7.5

11200068

most of the examples i have seen assume you are rendering the form on the server-side and then sending it along with the embedded csrf_token form field to the client-side

11200077
for-loop	loops
convert the following while loops into a for-loop

11200078

11200097

they should be hash and salt

11200325
google-chrome	safari
i did my dev in google-chrome and safari and it works nicely

11200325
width	height
apparently there is a maximum limit set to the height and width for an html5 canvas in ios

11200341
width	height
it s not a specific width height that is a problem it s the width multiplied by the height and the actual number is probably hardware specific

11200361
getter	setter
another thing to mention you re having collisions with your getter setter and their respective instance variables

11200407
google-chrome	firefox

webkit	gecko
webkit and gecko are examples

11200659
hash	salt
from my investigation it seemed that the salt is always 22 characters and the hash offset is 29 not 28 making it 31 characters in length not 32

11200659
hash	salt
this suggests that the salt portion of the returned hash is storing only significant bits so it may not always match your input salt

11200659
hash	salt
the benefit is that the hash can be used unaltered as the salt when verifying

11200659
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
thus you re better off only storing the complete hash returned by crypt and never the input salt you use initially

11200659
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
rolling your own salt is not a problem and knowing them by this i assume you meant store them separately to the hash is not necessary if you re storing crypt s output as-is

11200713
google-chrome	firefox
though application worked fine in firefox and google-chrome i have experienced same error in ie browser only when report is opened within iframe and only when frameset is used

11200792
opera	firefox
i have found the script from ajax but it doesn t really succeed just like in facebook title tag just assume i enter new data from another browser ie opera etc and after i go back to my main browser firefox the title tag does not change at all or does not auto refresh and change the value

11200819
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload use this method instead of viewwillappear

11200819
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload is called once when it is loaded while viewwillappear is called everytime you enter that view

11200842
post	get
for good practice always use post rather than get when dealing with db entries

11200844

11201002
width	height
you may need to set the width and height attributes of the img element to preserve the layout of your page

11201003
nsurl	nsstring
found the solution for it to work with sandboxing in mountain lion you have to provide the nsurl of the attachment instead of the file path as an nsstring

11201066
onmouseover	mouseout
i have several onmouseover events combination of javascript functions and jquery accordions but they seem to be overly sensitive to the exact location of the mouse to the point that it s making it either very difficult to trigger and or overly easy to mouseout and close the function making it very difficult to select something and or to inadvertently trigger the wrong function

to relax the security of your browser not possible on google-chrome and maybe no more possible on firefox

11210356
getter	setter
once the request is built i plan to manually change values inside that request using a pojo which stores my request with setter and getter so i could just go like request.setfield1 stuff .getbytes charset.forname cp1047

11210439
put	get
to do this you d need to come up with a data serialization protocol for the messages you put and get on the queue

11210448

you would expect that if you wanted to increase the height 4 times you would decrease the width 4 times

11210522
gridview	rowdatabound
the problem is that whether i put my code in the gridview s databound or rowdatabound event the cells in the header row seem to be empty so i can t reformat them

11210549

use firebug in firefox and developer tools in google-chrome for debugging your code and to find what is wrong

11210561
folder	directory
i want to create a folder named download which is outside of my site root directory in drupal

the code is set to loops through all the workbooks in the containing folder i want it to populate a2 a13 with the string derived from each workbook using a for-loop as below

11210736

i understand why they are all being populated with december since the for-loop is running 12 times in total with the main loops

11210737
matlab	simulink
i am using matlab 2012a and the simulink coder aka real-time workshop

11210756

javascript doesn t have 64 bit int it only has double which loses accuracy for int after 9007199254740992 2 53

11210781
versioning	upgrade
it is there for backward compatibility in case you upgrade your lucene with a versioning that changes the standardanalyzer but you dont want to re-index all your data

11210801
punctuation	words
i m not an arabic speaker but i m pretty sure you ll also need to include at least one other class to allow matching on the connector and other graphemes used to join arabic letters into words as those won t be classed as letters but will be some form of punctuation mark

11210843
int	chars
you can delimit the int and text in the value by some chars and do a split to pass them into an array

11210862
cassini	iis
use iis express rather than cassini and you will find that the response includes the reason

11210864
integer	unsigned
because php s integer type is signed and many ip addresses will result in negative integers on 32-bit architectures you need to use the u formatter of sprintf or printf to get the string representation of the unsigned ip address

11210908
google-chrome	firefox
this way the display property is no longer needed and everything works in both firefox and google-chrome

11210912
mouse	keyboard
i d like to learn more how keyboard only users are interacting with megamenus and i d like to know if they are able to intuitively learn a new behavior switching between tab arrow keys or whether they default to a keyboard mouse solution

11210920
mousemove	mouseenter
replace mousemove with mouseenter

11210964
getter	setter
this field obviously refers to a bean which has the usual getter and setter

11210975
userid	usergroups
i was thinking about make the usergroupid field start from 99999 and counting downwards while the userid field is starting from 00001 and counting upwards thus assuming that if the assignedto starts with 9 it s reffering to a usergroups

11210982
width	height
you might try to give the image tag static width and height attributes

11210989
post	get
ok i was able to get a reasonable solution based on a post from the kendo forum

11211032
post	get
since m2m get in the way here instead of post_save method mentioned in the post use m2m_changed signal to inform the ready of instance.albums.all something like

11211038
hash	md5
i am using the java mongodb driver for gridfs and would like to use md5 hash to check if a file already exist before saving it

11211038
hash	md5
looking at the underlying implementation both digestutils and mongodb driver uses messagedigest.getinstance md5 to calculate md5 hash

11211038
hash	md5
however it looks like the md5 hash code generated by digestutils are not the same as what gridfs generates

11211151
multiplying	multiplication
combining several transformations is simple it just means that each transformation matrix is multiplied with the others in order and keeping track of all the transformations means just remembering the final 3x3 matrix obtained from this multiplication and computing the final coordinates of an element means just multiplying the 3x1 matrix of the initial coordinates with that 3x3 matrix

11211197
portrait	landscape
the reason for these dimensions is that i want the image cover the screen in both landscape and portrait modes

11211197
portrait	landscape
in other words the logo must always in the center of the screen in landscape and portrait orientations

11211197
portrait	landscape
the issue with the code here is that the image is not centered in portrait mode the logo shows to the right of the screen in landscape at the bottom of the screen

11211197
portrait	landscape
image stays centered when ipad is rotated between landscape and portrait

11211204
button	checkbox
my initial idea was to use radio button for the options because of its exclusion functionality but maybe using checkbox provides a better solution

11211350
move	drag
but what i want is user long press then drag a cell to move it without entering editing style and i hope these moving view won t appear in cells right like this

11211381
octal	decimal
the value that you are passing is decimal 666 which corresponds to octal 01232 01210 after applying umask

11211398
inline	inlining
you can also suggest that a function should be inline using the inline keyword before a function note that it still doesn t actually force it and the compiler might decide to avoid the inlining .it s generally not such a good idea to do this manually as modern compilers tend to figure out the best possible inlinings on their own

11211464
opera	firefox
dart only targets es5-capable browsers that is internet explorer 9 firefox 4 opera 12 and reasonably new webkit-based browsers

11211474
nas	qnap
i am trying to compile rtmpdump for qnap nas 419p arm

11211506
versioning	upgrade
to overcome this bug try and upgrade to the latest msf versioning 3.1

11211541
children	parent
when this transformation is applied on the following xml document containing two innerelement elements -- with different parent and at different depths -- whose children need the specialized processing

11211541
children	parent
finally we can modify the transformation even further so that it can process the children of differently named parent -- say innerelement and someotherinnerelement

11211541
children	parent
when this transformation is applied on the following xml document where the children to be processed in the required way have parent named with these two names innerelement and someotherinnerelement

11211593
superclass	subclassing
if you catch a superclass it will also catch all subclassing too

11211598
hide	show
the minimum and maximum value the domain extent are part of the domain path so one option is to set axis.ticks to zero to hide the ticks and only show the domain path

11211617
post	get
i have tried changing the post to a get returning the data in a few different ways creating classes etc. but i cant seem to figure out what the problem is

11211617
post	get
only the solution with jsonp seems to be agreed to do a correct get or post

11211669
opera	firefox
a side note firefox and opera actually throw a different more useful error message function.prototype.apply argarray is too large

11211697
min	max
i know theoreticaly that to achieve this i must enclose the placemarks in regions and set min and max pixels values but my problem starts when i try to create the region itself

11211715
hide	show
see however when i add the fields it fails to show hide with the checkbox

11211727
x86	64bit
if you need the path to the 32 bit program files folder c program files for 32-bit windows and c program files x86 for 64bit windows then you can use this function

11211734
int	double
then you would parse the string and cast it to an int or a double

11211756
serializable	deserialization
it must be transient because org.slf4j.logger is an interface which doesn t extend serializable but this means that the logger must be re-injected after deserialization

11211762
post	get
you can send data via a form get or post

11211762
post	get
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example

11211860
portrait	landscape
it may seem to work in ie7 but this is because ie7 will remember the users last selection of landscape or portrait in print preview only the browser is re-started

11211871
post	get
you do not need to use json when sending data via get or post

11211967
width	height
if i remember correctly the tileset width and height properties are given in pixels not points

11211980
folder	directory
which will start from folder and recursively go through sub folder deleting any file which doesn t end in mp3 case insensitive as long as this file is not a directory

11211989
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t appear to be a browser issue either as both google-chrome and firefox seem to not have a cookie getting stored anywhere

11212002
width	height
i wanna place a profile picture that has a width of 200px and an unknown height inside a div container

11212002
width	height
i cannot get this to work the unknown height is messing it up since the way the img width will appear is depending on the height

11212002
width	height
- a landscape img will get a higher width to fill out the height difference and keep the img in proportion

11212006
sorting	filtering
in any way i am sure that you have to implement paging sorting and filtering on the server side

11212008
repo	egit
maybe could try this by creating a fresh test .git repo on a linux server add a php file use eclipse remote system to browse by ssh for the folder containing the .git folder use right click on that folder- create remote project and then somehow figure out how egit could be added.

11212009
hide	show
after researching the following 2 questions that were posted here here it seems google maps has issues with a tab that hide and show content from jquery or javascript and will not display a google map properly without some code in the jquery

11212051
width	height
for instance if have a gridview and your boxes need to go from 250x250 to 200x300 you can just copy the style you use for your itemtemplate tweak it so that the width and height values are correct and use a storyboard change your itemtemplate from standard250x250 to mynewportrait200x300style

11212051
listview	gridview
now if it is a fundamental change like the difference between a gridview and a listview you might just have to live with some duplicated layout code and using some storyboard s to collapse one and show the other like the templates do with landscape filled vs

11212051
portrait	landscape
to be clear i am saying your best options are to either tweak the styling properties via animations or create an entirely separate panel be it a grid stackpanel or whatever for your other layout and use an animation to set the visibility on the landscape one to collapsed and the portrait one to visible

11212060
post	get
forms hidden input field post | get

11212076
versioning	upgrade
we re edit a lot s of pages with text in confluence versioning 3.5 but in one good day we decide to upgrade our system to versioning 4.3.2

width	height
i m trying to get the background image called splash.jpg to always have the same height as the browser window and to resize it keeping its aspect ratio and allow some of the width to remain outside the browser window

11212314
width	height
the width also appears to be in the right ratio to the height

11212314
google-chrome	firefox
at first i felt it might be some sort of browser-dependent bug - but the page appears pretty much exactly the same in both google-chrome and firefox

11212314
google-chrome	firefox
i don t want this behavior to be javascript dependent - but i don t mind the solution working only in the latest versions of firefox google-chrome

11212382
children	parent
the user chooses a parent and then all the children show up below where they can then edit the children s information

11212498
google-chrome	firefox
the only issue is they don t seem to handle the attribute and apply the browsers firefox google-chrome box-shadow effects if the user attempts to submit the form without filling the required fields

11212518
width	height
background images have no height and width their height and width is dependent on the parent s height and width in which they are applied to

11212537
children	parent
2 i was thinking of adding estimation to the children components and then using that to set the height of the parent container

11212537
children	parent
i have a parent container where i take the some xml and using the xml creating children components based on the information in the xml

11212541
children	parent
arrows point from children to parent

11212601
switching	screens
i mean if my application contains several screens i can make them as several layouts xml-files and switching using setcontentview

mp3 wav caf etc.

11212845
int	boolean
your issue is that you are calling listbox.items.removeat int index and passing in a boolean value listbox2.selecteditems.tostring .equals test

11212852
int	boolean
the method could return an object that contained both the boolean and the int but that would need for the object to be created on the heap reducing the performance of the method

11212853
int	double
i mean some questions require just one answer others two anothers needs strings int double or any new struct what the developer has builded imagine that the developer is creating a math problem where uses fraction struct as answer for example

11212857

11212857
inherited	properties
then select the div element click style tab on the right panel and uncheck all inherited properties

11212857

mouseover	mousemove
the only thing you need to worry about in your user interface design is that anything that relies on a hover mouseover or mousemove event will be unusable on a touch device because touch devices only send click events or only send other events in conjunction with a click

11214256
mongodb	bson
because each of the services contains one or more methods which either accept or return a particular type pageinforesult which is also stored directly in the database the class pageinforesult is defined in the dal with both bson serialization attributes for mongodb and data contract serialization attributes for wcf

11214483
multiplying	subtract
so for practical uses if the numbers are currency a good option is multiplying by 100 so they are always integers and operating with ints which will give good results when adding subtract or multiplying

11214547
getter	setter
however original property is unchanged but the getter setter are defined via prototype

11214560

11214611
apache	nginx
i see some strange results while using apache benchmark with nginx

11214611
apache	nginx
is there any tool to analyze nginx or apache benchmark tool and see what is taking some much of time

rather a combination of a session variable a uuid cookie and a salt hash cookie can increase integrity of authentication.

11214739
google-chrome	safari
gwt treats google-chrome and safari the same so there is only a safari agent value that covers both

11214739
google-chrome	safari
this and any other rules like it will cause the gwt compiler to create an additional permutation of the code which is mostly the same as the safari version but with your google-chrome customizations

11214773
getter	setter
getter setter are defined via prototype

11214780

under this uiview there is a calayer with a cgpath defining its shape added as self layer addsublayer mycalayer

11214860
uiview	calayer
this the main calayer defined on the uiview

11214890
int	chars
the solution is to generate the chars a simple int value at runtime and create a string with it using

11214890
unsigned	short
but if you look in the headers you ll see that nsstring stores its characters as unichar which is defined as an unsigned short i.e a 16 bits-long value whereas the unicode code point u+1f430 requires at least 17 bits

11214890
int	chars
unicode doesn t define chars it defines code points which are arbitrary int values in the range u+0000 Ã¢ u+10ffff

11214902
int	chars
what you can do instead as per another answer is use the format specifier c -- not together with the uxxxx escape but on its own -- and pass in the full chars code as an int

11214902
int	chars
actually a wchar_t which is a 32-bit int on mac os x now which you ll need since the chars code you re looking for is more than 16 bits long. to put this together with a base you can just add the int

11214909
min	max
since you don t care which of the multiple names belonging to a number are returned you can use a max or min function

11214943
width	height
basically i have a outer div that when faded in is 100 width and 100 height it then has a container in the middle my aim is to have it when you click the outer div it fades both out but not when you click on the inner div

11215031
websphere	ibm
the question is when to use a full fledged product like ibm websphere mq or activemq instead of using app server s inbuilt jms provider

11215033
int	chars
also both on c++ and php i m treating each chars as an int which should allow utf-32 strings to be handled correctly in binary safe mode

11215033
post	get
remember that you should not define szstring or szsalt php side via a http get or post request

11215038
width	height
you should be able to set the flashobject at 100 width and a static height in html

11215038
width	height	min	max
it does allow you to use 100 width and specify a max min height

11215084

11215089
google-chrome	safari
here s the code i m trying to use this works ok in ie but breaks in mobile safari and google-chrome for pc

11215090
int	chars
a string in this case starts with an int describing how many chars follow the int for that string

11215102
getter	setter
outerwidth is going to be a setter and a getter in jquery 1.8 it is safe to use it as long as you continue to include jquery ui in your code until you upgrade to jquery 1.8

11215170
affinity	processors
when we say alignment we basically are referring to an architecture processors s affinity for having data lie on specific byte boundaries

11215198

11215372
popupwindow	pop-up
in my case the pop-up is a popupwindow with an inflated view

11215410
min	max
rather than generating 10 intervals and hard-coding the lowest interval you can enhance the query to derive the starting point and the number of rows from the min time and max time in the table

11215411
postgresql	mysql
this works with mysql sql postgresql oracle

11215424
fgets	strtok
this is important if a line read contains user+password longer than provided earlier a token separator will not be read by fgets and strtok unable to find for example final n character will return null

11215460
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if that still doesn t work and you are sure the element is there and should be working try adding a delay in loading the script using settimeout or fire the script manually using the web developer tools in google-chrome safari or firebug in firefox

11215493

it looks as though dvdauthor prints a lot of output to stderr rather than stdout

11215647
stdout	stderr
i don t have this software myself and so can t be sure but i see a lot of this in what i presume to be the source code which suggests that it s printing informational messages to stderr rather than stdout

we multiplying that back by 300 to get seconds again and then divide that by the number of seconds in a day 86400 and we can add that back to the truncated date portion

11215681
ceil	floor
as a base date is arbitrary but i didn t want to mess with negative values and figuring out if floor would be right or whether we would need to use ceil with negative numbers

11215681
integer	fractions
in this case we are taking the fractions day multiplying by 1440 and dividing by 5 and taking integer portion of that and then putting it back to fractions days

11215737
jqgrid	tablesorter
note main requirement is i don t want to use any jquery plugins such as tablesorter jqgrid etc.

11215766

you can post on user wall even the user signout from facebook its also my personal experience i post on my behalf with my 60 days access_token and get the post data from database all is work

11216076
getter	setter
so the situation is like this when you done compiling you can not change it - so you first attempt - to return it in some function or getter setter is right one

11216088
stdio	fflush
the difference is that _exit will not run functions registered with atexit nor will it fflush stdio streams

11216120
hash	salt
basically im building a simple registration login system for my project saving the userdata password in a dynamodb instance with the password hash using ripemd160 and salt as well using c# s rngcryptoserviceprovider

11216120
hash	salt
the issue is upon login no matter what the passwords dont match up and i think its because i m getting some funky characters back when pulling the hash salt back from dynamodb

11216120
hash	salt
first off both the hash and the salt are byte arrays of length 20 and converted to strings before saved in the database

in fact postgresql implements it s sequence data type serial column their equivalent to mysql auto_increment in such a way that if a transaction requests the sequence to increment a few times but ends up not using those ids they never get used

11216376

11216555
hide	show
the first theme will show the status bar for you if you want to hide this one also use the second theme.also i have used the attribute windowbackround to null because you will use your image as a backround for your rootlayout after that so it s better to not override the background color used by the default android theme for performance issue

11216584
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a very nice database that you can use as easily and freely as mysql

11216596

i m using glkit s baseeffect for my shaders and loading all my vertex data using vao and vbo

11216721
vbo	normals	vbo	vao
for a model with say 16 groups at init time i m separating each group into a vao with each vao having a vbo for vertex data and normals interleaved and a second vbo for texture coordinates

11216721
vbo	vao
in my rendering routine pseudo code below i am looping through all the vao s i created for each group applying the material for the group to the baseeffect and then drawing it using drawarrays not using drawelements because i ve set the vbo s up so the data is already in indexed order although it s probably not as efficient as it could be on graphics memory

11216724
margin	height
get to the img inside the #image and collect its height divide it by two and apply a negative margin to it with the resulting value

however i am now having issues dealing with the rotation of the device as i have several uiview being added as subviews i am faced with a rotational problem as this is how i declare the views generally

11216786
portrait	landscape
but they need to be able to handle loading in either portrait or landscape and then if while they are loaded they need to be able to handle a rotation from either orientation to the other

11216786
portrait	landscape
in this example i have two views landscape and portrait obviously as the names go each are for their respective orientations

fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
if you are using more complex c libraries python interface for mysql then it helps to use a package manager like macports homebrew or fink as the port writers will have sorted out the tricky dependencies

11217032
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
macports and fink will install a separate version of python in opt local bin or sw bin whilst i think homebrew will use apple s python

11217032
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
macports and fink were developed by people who experienced a lot of issues with different versions of software and so said that all our installs will be in a place only the package manager uses whilst homebrew trys to use as much of the apple supplied tools as possible so to add as little as needed

11217047
apache	nginx
nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

11217047
apache	nginx
nginx vs apache is a false dichotomy

11217047
apache	nginx
nginx makes apache better

11217047
apache	nginx
by all means put nginx out front but don t write off apache entirely if it suits your needs

11217048
portrait	landscape
also if you decide that autoresizingmask is not enough for example when you re moving objects with respect to each other to really fine tune the portrait versus landscape orientation i d suggest you do this layout process in viewwilllayoutsubviews for ios5 or willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation in ios4 or earlier

11217052

i thought maybe if i blended selected with post data i could get it to work like this

11217633
post	get
it is my philosophy that the content of the form what is passed in via get or post should be separated from other logic such as security and calculations and that the server should not consider user-supplied data as anything other than user-supplied data

11217644
google-chrome	firefox
tried it in firefox and google-chrome

11217673

i find that drawing a single line between the two polygons or an outline around them solves the problem in firefox and google-chrome at least

11217968
google-chrome	firefox
that seems to fill the gap in google-chrome and firefox at least

11218031
min	max
otherwise you should configure haxis.viewwindow object min max values

11218047
wordpress	joomla
git provides version control for code while wordpress and joomla already manage content stored in the database

11218047
wordpress	joomla
by the way if you use git with wordpress joomla you should add cache logs tmp to .gitignore

11218077
inherited	properties
making java.util.file a properties behind a getter sounds like a better choice it does not reveal irrelevant operations to the users of your class and lets you inherited from a base class of your choice

note - i have seen all manner of discussion on c4800 talking about assigning int to boolean or casting a burger combo with large fries hold the onions to a bool and wondering why there are strange results

11218537
vim	emacs
i switched to emacs after over a decade of exclusively using vi and initially i would have agreed with the claim you can easily do things in vim in the normal course of editing that would require you to drop down to scripting in emacs. but then i discovered that by using emacs macro capability and a large repeat count i could easily make emacs do pretty much everything that vi had made easy and a great deal more

11218557
range	minimum
if you want to show tooltips with maximum and minimum values in range type charts the following code can be used

visualvm	jstat
jmx does not allow detailed jstat monitoring details as required by several plugins in visualvm like the visualgc plugin

11218764

however it seems safe to assume for now that any html5 doctype page rendered in firefox and google-chrome is already in an environment where deprecated poorly supported etc interfaces have already been removed

11218764
int	boolean
thus i ve tested every attribute as well as the non-attribute properties mentioned in the jquery blogs against every every html element type using boolean string and int values

11218782

11218874
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i realize this is quite an old question but to me this is only half the story of accepting url s with hyphens in them the other half is generating these urls while still being able to use html.actionlink and other helpers in the asp.net-mvc framework i solved this by creating a custom route class similar here is the code in case it helps anyone coming here from a google search

11218952
width	height
the problem is that it rescales the image to fit both width and height and changes the aspect ratio

11218952
width	height
i want the background image to rescale to full screen width and then crop the height only starting from the top of the image not the center to cover the view port

11219039
division	modulo
you seem to be unaware of the division and modulo operators

free	malloc
in an attempt to free up memory after a malloc command to prevent memory leaks i am running into a heap corruption problem during runtime

11219173
width	height
if you make it 100 auto as nit suggested then on a window where height width ratio of the html element is larger than your image s you will see empty space at the top which can be what you wanted especially in case you are using an image that fades into the same color at top.

11219380
git-rebase	undo

11220646
width	height
i read that swing components do not have attributes of height width until they are added because that is for the layout manager to decide how much room they have so it makes sense that in the method usernamescreen adding in all components at the end commented out here makes the textfieldusername variable have no height

4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

11224210

int	double
the array comes from a csv file and some columns are strings some are int and some are double

11229432

i know i could use the arrays.sort method and just create my own comparator and use a try catch to determine if the string in the specified column is an int or double but that seems a little much for something that seems so simple

11229437
int	chars
also use unsigned chars to cast instead of unsigned int and then assign it to array elements

11229732
punctuation	words
but my thoughts on how it would work are that php would generate random length words 1-6 letters each with a few don t do this rules like no two single-letter words next to each other or no three-vowels in a row or no three-consonants in a row and automatically add punctuation and capitalization after between 4 and 8 words to a sentence

11229795
width	height
hidden it implies information about how that element is handled in terms of display meaning a block element is treated as its full height width with whitespace as needed no matter what and any html elements next to it are forced to the next line unless explicitly designed otherwise

11229900
installshield	orca
also i had to make this change directly on the installshield xml project file as the gui wouldn t understand that and still does even do it load up the project and build it correctly the custom errors tab is a mess i just discount the default or suberror specialized entries they are not there in the resulting msi file or this is what orca says anyway

11229935
floating-point	integer
the issue here is not converting floating-point values to integer but the rounding errors that occur with floating-point numbers

11229935
floating-point	integer
if you expect that exact mathematics would give you an integer results and the floating-point operations you are performing are so few and so simple that the errors have not accumulated to much then you can round the floating-point value to an integer using the round function

11229949
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

post	get
then you have both post and get variables

11230067

lets take the case for timeout pop-up where user needs to extend his session so if we could flash the dialog then user is notified when he is on other page

11230899
min	max
you can figure out the min and max duplicate size for each hash value by subtracting out the min and max sizes from the total sum

11230899
min	max
then you can compute the min and max total dup size

11230934

11231108
ready	each
each one contain 1000 document that is ready to be inserted into couchdb with http bulk api

11231119

it s much easier to guess the manner in which the salt is applied than it is to brute for the passwords especially in the cases in which the attacker has a database of hash passwords and one known match his own password

11232343

even if he has no knowledge of it he can simply use his known password and the known hash to brute force the salt and salting algorithm

rdf	owl
i think the strengths of rdf owl is that you 1 get a real query language 2 they re w3c standards and 3 you get reasoning if the triple store supports it for free more or less -- you still have to write an ontology

11232920
rdf	owl
with rdf owl sparql being standards it makes it quite easy to pick up and move to a new triple store with a different feature set should you need to your data is already in a common format that everyone understands and any application logic encoded as queries are completely portable

11232920
rdf	owl
i also think that rdf owl especially combined w reasoning and the kinds of complex sparql queries that you can create with the new sparql 1.1 really suit themselves well to building complicated analytic applications

biztalk	econnect

11250072

i have a case where i want to hide show views depending on a specific state and wondering if i should either move this logic at the css level via classnames or using isvisible ember logic

11250255

when an instance method declaration includes a sealed modifiers that method is said to be a sealed method

11250255

with printf i can use hhu for unsigned chars hi for a short int zu for a size_t tx for a ptrdiff_t etc

also if you have only text and all images have fixed dimensions ie explicit width height you may use the domcontentloaded event

in chrome for mac on the first page if you scroll down fadeout and then fadein the newly faded in content is off the screen - in other words missing

11250944
folder	directory
this will look for tags in the current directory and will go down recursively to your home folder if you would like it to search until the root folder or less just change for or path to root project

11250951
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the scroll bar works perfectly fine in firefox ie and google-chrome just not in safari

exponent	modulo
however given a definite chunk of data to sign a definite modulo a definite private exponent and a definite public exponent the outputs of my signatures are different depending on devices

11251110
getter	setter
like as with getter methods you shouldn t be doing business logic in setter methods at all

you could put a pointer to the instance of the master view in your app delegate so that when one of your subviews load it can get the master view instance

11251123
hide	show
however when a user clicks a specific link button from the home page and is taken to the crm page i need to hide all grids and show a new panel of text boxes

11251127
for-loop	loops
if the things that the 4 different for loops do don t have to happen in order you could run each for-loop on a separate thread

11251167
pull	push
i keep this backend with threadsafe false since i use a pull queue expiration deadline of 300 seconds but if i allow more than one task to execute on a single instance they may cascade down and push finishing some of the tasks over the 300 second mark thus allowing for another task to pull the same task a second time and possibly double-counting

11251188
portrait	landscape
apparently even if it only launches runs and supports landscape mode it first creates the view in portrait mode and then switches to landscape mode

11251193
width	height
height and width

11251195
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
most browsers for desktop machines are java compatible ie firefox google-chrome safari opera on windows mac linux and solaris

11251212
int	chars	unsigned	short
in a call to printf a chars or short will be promoted and passed on the stack as an int or an unsigned int so i would think that using d as a format specifier would be fine

11251221
inherited	properties
an element inherited a properties only when no style sheet sets that properties on the element or when the value inherited has been set

11251252
hide	show
by doing that of course we aim to show a friendly error page to our customers but furthermore we mainly aim to hide the stacktraces which are usually included in standard http 500 error pages

11251258
queue	fifo
also if i inherit from i would violate lsp because a priority queue is not a fifo collection

11251307

11251361
integer	unsigned

11251414
maven	pom.xml
well looking at the maven pom.xml file for java-rdfa it looks like it s using a rather old version of jena - 2.6.3 whereas the version you re likely to have downloaded for your ide will be at a guess 2.7.0 or 2.7.1

11251489
webclient	webrequest
i also have tried with httpclient webrequest webclient though nothing appears to work

11251498

getter	setter
the common approach is setter getter - getter only if you want to have your class immutable

11251716
free	malloc
even single-threaded code may do malloc then free then malloc and get back previously used non-zero memory

11251750
int	chars
it can be a typedef for an int as i ve mentioned it s used but is not recommend subject to bugs or chars or unsigned int or an enum and #define that s commonly used

11251778
post	put
where myaction is of type something i didn t put in the original post but should have instead of a plain action

11251832
int	boolean
keep in mind that the operator expects boolean operands...so it won t work with your int array the way you re expecting it to

11251841
getter	setter
also the method and parameter ordering of slightly off property declaration getter and setter

11251903
int	boolean
1 you cant use or || operators on int variables because the are meant for boolean values

11251911
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	debian
if python2.7 is available on yum you should use that the package management on large distros redhat ubuntu debian fedora takes care of maintaining parallel python installs for you which won t conflict with each other

11251916
onchange	onblur
the js to setdefaulttext gets called both onblur and onchange if the change results in an empty text field

width	height
i have a uiview inside a uiview m and i want the inner uiview to be always centered inside the outer one without it having to resize the width and height

11252137
width	height
looks like you have to embed several horizontalpanels into verticalpanels specify width height in everyone of them and produce a great paper of xml by this

11252142
letter-spacing	word-spacing
try adding word-spacing and letter-spacing properties

11252172

implements	extends
java classes and interfaces form a dag based on their relationships defined by the extends or implements keywords

11252207
implements	extends
if a extends b or a implements b then b is a direct superclass or superinterface of a

11252222
hide	show
i have a bool dependency property called isshown which is used to hide show the modal content

11252222
hide	show
the showmodalcontent and hidemodalcontent methods contain the logic to show and hide the modal content respectively

11252258
superclass	subclassing
the best solution here would be write superclass that contains the common elements of both classes and then have each of your subclassing extends the superclass that way you could have a list of type superclass

11252268
int	chars
all the scores are int and a student name consists of no more than 10 chars

11252344
width	height
if you think of the texture mapping process as wrapping a sheet of paper around the cylinder so the height of the cylinder height of the paper and perimeter of the cylinder width of the paper all you need to do is generate texcoords that change the y or x along with angle but this will go from 0-1 whereas angle goes from 0 to pi

11252357
hash	md5
determine the md5 hash value for the image

11252357
hash	md5
copy the new files to the public folder using the md5 hash value as part of the file name

jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
for one of my projects i decided to benchmark jython cpython and pypy using the project s innermost loop

11252385
xmltype	clob
otherwise in order to parse the data you re going to have to convert the clob to an xmltype at runtime

11252390
rar	zip
for instance if you had both a zip and a rar version of my-program then you could make it so you link to just my-program and the browser chooses the version it likes best

11252408
post	put	post	get	put	get
i put all post results in variables you should get into this habit it makes thing like the above work

11252466
post	get
each time you request get or post a page a new instance of the _default class derived system.web.ui.page is created and then destroyed the same happens with the contained controls

11252477
int	double
int and double are both primitive data types therefore you do not need to use a star when defining them

11252534
min	max
i ve also figured out how to determine the bounding box max lat min lat - max long min long for the determination of which zips fit the criteria we aren t going to worry about a precise radius

11252597
sequence	permutation
i need to make a permutation that looks like a sequence of 1-n with a 0 stuffed in place #k

11252649
int	chars
this is putting a chars which is an int chars code into your test array

11252653
children	parent
we have a tree structure which in jpa naturally is a onetomany relation with the children in a list in the parent node

11252653
many-to-many	one-to-many
for example we ve found that for our scenarios there s absolutely no need to expose rule writers to many-to-many relationships which proved very complicated to handle in drools - so we make them look like one-to-many instead and everything becomes more natural

11252661
int	chars
alternatively you can still use console.read which returns the int representation of the chars entered confirm that the chars is in fact a number and convert from the ascii code to the appropriate number

11252679
hide	show
in the keychain access program under the view menu select show expired certificates if the menu item says hide expired certificates then you re already showing them

11252691
stdout	stderr
however i would question whether you really want to show all stdout and or stderr to the user

11252700
inherited	properties
at the moment i don t believe there is a way while imagebrush inherited from tilebrush it s missing the important properties tilemode

11252799
hide	show
the problem is that in your definition of typesentence apply hide a variable bound as x in the definition of show of typesentence parametrized by some arbitrary existentially-hidden type b

11252815
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome and safari

11252834
keydown	keyup
the problem with ribbontextbox is that the keydown and keyup event are not triggered when you press enter key

11252835
hash	md5
if the actual data need never be saved locally i would only ever store the md5 hash and calculate it on the fly when checking

11252874
post	get
i used a method post instead of a method get in the form_for tag after seeing

11252886
children	parent
you need to restructure your list a little bit you want to keep the children within the parent

11252904
width	height
displaymetrics class gives me access to actual width and height of the screen

11252911
hash	md5
wouldn t the md5 hash object be aware of the internal identity when the magic __eq__ methods are called

11253005
explode	implode
because of your each line requirement i would first split the string to an array using explode then loop through the array and add text to the beginning of each line and then turn the array back to a string using implode

11253019
udp	tcp
i currently have n threads that are all open udp tcp connections

11253080
width	height
another reason to fail the width or height overflows the window

11253095

getter	setter
the log class is just a bunch of getter and setter of type string

11253148
ciimage	uiimage
upon moving the slider a filter is applied to the ciimage then the ciimage is rendered into the the uiimageview s uiimage

this is where i actually set the uiimageview s image property and initialize the ciimage cicontext and cifilter objects

11253161
gmail	hotmail
due to filtering systems withing gmail and hotmail when using yourself as the receiver and the from it was going directly into spam within gmail and hotmail

11253161
gmail	hotmail
with gmail if the two values are different it would go into your inbox while hotmail will still count it as spam

11253162
put	get
i would like to get data from textbox which is in usercontrol and put it to a property in which is in a main window on way it work but other not

11253165
versioning	upgrade
the only work around that comes to mind is to use the core only versioning of nservicebus that would make the code you mention in your question to work properly the development versioning of nsb has been upgrade to raven 960 so another option would be to upgrade to the ci versioning of nservicebus

11253185
post	get	ssl	https
ssl was installed on our server and our site is mostly wordpress and there are some non-wordpress pages which work fine with https and the home page works as well but when i try to access a wordpress page post i get 404 page not found error

my script works perfectly in google-chrome but it does not show my custom message in firefox

11253291
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
i can t see your html or a demo so i m not positive this will solve it but typically the result you describe is caused by using mouseover mouseout rather than mouseenter mouseleave

11253307
filesystems	fat
very large files tend not to be very dependent on which filesystems you use modern filesystems not fat

11253346
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
jquery uses either activexobject for ie or xmlhttprequest all others but ie 8 and above requires xdomainrequest for ajax

11253351

in firefox and google-chrome i get the expected

11253520
redmine	trac
i think things such as redmine or trac are an overkill but anyway notice this outlining thread here and this ticket here

11253530
google-chrome	firefox
to see what happens under the hood you can also use firebug if you re using firefox or ctrl+shift+i if you re on google-chrome

11253579
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the problem i have is when i initialise the plist array either in the appdelegate applicationdidfinishlaunching or the rootviewcontrollers viewdidload or viewdidappear methods

11253579
viewdidload	viewwillappear
and in the viewdidload or viewwillappear i check the array with

ssl	https
if you need to redirect from non-www to www then redirect to https for certificates like thawte that dont support www non-www on ssl 123

11253659
google-chrome	safari
by intermittent i mean that on the same browser safari in this case i can view that javascript file in my browser and refresh the page and still only see the file partially downloaded but another browser google-chrome i see the file correctly downloaded

11253664
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
i have tried some stuff with preg_match getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname

11253665
sorting	filtering
it does not allow you to parametrize table names or column names or keywords just values for filtering sorting inserting updating etc.

11253665
prepare	execute
on the contrary you have to do 2 operations prepare and execute which might actually end up slowing things down only a bit

11253674
multiplying	add
normalise this vector multiplying by d add to each point

11253676
post	get
i ve seen lots of post on stackoverflow and the asp.net forums on this issue and i ve tried to implement some of the solutions - even using javascript redirects but i still haven t been able to get this to work

11253676
post	get
here are the franchisecontroller create actions - both get and post - that i am using

11253683
spaces	delimiter
you can pass .removeattr a spaces delimiter list of attributes to remove so you don t need to loop through the attribute names one-by-one

11253732
google-chrome	firefox
document.referrer in javascript is blank from a 302 redirect from http to https using a f5 load balancer in firefox and google-chrome but shows up in ie

11253734
width	height
every time i call boundsonelement i get back a qrect that correctly corresponds to the top left corner of the text element after applying matrixforelement of course but its width and height are always zero

11253740
children	parent
i am trying to use d3.js to display a treemap where a parent s value may be greater than the sum of its children

11253740
children	parent
in particular the parent should be a rectangle on top of the children rectangles whose size is correctly proportional

11253740
children	parent
if the parent does not add any additional size the parent should still be displayed but at minimal size maybe a tiny rectangle spanning the top of the children just to indicate the parent name

11253742
inherited	properties
the annoyance is made worse by the fact that one cannot simply declare ireadablefoo with a read-only properties iwriteonlyfoo with a write-only properties and have ireadwritefoo simply inherited both

11253742
getter	setter
not that i can see any ambiguity--i can t see how the first could use anything but a getter or the latter anything but a setter but the compiler can t resolve it

11253765
plotrix	aesthetics
i foresee this may be approached using panes from the plotrix package to give it the aesthetics feel that ggplot s faceting gives

hide	show
if not can i modify the second function so that it doesn t hide the particular container i m trying to show as soon as it pops up

11253856
rxtx	smslib
the situation with javax.comm on windows is a bit of a mess the smslib installation instructions suggest to use rxtx instead and point to cloudhopper s page for a windows version

11253883
int	chars
parseint reads as much of a string as it can that can to form an int in this case on the first two chars 1 and 9 for 19

11253898
128bit	64bit
the factor would be another int64 so i d multiply the mantissa by it such that i obtained the top 64bit of the resulting 128bit number

11253898
multiplication	exponent
this int64 mantissa can be cast to a float losing only the necessary precision and the 2 q exponent can be applied using multiplication with no loss of precision

11253923
google-chrome	firefox
for further verification that you never left the home page view net tab in firebug firefox or network tab in google-chrome

11253959
stdout	fflush
if you are the owner of the program on windows and if you can modify it you need to fflush the buffer after every output to stdout this should solve your problem i guess

11253970
put	get
and when i put some data and select it i get only some strange characters

11254010
integer	unsigned
because byte array contains signed bytes it can contain -1 which is actually 255 as unsigned byte and thus indicate incorrect end of stream so is used to convert signed byte to unsigned bytes as integer values

11254023
sse	avx
interestingly non-temporal write-combining full cache line writes avx sse work as expected they always go to fpga and fpga observes full cache line writes reads return correct values afterwards

11254066
rvm	bundler
i m currently trying to run bundle install to install a git based gem using a gemfile and consequently use ruby other ruby commands without bundler with the latest version of rvm 1.14.3

11254161
hide	show
my plan was to include both the flash and svg animations on a page and show hide them based on a javascript detection

11254161
hide	show
my plan is to detect whether the browser supports the feature when the page loads and if it is supported hide the flash object id rotateflash and show the svg object id rotatesvg

11254161
hide	show
i ve found show hide javascripts but don t know how to implement detecting that feature with them

11254191
equals	gethashcode
in summary you must have an override of gethashcode and equals that knows how to do comparison on all properties of composite id

11254192
strlen	strdup	strdup	malloc	memcpy	malloc	memcpy	strdup
if you don t have the strdup function you have to implement it using malloc strlen and memcpy

it is setup with an nsoperationqueue that runs a bunch of nsoperation wrappers around an an asynchronous nsurlconnection

11254239
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome for ios is just a skin over the built in safari browser

11254239
google-chrome	safari
if safari is blocked from playing sounds so will the google-chrome browser

11254310
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux php 5.3.14 currently giving a try to php 5.4 and see if it helps

11254330
sudo	passwd
this is ubuntu live desktop os so sudo would not prompt for passwd and just execute the command with elevated privilage

11254338
cpu	processors
one ec2 compute unit provides the equivalent cpu capacity of a 1.0-1.2 ghz 2007 opteron or 2007 xeon processors

11254390
for-loop	arrays
crnt is short for current and typically indicates a for-loop variable or a value extracted from an arrays for one iteration of a for-loop

11254405
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome but in firefox it gives me

hide	show
i m trying to hide elements with the same class name float_form but i m also trying to use the script below to show them all of the float_form class divs are initially hidden

11254429
hide	show
without compromising the show hide id element since there is a loop with the div id as the key

11254457
hide	show
for some reason the show hide works perfectly fine on the items that are initially loaded but it does nothing when i click on the ones loaded by the ajax call

11254580
maven	pom.xml
for some reason maven was not adding the dependencies although they were all specified in my pom.xml

maya and blender these are a whole new world for me

11254586

i really don t want this happen again with maya or blender

11254586
maya	blender
is this possible with maya or blender

11254639
avr	microcontroller
i ve installed gcc on my mac snow leopard so i can compile for avr microcontroller

11254648
int	chars
once you get into the habit of using signed chars and unsigned chars only as small usually 8-bit int for arithmetic and you use only chars when you re operating on chars data it ll seem completely natural that chars is a separate type with implementation-defined signedness and even more natural that string processing functions always use chars and rather than the signed or unsigned variants

11254652
post	get
you can t hide the form before submission otherwise the browser won t get post its hidden fields therefore you have to hide it after sumbission

11254652
submit	submission
even with the settimeout delay set to zero will execute from a different event thread after form submission has happened in the original submit thread

11254665
exponent	modulo
if you don t send your public key as a certificate you are better off just sending the modulo and the public exponent separately base 64 encoded in separate fields

11254697
viewdidload	viewdidappear
presentmodalviewcontroller works only when present in viewdidappear and not on viewdidload

11254715
viewdidload	viewdidappear
simply put you would want to create any controls or arrays in viewdidload where as in viewdidappear is where you would want to refresh those controls or arrays

11254715
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload is called once when the controller is created and viewdidappear is called each time the view well did appear

11254715
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so say you have a modal view that you present when that view is dismissed viewdidappear will be called and viewdidload will not be called

11254735
implements	modifiers
implements your own clipexpectedandactual and findmismatchposition - here are non-spacing modifiers are respected

11254738
versioning	upgrade
this may be beyond the scope of your original question but as you contemplate the eventual deployment of your app and more importantly subsequent upgrade releases of your app you might want to add some table to your database with some internal database versioning number that you can use to determine what versioning of the database the user has in their documents folder and do any modifications to that database that you might need to support the latest versioning of your app

11254753
cos	sin
these are a set of ordinary differential equations these are just for testing how to work with cos and sin as ode

11254753
cos	sin
i am unsure how to express for cos.this is just a trial example i was doing so as to know how to work with equations where we have a cos sin etc terms as a function of another variable

11254768
for-loop	loops
try nesting a for each loops within a for-loop

11254782
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome but in safari it doesn t move it is just rotating and in internet explorer it moves without rotating

11254829
iboutlet	ibaction
i know the differences between ibaction and iboutlet but i don t know when i should use one over the other

11254861
iboutlet	ibaction
an iboutlet is a connection to an object and an ibaction is a connection to a method to be invoked as a callback

11254861
iboutlet	ibaction
for example you might have ten buttons and one label but you might connect to the label using an iboutlet so you can update its value and a single function - ibaction buttonpressed id sender

11254877
iboutlet	ibaction
ok iboutlet and ibaction serve two separate purposes

11254890
iboutlet	ibaction
in your case i would create one iboutlet for the label and one ibaction for the buttons

11254890
iboutlet	ibaction
i only put in the code relevant to ibaction and iboutlet you need an iboutlet for the label in order to update the text and you need the ibaction to change the label s text to the digit pressed

11254908
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i d like to set up loggly to run on amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk but can t find any information on how to do this

11254939
pull	push
since there are no complex relations in database it will be fast to push pull data from database to memcache

11254941
google-chrome	firefox
the code executes fine in google-chrome but fails in ie7-9 and firefox

11254947
queue	fifo
the observer pattern might help here but remember putting the tasks for rescheduling into a fifo queue or a priority queue sorted by start time

11255019
post	get
anyway you should either use post and face some issues with browser behavior like returning back to the page as you described or ctrl-r-ing the page or use get and have all parameters in the url

11255032
post	get
i thought i post it here where i ve come many times to get answers to a lot of questions and code-errors

11255059
post	get
as a side note even though it was mentioned earlier in this post sometimes the query won t have the and season 2011-2012 part so i must not get duplicates for the same player in different seasons either

11255068
dlsym	dlopen
you use dlopen dlsym to access symbols

11255106
hash	md5
the data in a file has been hash using the md5 algorithm and signed using a private rsa key and the signature saved to a separate file

11255212
children	parent
be aware if you close the parent window you will close the children also

11255216
src	attr
this img tags src attr is calling the url.action to call the action to render the gauge

11255216
src	attr
the src attr seems to render fine

11255218
nfa	dfa
therefore there is no nfa or dfa that can ever recognize them

11255231
typedef	struct
this would obviously not be as generic since deducing parameter types of an operator of a passed-in struct type is impossible without relying on the user to specify some kind of typedef as an example

11255259
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to iterate through your arrays

11255291
public	protected
if you can use a common base class you can easily use a public sealed method that does the invocation and a protected abstract method that does the logic

11255296
apache	nginx
i m using apache on the backend listening to 1740 and nginx is listening to 80 with a proxy_pass to upstream 127.0.0.1 1740

stateless	stateful

also you probably shouldn t be accessing the arrays directly from the main class instead put all the code from your main classes for-loop into a method in the truthtable class and call that method from main because you should tell an object what to do rather than asking for it s data

11268164

the cpu has no notion of type what it gets in its 32-bit or 64bit or 128bit sse or 256-bit avx - let s keep it simple at 32 registers needs to be properly aligned in order to be processed correctly and efficiently

11268330
int	chars
imagine a simple scenario where you have a chars followed by an int

11268330
int	chars
in a 32-bit architecture that s 1 byte for a chars and 4 bytes for an int

11268330
int	chars
visually - the first green byte is the mentioned chars and the three green bytes plus the first red one of the second block is the 4-byte int colorcoded on a 4-byte access boundary we re talking about a 32-bit register

11268330
int	chars
the instead part at the bottom shows an ideal setup where the int hits the register properly the chars getting padded into obedience somewhere off image

11268330
sse	avx
read more on data alignment which comes quite handy when you re dealing with fancy extensions of the instruction set like sse 128-bit regs or avx 256-bit regs so special care must be taken so that the optimizations of vectorization are not defeated aligning on a 16-byte boundary for sse 16 8 - 128-bits

11268340
for-loop	arrays
to add the view controllers to the arrays there s no need to have a for-loop

this is simply impossible and by that i mean that if you remove a or fadein fadeout or whatever you do on it you remove all of his children at the same time because its in the same container

11268925
width	height
knowing that there are still way to fake the background image like for instance a div inside the parent in position absolute top 0 and left 0 parent must be relative with height and width at 100 and z-index at -1 make sure it is behind everything

11269074
firefox	safari
stranger still there is near zero banding in safari firefox or ie9

11269074

this is also true with safari however google-chrome does not have this behavior banding is more noticeable on the native side always and less noticeable on the cinema side

11269128

octal	hex
if you use octal you ll have to split bytes across multiple characters so i d stick with hex

11269144
google-chrome	firefox
this works out fine in google-chrome or firefox

wakelock	powermanager
i have been using powermanager and wakelock but this way is kind of deprecated now

11269456

11269759
width	height
you will need to set the height and width of whichever you choose and make sure display block or display inline-block is set

11269774

the message that accompanies the folder are permission denied or no such file or directory

11269921
stdout	stderr
the funnels stderr to stdout so that both can be piped into the grep utility

11270016
symfony	silex
i know to use symfony2 and i would like to know if silex is very different of symfony or it s the same thing same operation same code.

11270022
symfony	silex
silex is based on the independent symfony2 components and isn t truly considered a full-stack web application framework like symfony is

11270071

you may consider writing in to blog sites like dailyjs or post to some mailing lists to get the word-of-mouth out but having your code on github and your package on npm is a solid start

11270072
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox opera....all do

return-value-optimization	nrvo
in a world without return-value-optimization nrvo this should avoid the copy construction in a pre c++11 standard library

11270330
min	max
use min instead of max and grab the id then join

11270352
subtraction	addition
this suggests to me that there s an addition vs a subtraction swapped somewhere

11270365
children	parent
the other solution i like the most would be to play with div elements s css and z-index in the way that - hovering the parent we animate he content children element from underneath

11270369
rdf	owl
if you are familiar with the java rdf and owl engine jena then you have run across their philosophy that everything should be specified as an interface when possible

11270422
qlist	qmap
i know there are certain functions in qt like qlist and qmap but both are not multidimensional and too unflexible for this case

11270424
move	drag
if the onscale event is not triggered i treat this event as a potential drag and move the displayed item around

11270463
uiview	subviews
i have a main uinavigationcontroller that loads a uitableview as a subviews as my main view i push a new uiview controller on then in that viewcontroller i add a left nav button to popviewcontroller bringing me back to the main view

post	get
actually though i imagine you will get into use text search to find data in the post

11270537
maven	m2e
so i thought that i needed to update the software so i went into help check for updates and then i guess it found a better version of m2e but now the import existing maven project is gone now

11270553

corecompile input file c buildagent temp buildtmp.netframework version v4.0 profiling client.assemblyattributes.cs is newer than output file bin debugging dllname.xml

11270586
children	parent
if i was you i would center the parent on the stage and then iterate through the children withing the parent and center each one within the parent

width and height set to 0

11270603
int	double	int	chars
chars and short are promoted to int float is promoted to double etc

11270603
int	double	int	chars
so that chars and short values could be passed to functions with int parameters or float values could be passed to functions with double parameters the compiler promoted the smaller types to be of the larger type

11270618
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
perhaps you should use borders instead and maybe with box-sizing border-box in case you can t subtract from width or padding

11270620
inherited	properties
i do this because they already inherited that properties defined in the base class fileentry

11270679
goto	break
there s no such thing as while in the command processor of course and since goto line statements break out of all loops it s not an option for iterating over some set of values for a specific duration before proceeding to the next value

11270680
folder	directory
i am currently using the code from to try and unzip the file yet all it does is create a directory called for example zipfile and then have a sub directory in it called folder which has nothing inside the directory which obviously should not be happening

jasmine	qunit
i use qunit in my example but you can easily substitute qunit for jasmine

11270748

a correct javascript inherited example that is similar in spirit to what you are doing would use object.create to create a dog with the correct prototype properties

11270764
division	multiplication
now how to make the pointers move like that even if you can only increment and can t to multiplication or division

11270782
symfony	silex
one that i prefer is silex because it promotes encourages good programming habits practices and as your projects grow you can seamlessly evolve into the more full-stack world of symfony

11270787
width	height
if the image goes out of the div a bit that s fine but i need it to resize with the div which resizes with the page both height and width

11270788
google-chrome	firefox
our solution at work involves three virtual machines running ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox and google-chrome all the time and our maven build process runs our javascript unit tests at every build

11270790
post	get
of course the challenge with one xsd is a response to a get operation - which does not require a xml from the client - will require the client to ignore the post content in the xml

11270804
for-loop	arrays
but because the string arrays is of a fixed size i need to create a new arrays and copy the prepended result using a for-loop

11270840
vtune	perf
i strongly suggest that you try them and profile the solution perf oprofile vtune etc to see if your bottleneck is really related to the locking mechanism itself and not things like cache utilization memory throughput cpu cycles io access remote-node memory accesses etc

11270844
gridview	datalist
datalist lacks functionality of pagging like in gridview but its possible to implement pagging functionality for datalist

11270863
crypt	salt
and as mark b said in his answer you should append the salt before you crypt

11270863

11270921
subtraction	addition
apparently one of the operations in settorotate need to be changed from addition to subtraction

11270924
crypt	salt
you crypt your password say it comes out to be 123 attach the salt and end up with 123abc which you store in the database

11270924

satisfy height width or width height depending on which is smaller

11271004
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

11271010
width	height
first you need to get the image properties and see which one is larger the height or the width then resize the image based on the div size after the window resizes like this

11271046
uiview	calayer
alright the answer for me was the calayer that underlies every uiview

11271082
getter	setter
it will save you a lot of typing as it produces all the getter and setter for you

11271096
getter	setter
you have attempted to implement your getter and setter as class methods instead of instance methods

11271101
lodash	underscore.js
note lodash an underscore.js competitor also offers a comparable .uniq implementation

where the google-chrome and firefox console.log states

11271216
internationalization	localization
i m not sure how to properly use nsnumberformatter for the following case and properly keep the localization internationalization

11271219
int	double
also see this earlier article which explains that int access is necessarily atomic but not double or long

11271219
int	double
these together mean that if your int field is declared volatile then no locks are necessary to guarantee atomicity you will always see a value that was last written to the memory location not some confused value resulting from a half-complete write as is possible with double or long

11271219
getter	setter
however you seem to imply that your getter and setter themselves are atomic

11271229
hide	show
also it would be better than changing the css to use hide and show

11271261
ncover	dotcover
if you use nunit tests i would say use dotcover by jetbrains ncover or an open source version is part cover which isnt being added to new features anymore

11271261
ncover	dotcover
i use ncover and i like it i also toyed with dotcover and its pretty good also

11271262
setinterval	settimeout
there is another method called setinterval but it is better to use settimeout with a recursive function

11271269
hash	md5
you should use bcrypt instead of md5 or sha-x to hash your passwords this will make decrypting your passwords a lot harder if someone steals your database because i guess you are on a shared or managed host

11271285
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 12.04 last stable google chrome browser always up to date

11271293
int	double
the variables themselves can actually be handled pretty easily read in the values and put them into a or int instead of double if the values are all int

11271304
profiling	debugging
currently i have to manually build each configuration debugging profiling release configs and it s getting annoying

11271307

11271342
pbkdf2	hash
by default django uses the pbkdf2 algorithm with a sha256 hash a

11271357
apache	nginx
if you re using apache or nginx you can use rewrite rules to process requests for your sitemap file to a php script that generates the sitemap contents instead together with the appropriate headers

11271369
division	multiplication
actually there is a good reason that as a general rule of thumb multiplication will be faster than division

11271369
division	subtract
floating point division in hardware is done either with shift and conditional subtract algorithms long division with binary numbers or - more likely these days - with iterations like goldschmidt s algorithm

11271378
put	get
why i am asking this is i am planning to put 50 school management applications with an single server so 50 rails applications is it possible or i am going to get out of memory error like the stuffs one that getting in java

versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to the latest versioning of xcode but apps made with this new versioning aren t running on my old ipod

11271620
qtreewidget	qtoolbutton
i believe its more efficient to actually subclass the qtreewidget compose it with the qtoolbutton as a member and then overload the resizeevent locally to handle the resize

11271648
client-side	server-side
we mostly use ajax which consists in a client-side javascript code that calls a server-side page with out leaving the page

11271648
content-length	content-type
note that here we use the setrequestheader method to change the headers of this http request and in this case to change the content-type and the content-length this header has a default value of 4096 bytes

integer	unsigned
c reverse bits in unsigned integer

uiview	subviews
in my program i have placed a uibutton as a subviews of a uiview both of which have userinteractionenabled set to true

11271775
try-catch	exception-handling
you should only use try-catch if you expect the possibility of the error and can do something about it--otherwise you should just let the exception-handling bubble up

11271777
lsp	principles
i think you want to apply dry don t repeat yourself design principles and partially lsp liskov substitution principles if you want some method to be stored in a class and then use this method from other two classes then i think prefering composing over inheritance will be a good idea

11271783
autocomplete	typeahead
the location field uses twitter bootstrap s typeahead function to display an autocomplete list of entries

11271785

11271971
cgsize	cgrect
in the view controller implement - cgsize contentsizeforviewinpopover and return a cgrect of the desired size

11271973
put	get
by the way instead of using query strings in your get request you could put those in as route kwargs and do nicer things the syntax is when no keyword name is given like in it just matches the regex and doesn t pass anything through to you

11271996
folder	directory
is there any folder named web-inf in your eclipse directory

i am creating a demo of math operation like addition subtraction multiplication and division using ndk

11272121

simply you cannot select multiple columns with one column in group by clause except for if you put them in some group function avg min max etc or you add all the columns in the group by clause itself

11272156
setinterval	settimeout
you use setinterval to call unpeektile every 1000 milliseconds and then you call settimeout to run peektile after 1000 milliseconds at the end of the unpeektile function

versioning	upgrade
in case it is there then versioning 1.1 knows it should upgrade the db by copying it over from the resource directory

11275458
versioning	upgrade
in general you might store a versioning number in nsuserdefaults so that each future versioning of your app has a way to know whether it is an upgrade os a new install if the versioning number is there then it is an upgrade from that specific versioning otherwise it is a new install

11275492
spaces	delimiter
a potential issue with this in terms of obfuscation is that the strings are very clearly delimiter thanks to proper monospace fonts and syntax highlighting so i am not sure how useful raw spaces themselves will be

for-loop	arrays
as i don t want to list every bind separately i decided to put all the div ids in an arrays workarr and create a for-loop

accessor	properties
so you can store the name of a properties as value of a variable or another properties and then access the variable or properties in the properties accessor

11275573
inherited	properties
in addition it also iterates over the enumerable inherited properties which is why one solution requires the hasownproperty call

11275573
accessor	properties
because indexes are not identifiers they start with a decimal digit you have to use the bracket properties accessor syntax some people misunderstand this and refer to all ecmascript objects as arrays even call them associative arrays and the array operator

11275573
inherited	properties
if not set means that the object does not have the properties but may inherited it then you should use hasownproperty as used in mahn s solution

11275573
inherited	properties
if not set means that the object does not have the properties and does not inherited it then you should use the in operator provided that the object is not a host object because the in operator is not specified for them

11275573
inherited	properties
if not set means that the object either has or inherited the properties but the properties has the undefined value or the object neither has nor inherited the properties then you should use the typeof operator as used in bob davies and aetaur s solutions but the latter approach using array.prototype.every is less compatible as-is

implements	extends
however i would reconsider to revisit your design and see if you can avoid having this - maybe you need to define another interface which will hold the methods that are always implements and extends it in another interface or provide an interface with no extension to the previous one for the methods you not always implements

11276154

other languages are vbscript and jscript via windows scripting host and batch files so nothing you d really want to implement more complicated stuff in

11280270
inherited	properties
and have my viewmodels that use this to inherited them and another interfaces with proxy properties like this

11280295
put	get
generally it is considered good practice to put source files in packages directories - it makes it easier to organise them as your projects get bigger

11280303
int	boolean
your class will extend defaulttablecellrenderer and override the method gettablecellrenderercomponent jtable table object value boolean isselected boolean hasfocus int row int column

11280366
switching	screens
i know it is working there because when it first runs the switching class directs it to the home screens

11280402
implements	extends
yes it would be a very bad idea - impossible in fact - interfaces cannot implements or extends classes

11280449
stdout	stderr
the first idea i had was something like ignoring that i need the child s stdin stdout stderr

11280449
stdout	stderr
i don t like this general approach because this shoves all errors concerning process invocation into the exit code of the child process and the stdout stderr which i need as binary streams in my application

11280475
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i never used it by myself for me it was enough to do all work in viewwillappear and viewdidload

11280503
velocity	rythm
note rythm is very fast about 2 to 3 times faster than string.format and velocity because it compiles the template into java byte code the runtime performance is very close to concatentation with stringbuilder

11280506
feof	fread
i went to add a unit test for this before fixing it but got stuck because i cannot mock fread and the other php built-in functions i m using such as fsockopen feof etc.

you can use this after you add your uiview as subviews then you can call this method as scale it

11280641
velocity	rythm
note rythm is very fast about 2 to 3 times faster than string.format and velocity because it compiles the template into java byte code the runtime performance is very close to concatentation with stringbuilder

it turns out that both bindingsource objects have exactly same instance of dataview condition is true

11280692
jstl	taglib
they can be fully avoided by using jstl taglib with el which is the clean and highly recommended way to iterate your query results in jsp

11280692
post	get
for the query part leave all the processing to a java class storing the query results in a variable mylist of type list and sending it get post forward to your page which should only show the values and nothing else

11280734
portrait	landscape
lets say i am starting with portrait view then i can see all imageviews in portrait view and if it changed to landscape then view is blank

11280734
uiview	subviews
its not problem with uiview rather its with calculation of subviews positions after device rotation

11280789
bindingsource	dataview
it seems that to change this behaviour one can create two different dataview instances for datatable and assign them to datasource property of two bindingsource objects accordingly

11280794
awt	swing
lightweight swing jcomponents are behind awt components

11280794

uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
the uiview of a uiviewcontroller is presented by a uiwindow

11281263
uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
when you change the uiview of a uiviewcontroller by constructing a new uiview it does not mean that it will reflect in the uiwindow

11281263
uiview	uiwindow
you might be so lucky that it works the first time however if you reconstruct the uiview before it is presented by the uiwindow everything still works but it is still a bad design that might easily break like you are seeing after the timing is changed

11281303
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and installed ubuntu

11281312
stdout	stderr
so it becomes redirect 2 stderr to where 1 stdout already currently is and add both streams

width	height
i would recommend using width 100 and height 100 to make it resize just enough to hold the content inclusive of all margins and padding

11281477
width	height
my desired outcome is that each cell is 33 of the width of the screen and each cell is 20 of the height of the screen

11281477
width	height
the problem is that as i resize the browser although the width works perfectly the height doesn t work in the same way

11281477
width	height
in each level i m defining the width and height and then inside i m defining a relative percentage bearing in mind the parent container

11281477
width	height
at the inner most level where the image tag is it s set to 100 x100 so that it fills it s container width as 33 defined in the td and height 20 defined in the tr

11281477
width	height
the div is set to use 100 of the width of the browser and 100 of the height

11281477
width	height
the td is defined as 33 width 3 columns of 33 to fill the browser and height 100 this column will fill 100 of it s parent tr which is set to 20 of the browser height

11281491
int	chars

i have looked around but...all i get from reading about when put in action it will only work for the one div which obvs the content div results for each post and separate comments as you can see in the code

11283429

width	height
what i am trying to achieve is to find max height and max width of each grid in stackpanel and apply it to all of them

11290881
width	height
i think that is because whenever you set height width to wrap_content it makes the layout as much wide or tall that it can accomodate the background of the layout the child views of the layout so it will grow even bigger if you add some more child to the layout

11290881
width	height
you can try and use the linearlayout s weightsum and layout_weight attributes and manage the height and width of your layout by appllying proper weight

the normal default behavior that i have seen by looking at the postgres query log is to see lots of parse bind execute for the same query so it seems that even though jdbc prepare statements are used they are not being cached by the postgres jdbc driver or on the server

reading online seemed to indicate that i had to configure prepare statement pooling on the postgres jdbc driver so i added to my application context.xml resource definition but i still don t see any caching going on it is still a lot of parse bind messages in the log file even when i get a prepare statement to execute more than 3 times

it looks like when you return from your web view google page the two views you mention above are being displayed in portrait mode but the device is in landscape

width	height
if so you could just store the two views frame coordinates x y width and height before you transition to the uiwebview page and restore them when you transition back

ostringstream	std
recommend using a std ostringstream you need to to construct your query

11295244
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog	savefiledialog	openfiledialog	folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog
i could be wrong but given that we have the openfiledialog savefiledialog and folderbrowserdialog windows i would have thought there d also be a control for viewing windows explorer

11295287
width	height
so if you set the layout width or layout height of your listview to wrap_content the listview will try to measure every single view that is attached to it - which is definitely not what you want

11295287
listview	gridview
keep in mind avoid setting wrap_content for listview or gridview at all times for more details see this google i o video talking about the world of listview

google-chrome	firefox
it all works fine in firefox but in internet explorer and google-chrome the button never seems to disappear

11295530
facebook	fbconnect
i successfully posted an image along with text to a facebook wall using the old fbconnect api

11295533

the reason for checking things in the server as well is that a malicious user can send manually crafter post or get requests to your server irrespective if those forms exist in your application or are disabled in your browser

11295554
express	node.js
i m using node.js + express to build a web application and i find the connect bodyparser that express exposes to be very useful in most cases

11295571
google-chrome	safari
these work in safari and google-chrome

11295576
inherited	properties
the best thing to do so you can access this everyone within your application is to create a class called basecontroller which all your other controllers inherited from and put this code on there ideally as a properties called domaincontext

11295583
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
instead you create subclasses of uiviewcontroller and then use a normal uinavigationcontroller instance to handle your view controllers

11295590
allocator	stl
ignoring the potential challenge of supporting customized allocator instead of assuming that allocator must go through the global new delete operator it seems that it is possible to build an stl compliant vector class that uses only 16 bytes or at worst 24 bytes to support the _alloc pointer

11295620
min	max
the collection contains objects that represent intervals properties name string min double and max double

11295620

multiplying	addition
whatever memory you save is going to be offset by having to do the addition and a multiplying on every call to end okay if it s a vector where the multiplying can be optimized out

11295736
ssl	https
if you don t want to use ssl https then you are correct in your thinking that you need to avoid sending the password in cleartext

11295736
hash	md5
where hash is a secure hash function such as md5 or sha

11295736
ssl	https
these classes of attack require mutual authentication that can only be achieved via use of a third party such as a certification authority which brings us full circle back to ssl https

11295744
dictionary	map
you can use as john palmer already said but it may be worth pointing out that the f# standard library includes a purely functional sorted dictionary collection called map

11295765
post	get
if you don t care about the user-agent loading a new url and the other file is on your server but it just expects those variables in post instead of get you can just copy the values over and include the file

iboutlet	ibaction
my solution was to delete the button iboutlet in ib also delete the ibaction in ib and then connect it back

11295927
integer	unsigned
by casting as a signed or unsigned integer 8 bits in this case you are asking matlab to convert an ascii 3 to a decimal number

11295959
maven	pom.xml
activebydefault does not mean always active. per maven docs all profiles that are active by default are automatically deactivated when a profile in the pom.xml is activated on the command line or through its activation config. so if you have another profile active the one with profileid will not be

11295975
int	double
it seems like what you want to use is either to format the output string of an double decmial value and or use the math.round double int function instead

11295999
redmine	chiliproject
as a side note though when using redmine 2 or the upcoming chiliproject 4 rails 3 the class patching will be rather different from this approach - most probably easier

11296036
google-chrome	firefox
and every time ie and firefox work fine and google-chrome fails

11296074

i don t want to write an upgrade script changing the versioning everytime i update

11296458

for data types like int float etc. that don t require memory management you can get away without using the setter getter methods however it s good practice to use them all the time

11296682
rspec	capybara
i am new to capybara rspec and i wrote a simple test under spec requests to test the my root path

11296682
rspec	capybara

in safari google-chrome input gets focus and all text is selected

11296735
opera	firefox
in firefox opera input gets focus but cursor is in the beginning

11296741
next	except
so i think the best thing to do is echo all fifty items to the page inside divs labeled 0 to 49...then use javascript to hide all divs except 0 and 1 until you click a next button and it switches to hiding everything except 2 and 3...and so on.

11296767

i want to prevent my activity from restarting when i change the orientation from portrait to landscape so i call this on the corresponding activity on manifest

11296849
super	extends
a class can only extends one parent class therefore any calls to super will be resolved without ambiguity

11296849
comparator	comparable
it s best to think of interfaces as a list of must have s to qualify as a comparable your cluss must have a comparator method but it doesn t matter where it came from or what other interfaces require that same method

11296864
toolbar	tabs
this toolbar has jquery tabs

11296867
super	implements
from other hand interface method is also implements in super class which is enough for interface contract

if you look at the c++ operator-precedence and associativity you ll see that the division operator is left-to-right associativity which means this will be evaluated as 1 2 3 since

11296931
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome does not have that option but to make a webkit browsers safari google-chrome print the background image or colour you should add the following css style to the element

11296936
versioning	upgrade
since you are running sql server 2005 you need to run separate insert statements use union union all or upgrade the instance which is separate from management studio which is just a client tool you use to connect to instances running any number of versioning of sql server

11296952
disk	ram
this usually refers to system ram but can also be disk buffers nic buffers graphics card vram etc

11296952
disk	ram
you re not touching the ram nor the disk but you ve allocated a block of virtual address space to your process

11296952
disk	ram
keep in mind that none of this has anything to do with swapping which is the transfer of system memory pages to disk the so-called pagefile to increase the availability of fast system resources ram

ienumerable	ienumerator
an iterator ienumerator and ienumerable for c# is used to access elements of a structure in an ordered manner without exposing the underlying representation

11297013
authorization	access-control
however it took us ages to get wcf to work in a proper restful way - if we were doing the project from the start then we would probably write our own restful web-server that sits on top of http.sys instead of plugging into iis as it needlessly complicates things at times for example our service uses http basic authorization for access-control something iis likes to get in-between

11297020
typemock	moles
any mocking framework will help you with this task while moles typemock isolator and such will allow you to mock setauthcookie directly

11297026
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval keeps calling the enclosed function repeatedly till clearinterval is called

11297064
rss	feed
basically you create another file which transforms and styles the xml document your rss feed created in cakephp to make the browser render it differently

11297072
firefox	safari
everything works in firefox etc but safari tries to open the file in a new window resulting in gibberish for filetypes it does not understand

11297089
cos	sin
changing float to int will not give you space savings and may complicate computations 1.5 1.5 is easy in floats while if you are using scaled ints it will require extra operation 15 15 100 and sin cos used for rotation may not work so well either

11297144
submit	submission
while submission after the first submit you could add a warning with javascript

11297158

put	get
if you put identical code into a per-call wcf service you get the 2-3 seconds delay on every call the first call and all subsequent calls

11297215
getter	setter
i m wondering what s the canonical way in ruby to create custom setter and getter methods

11297215
getter	setter
however this makes implementing a getter a bit tricky creating a method with the same name but with no arguments will just overwrite the setter

11297215
getter	setter
ruby custom getter setter

11297217
width	height
simply set width and height of the svg-container to the maximum values the image is likely going to have and you are fine

11297217
opera	firefox
only restriction is that firefox and opera yes the same two browsers that caused this mess dont work well with very big images -- dont use too high values for the dimensions

11297217
opera	firefox
the reason why this works is that opera and firefox render svgs before resizing them instead of the other way round as it is supposed to be done with vector gfx

11297251
hide	show
could someone please tell me how to make an ajax hide show toggle script also alternate between showing the contents of another element block

11297251
hide	show

11297254
textview	imageview
with the imageview above the textview the application would crash at the following line

11297254
textview	imageview
if i moved the imageview below the textview the application would run but the textview were covered by the imageview

11297268
wan	lan
i want to deploy a wcf web service but to be perfect wsdl must be accessed from any computer from lan and wan

11297268
wan	lan
the problem is that when local lan ip is used wan users accessing through the public ip can t download references import because the wdsl uses the local ip in the url

11297296
post	get
in theory i could fire off multiple .load requests but i would have to either query the webservice multiple times inefficient or delay some elements so they get the post webservice data

11297297
children	parent
the filtered model will have a mapping between children and parent with the appropiate method to restore this family

11297297
implements	extends
lastly but most important there is the need to extends the underlying treetable by implements one method and overriding another

11297438
multiplying	addition
in addition if you want to elaborate on the director object by inheritance you may do so without multiplying your hierarchy

11297438
inherited	subclassing
for example you may have an express process of building for saving time before the final construction - you can subclassing the director object or even use template method on it in itself to customize it by inherited without requiring to reimplement your concrete builders

11297464
width	height
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used

11297472
min	max
and i want to extract the min and max value from it so that i will only have 2 time period left

11297472
min	max
i understand that it can t work because min and max functions are only working with an array but i don t know how to tranform my in an new array

11297547
keydown	keyup
i have looked into keydown keyup events and while keyup seems to give me the current value of the input after the user has pressed a key i am finding it difficult to remove the effects of what they typed.

11297559
post	get
of course there s a small bonus in the r representational in that a load balancer can easily route the request to the right server if you have nice urls and get could go to a slave while post go to masters

11297574
min	max
like you described then you can use the explode function to turn that string into an array and then use max and min on that array

11297587
google-chrome	safari
but for some reason it does not work on my iphone i have tried with both mobile safari and mobile google-chrome and all it does is open up the facebook auth page and then dies

11297609
width	height
you want the density scale according to the default of 160 it is a multiplier and when you obtain the height and width in pixels you can use this multiplier in your code to correctly scale

11297629
initializer	class-method
call it in the load or initializer class-method

11297630
keydown	keyup
of note is that keydown and keyup events will return the key pressed while keypress will return which character is entered which may be better for your choice

11297634
google-chrome	firefox
it works on my google-chrome and partially on firefox

11297641
google-chrome	safari
i ve been experiencing an issue in mobile versions of webkit specifically webkit 534.46 on ios 5.1.1 as mobile safari and now google-chrome for ios which doesn t happen on any desktop browser that i ve seen

11297722
getter	setter
with jackson you can annotate properties i.e - fields that have getter setter according to java bean convention with jsonignore

11297722
getter	setter
this way you can prevent issues like recursion no matching setter or getter and so on.

11297722
gson	jackson
try to find out if you have the same at gson or use jackson

terminate	timeout
if you are using an executor service you can terminate it with a timeout after having submitted all you callables

11297908
setinterval	settimeout
there re multiple possible ways of working around this but generally you ll have to schedule the animations to run sequentially by using settimeout setinterval animation_function total_interval delay

11297923
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
use dataoutputstream that is initialized with a bytearrayoutputstream in order to conveniently write data to the byte array inside an implementation of rowtobytearrayconverter

i am trying to store an image in my database via the url image location at the moment my php code is storing the image in a folder in the directory called upload

11297945
jobs	cron
i am new at cron jobs and am not sure whether this would would work

11297955
post	put

i ve recently upgrade my visualstudio 2010 installation with nuget 2.0 and it seems that this breaks the mvcscaffolding package from hanselman and kirkland

11298173
versioning	upgrade
of course the final statement in the stack dump is you may need to upgrade to a newer versioning of mvcscaffolding but i ve determined that this is appended to the end of all the errors

11298189
postgresql	mysql
it does appear to error in the mysql postgresql and oracle

11298200
pull	push
it depends what you specifically mean by backwards compatibility but you should be able to specify a --depth 1 argument to git clone as described in the git-clone man page and get something where patches can be shared although commits themselves won t be able to be shared via the normal push pull mechanism you might be used to

11298202
oncreate	ondestroy
when such a change occurs android restarts the running activity ondestroy is called followed by oncreate

11298208

11298384
put	get
lastly if you feel you really must change the attachment name and there are certainly cases where you need to the simplest way is to get the attachment from the old location or with the document put it as the new name and delete the attachment with the old name

int	chars
assume that the base type of every parameter without references rvalue references pointers or qualifiers is either chars int or float

11298520
int	chars
how can i make it so that all the parameters of base type chars appear first followed by all of those of base type int which leaves the parameters of base type float last

11298520
factors	matrix
in my case the expressions are conditional probability tables and the operation is the factors product but something like matrix multiplication works suitably as well.

11298593
hide	show
that s strange for many reasons i can see the files are definitely in the correct resources folder within the app the webview doesn t disappear or hide it simply show a white background as if it hasn t loaded anything

11298613
margin	height
this would make it always be 80 of the parent object s height have a 5 margin from the bottom and a 15 margin from the top where your header could fit

11298646
google-chrome	firefox
while browsers at least firefox and google-chrome don t parse it as a paragraph they do render a simple string the same as a paragraph in quirks mode by default

as far as the html goes i embedded the applet as applet code firstapplet width 300 height 300 with proper opening and closing tags and it is located in the same folder as the java app

11298713
put	get
i just wanted to get at the very last li last item using a css3 selector its nothing major just to put some rounded borders on the hover to stop it spilling out of a container so no back-compatibility is needed since the borders on the container won t be rounded on non css3 browsers anyway

11298788
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
i m programmatically adding a uisegmentedcontrol to my uinavigationbar as follows

11298801
freemarker	velocity
if maven resources plugin with filtering from properties files is not enough maybe you could use one of freemarker or velocity maven plugins to generate your pages

11298813
int	double
to cast a double to an int and have it be rounded to the nearest int unlike the typical int 1.8 and int 1.2 which will both round down towards 0 and return 1 simply add 0.5 to the double that you will typecast to an int

11298813
int	double
as a small note this method also allows you to control the threshold at which the double is rounded up or down upon int typecasting

11298813
int	double
that is by adding 0.8 to the double immediately before typecasting 10.15 and 10.03 will be rounded down to 10 upon int typecasting but 10.23 and 10.7 will be rounded up to 11

11298821
google-chrome	safari
i discovered a problem on the ipad that when setting the y-value of translate3d to below 16500px the graphic is not displayed anymore in safari or google-chrome it works totally fine

11298821
width	height
i thought that there might be a limit to the height width of rendering svgs on mobile safari but removing the overflow hidden from the #graphic container lets me scroll all the way down and everything it displayed correctly

11298837
width	height
i think the jquery.hover_caption.js relies on the width and height that you specified for image

11298837
width	height
it will take the width and height values and apply to the parent div that the plugin created on the fly

11298837
width	height
if you dont specify the width and height for the images the plugin will not know what height width it should put to the parent div

11298846
apache	nginx
in my experience passing css js through controllers slower than pure apache nginx request

11298887
feof	fread
if the stream is empty feof returns false while fread has not been called

11298887
fseek	fread
i can t fread 1 byte then fseek as this stream does not support seeking

it works fine in safari ie but not firefox

11299117
inherited	subclassing
the methods the category adds to the class are inherited by all the classÃ¢ s subclassing just like other methods

11299117
super	implements
it s okay to have a category on super and categories on its subclasses implements the same method and it ll work exactly like if they were part of the classes themselves

11299117
super	implements
though i do recommend following zneak s advice of implements a stub method on super to help with debugging if it ever gets invoked accidentally.

11299172
width	height
if you are getting 0 in the width and height then you will have to wait for the view to draw

11299192
centos	linux
i downloaded the linux 64-bit .run from here i m running 64-bit centos

11299469
width	height
so i get the screen height and width programmatically using

11299469
width	height
but if i set the width and height of my listview with the value measured using the above code the last record of my listview is partially not visible

11299513
getter	setter
the config is used in object creation and when first used in the constructor is applied to the object itself using special methods from the extjs class system core to generate getter and setter and then initialize the component from them

11299513
getter	setter
in your example above the textfield is initialized with your config overriding the default values of the component during creation and then it generates getter and setter for certain attributes like value id and fieldlabel which need to be used instead of config objects after a component is created

11299532
multiplying	add
you can use selector attributes with modern browsers but it s longer to write in a fiddle and then you must consider text password and select element in html 4.01 and in html5 add email number tel etc that ll multiplying the length of your selectors

11299550
button	checkbox
my app is not very complex - it only has a few checkbox and one button

11299571
uialertview	uiwindow
if you want to mimic the way uialertview works you need to create a new uiwindow object initialize it properly and show it using

11299575
folder	directory
the where clause of the query uses a directory that is passed to it in order to filter for music within that folder and sub folder

11299602
ienumerable	ienumerator
foreach is not a single operation but rather several calls on ienumerable and ienumerator ienumerable.getenumerator repeated calls to ienumerator.movenext

11299661
put	get
but if i put it on the python path i just get an ugly stack trace ending in

11299672
children	parent
what happens on the terminal ubuntu 10.04 python 2.6.5 if this matters is that i see the echoed c whenever i press it but neither does the parent die in time when all the children should have exited from the job sleeping nor was i able to reclaim the terminal without killing the parent process

11299681
post	get
hopefully once i get started on the project i ll be able to come back and post more intelligent and relevant questions

11299683
ienumerable	iqueryable
you need an iqueryable to use expressions you can bring it back to ienumerable with tolist or similiar

11299719
installation	upgrade
apparently you made a fresh sql server installation and not an upgrade which would have been the recommended approach

11299723
subtract	add
this is supposed to take the address of the items pointer subtract the number of items in the list and add the index of the desired item to the address of p

11299732
serializable	deserialization
the wcf service will do all serializable deserialization for you

11299746
udp	tcp
if you want to use sockets over the internet and you want your application to be usable on every network setting including nat you will have to use a tcp holepunch called technique or udp holepunching may also fit

11299768
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has good developer tools built in and in firefox you can install firebug

11299804
post	get
also remmeber that if you do that instead of relying on the page post mechanism you would have to use ajax to perform operations on the server otherwise you will get the invalid postback or callback argument

11299852
public	protected
also some mechanism that would allow a user of the cms to mark pages as protected public might make sense

11299854
free	malloc
you do not free the old vector when you do a malloc causing a memory leak

11299934
box-sizing	border-box
another solution is to change the box-sizing to border-box

11299935
floating-point	integer
you would have to use some alternate mechanism such as returning the value in a different type scaled to an integer in a string in a decimal floating-point format et cetera

11299935
floating-point	integer
this scales the value rounds it to an integer using the current floating-point rounding mode and undoes the scaling

11299945
ienumerable	ilist
change the datatype from ilist to ienumerable second initialize the attribute in the constructor

11299967
post	put
i saw another post recommending using a temporary table to put the data in and then drop the column but the insert machines have very low specs and the amount of data could be pretty significant on the order of 50 000 rows

11300046
for-loop	loops
if you feel that you re accumulating too much memory wrap the interior of the for-loop in an autoreleasepool so it reclaims memory at the end of each loops iteration

11300143
children	parent
do i continue to make serialized classes of the parent until the child tags have no children

11300147
int	chars
each node consists of two int that map to another chars

11300147
int	chars
this int taken alongwith some other chars again forms a node that maps to some other int

inherited	properties
another option is to use inherited and have a base class that has the minimum properties and a more robust class that inherited from the base class

11300274
downcasting	upcasting
while this wouldn t get around the duplicate entity object at least upcasting downcasting could work

11300297

i have and cdi bean usercontroller annotated as conversationscope with an attribute named as user with getter and setter exposed

11300329
post	get
i did some searching and found the post how to get the set real value of the visible property in asp.net which offered the following solution

fseek	ftell
try inserting fseek ... 0l seek_cur before ftell and see if it helps

11300395
portrait	landscape
trying to get it to display correctly in both landscape and portrait mode but when one works the other does not

11300406
integer	fractions
the numbers look to me like the integer part is a julian date and the fractions part is the fractions of a day

11300433
width	height
the view appears to be the width of an iphone and about 1cm in height

11300453
hide	show
you could show the element to get its position and hide it afterwards

11300456
exponent	modulo
i know i can generate the rsa public key by just getting the modulo and the public exponent from the private key

11300493
width	height

ejbql	jpql
in ejbql and according to in jpql as well there is no functionality to cast a property of an entity

11300807
google-chrome	firefox
this works great on firefox and google-chrome ie just breaks the flow on this

11300821
versioning	upgrade
check your ie versioning for compatibility with pinned api first here it will tell you if you need an upgrade

11300897
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome you re asked permissions when indexeddb installs for the first time on a host origin port and protocol matching but this is apparently not the default behavior in firefox

11300940
getter	setter
everything i ve found is all databasefirst and getter setter class properties.

11300942
x86	64bit
just check for the existence of c program files x86 which is only present on a 64bit system

11301036
screens	tablet
rather than attempting to detect tablet consider detecting screens sizes and detecting features that the device supports since the difference between a phone and a tablet isn t exactly well defined and subject to change

11301073
rubygems	bundler
you can download bundler as a .gem file from rubygems and install it on the server with

11301073
rubygems	bundler
bundler won t go to rubygems but instead will install all gems from . vendor cache directory

11301078
stdout	stderr
or run this program by redirecting stderr to stdout

11301117
screens	tablet
at this point you can optimize your application for different screens sizes phones and tablet

11301122
rubygems	bundler
well that s because the gemfile isn t a file from rubygems but a file from bundler

11301132
folder	directory
it should loop this method through all folder found in a directory here is the bash version of this

11301132
folder	directory
i was able to install gnuwin32 coreutils sed and grep so i m able to use all the same tools but the actual process of looping through all folder in a directory isn t working

11301140
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i just noticed that none of my website s google earth embedded plug-in s work anymore in safari google-chrome or firefox Ã¢ all you can see now is blank space and small text that says information is temporarily unavailable.

11301147
min	max
then he carries on with his code as if x is still equal to 5 whereas when i run this code through my computer the max and min functions always change the value of x to 0 and then 10

11301150
interbase	firebird	postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql	informix	interbase	informix	firebird
oracle db 2 mysql postgresql sybase informix interbase and firebird all use that same standard syntax

11301150
interbase	firebird
as remus rusanu said though it s not strictly required but could help the database manage internal resources better if it knew that the savepoint was no longer necessary it certainly helps on multigenerational architectures like oracle interbase and firebird

11301151
width	height
within that i plan to place a div that stretches to the height and width of the viewport and has black background colour at 50 opacity

11301151
width	height
i ve set the div to be 100 width and height

11301171
submit	submission
another option could be that on submission some code linked to the submit button onclick or similar reloads to page in the frame or a page of my choice before it s had a chance to load externally - again on correct submission going to the welcome page before having a chance to reload

11301221
width	height
for an alternative to width and height you could use instead position

11301252
width	height
set a width and min- height of 100 on both the html and body tag

11301252
width	height
setting the element as fixed with the 100 width and height you have now is probably better as mentioned in other comments

11301255
pull	push
well the message tells you what to do git pull fetches and merges changes then git push again

11301270
traceroute	packets
you can try traceroute tool to diagnose where your packets are dropped this is not always 100 reliable because sometimes firewalls drop udp packets generated by traceroute and do not drop normal udp traffic

post	get
however when i send a post request using chrome s rest console plugin i get a response of errors and no new user is created

11301406
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in the future persistent connections will be supplied by websockets and spdy both of which are available in the latest versions of google-chrome safari and firefox with ie lagging a bit

11301444
getter	setter
and then manually define a getter and setter in the public part of classname .h and implementation part like this

11301463
vim	notepad++
i have to use notepad++ and not the windows version of vim because i am sure that notepad++ does not insert odd characters to the end of lines

11301538
testflight	itunesconnect
you can now use the testflight integrated into itunesconnect

11301560
ciimage	uiimage
i m creating a ciimage from a uiimage as follows

11301560
ciimage	uiimage
comparing someciimage.extent.size.width height with someuiimage.size.width height i find that sometimes the ciimage is double size in dimensions and sometimes its the same size as the uiimage

11301560
ciimage	uiimage
it seems like if the uiimage is slightly larger the ciimage is double the size whereas if the uiimage is slightly smaller this isn t the case

11301560
ciimage	uiimage
this is causing me real trouble as i m trying to draw a ciimage from a loaded uiimage

11301626
scatter	graphing
i have other graphing that use scatter plots without any similar results

11301658
pbkdf2	hash
so taking your erratasec article that benchmarks 430 million sha-1 hash per second on a gpu as a baseline - the agilebits article shows metrics that suggest pbkdf2 with 10k iterations would bring that down to around 100k tests per second

11301721
put	get
i also can t seem to cut on the to try and get rid of the first put of the string no matter how i try to escape the slashes

11301725
width	height
it may or may not be larger than the window i am trying to write a function which will keep it centered around its current center relative to the window when the div s width or height is changed by a scaling function

11301750
google-chrome	firefox
i have no ellipsis on firefox or google-chrome

11301757
cypher	gremlin
i know you asked for a gremlin but you said you were open to cypher as well which may represent the query in different format

11301775
children	parent
one way would be to find the parent then get the children and then filter out the one you need

11301779
button	checkbox
this semantics is apparently to minimize the differences between checkbox and radio button

11301810
sorting	grouping

create an abstract class that implements runnable with the code you want in its run method - then extends that class as many times as you need the same functionality in your run method

11301939
google-chrome	firefox
works well on google-chrome and firefox

11301959
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
from the what i have read on other discussions i can either use nsurlconnection or nsxmlparser to send and receive data

11301971
hide	show
if you must have the app visible to logged-out users remove the api-level restriction and use the details passed in the signed_request to show or hide the app s content

11301976
boost	allocator	boost	stl	allocator	stl
boost pool_allocator implementation itself uses boost singleton_pool and provides interface like std allocator so you can use it with stl containers but not only stl and not only containers like vector list etc

11302004
rss	feed
you could set up a simple rss feed or a plain xml file on a server and poll your list from there from time to time

11302025
spaces	delimiter
remember that search strings are delimiter by spaces unless the c option is used

11302037
erlang	lisp
it is a clojure-like dialect of lisp targeting erlang virtual machine

11302051
public	protected
this will create public variables - so unless you want them private protected that s the easiest way to achieve what you want

11302129
pull	push
being a dvcs mercurial would allow off-network developers to work anywhere only having to be on network to deal with server push pull situations

11302195
temp	tmp
you may be running into a permissions error with the windows file system and the sessions not being able to write to the local temp or tmp directory

11302195
post	get
so if i make a post get request to your site software with the name admin or i set a cookie and call it admin _request will treat it the same as it would any of the specifically defined versions

11302201
hide	show
when user click other icon hide and show in the other

11302231
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up asking whether or not you would like to tweak the settings

11302240
post	get
even if writing to _request is really a bad coding practice and at least one should differentiate between post and get

11302268
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
depending on how you increasing the size of the div width height you can just change the margin of the div to reflect a fraction of the change in size

11302334
profiler	visualvm	profiler	yourkit	visualvm	yourkit
i have written one of my own to detect those states java concurrency profiler but there are others out there as well for instance visualvm or yourkit

11302342
translation	localization
we re looking for an open source machine translation engine that could be incorporated into our localization workflow

11302361
google-chrome	firefox
i have new versions of google-chrome as well as firefox and they are all converting to 20 to + on download

11302367
pull	push
so if you give someone read only access then of course they can only pull not push

11302381
google-chrome	firefox
i am coding on a mac and have tested on firefox 13.0.1 and google-chrome v20

11302388

11302405
put	get
the only way i have been able to get it to work is if i put

11302495
couchbase	couchdb
afaik the way that couchbase works is that if a string that you set or add is the json representation of a valid couchdb document it stores it as a couchdb document otherwise it stores it as an attachment

11302495
couchbase	couchdb
the upcoming version of couchbase 2.0 now in developer preview exposes almost all of the couchdb functionality except for couch apps which are irrelevant if you re using erlang anyways

11302495
atomic	compare-and-swap
so if you want to use that you ll want to pass json of objects over the memcache interface but note that then you lose memcache s atomic shortcuts you d need to do a compare-and-swap which requires an extra network hop

11302514
versioning	upgrade
i think you have to upgrade your jquery library to the newest versioning

11302558
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome 8 and opera 11 both use the native html5 spinner but it s ugly imo

11302568
sorting	filtering
here is some more on view collation for your reference couchdb sorting and filtering in the same view

11302572

inherited	properties
since c is not an object-oriented language gobject provides a c-based object system which includes properties and inherited again built into python already

11302576
gtk	pygobject	pygtk	pygobject
it looks like python-mpdor is using gtk 2 which would be pygtk as opposed to newer gtk 3 which is pygobject

11302580
width	margin
maybe i can set the width and the margin manually with css but i think this isn t the right

11302611
onresume	onpause
i know you said that implementing onpause did not work for you but i tried it and implementing onresume and onpause in the mapactivity does work for me

the code is working in firefox 13 google-chrome opera but the user agent value as null in ie8

11310247
switching	screens
the only other more complicated way i could think of doing this is every time you switching orientation or increase decrease the number find the width of the screens in pixels figure out the width of the word total and the each digit of the number in pixels subtract that from the width and divide that by the number of pixels a dot takes up

11310261
opera	firefox
that makes both firefox and opera respect the max-width rule

11310279

11311444
stdout	stderr
this output is if i m not getting it wrong part stdout and part stderr

11311444
stdout	stderr

11311444
stdout	stderr
in the same way if i try to redirect both streams i get stderr but not the stdout output that i need

11312241
width	height
best option is to get the screen width and height dynamically using simple height and width getting parameters

11324877
onresume	onpause
in my application class i set reset this variable inside onresume and onpause of each activity

11324877
onresume	onpause
to simplify the process i created an abstract class myactivity which extends activity and placed the setter calls in side onresume and onpause of this class

11324877
super	extends
and all other activities of my application simply extends this custom super class instead of activity

11324889
inherited	base-class
perhaps you can do it indirectly by creating a base-class which has the serializable attribute and add a constraint to your generic class so that the type-parameter should inherited from that base-class

11324904
ostringstream	std
recommend using a std ostringstream to construct the sql query

11325032
min	max
you can have a slider with min 0 max 100 100 then override positionchanged then implement as below

11325039
addclass	removeclass
i faced this problem once and i end up using addclass and removeclass on elements parent container

11325090
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
the example code above was really helpful to me however as has been hinted at above i think you need to use nsmutableurlrequest rather than nsurlrequest

11325093
installation	upgrade
then simply set and and leave everything else at defaults and inno will automatically skip the directory and start menu selection pages for upgrade using the values entered during the original installation

11325096
google-chrome	firefox
this happens both in google-chrome and in firefox haven t tested others

11325096
google-chrome	firefox
my guess is there is some difference in rounding strategy between the two browsers google-chrome might be rounding down while firefox might be rounding up

post	get
in html only get and post are allowed

11325318
post	get
browsers deal with get and post differently with respect to caching the request a cached get will automatically be reissued but a cached post will prompt the user to allow it to be resent and many html elements can issue gets making them unsafe for updates

11325318
post	put
many people who claim to be restful will confuse http post and put with sql update and insert

11325318
post	put
for example creating a new entry on a blog could be a post to the blog itself or a put to a subordinate resource

11325318
post	put
typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri

with primitive floating point types i can just cast to an integer to truncate the fractions part but this wouldn t work with a big number class

11325946

client-side	server-side
you re no longer interacting with the form both server-side and client-side and in fact even with webforms you weren t interacting client-side

11325950

11325964
google-chrome	firefox
it appears fine in firefox and google-chrome

11326280
highcharts	highstock

so kurt i think i could split the pdf to pages with gs -dfirstpage and -dlastpage and then if you have some idea how to decide if a page is landscape or portrait then i could do some conditional processing

11326434
qgraphicstextitem	qgraphicsscene
there is also a qgraphicstextitem - an element for displaying text on a qgraphicsscene

i am trying to force my android application to go from the onpause method directly to the onresume method by using a dialog

11326539
onresume	onpause
when i click my button to show the dialog the dialog shows up just fine but i do not receive any log messages that the onpause is being called when showing the dialog and i m not receiving any log messages that the onresume method is being called when pushing the back button on my phone to exit the dialog

11326542
width	font-size
if you play around with the textarea width property and font-size you can reach a desirable outcome

11326658
children	parent
this is often when having floated child-elements as declaring an according overflow on the parent forces it to completely wrap it s children

11326689
onresume	onpause
that s why your activity methods onresume and onpause are not called

11326702
children	parent
mptt to make querying for children parent easier

11326873
width	height
1- set your scrollview s height and width to match_parent

11326904

presently the metric model has many operands and can perform calculations based on the operation_type sum multiplying etc. and each operand is defined as being right or left so that if the operation is division the numerator and denominator can be identified

11326914
post	get
i know you can make a custom post query using get style variables but with pretty urls enabled i cannot seem to use the get variables to filter specific post etc etc

11326938
public	protected
on top of having the plumbery shared another advantage is that i have for example a delete method protected available to any repository but it is not public so i am not forced to implement it on a repository where it has no business meaning to delete something from my data source

11326947
int	chars
if you change type int to chars code might work

11326951
hide	show
you can use javascript to apply css classes to hide and remove that class to show again

11326958
uiview	cagradientlayer
the way to fix this is to create a cagradientlayer and apply it to a uiview before anything else loads

11327056
width	height
set a fix column width and height does not help

11327072
for-loop	loops
if you change the declaration of arr so that it is of type char you can read your string in and your for-loop will loops over those bytes one at a time

11327100
filesystems	hfs+
one notable exception is mac os x which is unix-based but uses a default filesystems type hfs+ that is not case sensitive

11327112
width	height
similarly for the layout method to layout that particular field for example set the width and height of that field also having 3 argument

width	height
for all images - insert the alt attribute and for all width and height optimizations don t use css-based width and height

11327276
ilist	icollection
there are other workarounds that would be valid but maybe not always ideal like using icollection or ilist or performing a typical if-null-throw-exception

11327291
getter	setter
if your application applet servlet library etc. makes extensive use of introspection on bean classes to find bean editor classes or getter and setter methods then configuration may become painful

11327291
getter	setter
there s not much else you can do than making sure the bean class names or the getter and setter names don t change

11327291
getter	setter
this example should encompasses all possible setter and getter in classes in the package mybeans

11327305
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
attribute selectors are supported in ie7+ firefox 3.0+ safari 1.3+ google-chrome 2+ and opera 9.2+

11327308
width	height
this is not a background of the body tag but a div with id backdrop which has 100 width and height

11327332
innodb	myisam
maybe you could use innodb instead of myisam as the former has a row-level-locking whereas the latter has table-level-locking when writing

11327352
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns a numeric identifier of the created interval which you can pass to clearinterval to stop it

11327360
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not have native support for this you can simulate the behavior of a postgresql sequence by creating a table with only one column and an auto_increment on that column

11327397
for-loop	loops
what negs me is the if statement i could insert the first item before loops and start with a for-loop starting at index 1 but this doesnÃ¢ t increase the readability

11327398
move	drag
i ve also noticed that the area i click on to drag the window a border tends to move around as well so is no longer under my click as i move the window

11327476

11327819

if i copy data from the url and put it inside single quotes i receive data but trying to get data from the url i get nothing

11328356
min	max
we have a system in which we want to maintain stats on large volumes of logged information split into separate channels each channel will have an overview document maintaining stats including max and min values for the hours days months and years in a cascaded fashion

11328356
min	max
we could maintain a single document to hold the stats of a channel for a month which would have a single monthly max min 31 daily max mins with 24 hourly max mins for each of the those days

11328356
min	max
using a document for counting using inc is great for in place atomic updates a max and min on the update modifier would solve our problem but that s unfortunately not available

11328356
min	max
we can keep the max and min within the task processors and issues set but that has issues with coordinating those over all of the task processors in the system potentially on different machines so we have decided to keep mongo as the main reference

11328377

11328530
pop-up	dialog
this pop-up is jquery mobile simple dialog

11328561
post	get
then in your view code you have logic that says - if the request for this url is a get request then do the work to configure the form otherwise you assume it is a post and then you can handle the response

11328561
post	get
additionally i would advise that the your view explicitly checks that the request is a post and if not make the assumption that it is a get rather than the other way around as you have it this is safer as get and post are not the only request types and you definitely need to know that you are dealing with a post request if you want to deal with variables submitted in the post request

11328592
children	parent
it makes the update on the parent object but when i change something on the children object it doesn t update it and neither gives problems with hibernate or oracle

probably because in the first case the output is on stdout and in the second case its on stderr

11328993
versioning	upgrade
the update patch cannot be installed by the windows installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade patch may update a different versioning of the program

you can make a pretty convincing replica yourself using a uipickerview rather than using uidatepicker

11329225
uidatepicker	uipickerview	uitableview	uipickerview
as the uidatepicker or uipickerview don t have the ui_appearance_selector and even you can t change uidatepicker contents appearance as its uicontrol and not having any delegate so it has its native appearance whereas in case of uipickerview you can change its contents appearance similar as in uitableview

getter	setter
now given that i know the bbmovie implementation has both getter and setter for the properties it seems like i should be able to implement bbmutablemovie as simply as

11329763
getter	setter
possibly a better solution would be to use a getter setter pair so you can know at the exact moment the properties are set

11329781

vim	emacs
this is a vim emulator running in emacs and works quite well for me

i don t think what you want is currently possible without manipulating the pdf first so that it uses a portrait media format to display its landscape image contents

11330121
width	height
since it seems you take issue mostly with the 120 pixel width you re getting my own workaround for processing the un-modified input would be to change the height width settings like this

rss	feed
i need to implement an rss reader on ios which updates its feed every # minutes even if the app is in the background

11330171

11330898
post	get
the javascript served from foo works by making restful ajax calls get or post depending on the action to the wcf services on bar obviously these are cross domain calls as they aren t on the same host

11330898
post	get
the main problem now appears to be attempting post requests get is working using the above configuration

11330898
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that google-chrome 20.x.x doesn t suffer the problem of not negotiating ntlm to retrieve the options header response from the server but firefox 13.0.1 does

11330898
google-chrome	firefox
using the following code we can watch the network trace to see firefox failing and google-chrome working fine

11330898
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
on a separate note ie8 doesn t support the xmlhttprequest for cross domain calls favouring it s own magical xdomainrequest object so we ve got some work to do in changing the client side code to handle ie8 vs the world cases

11330907
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used google-chrome firefox and ie 9 and it works fine but in ie8 it doesn t work

11330926

11331348
put	get
as cheeso mentioned the parse error that you get is due to the fact that the javascript engine cannot interpret the data that you re returning because it s just a plain json which itself is not a valid expression imagine that you put it inside the tags

11331503
hide	show
both of them examples are free you should not be paying for a fancy modal dialog you could also create your own by using a tag which holds your content and javascript to hide show the tag

11331551
width	height
first you shouldn t create the new image with the specified new height and width but instead calculate what they should be based on the ratio of the original image otherwise your scaled image will be distorted

11331556
width	height
in one project when calling glorthof i would pass a ratio between the width and the height for left and right and i would pass -1 and 1 for top and botton

11331561
textarea	textbox
when a textbox input type text or textarea has the focus then dragging with the mouse only selects text within the textbox

11331580
getter	setter
i only want to say explicit to one getter because i have a custom complex class and all setter and getter should function only one should not

11331589
hash	salt
as passwords are hash after being salt i see no reason to use a different salt

11331597
pop-up	dialog
so no dialog pop-up

i realize that this is on a 3 year old post there was activity on it 5 months ago as of this posting though but i found one other tid-bit that may be of use to others trying to get around this

11332220
rank	percentile
complex statistics and rank attributes like the 90th percentile and the nth smallest often need more complex work than standard deviation and averages solved in the above

11332220
median	percentile
useful for finding median percentile quartiles and deciles

11332239
serializable	deserialization
using files for cache is not an option either it has the same unaffordable serializable deserialization overhead - use case is a ha server with lots of data used in random human order and low latency needed

11332253
post	get
works as well but should be avoided because what you get out of it depends on php settings and a mixed-mode submission a post form but using query variables in the url is dependent on those settings

11332279
put	get
i say almost unavoidable because you could probably concoct some system which made further virtual method calls on the object passed in to to get the right kind of comparison behaviour but in practical terms another virtual method lookup remember virtual methods also have a runtime performance penalty because the compiler has no idea which implementation will get called so can t put in a concrete function address is probably no faster than the cost of the rtti

11332290
int	double
the ampersand on the other hand literally means the address of and is usually used for primitive data type variables such as int bool double etc in cases where we want the method to modify the variable itself often what it points to as well and return a useable value

11332334
width	text-align
i have set the width 100 and the text-align center to the footer .

11332334
google-chrome	firefox
this is for google-chrome ie 9 ie 8 firefox

11332337
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see in firefox the font appears smoother and in google-chrome choppier

11332357
width	height
your images are showing in different sizes because they have different height width ratios

11332363
verilog	vhdl
so i ve got in verilog for instance--a vhdl answer would be perfectly fine too

11332377

11332448
folder	directory
it says it should in the solr home directory and the .conf folder

11332500
prepare	execute
the prepare creates a statement and it s that that you run execute on.

11332505

epplus	excellibrary
i suggest you use epplus wich is a excellibrary xlsx only that have worked great to me

11332547
margin	height
if you know the height of what you are centering you can use absolutely position the box 50 from the top and then use a negative margin half the height of the box to center it

11332557
children	parent
i now need to know how to set all the children checkboxes to checked when the main parent checkbox is checked by the user

11332714
uilabel	uibutton

x86	64bit
this error is believed to be result of the version of python being used having been originally compiled for the generic x86 32 bit architecture whereas mod_wsgi is being compiled for x86 64bit architecture

11332717
x86	64bit
the actual error arises in this case because libtool would appear to be unable to generate a dynamically loadable module for the x86 64bit architecture from a x86 32 bit static library

11332717
x86	64bit
alternatively the problem is due to libtool on this platform not being able to create a loadable module from a x86 64bit static library in all cases

11332723
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
nullpointerexception and runtimeexception are both unchecked-exception

11332727
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
using nullpointerexception and runtimeexception to whet it further is not correct because runtimeexception need not be declared on the signature

11332738

11333001
division	modulo
the modulo will return the remainder from an integer division 11 mod 3 2

11333014
portrait	landscape
sounds like you will have to do something where a special viewcontroller gets shown on start that in the loadview or init gets device orientation then sets the views frame appropriately and which based on whatever mode portrait or landscape it is then only returns the allowed orientation from the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation

11333015
folder	dir	folder	directory
base path is a local directory and log dir is a unc path which is appended with the folder set

11333021

verilog	vhdl
i ve been an asic and fpga designer verification engineer for 17 years and i ve worked on both vhdl and verilog projects

11333044
verilog	vhdl
also from my limited sample of job interviews and experience its been pretty evenly divided between vhdl and verilog over most of my career

11333044
verilog	vhdl
my take on it is that vhdl and verilog were pretty even until the mid-2000 s when verilog evolved into system verilog and vhdl stayed fairly static except for minor changes

11333044
verilog	vhdl
it used to be that vhdl had more non-synthesizable language features that aided verification that old-school verilog

11333044
verilog	vhdl
with system verilog vhdl got leap-frogged in that area of strength and never responded with an evolution of its own so i m anecdotally seeing a migration towards sv and away from vhdl

11333059
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend is the tool that makes wpf silverlight a lot of fun imo

11333140
google-chrome	firefox

11333251
width	height
also should i write height and width with both div and svg or it fine to use with only one

11333285
postgresql	mysql
wherein this gets more complicated sqlite does not have the same date functions as mysql or postgresql

11333373
document.write	window.open
there are also more or less hackish ways to write directly to the new browser window by calling document.write on the handle returned by window.open but i would only do that for simple things that don t require too much user interaction i ve used this approach for a print preview feature

11333376
width	height
so what i need is a non-scrolling ui element which is able to display text and resizes its height the width should remain constant to exactly fit the text

11333411
pascal	delphi

this works in both google-chrome and ie but in firefox a css property of top is added which blows the div out of the container

11333570
google-chrome	firefox
to see what i mean check this fiddle and resize the element if you inspect it in firefox there will a top css property but not in google-chrome

11333611
google-chrome	firefox
latest browser status on above code works well on google-chrome 20.01132.47 not on firefox 13.0.1 if you simultaneously call various functions to load multiple dynamic kml layers track stops poi s using settimeout

11333627
stateless	stateful
with ejb 3.x you have a choice of session beans stateful and stateless

mocha	node.js
i ve also found a few examples using mocha and phantomjs via node.js including this lib extending grunt to run mocha inside phantom and this script showing how to run mocha inside phantomjs

11333948
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
assuming that you are talking about rtp over udp afaik vlc uses live555 libraries for client-side rtsp rtp functionality and live555 has a built in jitter buffer that should take care of re-ordering for you

all inherited properties in the realized concrete class will be persisted and retrieved

11334140
curlpp	libcurl
another good choice can be libcurl library which is c library but it has c++ bindings - curlpp

11334159
base	fractions
absence of literally fractions power units of measure does not anyhow discounts f# unit facility as it allows presenting seemingly fractions exponent unit relationships the other way around having smallest fractions as a base dimension

11334162
google-chrome	firefox
below you can see how the same code is displayed differently with firefox and google-chrome

11334198
folder	directory
you have to append an asterik see msdn findfirstfile for more information to your directory path szdir in order to enumerate all files and folder in the downloads folder

11334212
width	height
both jpanels the width it prefect but they are not filling to the height

11334220

i think fastest way for debugging applications like this is profiling application for specific usecase in this way you can understand which classes used for this scenario and after finding classes you can debugging these classes

11334220
yourkit	jprofiler
commercial yourkit jprofiler jprobe

width	height
i was making it twice the height and twice the width of the google map so 4x the screen size total and it seems to really slow things down.

11334396
superclass	subclassing
i could ofcourse have a static animation per subclassing and not use a superclass but that would require a lot of redundant copied code

11334403
pull	push
then just use pure git interface pull push instead of git-svn as if it always were a git repository

11334476
getter	setter
if directly annotating the field property getter setter to be skipped is undesirable another approach is to make use of the jackson mix-in feature

11334486
width	height
that above code is pretty crude and you may want to scale the video better ie find the ratio of the media width vs the stage width media height vs stage height .

11334488
oncreate	onstart
to onstart instead of oncreate

11334549
background-image	background-color
in case of images just replace background-color with background-image url www.example.com myimage.png

your approach doesn t work because you would need to change the direction of the sidebar s parent box not its children

11334971
post	get
i would like to get numbers of comments for each post using mysql

11334992
free	malloc
both require a local variable on the caller s side but malloc ing it will require an additional call to free the allocated memory and is also more expensive than simply passing a pointer to a local variable

using sudo but that would require storing a passwd or having no

11335084
apache	nginx
put an nginx or lighttp server in front of your apache

11335131
post	get
i would say you ll have a bit of magento work on your hands to get your custom post types to work might even be quicker to go for partial integration and code up a wordpress theme to match your magento one

11335171
cos	sin
x cos t x - sin t y

11335171
cos	sin

switching	screens
the problem i am seeing is that if you switching quickly between the master and detail screens several times whilst fresh data is being retrieved parsed and saved the app freezes or crashes completely

11335270
free	malloc
the overhead of using allocate and deallocate is the same as the overhead of using malloc and free in c

11335270
free	malloc
actually most fortran compilers implement de allocate as wrappers around malloc free with some added bookkeeping inherent to all fortran 90 arrays

11335301
glfw	freeglut	glut	glfw
playing around with opengl for a while using the freeglut library i decided that i will use glfw for my next training project instead since i was told that glut was only designed for learning purposes and should not be used professionally

11335336
unsigned	short
gl_unsigned_byte or unsigned short gl_unsigned_short

11335375
free	malloc	free	memcpy	memcpy	malloc
first if you need to duplicate the input data do it dynamically using malloc and memcpy then free it afterwards

11335375
free	malloc
remember that not only write but also malloc and free may modify errno and you must hide those changes from the caller

11335375
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
applications do internal processing and especially when working with sockets flush it at odd sizes multiples of mtu for tcp ip and udp ip in particular

11335409
integer	unsigned
in other words when you re passing integer types like unsigned byte use a normalized value of gl_true and use the full range of that type such as 0 to 255 so a value of 127 would be approximately equivalent to floating point 0.5

11335420
folder	directory
create an empty __init__.py file in the app folder so python treats the directory as a package

11335425

11335556
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
a lot of people use textmate vim or emacs as well

11335560
hash	salt
from this you can cater your length of salt and number of stretching iterations to whatever you feel is secure enough though i personally like to make sure the hash takes at least 1 2 second to generate on a really beefy server

11335569
width	height
the width and height columns might indeed have to be made nullable in the database because until the transaction is fully complete they can contain null values

mousemove	mousedown
found the problem i was using preventdefault in mousemove instead of mousedown

11336907
free	malloc
i have found that dynamic array allocation within tight loops can really slow down the execution of my code with valgrind showing that a large percentage of cycles is taken up by malloc and free

11336907
valgrind	callgrind
it is easy to see this overhead by profiling using valgrind callgrind functionality it may be worth reducing the size of your problem as the profiled execution can be at least 10 times slower

11336913
int	chars
the delimiter second parameter of ignore is of type int to which a chars constant can be converted implicitly

11336926
punctuation	words

11337126
profiling	instrumentation
try using the time profiling instrumentation in instrumentation hold option to select parts of the graph where your program is bogging down and examine the call tree

11337150
public	protected
documentation provides more information than private protected public does and a good system will have documentation anyway

11337217
uiview	calayer
previously we use a uiview with its drawrect implemented for each riser and later i decided to use calayer without implementing its drawlayerincontext for each of them for animation

11337230
public	protected
nobody should depend on your internal and private implementation they should only depend on your public or protected implementation

11337230
public	protected
also a clear distinction between public private and protected are extremely useful with inheritance in defining what you expect to be overridable and what shouldn t

11337234
width	height
width and height restriction have been removed

11337244
put	get
alternatively you may want to put the script tags in the head to get the javascript files earlier in the fetching order before images audio or video files specified in the body for example

11337260
maven-javadoc-plugin	pom.xml
maven-javadoc-plugin doesn t attach to any phase goal by default you need configure it manually in pom.xml

sqldatasource	detailsview
i used a sqldatasource and was binding the data to a detailsview

11337712
post	get
as you download the post just keep track of which tags you get

11337712
post	get
it s kind of unfortunate you have to download the body of the post just to get the tag list but i don t see any other method that gives you the tags or a option to supress the body and just see the meta-data for post

11337712
post	get
at that point though you might consider dropping the info query all together and just querying post until you don t get any more results

11337714
post	get
admittedly there s not a lot of doco around about it but these post really helped me get going

11337746

for-loop	arrays
as you are uses the random method to randomise the objects into arrays then no need to use the random for displaying the data in labels as in randome method some returned data can be repeatedly returned so this happens just use random for randomize the data and serially show them in labels using simple for-loop

11343520
portrait	landscape
but problem is that when i capture image from camera in landscape mode at the time of croping it in portrait mode the blackbox is shown in image

11343675
equals	gethashcode
this ensures that by default no 2 instances of an object even if they contain identical data will not be considered equals because they do no reside at the same memory address this behavior can be overwritten by overwriting gethashcode and equals methods in any class definition

11343711
post	get
it post the username and password to a php verify file by get which will a response either success or failed would be got

11343717

11343762

itext	docx4j
now that i m using docx4j i need to update itext to a more recent version or it won t work

11343856
itext	docx4j
docx4j 2.8.0 uses itext 2.1.7

11343856
itext	docx4j
i can only use one itext library but whichever one i use i end up with compatibility issues for either flying saucer or docx4j

11343856
int	chars
at the moment the problem seems to come down to one particular method com.lowagie.text.pdf.basefont.getcharbbox which in one version takes a chars parameter and in the other it takes an int parameter

11343866
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
for example a protected instance method in the superclass can be made public but not private in the subclassing

11343866
superclass	subclassing
you will get a compile-time error if you attempt to change an instance method in the superclass to a class method in the subclassing and vice versa

11343874
stdout	stderr
create three pipes corresponding to child process stdin stdout and stderr the parent process writing to stdin_pipe and reading stdout_pipe and stderr_pipe using pipe 2 system call

11343874
stdout	stderr
if you do not need to make the distinction between stdout and stderr you could just simplify your life by using popen 3 - you could probably redirect stderr to stdout by proper choice of command string

11343932
banking	payment
the idea is that the card you re currently using is emv but can only really be used to make payment for a single bank whereas a global platform card could be used for non-banking purposes like as a sim for a mobile phone type device and for banking payment purposes could also be used to hold all your old plastic cards not just the ones from a single banks

11343951
floating-point	integer
use floating-point arithmetic not integer arithmetic because in integer arithmetic 5 9 is 0

11344095
google-chrome	firefox
but i learnt something if you assign color attribute to an element firefox doesn t check if it has # symbol in the beginning but google-chrome checks

11344095
google-chrome	firefox
therefore color 343434 fails in google-chrome but not in firefox

sharpbox	dropnet
it looks that both sharpbox and dropnet are wp7 compatible

11344212
stateless	stateful
irrespective of stateful or stateless protocols two clients can connect to same server port because for each client we can assign a different socket as client ip will definitely differ

11344212
udp	tcp
for example two unrelated clients say one is using tcp and another is using udp can bind connect and communicate to the same server node and to the same port but they must be served by two different server-processes

11344213
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if your subclassing is clearly a superclass inherited is fine

11344386
onresume	onpause
usually it s suggested to call the acquire method inside the onresume of your activity and the release method in onpause

11344431
mvp	presenter
i don t think this setup violates mvp in any meaningful way to be a purest as i frame mvp you could have your presenter listening to the bus and then tell the view to change but to me that seems like a pointless layer of abstraction coupling and source for bugs and more work later

11344452
folder	directory
go to the directory manually and right click.select git bash option.git bash terminal automatically opens with the intended directory.for your example go to your project folder.while in the folder right click and select the option and git bash opens automatically with c project

11344463
width	height
if it s the vertical axis then increasing the ratio width height will inevitably lead to letterboxing left and right

docx4j 2.8.0 only uses itext because it is required by our fork of flying saucer which does the xhtml import

11344601
decoder	encoder
i haven t seen a sip decoder encoder for netty but depending on what you want to do with the message the http decoder is a a very good starting point and could be made simpler since chunking is not supported in sip

why protected becomes private to other classes in different package of subclassing .but it is still protected in same package of superclass

11344966
post	get
maybe this is a better answer if you want to get your data into your controller after a post

11344984
for-loop	arrays
the problem with the for-loop is that- it stores all the subdirectories to be discarded from an arrays just fine

11344988
pull	push
when using the xcode ide when selecting file - source control - pull or push xcode crashes

11344988

after repeating this for each repository the normal push pull options work fine until xcode is restarted and then the process must be repeated

11345026
width	margin
you may want to set a width and padding margin on the elements as well so they come out as desired

11345030

the mouseover and mouseout handlers look pretty confused to me

11345144
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

11345171
nhibernate	queryover
you can use projections in nhibernate using queryover or linq syntax and generate only the sql select for columns you need

11345225
portrait	landscape
second step 2nd intermediate pdf portrait with centered landscape content

11345225
portrait	landscape
now that we have portrait pages in the pdf holding the landscape image content our thumbnail creation will result in portrait thumbnails too.

11345225
portrait	landscape
of course if you have a file with pages in landscape as well as portrait you need to apply some conditional processing

you need to call setcontentview r.layout.match_selection_layout before calling findviewbyid

11345497
ceil	floor
as for casting to an integer if the determinant is not an integer then you shouldn t be casting it to an integer you should be using round floor or ceil to convert it in an acceptable way

11345534
sbt	scala-ide
the path from sbt to scala-ide is well described in many places

11345534
sbt	scala-ide

so now we look at the bignumber.parseformatspecifier string format out int digits method and discover that because it passed in a null string it simply returns the chars r with the number of digits digits equal to -1

11346275
oncreate	recreate
i read that if the orientation changes then the activity is destroyed and recreate again oncreate bundle created being called

11346275
portrait	landscape
i m not sure if it means that it should also call onsavedinstancestate bundle bundle because in my app it is only called if another activity takes the focus on top of my main activity but not when rotating to landscape portrait

11346294
versioning	upgrade
i had the same problem because i was using surefire versioning 2.7 after upgrade to 2.12 it worked with the following configuration

11346344
google-chrome	firefox
open up the url i have provided in both google-chrome and firefox

11346407
folder	dir
but that did just install the vendor dir and not the rest like app folder etc

11346427
ready	each
when data is written to the filter it should frame it appropriately and then raise the datatosend event each time a complete data frame is ready to send

it s no more multiplication than addition so is misleading syntax.

11346624

the page with the form is called upload pictuture.html and the scriptt is called upload_file.php they are both on the root and the folder pics 2012 blackhall primary does exist and the pics dir is on the root also

11346676
put	get
i suggest 8 as that would be the maximum number of waypoints you ca put in a directions request i think if you set optimize_waypoints to true and add all of those 8 as waypoints to a round trip start and end points are the same you will get the shortest driving distance between either the first or the last waypoint and the start point

11346693
int	double
i wanted to know how can i reduce the precision of double type variables in c so that equality with int works

11346709

width	height
you can use and to make x1 y1 x2 y2 percentages of width height respectively if you don t know the viewport coordinates in image dimensions

11346796
width	height
negative crop values will be relative to bottom-right instead of top left so after copying the absolute value of negative or for far right values the excess amounts into variables for padding later set them to zero or width height cropxunits cropyunits

11346796
width	height
x and y here should be the desired width height of the image in display pixels not the canvas

11346808
int	double	ceil	floor
you should probably think instead of using functions such as ceil floor and round to make an int out of your double in a way that you have good control over and then use that int in your comparisons

11346881
put	get
looks like the next sibling for your mynodeone is and if you want to get to the next one you ll have to put

11347123
rss	feed
in general you can t retrieve content in your case an rss feed from locations different than the current page

11347123
rss	feed
so one solution in your case may be to set up a proxy script on your server which just calls the rss feed and relays the results to your page

i have a script that makes a post request to my website from other websites different domains and i need to know if it s possible to get what s that other domain

11347465
put	get
the trick for me was figuring out what they meant by path to qt and what to put after -prefix. suslik s links lead me to this github.com refuge whitesheep wiki compiling-qt-statically which is about the same thing but helped me figure out the exact correct syntax to get everything going

11347469
getter	setter
firstly if you declare a retain property as you have done and synthesize it the automatically generated getter and setter handle memory management correctly for you

11347469
super	self
you should get into the habit of using it because you need to call the super class s init method and it is allowed to change the value of self even to nil

11347478
submit	submission
now use the global variable shouldsubmit in your form s submit event handler to optionally block form submission

11347498
google-chrome	firefox
tested to work in firefox ie and google-chrome

11347503
rss	feed
my problem is that i need to get data from an external rss feed instead of a local database and convert that to json data so i can call it the same way using javascript

11347536
folder	directory
but when the plugin is installed in the dropin folder of eclipse i cannot access my directory anymore

11347539
range	median
i see what looks like the option to compute as the median or mode of this range but not mean it s also not clear if these scipy median mode options with alpha and beta are computed as the median mode of the observations or of the range that would produce the flat cdf value.

11347556
rss	feed
just make sure it points towards an xml file and change the url to url rss feed

i just got the latest adt and have found that i can no longer type width and height values for layouts

11347572
submit	submission
on form submission validation is done using ajax call and submit button is disabled using

google-chrome	firefox
this work absolutely fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie8 whenever button is pressed effect of being enable to disable is visible button is normal when clicked visible like disabled

11347575
maven	pom.xml
a more extreme way would be to move to maven and then eclipse will only include the jars you specify in the pom.xml - though that s a load of extra work for not much gain

11347612
onsubmit	onblur
rather wait for user to make the mistake onblur and onsubmit like the default behavior

11347624
google-chrome	firefox
this works for ie but not for google-chrome and firefox

11347656
post	get
the safer way would be to use form.getvalues catids this will get you the array passed in the post

11347691
hash	salt
if you are still paranoid which i would guess you are by the whole hash the usernames thing i would consider adding a third salt which you use throughout your application

11347714
google-chrome	firefox
its works in firefox and google-chrome

11347741
versioning	upgrade
it is likely that its interface will be changed in a future versioning of the sdk and you will need to update your code when you upgrade to a newer versioning of the sdk

11347766
width	height
then you can set logic for width 2 and height 2 - gives you left-top portion of your screen

11347780
google-chrome	safari

11348114
mouseover	mouseout
i added a console.log to smoothdivscroll-1.2.js to log mouseover and mouseout and they are firing at the right times

11348145
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
if you want to view multiple matches such as abcd.mrk and pty09.mrk you would just put checkbox next to both of those in the dropdownlistfor

if you want the stderr of the children to be the same as the stdout of the parent then you may be able to simply launch the parent with its stderr tied to its stdout

11348527
post	put
2 also you could put the comment saving logic in the comment model then check for a comment post in your post view action update form to point to this action and call the save function you create there with

11348549
prepare	execute
for the javascript to execute successfully the call stack needs to have been prepare

11348552

11352736
for-loop	loops
now i can rewrite the code to fix this but what i d like to know as i ve ran into this a few times already is how can i use a for-loop in a while statement in this fashion but have it re-evaluate the for statement on each iteration through the while loops

i have a slidetoggle that show hide a table

11352883
int	chars
100 strings of value x00 take 24 bytes per value too -- but notice that listofstrings is one chars shorter than listofintegers so the 1-byte string takes up 1 byte more than the int 0 and the same amount of space as the int 255

11352927

since you ve put the for-loop into a while loops each time around the while loops when the for statement is encountered the expression will be evaluated

11352992
maven	pom.xml
the problem was that module2 is a maven plugin and in my root pom.xml i had the plugin in the section

11353004
children	parent
every node would have to have a maximum of 2 children and 1 parent max 3 connections

11353050
post	get
if the remote website is redirecting you back to your own app you can use its get or post values

11353061
google-chrome	firefox
use jsonp instead of json so you re not restricted by the same origin policy which affects firefox as well as ie and google-chrome

11353064
profiling	debugging
i ve been profiling my application and found that debugging formatting causes significant performance issues

11353099

11353182
switching	screens
however when i switching into snappedview the text clips off due to the decreased screens width

11353215
int	chars	post	get
the good side is that you have not to add and then remove alphabetic chars from id like someone suggested don t remember if in this or other post with similar question you could easily trim it but most of the times the space is just ignored and if you post or get those to another file they will simply see the int value not the space

11353230
client-side	server-side
but for anyone looking to do this client-side on the web rather than server-side with node beware that is not standard.

11353235
ember.js	backbone.js
you don t have to use backbone.js there are other javascript frameworks out there as well like ember.js and angularjs

11353245
spaces	delimiter
or to be a little more liberal with white spaces and the delimiter

11353247
put	get
i guess you would need to put up a working example to get more help with this one

11353265
int	chars	post	get
the good side is that you have not to add and then remove alphabetic chars from id like someone suggested don t remember if in this or other post with similar question you could easily trim it but most of the times the space is just ignored and if you post or get those to another file they will simply see the int value not the space

11353273
stdout	stderr
for example if stderr filled up i believe that could cause the process to block preventing it from producing further output on stdout

11353277
express	node.js
i m using node.js with socket.io and express

11353296
opera	google-chrome
however my environment is an extension made for google-chrome and opera

11353307
ant	maven
i would recommend that you get familiar with a build tool like ant or maven

11353392
ilist	icollection
to fix this error either change the json to a json object name value or change the deserialized type to an array or a type that implements a collection interface icollection ilist like list that can be deserialized from a json array

11353413
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox based on the nitro github page it seems that they are just deploying it as a browser plug-in

11353436
ubuntu	linux
it looks like they have a version for linux ubuntu and also an extension plugin for chrome

11353437
google-chrome	firefox
also can it be done in firefox google-chrome

11353447
inherited	properties
it s a general enumerator that includes all enumerable properties including those inherited via prototype

11353451
inherited	properties
you should not use for in for iterating an array because actually you are iterating on every properties of an array object also the ones that are inherited i m not sure if there are any

11353477
slideup	slidedown
ok so i am trying to recreate the slideup and slidedown functionality in jquery but when a flexbox is used for its display

11353526
lodash	underscore.js
the difference method in underscore.js or its drop-in replacement lodash can do this too

11353536
post	get
i was thinking i should implement this using get method because post or any other verb does not describe what i want to do

11353536
put	get
when using get i cannot put stuff in the body

11353540
tinyint	boolean
as the title states feeding a resultset that contains a tinyint 1 column to a cachedrowset throught its populate method will convert the values in that column to boolean with values false for 0 and true for anything above

11353584
awt	swing
swing awt draws event driven one does not draw an image immediately but one could trigger it by an invalidate or repaint

11353594
width	height
my question is a bit complex i have a managed bean possibly a session scoped one now in this bean i retrieve information stored in a database about some elements their width their height their x y coordinates..etc but these elements number are dynamically stored meaning they don t have a certain number and the other thing is they also might have another element nested inside

11353610
int	boolean
which inputs two int and outputs a boolean describing whether int a divides evenly into int b

11353625
for-loop	arrays
anyway i see you re using jquery so i think you should be able to use .html or .append to add each button in a for-loop i assume you ve stored your answer buttons in an arrays

11353634
maven	pom.xml
change your maven pom.xml to enforce java 6 or 7

11353651
minimum	diagonal
it may appear wasteful as testing for equality will compare each pair that are not on the diagonal twice but this is done at the c level so will be much faster than using explicit loops and doing the minimum number of comparisons

11353654
getter	setter
i want to use core data support for restkit but when i change synthesize to dynamic i ve lost all getter and setter and i use them across all my app in almost every model

11353654
getter	setter
i was thinking of implementing all the getter and setter by myself but i think it should be a cleaner way to do this

11353741
int	boolean
in your place instead of defining three int fields i would use the django datetimefield and and a boolean which tels me if i should take only the year or the whole date

11353759

i am to get get to work and even post to work when i only pass a text plain

11353811
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this does look dangerous and i don t like it at all but i tested in latest google-chrome firefox opera ie9 ie8 ie7 safari and safari on ipad

11353916
google-chrome	firefox
when writing testing this code in firefox everything works as desired but on google-chrome the changes from the hover effect persist and i don t want them to namely the image opacity stays lowered and the text remains visible

11353916
google-chrome	firefox
it s not styled perfectly images and stuff aren t centered but the problem i m having shows up in google-chrome and works fine in firefox

11353926
inherited	properties
i pulled the code below from mdn but it doesn t talk about how to pass in properties with inherited

11353926
superclass	subclassing
what i need is a superclass and subclassing that have properties that are defined during instantiation

11353926
superclass	subclassing
the properties of the superclass need to be available to all subclassing and the properties of the subclassing will only belong to the subclassing

11353945
superclass	subclassing
when you subclassing the instance variables of the superclass will automatically be available to the subclassing

11353965

i am able to complete the whole process of creating the package signing it and deploying using powershell in the tablet .the tile of the app appears on the start screens

11353973
width	height
scale the image uniformly maintain the image s aspect ratio so that both dimensions width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view minus padding

11353974
width	height
one thing you can do is to put both images inside a framelayout with the width height on both set to wrap_content

11354001
ubuntu	opensuse
i used to maintain a binary application which had to support several distros ubuntu fedora opensuse sled mandriva and the way i would do it is install the oldest distro i was targeting on my build machine

11354052
width	height
the width 100 appears to fill the column okay but the height doesn t work

11354107
noexcept	throw
that s why the standards committee for c++11 ditched throw ... in favor of noexcept which states that the function will throw nothing

11354129
glut	glfw
there are some problems though for starters because i am on a mac the glsl language maxes out at 1.5 i decided to use 1.1 and the tutorial expects 3.3 also the tutorial uses a different windowing system i am using glut they are using glfw see here for the complete source code of all the site s tutorials

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
i m using caliburn.micro as my mvvm framework and my viewmodel are inheriting from screen

11354286
children	parent
you can add parent or children as you need to right there and then export to xml

11354321
free	malloc
you should find out the common memory management routines that are called by new delete and malloc free and intercept those

11354321
free	malloc
it is usually malloc free in the end but check to make sure

11354381
width	height
in this kind of cases it has to do with positioning of any of the parent elements or height width of the some elements

11354423

i have also installed the libxml2 and libxslt packages using rvm pkg install and reinstalled ruby afterward

11354479
put	get
need to issue more than just get and put commands

11354487
getter	setter
this would mean that when the application launches it would create an object with getter and setter

11354488
accessor	properties
here s an example using properties for x since it s just an attribute and an array proxy accessor for y

11354489
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
i haven t used caliburn.micro but it sounds a bit odd that your viewmodel inherits from screen

11354489
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
a quick google search suggests that in caliburn.micro the viewmodel implements the iscreen interface as opposed to inheriting from screen

11354532
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

put	get
the stack is a lifo kind of data structure meaning that the last thing you put in is the first you get from it

11354534
put	get
the heap on the other hand is a free store by that i mean you can get any values from the heap no matter the order it was put in there - this distinction is important

11354534

post	get
i am developing my first facebook app my app uploads videos to the app using get graph-videos then post a link to the video on on the users wall

11354606
getter	setter
one ways is to create a hidden variable in your jsp for errors and mapped it either with bean or declare variable in action class with getter n setter once you get an error set this error to this declared variable when page loads through java script read the value of this variable and if you find any value in this hidden variable then display it in alert

11354616
firefox	safari
the same behavior occurs for me in safari as well as firefox

what i did is having a facade that expose the dao on the server side a server and a client objects communicating over java socket

11354629
dao	facade
and with the help of reflection the facade calls the right method on the dao

11354633

for more information read the upcasting and downcasting sections here

11354660
post	get
if you create a special queue or thread for it or post it to an nsoperationqueue then you ll get no real advantages over a normal asynchronous post and your app will be less power efficient per apple s standard wwdc comments

11354678
innodb	myisam
there s this database where i am working on i notice that for the production database if you view all the tables in phpmyadmin some of them are displayed as either myisam or innodb

11354842
titlebar	window
this has a class which handles some of the tricky aspects of getting this to work correctly such as keeping the application window titlebar active handling alt-tab and cancelling with a mouse click

11354872
put	get
the problem is i am trying to get linearlayout from the parent class so that i can add my stuff in it but for some reason it returns null the reason i have linearlyout in the settingsactivity class is because i want to put some ads etc at the top of preferences and without putting ad specific code in the library project

11354874
folder	dir
this worked great as it was always a sub folder of the current dir

11354916
post	put
contain the regular post put data files will contain the uploaded files as filestorage objects

11354916

contain the regular post put data and files will be empty

11354955
margin	height
i have a content div position relative between the header and footer and when i set a margin around the div my absolutely positioned header and footer move from their top bottom positions by the height of that margin this also happened when i tried setting a margin above and below the paragraphs in the div

11354955
margin	height
metrics show the body is the height of the html element minus the amount of one margin the margin that s still affecting the footer

11354955
margin	height
but that height ends where the content ends instead of after the margin

11354991
hive	hdfs
and we store all the data in hdfs and then we use hive or pig to get data back from hdfs

this works as expected in firefox but safari and google-chrome remove the hash and stays at the top of the page

11355057
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
any time you want to deal with these kind of alu items be it add subtract multiplying etc start with 2 or 3 bit numbers much easier to get a handle on than 32 or 64 bit numbers

11355057
subtract	add
normally these are computed on every alu operation for the non-mips type processors you will see signed and unsigned overflow being computed for add and subtract

11355057
subtract	add
if i wanted to subtract 3 - 2 using twos complement what actually happens is that is the same as +3 + -2 right and to get from +2 to to -2 we invert and add one

11355057
subtract	add
i used some twos complement tricks to perform an unsigned operation because here again no matter whether i interpret the operands as signed or unsigned the same rules apply for if add or if subtract

11355057
subtract	addition	subtract	add
it has to do with cascading operations taking say a 32 bit addition logic and using the carry flag and an add with carry or subtract with borrow instruction creating a 64 bit add or subtract or any multiple of the base register size

11355128
put	get
i am implementing the code that i get from internet and i put a select on it

primes	palindrome
if you want all the primes that are palindrome this will work better

11355217
width	height
the size of the image width height

11355247
put	get
this definitely needs more programming logic most likely embedded loops or better yet calls to functions to put everything in the right order sequence but the basic constructs are there and i hope will get you started and gives you some ideas

11355280
children	parent
so besides this i add letter-spacing -.31em to the parent and letter-spacing normal to the children

11355280
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on firefox 13 win ubuntu 14 on android google-chrome 20 win ubuntu android browser on ics 4.0.4 and ie 9

11355301

assume the original picture is 500px in height 400 px in width .i want to display this picture in website such that only 480px in visible in height

11355336
margin	height
but that height of the body ends where the content ends instead of after the margin

11355336
margin	height
answer no the body height itself is unaffected by the bottom margin of an element within it

yup set the image as the background of an element and specify that elementÃ¢ s width and height

11355410
principalcontext	directoryentry
i ve tried using directoryentry and principalcontext and have the same problem both ways

11355423
width	height
to crop you could try using an outer with overflow hidden and the resulting set width and height have the image within it then use margins to crop

11355423
margin	height
the margin value would be the difference of the original height and the cropped height so in your case 20px

11355423
width	height
if you don t know the height width of the image try this fork of praveen s solution

11355429
memcached	apc
if you have access to memcached or apc on your webhost some shared plans disable this functionality look them up as they are considered fairly high-performance forms of caching as it utilizes the system memory directly memcached is more suited for distributed systems

11355437
width	height
height the second time not width

11355459
margin	height
if you don t know the height of the image and you need to cut the image then you can use the negative margin and overflow hidden left is the image as is and the right one is cropped one

11355569
pop-up	dialog
now i need to delete disable close x button of that ajax pop-up dialog

11355581
folder	directory
i could only find such a way that involved entering directory and stuff but what i want is so i can get the php filename no extension or directory info and use it as a var anywhere in any folder using the include function to include the var

11355583
stdout	stderr
you should also be able to parse the output of the adb install command - you ll have to see if it sends errors success to stderr or stdout

11355588
equals	compareto
compareto returns 0 exactly when the equals object method would return true

11355626

remove the width and height attributes from the tag

11355653

the problem is whenever i click the button to make the ajax get the height of the whole container will change because i haven t set a static height i have set a specific width though for the container in my css stylesheet

11355688
superclass	subclassing
you can use the superclass classifier as the type declaration for any classifier object even though each object will be a subclassing of classifier such as j48

11355875
hide	show
you should assign your card divs a common class and change the jquery selector to use it but the general idea is select all the card divs and hide them show the first and on click of whichever one is showing hide it and show the next

11355891
postgresql	mysql
and look at the relational database mysql and vfabric postgresql you can see how auto-reconfiguration works

11355904
uiview	subviews	uilabel	uibutton
if you consider that all uibutton uilabel and other controls are inherited from uiview and you do not explicitly remove them from your view it becomes clear that removing a parent view from superview also results in removal of all child subviews

11355910
maven	m2e
for example when i run my project using maven m2e plugin the terminate button on console view is available but not on the menu

remove onclick and make it onchange

see opening images on nodejs and finding out width height

11357427
getter	setter
i have a question about the magic methods getter and setter

11357513
getter	setter
getter and setter are intended to add control over what happens when a property is set or retrieved or to create read-only or write-only properties

11357533
put	get
because you haven t put var in front of marker thats why it get created in global level

11357563
sorting	grouping
you can also specify grouping totals in select sorting and grand totals in select print options

11357574

11357690
hide	show
you basically set a different formdata on composite3 depending on whether you want to show or hide it

11357691
getter	setter
i always prefer to use getter and setter also into methods of the same class where they are declared although i could use privare variables

11357691
getter	setter
getter and setter hide logic that is required when you have to set or get a class property so you can modify what-you-actually-do inside your setter getter without worry about impact in client methods

11357746
radiobuttonlist	formview
i have a formview with textboxes and radiobuttonlist and edit button in the order as follows

11357913
google-chrome	firefox
but i cant figure out how to check if firefox is installed then open firefox if google-chrome is installed open google-chrome and the same thing goes for all the browser types...

11357956
slider	jcarousellite
there are 3 slider one image slider and two jcarousellite plugins in my page

11357966

so if these custom_editfield objects are created by a manager that extends verticalfieldmanager but also implements sublayout itself to perform all the positioning then try the solution i suggested in the other question don t extends verticalfieldmanager just extends manager

11357986
gdal	proj	gdal	ogr	proj	ogr
i m using the gdal ogr library in my proj not sources

in ie7 the div now has a width of 56px and a height of 60px for no reason i can discern -- the image in question is 100x100

11358155
pull	push
in the official site it was heroku db push postgres postgres mypass remotehost mydb and in this article heroku db pull postgres root localhost db_name was used

11358183

the reason is thar the algorythm to generating a jar war or ear file is similar to zip algorythm

11358194
kentico	dotnetnuke
several of the wider cms offerings such as kentico and dotnetnuke offer forum components that you could use

11358196
pop-up	dialog
what we re talking about are javascript s dialog pop-up

11358196
pop-up	dialog
that s no real pop-up that s just a well designed overlay consisting of normal html made to look like a dialog

11358212
hmac	md5
then any known collisions in md5 are easily used to make messages with the same hmac value

11358215
pop-up	dialog
all pop-up s will have form submission and comfirmation message modal dialog

11358238

you could extend ds.model with a flag if this case deleted client-side but do not delete server-side is present for this model

11358239
portrait	landscape
i am not an experienced iphone user so i have a question regarding to nice way of handling portrait landscape layouts in my application

11358241
set	bag
since you mapped the column you could map it as reference and set the bag to inverse

11358265
portrait	landscape
on the ipad case it s more common to have both portrait and landscape but still you can make it only portrait

11358268
ant	maven
here at sonarsource we are analysing our sonar eclipse plugins using a combination of ant and maven

11358357
put	get
in the old application we have used sql adapter to get procedure out put for a xml file

11358398
cobertura	jacoco
first sonar is using cobertura by default jacoco will be the default one in sonar 3.2 that will ship during summer 2012

11358407

11358432
post	get
i have to get currently_listing_categories and thepostid even after i turn on seo friendly urls post name as permanent link

11358445
dictionary	map
you can use a dictionary to map the target keys to their associated values

11358465
postgresql	mysql
much like jdbc despite having an interface defining the operations allowed with a database you need an implementation mysql postgresql or db2 that carries out the selected tasks

11358465
sedna	marklogic
as well as interfaces to zorba marklogic commercial and sedna written in c c++

11358472
try-catch	exception-handling
be sure to wrap each operation closing the input stream closing the output stream etc... into its own try-catch as otherwise failing to do one cleanup because an exception-handling is raised will skip all other cleanup measures

11358531
post	get
i was also trying to get a json post web service to work but it s parameter was always being set as null

11358531
post	get
my get web services worked great but this post one drove me nuts

11358550
min	max
this method works good for perfectly constant sloped lines but i want to give it some felexibility i don t think comparing the difference of max and min values to a constant number is a good practice

11358561
super	self
the call to super uploadform self .clean is the same as in the django documentation for custom clean functions

11358571
hide	show
use jquery or similar to hide all and show the relevant table based on clicking in the summary table

11358605
put	get
also always put your session_start to the top of a script before every other output or your script will not work you ll get the headers already sent warning

11358655
getter	setter
the errors are from compile time and they state that the conversion cast cannot be performed for both getter and setter cannot convert from b to a and from b to a .

11358677
udp	tcp
if you want to make sure that you will receive all send packets you should use tcp protocol instead of udp

11358682
width	height
i need to do this using jquery and i won t necessarily know the values of height and width

11358684
opera	firefox
on firefox and opera on linux it is working all right but maybe you try this

11358707
versioning	upgrade
i have a very simple service that has always worked earlier but now i upgrade it to newer .net versioning and it has stopped working with error message like this

11358720
coalesce	isnull
i m using coalesce instead of isnull because it is more portable

11358754
width	height
to swap width and height

11358785
post	get
my best suggestion for you is to post on the wordpress stackexchange where you may get someone who has done this configuration before

11358822
children	parent
then with the parent element found i need all the children of those elements

11358854
hash	md5
i use md5 function to generate a hash value of it and then i save the encrypted data into the database

11358887
min	max
considering only the min max slopes doesn t tell anything about the whole curve

11358951
redmine	bugzilla	redmine	trac	trac	bugzilla
when i then open the task respository view and try to add new task repository it does not give me an option for redmine connector only bugzilla and trac

11359006
min	max
as you aren t using the max function like in your second query you need to call the min function before the time_to_sec

11359015
salt	md5
another point to keep in mind while using md5 is to use a salt value

11359015
salt	md5
md5 is susceptible to brute force attack if no salt is used

11359015
salt	md5
using a salt means adding a arbitary string to the user entered value before calculating the md5 and saving to database

11359015
salt	md5
for example if the value entered by user is abc and your salt value is 12345 you will calculate md5 for abc12345

11359074
pull	push
i ended up using a gui tool sourcetree a good and easy to use tool to pull push your code from local git to remote git repository

11359159
next	except
it s working great on all devices except for ie8 on xp which due to the infamous ie transparent png issue i get black borders around the prev and next buttons on rollover

11359187
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr was redirected to null device

11359194
filtering	grouping
there are no additional grouping filtering or aggregation on the displayed table

11359195
folder	directory
for that i downloaded org.apache.poi package and i put that in classes folder in root directory of tomcat

11359240
google-chrome	firefox
i opened 2 browsers a firefox and a google-chrome

11359240
google-chrome	firefox
afterwards i login in firefox and then i refresh google-chrome

11359289
udp	tcp
use tcp udp socket connection can be the quickest solution

11359295
put	get
when i put limit to 1 million records i get this error

11359347
unsigned	short
if you later needed to handle another type unsigned short you might need to either

11359353
hide	show
the data would be static and the user would have the liberty to choose to hide or show the data after choosing from the dropdown

11359363
google-chrome	firefox
so take a look at www.qualificationcheck.com under both google-chrome and firefox

11359363
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome dev tools and then firebug in firefox i can see that in google-chrome margin-top ends up being -33px while in firefox it ends up being -87px

11359384
ssl	https
the problem in my case was the the connection pooling between reverse proxy and backend server was not taking place because of the backend server apache closing the ssl connection at the end of each https request

11359402
google-chrome	firefox
i personally strongly prefer google-chrome s developer tools over firefox firebug but regardless which one you choose learn how to use the debugger

11359576
erlang	scheme
if you want to implement a round-robin scheme in erlang the easiest way is to have a single point of entry and then let it forward the requests out to multiple nodes

11359596
jasmine	mocha
otherwise i recommend you take a look at jasmine or mocha

11359596
jasmine	mocha
while i prefer mocha my experience with jasmine has generally been better for in-browser development thanks to the awesome jasmine-jquery plugin

11359597
hash	md5
and a small helping method to get md5 hash needed for the login

11359601
google-chrome	firefox

11359766
ubuntu	linux
it is packaged for linux distros at least for ubuntu and the website claims it also runs on macos x and windows i haven t tried

11359769
versioning	upgrade
i suspect the upgrade to a new .net versioning is either a red herring or is only indirectly causing the problem for example you might be getting exceptions that you weren t getting before and your code might be failing to dispose close connections properly when an exception is thrown

11359841
put	get
i have to put them jar by jar in the web-inf lib folder that they get deployed for runtime while in project x they are already deployed via dependencies

11359843

11359881
uninstall	upgrade
also either uninstall disable any extensions or upgrade them

11359881

the way i upgrade is by ftping in and copying the newest versioning of magento over the current installation

11359886
rubygems	rvm
i replaced rvm with rbenv on my macbook and after doing so i ve needed to add require rubygems to things to get them working

11359909
hash	salt
if i limit to a base64 string then essentially i always have to use a hash as a salt is this the recommended way

11359916
children	parent
parent know all about their children but children know nothing about their parent

11359916
children	parent
in this case i would still try to work with the children known nothing about their parent mindset

11359916
children	parent
think where the parent page is the mediator between your children the wikipedia page is good

11359916
children	parent
each child depends not on the parent but on an interface that defines exactly what the children need access to

11359917
opera	firefox
sometimes some animations make user s computer slow on opera and firefox so i need a snippet that can help user cancel all css js based animations in my web app

11359918
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome since recently interpret margin and padding differently

11359918
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
margin and padding values are added to the div height width

11359935
margin	text-indent
playing with margin and text-indent along with the first-line pseudoclass you could achieve the desired effect here s the relevant css

11359942
width	height
the height and width of image is dynamic

11359944
folder	directory
hartl s rails 3 tutorial he mentions copying the css blueprint directory into the public stylesheets folder

11359944
folder	directory
my stylesheets folder resides within the assets directory

11359946
draggable	droppable	width	height
basically the idea is to read the offset width and height of a droppable once a draggable is dragged over it

11359951
width	height
here i am able bind the images but images are coming at different sizes but i have given fixed size height and width to button and image tag still i am getting the images in different sizes different height and width

11359964
textview	imageview
but now the problem is i want to transfer the image from rows i am getting the textview values from the same but want to get the imageview added in nextactivity to previousactivity

11359994
button	checkbox
when the user checks checkbox and click delete button it should access database and delete all checked item

11360036

11360152
post	get
send an additinal parameter with ajax request like either post or get request

11360152
post	get
when a normal request post get will be posted it will not be there

11360152
post	get
so just have a check that whehter an ajax named variable exist in post get request and process data accordingly

11360156
google-chrome	firefox
however only ie 10 will support web sockets but firefox and google-chrome already does

11360168

11361163
button	checkbox
user can delete any data using checkbox and button

11361208
udp	tcp
it becomes obvious that i should use udp and aside from sending coordinate updates frequently i should also implement kind of semi-reliable protocol afaik tcp induces packet loss in udp so we should avoid mixing these two to handle such events like chat messages or gunshots where packet loss may be crucial

11361337
int	double
i would treat all parameter as an int or double even if there is only two possible values use 0 and 1 instead of true and false

11361477
children	parent
the looping is simple because the parent node is link to the children nodes by a link object

you re going to have to learn a bit about bsd unix linux input output to pull this off replace your call to scanf with a non-blocking function you write to acquire input from the user s keyboard

11361673
width	height
unfortunately since this is a mobile app i can t work with absolute sizes at all as i need this app to work on a variety of platforms and resolutions thus all groups have relative sizes assigned usually 100 for both width and height

11361727
width	height
you can use left top width and height to position controls just as effectively

11361754
mouseleave	mouseenter
works for me although it fires twice since .hover with a single argument calls it upon mouseenter and mouseleave

11361761
jlist	jtree
but looking through the jtree there is no method to get the index of the chosen like in the jlist i have searched online and have had no luck with finding a solution

11361767

moreover if you need to access the appdata directory for the roaming user you can get the folder path without hard-coding anything do not forget that users directory isn t always c users on every windows version and path for appdata may vary too

11361810
put	get
the difference now must be in the requests - the get formed by chrome is fine the put formed by my test client json must be tripping it up

11361822
google-chrome	safari
however safari does not use tcp http as a transport layer thus making it incompatible with google-chrome

11361854
button	checkbox
when the user clicks the button he she will go to the second activity which has 4 checkbox corresponding to hobbies

11361854
button	checkbox
my problem is that when the user sets the hobbies using the button again but already has hobbies showing in the textview the checkbox in the second activity should be initialized according to what is shown in the textview

11361865
nexus	artifactory
if you have your own maven repository such as nexus artifactory etc you can use it as well

changing height width or re-position changing top right

11362035
m2e	pom.xml
if you move the original sources to a different folder tools like m2e will prevent you from editing them in say eclipse because they read your pom.xml to determine the paths

11362043
children	parent
to div will make all the absolute positioned children to take position according to parent div

11362053
width	height
bottom-right coordinates however are more murky because they also involve the height and width as previously noted

11362053
width	height
the top-left coordinates are set to 10 10 the height is 10 the width is 10 and the bottom-right coordinates are 25 25

11362053
width	height
scenario 2 - rather than calculating the bottom-right coordinates the height and width are calculated

11362053
width	height
by limiting the programmer to top-left and height width the above scenarios will never occur saving processing time and accidental errors

11362104
min	max
test some or all values against some criteria min or max length min or man number value regular expression etc

jwindow	jdialog
use jframe jwindow jdialog frame window tried every window model i could without any luck

11362215
width	height
i believe they have made bottom and right read-only not because it is technically necessary but as a way of documenting that it is these properties that get re-computed when top height or left width are modified

11362215
width	height
there are two property sets one for absolute coordinates top bottom left right and one for dimension height width

11362234
atomic	lockless
if you still insist on giving a lockless implementation a try maybe out of academic interest you will need an atomic compare-exchange operation look up legacy __sync functions in the gcc documentation for c for c++ you would use the new atomic ops

11362234
atomic	lockless
alternatively a lockless queue can be implemented with only atomic add or without any atomic operations at all see fast forward queue if you re interested just for curiosity if you make some assumptions

11362246
innodb	myisam
note two of these tables are myisam table for full-text search reason and other one is innodb table

11362270
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout and is required because as you said the lines are written to stderr not stdout

11362270
stdout	stderr
that is redirect stdout to your diff file redirect stderr to some file

int	double
you have a small bug in your code you are writing double and reading int

and i don t want click show hide to show the content

11362475

11362553
children	parent
for the second part you have to get a handle on the treeviewmodel.nodeinfo instance or if you used a treeviewmodel.defaultnodeinfo on its abstractdataprovider for the parent of the highlighted node so that you can trigger a redraw of the children list where the highlighted item is

11362592
inherited	subclassing
when a model is abstract it is not created with syncdb Ã¢ only when you subclassing it in which case only the subclassing model is created in the database containing all its own fields and the ones it inherited from its parent class the abstract-class

11362632

11362916
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie9 firefox and google-chrome on windows and firefox google-chrome and safiri on mac

11362920
put	get
you could do this with a regex which i am not good at and this solution is not complete depending on your requirements or lets say the bad xml you get you will have to adopt it scan for complete xml elements instead of only the and brackets put cdata around the inner text of a node and so on

11362926
.htaccess	httpd.conf
so despite of using .htaccess i uncommented the lines with typo3root which were said to be used in httpd.conf replaced typo3root with actual value and that s it

an existing pattern to avoid this problem is post redirect get

11362941
hide	show
there is a footer underneath this area so i cant just hide it and then show when hovered

11362965
inherited	properties
better would be inherited button class add two dependency properties text1 and text2 for example and to that class let s call it textbutton for a while

11362975
inherited	properties
the reason it works is because statetree inherited from which does implement an indexer properties

screens	tablet
edit just to clarrify the above code asumes that you are interested in device screens size and density for classifying a device as tablet

11363106
put	get
instead of directly using the state function you should use the more polymorphic get and put functions so that you can give them the more exciting types

11363115
setinterval	clearinterval
i have been experimenting a lot with setinterval and clearinterval recently for creating my own custom effects and one of the things that i have been working on is an efficient way to clear an interval whilst staying out of the global scope

11363115
for-loop	loops
also i know that this example is kind of silly since i could easily use a for-loop or a .each but it s just an example - i do have instances where i do not want to use a loops

11363147
put	get
then put one back in to get it back and then use this hopefully less arduous query and explain and see if i could get a usful index in or restate the query to use a more useful index

11363151
mp3	wav
so i setup a webservice that access the required file and return a byte containing the mp3 wav audio actually i have to convert them to the desired mp3 wav prior to returning the byte

11363173

11363181
spaces	delimiter
is it something to do with the delimiter being a spaces

11363183

i have two grids within the templates and was hoping to simply show and hide the grids depending on if the listview item is selected

11363309
textview	imageview
the xml for said fragment contains an imageview a couple of large-style textview and a small-style textview

11363309
textview	imageview
the fragment class code receives a bundle then based on the contents populates the textview and imageview accordingly

in your specific case no logic on getter or setter the best option is c with a small change on properties names to follow c# standards

11363384
versioning	upgrade
note that i also upgrade jquery ui because of jsfiddle to jquery ui 1.8.18 but the problems lie in the versioning of jquery you are using

11363405
getter	setter
depends on the case when you define the fields an underscore character is used and if you just need a simple getter setter there is no need to define the fields yourself because the compiler will define them for you in the background

11363442
button	checkbox
examples include the value property of input elements the disabled property of inputs and button or the checked property of a checkbox

11363459

11363499
int	double
if you can avoid double and float variables use int

11363499
int	double
you can still achieve decent precision by simply shifting your units ie use 1026 as int instead of 1.026 as double or float

11363514
google-chrome	firefox
if that works as expected on your server then i would use a browser developer tool f12 -ie google-chrome firefox to see if there are any errors are present which would prevent the page from loading correctly and resolve those and you should be fine

11363553
width	margin
the workaround hijacks the width property binding with some events textchanged and unloading for cleanup of the events using an ivalueconverter to set the margin

11363621
class-method	delegation
i was incorporating delegation calls within the custom class for textdidbeginediting and textdidendediting in order to maintain the placeholder text when the user tabs out of the field but i wasn t calling the respective super class-method as well

11363729
move	drag
i want to have the users be able to check many items on the listview by dragging without getting in the way of scrolling the listview so i figured users would use one finger to scroll the listview and click and drag with two fingers to select items they move over

11363743
bionic	libc
from some posts on the internet on launchpad it seems that some parts of the bionic libc in particular stdio are not thread safe either at least in some android releases we still target pre-3.0

11363743
bionic	libc
edit updating with my current understanding the bionic libc is supposed to be thread safe entirely and the issue shown above is an isolated bug that will not happen in most situations like many mt bugs

11363814

if you d like to get a valid age with each user but don t care which one select the min or max of the ages

11363889

i have this letterpress effect with my own font and it is perfectly working on google-chrome and safari

11363904
put	get
so i need to be able to capture whatever is within and then get all the columns and rows and put them in a datatable object

11363929
width	margin
you will also need to reduce the amount of horizontal margin used for #previews because the width of the container is only 1300px

11363945
ubuntu	linux
i m developing an application in java for linux ubuntu 12.04 that in a part needs to configure an ad-hoc network for that i m using console commands i already did it in c and it worked and when i do it by myself in console it works but using the exact same commands in java it does not work

this seems to be happening in all browsers but i ve seen it for sure in google-chrome and firefox latest versions

11363997
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x102302f20 pointer being free was not allocated

11363998
google-chrome	firefox
xpe is simply componentized xp so as long as the browser you want will run on xp google-chrome says it supports xp i imagine firefox does too though i didn t check that then it s possible to make it run on xpe

11363998
google-chrome	firefox
since xpe is componentized you have to ensure that all of the os components that google-chrome firefox etc use are in the os you build

11364024
udp	tcp
tcp ip or even udp

11364040
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari

to get a feel for the problem visit maps.google.com in google-chrome or safari on a mac and do a pinch-zoom gesture

11364106
serializable	deserialization
and by controlling the serializable deserialization of the toys list in pet we can eliminate the problem of not being able to serializable de-serialize the list based on the type nhibernate.collection.generic.persistentgenericbag

11364117
getter	setter
note that you can make change protection-level on the setter and getter individually

11364222
google-chrome	safari
the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine

11364235
min	max
now if i want to get a count in a ideal case when all the p1 p2 and p3 have dumped cache in g1 i would say get me max id from g1 where p1 1 and similarly min id from g1 where p1 1

11364235
min	max
than i would write a query saying select count from g1 where x 1 and y 1 and z 1 where id between min id from g1 and max id from g1

11364239
html5lib	beautifulsoup
you could try html5lib instead of beautifulsoup

11364345
minimum	max
whuch means i may be wrong at least one digit at least one lowercase at least one uppercase at least one of the special chars listed with a minimum total length of 8 and a max of 20.

11364371

11369304
multiplying	modulo
if you have the choice modulo is probably more convenient basically you take your matrix modulo a number m after each power or multiplying and the individual entries of the matrix will never grow beyond m - 1 2 but obviously the result will be an algorithm for modular exponentiation thus different from what you have now

11369304
exponent	modulo
so for an unsigned long you can have a modulo up to 65535 or so and an unlimited exponent

11369304
exponent	modulo
remember that such modular exponentiations will eventually enter a cycle anyway as the exponent increases how big the cycle is depends on the matrix and on the properties of the modulo

11369304
multiplying	modulo
the code would look something like this not tested and not particularly elegant pretty much just insert matrix modulo s after each multiplying

see the messages are attached to each validator object - you cannot attach them to class unless you make your own implementation of the validation logic with static message properties and static setter getter for it and will use it instead

11370458
put	get
maybe you can create a base class responseaction with a common respond method and then you can inherits from this class for each of the possible responses type you can get and then when you call the server you instantiate the right response_specific_action class and put this instance in the dictionary.

as well as drawing on the screen a gui library or toolkit is also responsible for handling keyboard and mouse for dealing with other windows going over your window and for drawing all the standard controls such as file open boxes etc - that s why it s a bit complex

11371483
oncreate	setcontentview
you should put your code inside oncreate and after setcontentview since your method constructor public void myactivity bundle onsavedstateinstance is never called therefore your code is never executed

11371630
oncreate	ondestroy
from experience i believe the variables of one activity is only avaliable to the other while the activity is active which means between oncreate and ondestroy other then that you will probably get a null pointer exception what you really should be doing is sending the data or arrays along with the intent to the other activity

11371649

at the very end check if it s really a tcp socket you need not udp

11371674
google-chrome	firefox
the code works in google-chrome but not firefox

11371716
udp	mtu
keep in mind that the mtu may vary at various hops along the path between server and client - you can either use the common choice of a bit less than 1500 1400 ought to be safe or try to probe for it by setting the mtu discovery flag on your udp packets via ip_mtu_discover and always sending less than the value returned by getsockopt s ip_mtu option including on retransmits

in case anyone is curious i m relying at the moment on a technique for extracting the absolute value of a negative integer consisting of first a cast to the unsigned counterpart and then the application of the unary minus operator so that for instance -3 becomes 4 via cast and then 3 via unary minus

11372070
ddms	adb
restart the adb from the ddms

11372121
client-side	server-side

11380998
free	malloc
notice that i didn t use pointers new delete malloc or free anywhere here

11381024

11381566
multiplication	modulo
just for future reference if you are required to do multiplication with large numbers not applicable in this situation since the answer is taken modulo 1000000007 you should look into the karatsuba algorithm

11381595
width	height
it simply fills the clientrectangle with the specified linecolor so the height and width of the line is that of the control itself

11381623
scrollable	panels
let your panels implement scrollable the getscrollabletracksviewportwidth height control how the viewport handles the sizing in the horizontal vertical dimension respectively

11381662
getter	setter
also you might want to have a look at the concept of getter and setter

11381662
getter	setter
the bonus you get out of using getter and setter is that you can do extra stuff that might be required when retrieving the member

11381665
int	double
i think i found the answer and i also managed to make it so that i can use the arrays with any type int float double or even other classes

11381745
pthreads	fork
the other option again for pthreads only is to fork a new process whose job will be to write the string to a pipe while you fdopen the other end to obtain a for your function

this won t compile since init is protected and can t be called from a public static function

11381823
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
calling pdo prepare and pdostatement execute for statements that

11381823
prepare	execute
is using prepare and execute like

11381838

it works properly but i d like to do it in another way that is using a for-loop getting each character in the string using substring method with two parameters starting with the last character then concatenates that one-character substring with the new string each time through loops

11381876
onresume	onpause
however it is possible to make your app better at handling this by saving data and it s current state in onpause and restoring the same in onresume

11381885
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if i do setcontentview main inside the class that extends listactivity findviewbyid r.id.deletebutton would return null

11381885
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if i place findviewbyid r.id.deletebutton after the setcontentview it returns null

11381922
entities	entitymanager
the best solution to avoid this is to use a managed entitymanager from your application server to deal with entities

comparator	comparable
you should implement comparable instead of comparator

11385688

and ones rather than as decimal hexadecimal or octal numbers

11385693
comparator	comparable
you should implement comparable for a natural ordering in which case you don t need to pass a separator comparator into arrays.sort

11385693
comparator	comparable
it s important to understand the difference between comparable and comparator

11385693
comparator	comparable
a comparable implementation says i know how to compare myself to another object of an appropriate type - where a comparator implementation says i know how to compare two objects of appropriate types

11385693
comparator	comparable
obviously any type can only implement comparable once within reason whereas there can be any number of comparator implementations

11385693
comparator	comparable
if you don t specify a comparator arrays.sort will assume that each of the elements in the array can compare itself with other elements of the array they implement comparable

i wrote in the default and my own implemented constractor both the width and height to be 20 but this does not change anything if i drag the control from toolbox into designer or i programatically add the control to form

when using caliburn framework you could compose your application using smaller views and viewmodel and have a shell which binds all those smaller views together

11387822
viewmodel	caliburn
the good thing about this - unlike the pattern mentioned above where you hardcode the name of the view usercontrol in other places - is that you just create a contentcontrol and bind it to the correct viewmodel property and caliburn will find the correct view for you by convention

if someone were to use a dictionary attack brute force method on a bunch of hash with the salt would they be able to crack the passwords any quicker

11388452
post	put
for requests which requires an authentication you have to put the authentication parameters in a http header called authorization not in the post parameters

11388462
min	max
to get one per group to join against you can use an aggregate max or min on the movie_id and group it in the subquery

11388462
min	max
no subquery limit is then necessary -- you ll receive the first movie_id per name with min or the last with max

11388495
firefox	safari
it has no problems however firefox isn t the target platform and when the project is compiled within xcode in the phonegap environment it expresses the same problems that safari has with it

11388495
firefox	safari
i also tried coding my own custom transition handler within jqm and it didn t render properly although it came the closest worked in firefox and safari just not in uiwebview

11388501

11388559
submit	submission
returning false on the submit handler will prevent the form from submission and the page from refreshing and there really is no need for jquery just to prevent a form

11388605
rss	feed
but then came the idea of rss feed

11388654
versioning	upgrade
i have already looked at various railscasts and used the rails upgrade gem but most of the documentation is from some time ago when rails 3.0 was latest versioning

11388655
affinity	processors
i am wondering if there is simple way to ensure that when a c# project is compiled the csc.exe launched inherits the parent processors affinity settings

11388655
affinity	processors
i d like csc.exe to inherit the processors affinity or a simple way to be able to override how csc.exe call is generated so that it becomes

11388655

geocoding	geocode
if you don t already have the address stored you can use google s geocoding as a reverse geocode to translate lat lng to address

11388662
geocoding	geocode
you can look at this article from the documentation which discusses geocoding strategies the geocode and reverse geocode services are similar and the same quotas and rate limits apply to them

11388686

11388739
post	get
servicey is consumed by post ing a web request with the data appended to the url yes...i know this should be a get but i didn t write the external api so don t lecture me about it.

11388739
post	put
for servicex the data needs to be encoded and put into the request body as oppose to servicey where the data needs to be iterated over and placed on the post string

11388746
width	height
each textblock is a different height and width - and this is determined by the testblock.measure size then setting the width and height via desiredsize.width and desiredsize.height

11388769
freemarker	velocity
i also was disappointed to learn that click s claim of full jsp support was simply not true -- for example their panel component one of their central components used for layout cannot be used with jsp templates it only supports velocity or freemarker true as of click 2.3 the last version i evaluated

11388784
width	height
just set the width height of your canvas to #screen

11388791
innodb	myisam
if you re using myisam or innodb engines with mysql you can use some of the built in full-text search functions

11388791
innodb	myisam
definitely have a read about these and you ll probably need to do a little work with your db to find out if it s running myisam or innodb and possibly a little bit of configuration

11388841
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails 3 is basically a hybrid between merb and ruby-on-rails 2 - a ton of stuff changed . fix all that newly broken stuff

zoo	chron
i ve looked at the different libraries for dealing with timeseries data zoo chron etc but couldn t find anything satisfactory

11388941
rss	feed
i parse the rss feed and then take one of the item elements and build html string

11388974
getter	setter

11389042
awt	swing
swing programs should override paintcomponent instead of overriding paint . Ã¢ painting in awt and swing the paint methods

11389064
folder	directory
so if you need them to be included in the same folder i recommend you rename the xml files to .xml.txt so they will be deployed with the rest of the application instead of to the data directory and then have your add-in rename them when it starts up

11389118
hide	show
that way you can use javascript preferably through a library like jquery which i ve chosen for my code below to hide or show more of your solution without having to make a second database request using ajax

11389125
implements	extends
i would suggest implements it as a subclass that extends countdowntimer such as

11389137
inherited	subclassing
however unlike class inherited using is-a relationship to define what should be a subclassing i m not sure how to use an interface

11389137
abstract-class	superclass
a verybadvampire is-a vampire so my understanding is that a vampire should be a superclass maybe abstract-class

11389137
implements	extends
if we wish to create a new monster called bigrat which is dangerous but not lethal then we can create a bigrat class which extends monster and implements dangerous

11389137
implements	extends
vampire class extends monster implements dangerous lethal bloodsuckable

11389137
implements	extends
chupacabra class extends monster implements bloodsuckable

11389137
implements	extends
verymildvampire extends monster implements dangerous lethal vampiric

11389137
implements	extends
chupacabra extends monster implements dangerous vampiric

11389206
hash	salt
rather build my implementation to come up with the proper salt hash values then build my tests against those values to prevent regression

11389253
hash	salt
2 storing the salt and the rounds in the resulting hash is indeed intentional

11389253
crypt	hash
3 you don t need to extract the parameters from the hash to test against it that does the php function crypt for you

11389253
crypt	hash
just pass the existing hash as new crypt parameter

11389285

i can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappear

11389390
inherited	subclassing
the import scope is per source file 1 it adds nothing to a class type and thus has nothing to do with inherited or subclassing

11390217
implements	extends
public class mygenericserviceimpl extends remoteserviceservlet implements mygenericservice

11390225
put	get
you can put the jar in ant s own lib directory instead and then you don t need the classpath but using an explicit classpath element as above means your build file will work with a standard unmodified ant installation so it s a good habit to get into particularly if you are going to be collaborating with other developers

11390263
post	get
post fields do not show up in your url only get s

11390285
spaces	linefeed
i ve done a bad commit yesterday the ide converted tabs to spaces and linefeed to crlf and i want to revert that bad commit but i don t want the files that has been affected by the commit to get reverted back to the previous commit

meanwhile i also have the same version of zopeskel in my plone buildout located in .buildout eggs

11390363
innodb	myisam
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

11390363
innodb	myisam
if you change the create_table_query innodb to myisam you d see significant performance increase

11390390

integer	unsigned
to do your fixed-point literal conversions you could use the integer literal operator with unsigned long long

11390562
floating-point	integer
c++11 in section 2.14.8 user-defined lierals lex.ext within paragraphs 3 and 4 define literal operator variations including a template version for integer and floating-point literals

11390562
floating-point	integer
this means this technique will only work with integer and floating-point literals

11390562
int	chars
notice that template parameter is a chars --not an int or some other number

11390562
int	chars
thus code like digit - 0 is needed to get the numeric value to an int value for that chars

11390613

if you need to use custom graphics anyway use common links each with custom id attribute then just use css to set it s display as block set the width height float to make sure the each button is in the sam line and finally background-image with your buttons

11391284
postgresql	mysql
note if you want to migrate between databases ie postgresql mysql then you would have to use the db pull approach

11391320
super	self
instead of super usertravelscarsmanager self .get_query_set .filter.

11391322
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
because apple s apis lack in customization of uisearchbar s scope bar that is i want to change its frame which to my knowledge is impossible i had to create a scope bar myself using a uisegmentedcontrol inside of a uiview

11391605
ant	maven
a few months ago we finalized the migration from ant to maven and at that time the goal was to make sure things built properly under maven 2.2.1 as we weren t still willing to move directly to maven 3.0.x

11391605
ant	maven
yeah we knew that maven was relatively stable but due to the effort required in migrating all of the modules and assemblies from ant we chose to stick with a well-known stable version such as 2.2.1

11391687
hide	show
i m working on a wpf application and i want to show hide the menu when the users press alt

11391717
folder	directory
i m making use of the hadoop filestatus api to determine whether a folder is empty in order for the directory to be deleted

11391729
hide	show
i have the following js code which show hide buttons had to be done this way and please don t say do it another way

11391756
put	get
and even if you did you should really get it by the key that s returned from the put call rather than doing a query the eventual consistency model means that it s possible for the data not to be fully persisted by the next statement so a query wouldn t see it whereas a direct get by key is always guaranteed to do so

11391763
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
so basically my idea is to create every mysqlconnection mysqlcommand and mysqldatareader for every if condition

11391782
post	get
just change your method from get to post and change the routes accordingly

11391784
setinterval	clearinterval
you can implement a timer in javascript using the setinterval and clearinterval methods

11391831
implements	extends
also i don t think it would be possible to extends lengthvalidator while implements which is mandatory for your validator

11391848

here also i got correct result but when i use following post method without ajax i didn t get expected result

11391896
listview	gridview
this is a excellent example of implementing pull to refresh in listview gridview webview expandable listview

11392102
textmate	sublimetext
the most popular rails text editors at the moment are textmate and sublimetext 2

11392102
vim	emacs
basically you can use any text editor since you do not need to compile anything even emacs or vim will work if you like

11392163
listview	gridview
how could one accomplish behavior in which a header of a listview or gridview group doesn t scroll with the content but stays fixed until the content comes to an end and the following header then comes in focus

11392263
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
hard to tell from the code you posted but you probably want to set the image on the tabbaritem of the uinavigationcontroller navcontroller2 since it looks like that is what you directly add to you uitabbarcontroller

11392277
min	max
you can remove min and max and group by if second can t have many rows with same first_id

11392309

opera	firefox
firefox opera and ie9 all do not raise the click event with middle mouse click

11392396
mouseup	mousedown
they do raise mouseup and mousedown

11392460
getter	setter
to create getter and setter methods select the field s declaration and invoke source - generate getter and setter

11392460
getter	setter
another way to create getter and setter is using content assist

11392460
getter	setter
set the cursor in the type body between members and press ctrl+space to get the proposals that create a getter or setter method stub

11392527
realloc	malloc
use malloc the first time and then realloc as needed

11392588
keydown	keyup
on most browsers you ll get keydown and keyup events for capslock try it here just focus the page and press a key

11392588
keydown	keyup
keydown doesn t seem to repeat for capslock the way it does for others but you can watch for keydown and assume it s down until you see keyup

11392608
int	double
i think it is because of the math.floor method which is supposed to be a double but i did typecast it into int so there will be no problem when passing the parameters

11392645
minimum	max
now i want to select max x from all minimum x for each group

11392677
min	max
get max and min from fields

11392683
int	double
i think it is because of the math.floor method which is supposed to be a double but i did typecast it into int so there will be no problem when passing the parameters

11392764
mdpi	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi
however buttons that look good on an mdpi phone look poky on an mdpi tablet and i d rather use the hdpi bitmaps for that application

11392766
min	max
you can use the min and max functions

11392770
hide	show
now there are two possible scenarios in the first you would be loading all the content during the page load - and the tabbed widget will simply serve to hide other sections and show a particular section

11392815
oncreate	setcontentview
if you are extending droidgap no need to do setcontentview in oncreate droidgap will display webview by default

11392835
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in all browsers i ve run the code in ie8 ie9 google-chrome 20 firefox 11 and i want to remove it

11392871
recvfrom	datagram
i do not recommend using this but technically the most efficient way to receive udp datagram would be to just block in recvfrom or wsarecvfrom if you will

11392871
udp	tcp
completion ports are irrespective from using tcp they work just fine with udp too

11392871
udp	tcp
about tcp inducing packet loss on udp this is something that i am inclined to call an urban myth although it is somewhat correct

11392871
udp	tcp
it may have been true once upon a time there exists research on that matter which is however close to a decade old that routers would drop udp in favour of tcp thereby inducing packet loss

11392871
udp	tcp
tcp induces packet loss on tcp and udp induces packet loss on tcp and vice versa this is a normal condition it s how tcp implements congestion control by the way

11392871
udp	tcp
from that everyday observation one can tell for certain that udp is definitively not dropped in favour of tcp

11392871
udp	tcp
if anything qos might favour udp over tcp but it most certainly doesn t penaltize it

11392925
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you are using java you can use objectinputstream objectoutputstream and not be bothered about serialzation issues

11392934
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
a site i m creating is showing the front page exactly as its supposed to do in both google-chrome and safari but when i test in firefox the menu isn t showed correctly

here s a screenshot comparing firefox and safari respectively

11392942
post	put	post	get	put	get
dude the issue in your code for the starters is that you have specified post method for the ajax to call the controller whereas as per your code which you have put shows that the method is available in get method

11392949
getter	setter
the convention for getter method names is simply name so your setter should be setfoo and your getter would be foo

11392953
min	max	minimum	max
then by the groupings of each first group by a.id a.title we can use the min and max aggregate functions on the num column to extract minimum and maximum values per first group

11392953
min	max
in the case that a first_id had all four columns having null s or 0 s the min and max values would show up as null due to using a left join instead of an inner join as i believe this is would be a better behavior for your situation

11392964
mouseover	mouseout
i have a mouseover and mouseout effect but i need a twist if click than keep that box open even though their is a mouseout

11392967
int	chars
we can only see your receive code so we can only guess what you send but lets say for example that you write 4 x 4 byte int to a chars buffer and then send over the socket

11393050
mp4	webm
he plays one video but doesn t want to play the other video in mp4 format and doesn t fallback to webm

11393050
mp4	webm
besides the first video plays normally without using mediaelement.js library in mp4 format and the second one turns into webm format

11393057
uploadify	plupload
you could use existing plugins such as uploadify or plupload which provide this functionality by testing the capabilities of the client browser and falling back progressively

11393064
mouseover	mouseout
for this reason the timeout needs to be accessible to both your mouseover and mouseout handlers as i demonstrate here

11393077
factors	mean
what i would like to do is to concatenate high and low into one factors what i mean is create a new factors called foreign that will contain the values of high and low

11393095
google-chrome	firefox
i have this issue on google-chrome and firefox window.frames.length inside the function crse_frameexists always returns zero when actually it should return value 3 and true in order to proceed

11393113
versioning	upgrade
at the moment i am simply using the same package name in both versioning so when the user upgrade it will read from the same sharedpreferences

11393178
min	max
more or less just keep a min priority queue of the n largest elements and a max priority queue of the n-n smaller elements

11393190
width	height
in previous versions i could manually set things like layout height and width right from the property list if i wanted to set a height to 20dp i could edit it from the property list for example

11393234
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome

11393241
listview	gridview
i am currently stuck by adding a gridview to a row of a listview which uses different layouts for each row

11393241
listview	gridview
the second view should add the gridview to the listview

11393241
listview	gridview
is it possible to nest a gridview inside a listview

11393281
google-chrome	firefox
with the response header cache-control set to no-cache or the problem doesn t happen in firefox as you said but it persists in google-chrome

11393284
spaces	delimiter
extractxml returns values spaces delimiter

11393305
width	height
change the width and height to suit or if you cannot specify an exact width and height just use

11393338
dia	visio
if its purpose is only to do representative figures visio or even dia should do the necessary help

11393351
stdout	fflush
if you want to be sure add the n at the end of the string and an fflush stdout after every call to printf

11393354
children	parent
is it enough to gldeletelist . only the parent or should also its children be deleted individually

11393358
folder	directory
you should be have all the dynamic pages inside a directory lets say dynamicpages folder

11393373
capitalize	uppercase
uppercase lowercase capitalize an ant property

11393384
box-sizing	border-box
jquery calculates dialog size incorrectly when using box-sizing border-box with default template

11393388
explode	implode
i would remove the needs to use explode when fetching them and implode when updating storing them

11393426
ubuntu	debian
installation on debian ubuntu

11393501
free	malloc
i m pretty sure that your array allocated by using malloc will result in leaked memory since you have no way of controlling when this memory is to be free

11393574
width	height
if it were me i would surround your tables in a div layer specifying the width and height of the div layer to force the tables next to each other

11393609
children	parent
this datacontext only goes down the tree to the children - if you place a new value into the datacontext of a child control it will override the parent datacontext

11393640
rdf	owl
we re thinking about a project based around knowledge processing and came across owl rdf

11393741
gif	png
png jpg gif

11393844
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the behavior is correct in firefox and google-chrome but in ie and opera the mouse pointer doesn t update its style until it is moved

11393891
post	get
if you don t want to show the the on the url you should change the method from get to post in your form

11393942
uploadify	plupload
uploadify and plupload flash work great for uploading but make me crazy with the callback

11393942
uploadify	plupload
i don t think it s a plupload or uploadify issue because i have the same problem with both

11393953
put	get
but when i try to put create-img.php as source in the api call above i get an error

foldable	traversable
traversable and foldable data structures

11394101
post	get
you can use this component for http-requests like post get delete etc

11394147
min	max
1140 - mixing of group columns min max ... with no group columns is illegal if there is no group by clause

11394148
onfocus	onblur
we know that the onblur and onfocus gives us the ability to detect that change and with one settimeout function we can stop it

11394182
queue	fifo
gcd provides and manages fifo queue to which your application can

11394183
bmp	png
i see that you are using base64 to send the image you could try to compress the bytearray before convert it to base64 to reduce the image or try to convert to a more compressed image type ej bmp to png

11394251
google-chrome	firefox
the code works on both firefox and google-chrome but in ie9 i get the following error

11394256
hide	show
what i would do is stroring the two filter parameters in two variables and use one function to show hide accordingly

11394287
google-chrome	firefox
i did not manage to get your code work on google-chrome or firefox i always get an error on main.width

11394293
shadowbox	lightbox

11394419
mouse	keyboard
we use gpsyshook to log keyboard and mouse events in our software

11394443
mouseup	mousedown
you may sink mouseup mousedown event on the splitpanel and check split position at each mouse release

11394495
post	get
you can set session.use_trans_sid in php.ini which will automatically append session id via get or post

11394568
width	height
width 100 and height 100

11394570
median	percentile
there is already a so question for the median which is the 50th percentile so you should be able to adapt from there

11394590
sorting	filtering
as a global guideline when writing queries try to formulate them in such a way that the resultset is as close to what you need as possible ie no extra sorting or filtering operations afterwards

11394642
google-chrome	firefox
use a javascript debugger like google-chrome developer tools if you are using google-chrome or firebug if you are using firefox

11394713
width	height
this way you dont have to worry about recalculating things if you want padding on the overlay or the container like you would if you used actual height and width values because its always going to be adjusted to the outer dimensions of the box

11394726
imap	nntp
the apache james is a pure java smtp pop3 mail server imap and nntp news server designed to be a complete and portable mail messaging engine solution based on open messaging protocols

11395099
submit	submission
either set as part of your form hidden field for ret or output into the javascript controlling the form submission or page the form submit to

11395099
submit	submission
alternatively have some javascript trapping the login form submission that then submit the page via ajax then redirects to the chosen url you won t need to close the fancybox just target top.location.href

11395120
pull	push
the safest way to move changesets back and forth between repositories is always hg push and hg pull and none of those command operate on more than one source or destination repository

11395120
pull	push
in theory you could do both push and pull and if necessary a init clone but you ll start running into edge ccases pretty quickly

11395147
width	height
i have four floated divs with same width and height

11395176

11395227
rdf	owl
if some of that stuff sounds good then the rdf owl primers are good places to start learning about the technology

11395240
serializable	deserialization
again i would recommend externalinterface it has many features fscommand doesn t have like preserving data types and automatic serializable deserialization of objects between actionscript and the typical external environment - javascript in a web page - whereas fscommand only sends strings

11395290
integer	unsigned
there is no conversion to unsigned integer however there is a conversion to signed integer nsinteger

coalesce	isnull
if you want to create a default value on an actual field in a table you could use either the coalesce or isnull functions please assume that test is an actual field

11395487
children	parent
however when i m saving an item all children are created and then returned to the parent object and stored within it so that a save can be performed on the parent only and nhibernate will take care of cascading records

11395487
children	parent
for example a parent object that contains children of type child

11395734
width	height
you would need to change the height and width values as you require ..

11396087
width	margin
by providing a margin to #main that is equal to the width of the fixed columns it ll keep that area from snapping back towards the left

11396092
int	chars
i would like to copy 2 int 2 shorts and 1 chars one after the other

11396094
client-side	server-side
this will cause the server-side and client-side length methods to match letting you use the stringlength attribute i assume your issue with stringlength was that the server and client validation methods differed

11396098
hide	show
you could also just hide the panel with the other widgets and show the one with the bitmap

11396100
width	height
the chart should fill the entire row because of 100 width and height table layout is right it fills the document area and everything else is fine

tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol and users controls are in tabitem content like that

11396228
getter	setter
if you access self.data you are calling the getter setter method

11396228
getter	setter
this could be useful for example if your setter or getter is doing other things that you may not want to in this particular case

11396243
getter	setter
one solution i thought of was to have all the saving and storing occur in the class in which it was initialized and just use getter and setter but was trying to make it more readily accesible by making it an object that can be called from other classes and changed in those classes which becomes a little more complicated and confusing at times

11396249
typedef	struct
i believe this is happening because mode is a type defined using typedef and its not the name of the struct

11396290
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working in google-chrome and ie but the submit button is 1px too short in firefox

firefox doesn t understand jscript like google-chrome and safari do

11396306

11397085
subtract	add
so when your app it says app not activity goes to background all the activities are not visible so they execute the onstop method so the idea behind this is to add one each time an activity es started and subtract one each time an activity es hided so if the value of the variable activities is zero that means that all the activities that where started in some point are now not visible so when you app returns from background and executes the onrestart method on the activity in front you can check whether comes from background or is just restarting an activity

11397509
width	height
by setting width 0 on the cells you could override this so that the browser makes each cell as narrow as possible effectively as wide as the widest word in the case of pure text content but then three words make three lines causing the height setting to be overridden

11397535
integer	unsigned
which indicates that you somehow reached a point where your argument list is empty except for the unsigned integer argument

you need to rebuild everything linked against bionic using the ndk toolchain possible via its generate stand alone toolchain function

11397992
temp	tmp
so it seems that you just need to give a value for the sqlite3_temp_directory which if you set it to a null pointer will use the tmp temp etc variables as defined in the sqllite manual

11397996
tar	gunzip
i experienced the same issue i solved downloading unpacking the archive using tar gunzip and coping sqlite3.c from the resulting directory into svn-src-folder sqlite-amalgamation sqlite3.c

pop-up	dialog
it seems like i can t create any .ane files rather than abstract tools like push notifications or pop-up like windows like progress bars and dialog boxes

11398238
post	put
i must also add that if you instead set then the store sent a put request instead of the post

listview	gridview
if i correctly understood your needs if you use a listview or a gridview which is bound to an iobservablecollection the items will automatically fit correctly when deleting adding items

or better use set interval for each npc independently however using lots of timeouts and intervals is highly inefficient so be aware and ready for lag

11398687
equals	gethashcode
either that or create your own class to be a list of timepoints and have it implement gethashcode and equals and or implement which are used by the default comparer

11398720

11399249
width	margin
and avoid hard-coded width margin values -- allow the application elements to size themselves proportionally

11399250
removeclass	next
but now it can be that wrongfilterid is undefined and the next call to removeclass would remove all classes form #imgwrap

11399250
spaces	delimiter
another problem is that imgwrapclass can be a spaces delimiter string of classes fashion black which means that

11399272

11400713
width	height
give one container height 0 and a padding-top with the percentage you want for the height of your image in proportion to the width

11400713
width	height
so for a height of 50 of the width use padding-top 50 and height 0 which - as explained here - will make the height proportional to the width by 50

11400713
width	height
now just place your image in the inner container and give it width 100 and height 100

11400818
pbkdf2	crypt
much better is to use crypt function with crypt_blowfish or pbkdf2

11400821
subtract	add
so when your app it says app not activity goes to background all the activities are not visible so they execute the onstop method so the idea behind this is to add one each time an activity es started and subtract one each time an activity es hided so if the value of the variable activities is 0 zero that means that all the activities that where started in some point are now not visible so when you app returns from background and executes the onrestart method on the activity in front you can check whether comes from background or is just restarting an activity

11410402
free	malloc
it requires a bit of extra discipline to use dynamic memory managed by malloc free but is considerably useful to avoid huge local or wasted global storage in situations where a function needs to handle a bunch of data and can get called a few times or a big chunk of data that very rarely needs to be in memory

11410402

11413527
udp	tcp
regarding your comments on udp versus tcp speed udp will always be faster

11413527
udp	tcp
tcp offers ordering and delivery guarantees this means possible retries and holding other packets back until a lost packet finally arrives at its destination while udp only promises to send it once not caring what happens with it afterwards

11413527
udp	tcp
a game may typically use a tcp stream where ordering and guaranteed delivery matters the important stuff and udp streams for object movements etc where only the latest position really matters and if one update got lost it does not matter as long as each package contain the full position instead of a delta where all packets matter

11413527
udp	tcp
for your own game i suggest implementing it on tcp first and then when you have some more experience you can try move the time critical stuff where order and lost packets matter less into separate udp streams

11413527
udp	tcp
there are many projects that have failed because people started with udp first and then tried bolting on ordering and delivery guarantees on top of it effectively trying to reimplement tcp

either your superclass should expose those methods perhaps as abstract or your array should be of the subclassing type so you re not telling the compiler to forget the actual type of the objects or you ll have to suck it up and do the cast possibly with the instanceof test

11415161

integer	unsigned
for example if one receives four unsigned bytes from a connection and wishes to regard their value taken as a whole as a 32-bit integer using unsigned types means one can simply say

11417985
integer	unsigned
i m not sure i really see any reason for a language designed nowadays not to include unsigned versions of all types shorter than the longest signed integer type with the semantics that all integer meaning discrete-quantity-numerics rather than any particular type operations which will fit entirely within the largest signed type will by default be performed as though they were operating upon that type

11422956
portrait	landscape
no the size of that photo is controlled by facebook and the only thing you can do is playing around with the relative size of the photo you use so that it would look slightly bigger you should use pictures with landscape layout as opposed to portrait to get a slightly bigger photo

11423081
put	get
the servers produce varying work packets that all get put into one blocking queue

11423311
int	double
you are guaranteed that double is never smaller than float and that long double is never smaller than double - similar to the guarantees for long long long int short

11423323
width	height
the basic reason why your code is not working is because the height of an element is calculated differently than you might expect it s different than width

11423335
folder	directory
when you compile and run the project in netbeans the .class files are created and stored in some folder within your project s directory probably called bin or something like that

you can find the maximal divisor by multiplying by ten usually by repeated addition until the divisor exceeds the number then backing off to the previous value

11423542
passenger	unicorn
i d choose unicorn over passenger if only because passenger still doesn t offer rolling restarts

11423547
google-chrome	firefox
the button works fine on google-chrome but does not work in firefox

11423567
sorting	filtering
the databases already have out of the box several utilities and features that assist in manipulating the data input storage analysis sorting comparison integrity checks reporting retrieval search filtering security multi-user edits etc

11423586
subtraction	addition
then inside the enterframe loop to increase the second sound it would be the same as above but addition instead of subtraction

11423633
doxygen	docset
however i do recommend taking the easy way out which is generating the docset based on the php source using doxygen see creating docsets using doxygen inside the article you linked

11423665
free	malloc
i have a basic understanding of how memory allocation works enough to know that if i malloc then free i m not likely going to actually free an entire page

11423665
free	malloc
i m also open to a drop in replacement malloc if there s a solution that makes checking free relatively easy

11423682
post	get
clarification i am not asking if a get or post can be constructed and sent to any domain

11423682
google-chrome	firefox
if google-chrome ie or firefox will allow content from domain y to send a post to domain x

11423682
post	get
i say somewhat because it seems too easy to believe that an attacker could simply issue an http get to retrieve a form containing the anti-forgery token and then make an illicit post which contains that same token

11423752
free	malloc
the easiest way is to make wrappers for malloc and free

11423752
free	malloc
if you use the real malloc and free then the following could happen

11423754
free	malloc
do one malloc free cycle then capture the results of getrusage then do 1000 more malloc free cycles and ensure your process didn t actually allocate more memory

11423754
free	malloc
if you want something more deterministic but slightly more intrusive you can override malloc and free to track allocations and observe the tracking data from the test harness

11423778
post	get
it is possible to build an arbitrary get or post request and send it to any server accessible to a victims browser

11423820
folder	directory
as you made changes to instance a and instance b you would have create a mask that would hide files from commonsource if they were deleted from the instance folder and create a new physical file in the instance directory if an existing common source file was modified

google-chrome	firefox
the other elements i m animating with it work properly in firefox ie google-chrome

11423880
inherited	properties
then the child elements will automatically inherited the properties of the parent element

11423891

first when you use hover and active and other such things the base style is taken so you do not need to re-declare the background-image and background-repeat styles once will do

11423923

ready	each
create non-consumable products with product id com.testitem1 com.testitem2 com.testitem3 there is ready to submit status for each products

11424017
int	chars
apart from int the parameters should also support chars type and any other types as well

11424068
for-loop	arrays
you can easily test this yourself by creating an immense multidimensional arrays with a for-loop but accessing it directly will generally be faster when indexing large arrays

11424089
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled

11424096
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled

if you post your dmanager1.h file you ll be able to get a more detailed answer

11424114
getter	setter
lowercase letter by convention appears uppercase in getter and setter

11424114
getter	setter
getter and setter for property empname

11424125
min	max
using the pre-processor and creating a basic macro such as your basic min max type macro that simply wraps a few and operations

11424127
getter	setter
this makes sense since properties are not variables - they are implemented as getter setter methods by the compiler

11424135
width	height
edit and as the original image is rotated the old width and height have to be reversed

11424142
button	checkbox
otherwise if the field element is an input element whose type attribute is in the checkbox state or the radio button state then run these further nested substeps

11424155
uiview	cashapelayer
use a uiview with a cashapelayer backing it

11424198
folder	directory
for example im in desktop directory say it contains a bb c i type in a b aa bb it will search a b aa bb against all the folder names in the current directory then it outputs a bb c exists aa b don t exist

11424249
inherited	properties
- extend allows you to inherited all the properties of a selector without having to define it as a mixin

11424261
google-chrome	firefox
it only seems to be happening in firefox google-chrome was fine

11424308

the release notes to upgrade an existing server installation say to just install the newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones

11424332
min	max
in result set i want to ad a column which shows min and max date combinely 20 3 2012 - 25 4 2012 from table

11424378
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
when i did server stuff i used bufferedreader and bufferedwriter

11424378
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
note if you re going to deal with large pages this could cause a problem as the bufferedreader and bufferedwriter will fill up before you re ready

11424390
datalist	repeater	gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist
when you set the datasource from code behine the same principle is valid for other databound controls like gridview datalist repeater etc you need to bind again on some paging event

11424390
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
an alternative way to solve this you could add a datasource control like objectdatasource linqdatasource etc... and set it on the listview s datasourceid property and the datapager will work automatically

11424395
width	height	int	boolean
so using your jtable you can get the cellrect int width int height boolean includingspacing and pass it off to the scrollrecttovisible

11424397
comparator	comparable
the classes you are looking for is comparable and comparator

11424465
children	parent
i m trying to keep my parent div and children in focus until i focus out of the div and it seems surprisingly hard to accomplish

11424480
folder	directory
in rails 3.1 i was able to put a symbolic link to a directory of html pages in my public folder and it worked

11424509
inherited	subclassing
it conflicts with the way rails uses sti single table inherited as it uses the type attribute to determine the type of the class when its subclassing another

11424538
width	height
1 make sure that each element in your layout has layout height and width defined

11424539
width	height
as a result i have many some classes with identical styling mainly width height padding etc.

11424553
uiview	subviews
now the other approach would be to just use a new uiview added as a subviews of your main view controller

11424587
children	parent
the issue described at the highest level possible i have a parent class that would like to act as the delegate for multiple children all using the same protocol but when the children call methods on the parent the parent no longer knows which child is making the call

11424587
children	parent
i would like the parent view controller to be notified whenever the user touches one of the children

11424587
children	parent
the parent implements the protocol and sets itself as the delegate to each of the children

11424587
children	parent
the parent defines a separate method for each of the three children and then subscribes to the viewwastouched notification for each of the three children as the notification sender

11424598
decimal	ieee
another way to look at this is to realize that ieee 64-bit doubles normalized approximate positive and negative decimal numbers having absolute values ranging from 2.225073858507201400 e -308 through 1.797693134862315700 e +308

11424598
int	double
the behavior of floats and double wrecks havoc with decimal computations requiring exact decimal accuracy such as financial calculations and is why unless a high-precision approximation is acceptable one should use scaled int and longs or classes such as biginteger and bigdecimal for computations requiring exact decimal accuracy rounding and precision

11424600
post	get
change method post to method get if you only want to send get data

11424602

11425286
width	height
all of that above of course if you are talking about taking existing vga solutions which means you are programming chips and the chips are all different from each other and the programming of them have little to do with vga itself that part is all hidden from you you are just manipulating registers to define the height width and depth etc and then manipulating the pixels in memory

11425331
subtract	add

apk	dex
android application are apk files that are basically zip file that contains dex odex files and all other resources that you may wish to add.but i think you can use any coding language to develop as long as you have ide that converts your code to apk and dex .and most important of all your programming language must support corresponding api or must have something similar to cross compile.the reason google used java for android was they felt it is convenient to do it read it during case google v s oracle

11425708
button	checkbox
you don t need to handle any events of the checkbox and the button everything is handled by the binding

hide	show
if the idea here is to hide the end of long lists until the user clicks show more... then you can do something like this for your html basically the same as you had minus the div

11425930
hide	show
the click handler gets the parent li of the clicked link and hide it then gets the following sibling lis and show them

11425933
goto	break
you can use goto instead of and break

11433021
int	chars
in c a chars literal has type int

11433030
int	chars
when you use the commas you are treating the number as a chars and if this is given to an int the int will take the value of the ascii code of this chars

11433035
int	chars
in fact such literals evaluate not to chars but to int so they are perfectly interchangeable with other number literals

11433038
int	chars
all the chars in c are represented with an int value the ascii code of the chars

here is the full test using jasmine sinon

11433197
for-loop	arrays
an argument in favour of reading a whole arrays and indexing is that using next f could be unclear when combined with a for-loop

11433197

in racket s scheme it would be

11433863
width	height
i know the window width and height and i know the amount of buttons there is to add

implements	extends
just make an baseactivity in which you implements this code and then let all your activities that you want to have this 2 options menu extends your baseactivity

11433994
for-loop	arrays
as expected fast enumeration is by far the fastest and nsenumerator is still a little bit faster than the for-loop but this was for enumerating quit a large arrays

11433994
for-loop	loops
i then tried a hybrid version as well using fast enumeration for the outer loops and a for-loop for the inner one

11433997

under advanced settings there is radio buttons for migrations playing around with those solved the problem and setting the default width of 810px and height to 900px works fine - however i ve got the scrollbar at the bottom

11434134
nfa	dfa
chapter 1 gives detailed algorithms for converting a regular expression to a deterministic or non-deterministic finite-state automaton dfa or nfa in the context of proving their equivalence a dfa an nfa and a regular expression can match exactly the same classes of strings

11434134
nfa	dfa
you then convert the nfa into a much larger dfa which involves creating one dfa state for each set of alternative nfa states

11434134
nfa	dfa
the dfa has at most as many states as the powerset of the set of nfa states an nfa with 3 states can get transformed to a dfa with at most 2 3 8 states and can recognize any target string without backtracking

11434194
inline-functions	inlining
it s not to do with inlining what happens is the linker sees multiple definitions of the same symbol which often happens with template instantiations and inline-functions and other symbols when using dynamic libs and picks one definition to use

11434201

width	height
the number of controls has to be a product of two other numbers so as someone suggested 17 gives you only 17 1 so then button width is gridth width 17 and button height is window height or vice versa if you d prefer one column

11434443
width	height
you could try and do something with aspect ratio to make this more sense width height means you should go for a row

11434443
width	height
if the number of controls is a product then it will either be a square or again you can use width height to calcu out the button widths and height

11434443
width	height
you might also want to consider minimum width and height for the buttons but then you have more won t fit problems

trie	tree
after rereading i think the best way to do this is probably to build a trie or a prefix tree of your big library of strings then match s against that

11434518
trie	tree
it also fits your use case quite well -- while it takes quite a bit of work to build a trie or especially a prefix tree from the input using it afterwards is quite fast

when that thread is done it indicates that it is and the button and checkbox should both be re-enabled and the gif should be gone

11444418

for some reason the the checkbox is re-enabled and unchecked and the gif is gone as expected but the dostuff button is still disabled and reads processing...

getter	setter	width	height
a typical example that violates lsp is a square class that derives from a rectangle class assuming getter and setter methods exist for both width and height

11445019
width	height
the square class always assumes that the width is equal with the height

11445019

if someone is trying to use what they think should be an instance of rectangle but it s really an instance of square they might set the width and be surprised that the height automatically changes unexpected side effect

a qhd hdpi device has a display-independent pixel dip screens size of 360x640 whereas the incredible s s is 320x533 hence why some of the images are higher up the screens relative to others

11454524
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
but i d work on making your app adaptable to screens rather than trying to divide screens sizes up like this as you shouldn t really need separate layout resources for mdpi hdpi etc

11454524

-- i agree that normally i shouldn t need separate layout for mdpi and hdpi screens

but i d work on making your app adaptable to screens rather than trying to divide screens sizes up like this as you shouldn t really need separate layout resources for mdpi hdpi etc

11455007
getter	setter
first when you use property synthesize directive you create getter and setter methods around a variable

11455007
getter	setter
in your case the variable is called arrayspeechsentences the compiler will create the variable for you and you can access these methods setter and getter with self

11455016
vb.net	vb6
a proper answer is really too big and time consuming to fit in here and will demand a bit of experimentation to get it working but basically you can install a usb to com driver from prolific and then write software to that or rework the vb6 answer you linked into vb.net using the usual techniques

11455020

when i try to use realloc to allocate memory for a pointer which has been free d i get a segmentation fault

11455323
versioning	upgrade
it worked fine with phonegap 1.5 but after an upgrade to versioning 1.9 it stopped working

11455341

if you re passing a pointer to realloc that has been free d but not explicitly set to null you re probably passing realloc an invalid address which it will try to use resulting in undefined behavior hence your segfault

11455352

if i extends activity and implements an event handler in my base class sorry if that s not the correct oop term how can i ensure that my event handler always gets run from classes which extends mine

realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
the pointer you pass into realloc must be one of two things either a valid pointer that was previously returned from malloc calloc realloc or else a null pointer

i tested your code with two images one was landscape width height the other was portrait height width

11455583

11455836
pop-up	dialog
note that if you re giving some sort of bonus for users accepting the requests you should also implement logic in your own app which tracks the number and ids of the sent requests to corelate them later when processing the acceptances as users could conceivably trigger the dialog themselves via javascript or the pop-up dialog and send more requests than your app allows

11455843
actionscript	mxml
so far when i get the application to work if i use an mxml olapcube but not when i try to build the olapcube in actionscript

width	height
i would like for the text title to have a black background that is the same width as the text but a different height

11455865
width	height
if i get the width right i can t change the height because the span is an inline element

11455865
width	height
if i get the height right by making the span a block i can t change get the width to be exactly the width of the text because it is now a block level element and expands to be the entire width of the page

i have put together an example bit of code as i am trying to get 2 images of different sizes to be aligned at the top such as shown below

11456097
udp	tcp
if you re working with connection based protocol like tcp it would be senseless to drop packets but with a datagram based protocol udp it would also be simple to implement

11456099

however you can create a filewriter object using a filedescriptor and fileoutputstream can provide one for this purpose

11456113
min	max
min max

11456132
fadein	fadeout
the animation.setstartoffset method allows to say when the animation should start 0 for the fadein and 2000 for the fadeout

11456149
for-loop	arrays
i know i could create a for-loop to iterate through the movies arrays with an if condition but that requires me to look through every single movie

if you expect an integer value there a floating-point with .0 fractions part you should probably round the result of pow

11456215
getter	setter
it overrides the getter and setter to simply place the values into a map rather than into the object s normal property space

11456233
width	height

11456297
pylons	pyramid
the first package from the pylons project was the pyramid web framework

11456305
children	parent
however i think you would be able to detect such situations in a post-processing step and correct them afterwards walk the tree and for each node check to see if it represents a horizontal or a vertical join and if a node x has the same orientation as its parent y then remove x and make its children additional children of y

11456338
strcpy	strtok
i m also getting this error with strcpy strtok and some other standard functions all respective headers included in header.h

11456345
width	height
width and height should be png_uint_32 not unsigned int

11456345
width	height
after seeing your pastebin it looks like you re passing in width and height to the function as unsigned char which are effectively hiding the class members width and height and is probably not what you want specifically since unsigned char can only hold values up to 255 and the width and height are 1024 and 2048

11456365
post	get
tried get post also the same results

11456376
google-chrome	firefox
this page is loading differently in ie than google-chrome or firefox

11456398
nsurlconnection	nsstream
you can watch the wwdc videos network apps for iphone part 1 part 2 and networking best practices where they suggest to use nsurlconnection for http and https the cfsocket cfstream nsstream family for other tcp networking and of course webkit if you just intend to render web content

11456409
post	get
you should be able to get around this by making your view model a parameter into the httppost action result method and then passing that list back to the view after the post so that it retains which items are selected instead of creating a new one

11456419
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

fadein	fadeout
basically i would like a fadein effect on a child when entering a parent div and a fadeout effect on the child when leaving the parent

works in google-chrome firefox

11457085
union	distinct
union implicitly performs a distinct so the resulting list will not have duplicate values.

11457118
free	malloc
this code doesn t include a copy constructor however copy constructor is used in scenarios where you dyamically allocate members of a class so that the program should not crash once an instance or object goes out of scope because the destructor will deallocate the dynamically allocated memory if you have included delete or free for new or malloc respectively

11457129
width	height
where icons.on and icons.off are the two images and width_of_image and height_of_image are the width and height of the image you use

cpu	processors
this all comes from staged processors where portions of the cpu in the past remained idle now we make use of every little piece as much as possible

11457314
inherited	subclassing
a serious answer would be to write a separate main for each subclassing but let it call a common inherited method that accepts an appropriate instance

11457349
x86	64bit
if you are using windows 7 64bit make sure you update your x86 jdk jre version as well

11457365
disk	ram
changing to pvr format will not help since it is the texture size that dictates the amount of memory pvr will only benefit on disk size and load time not ram required at run time

11457377
post	get
you only real chance is if you can subscribe to all the relevant forums then you could get all the post from your messages page or email again depending on how the site is setup

11457475
wordpress	phpbb

11457482

11457496
inherited	properties
you should check the code behind the filename and inherited properties on page directive and ensure that they both match..

11457504
subtract	add
an easier solution might be to simply subtract one from the techniqueid then add it back when you use it

11457572

if you use stored procedures its not as easy to upgrade and roll back versioning or run multiple versioning concurrently

11458013
superclass	subclassing
concatenated property means that overwriting the this property in a subclassing does not overwrite the values but extends the existing ones from the superclass

11458040

implements	extends
i was wondering if it was possible to set a parameter to a method as an object which must be a extends one class and implements another

11458190
implements	extends
let s say somewhere else there is a class called classb which both extends classa and implements myinterface

11458190
implements	extends
i could also have a classc which also extends classa and implements myinterface

11458190
implements	extends
but what if i wanted a method3 and i wanted to have a parameter which accepts only objects which either subclass classa or is classa itself and implements myinterface and so will accept both classb and classc but not any class which only extends classa or only implements myinterface or neither

11458273
int	chars
i tried changing the default userid from int 11 to chars 16

11458284
implements	extends
one that both extends classa and implements myinterface

11458312
post	get
you need to check if a post has actually occured - the first time someone hits your page it ll most likely be via a get but your search code will run regardless

11458318
implements	extends
but i don t think it s a good idea - if you have a concept of object that extends classa and implements myinterface it would be better to create a separate class or interface to represent that concept

11458338
int	chars
this assumes that your int will never be more than 10 chars long

11458352
implements	extends
like have a parent abstract class interface that defines the executeoperation graphics2d gr boolean drawingmode method then extends implements it for each operation you support may be able to drop drawingmode too i can t see what it does though. can possibly put the graphics2d into a constructor too

11458370
dictionary	map
so by default two logically-equal instances of your class will map to two different entries in the dictionary until you properly override both -isequal and -hash to reflect your logic

i m consuming data from an rss feed and want to store the data in our database

11459417
getter	setter
in your code you can reference it by myproperty ivar or self.myproperty property - with the access rules - readonly readwrite getter setter etc... this can of course be confusing if you are using some kind of rules like

11459433
getter	setter
the ... _speed will create an property named _speed and its setter and getter will be named after speed

inherited subclassing subtype generalization hierarchy etc.

you will have to set an object to be the alert view s delegate and override its appearance in willpresentalertview the way you do any other uiview adding subviews

11463274
for-loop	arrays
the problem is your call to match is literally trying to match the string badexporthosts badhosts on each iteration of the for-loop which is no good since you need to match the values in your badexporthosts arrays and not the variable name itself

11463319
width	height
what you re copying now is the struct itself the width field the height field etc

11463377

now i wanted to ask this question on postgresql or mysql forums why there is discrepancy on results between a condition on where clause and a condition embedded on select clause

11463377
postgresql	mysql
on both mysql and postgresql max yield the same output

11463387

11463450
hash	md5
it wont open twice if the md5 hash is the same

11463470

11463511
int	double
in your case use double instead of int

11463512

seems that something in ddms or adb needs to be standardized so they all work under the same conditions.

11463575
entity-relationship	diagram
what i did i used schemaspy a script that -among other features such as a really useful html diagram of the underlying entity-relationship model - it generates two very useful lists a insertion order where all of your tables are listed as an optimal order in order to perform insertions considering existing restrictions and dependences and a deletion order very useful in order to drop tables

11464021
phpfox	elgg
while elgg is free the 99 you will spend on a basic phpfox package will pay for itself 300 times over the first time you have to pay someone to create an addon that likely already exists for phpfox as it s third party developer community is much larger

int	chars
in c programming language signed int when converted to smaller signed int say chars for the sake of simplicity are of implementation-defined manner

11464365
int	chars
update the reason why int doesn t work in oppose to chars and short is because that when both numbers are added there is a possibility of overflow regardless of being int short or chars while not forgetting integral promotion but because short and chars are with smaller sizes than int and because they are promoted to int in expressions they are represented again without truncation in this line

11464365
int	chars
this is because short and chars get promoted to int evaluated and then get truncated overflowed

11464365
int	chars
however this is not what happens in c because chars and short are promoted to int thus overflow is detected which is not true in int because it is note promoted to a larger size

width	height
a pixel size for a font gives a height with a width corresponding by ratio

11477323
width	height
the only way to know for certain is to test with the font you are using since they can vary pretty significantly in ratio of height to width and definitely will change by the character used

11477406
width	height
note the wrapper is set to a fixed width and height and has overflow-y hidden and overflow-x scroll set because i do not want vertical scrolling-- only horizontal

rsa	aes
generally one would use rsa to encrypt a secret key like an aes or rc4 key to allow us to send that key in public and then use that secret key to encrypt the actual messages to take advantage of the speed of secret-key encryption

11477531
hash	md5
rsa can also be used to sign a message but what is actually signed with rsa is a hash of the actual data like md5 sha-1 sha-256

to make sure everything stays in the same place you can give the next element a top margin of the same value as the line height

11477959
button	checkbox
the problem is that there is a button on the page too which is triggered by js code and maybe i can add a line there to check if the checkbox is checked once the button is clicked otherwise display message for unchecked checkbox

11478004
min	max
the min and max are set right at the window container

11478028
stdout	stderr
then you can specify that object as stdout and stderr in your subprocess calls

11478033
min	max
oracle forces me to use an aggregate function and i used max or min knowing that it s completely senseless

11478067
width	margin
yes i could have set the width and gave it margin 0 auto but that s a lot of work for centering one single element and it dirties up my code which i take pride in keeping orderly

11478093
mouseover	mouseout
you just need to use the hover function the first parameter is mouseover the second is mouseout

11478094

11478159
getter	setter
synthesizing a property simply auto-generates a getter and setter for the ivar

11478163
width	height
the horizontal bar s position will vary with the height of the browser window whereas if you set it as 85 of the width it would be exactly where i want it

11478163
width	height
so if i could define the horizontal position as 85 of the browser width instead of height the navbar would be exactly where i want it no matter what dimensions the browser is open to

11478198
margin	text-align
inside this div you place another div and set margin to auto and text-align left

11478229

11478243
width	height
only in designer for height and width i only can set fill_parent or wrap_content values

11478250
getter	setter
this will by default create a getter and a setter and handle the autorelease as well as create the instance variable

11478250
getter	setter
you should always use the getter and setter

11478273
getter	setter
when writing setf expanders for user-defined getter i commonly find that there is code duplication in the getter and setter as far as how the property is retrieved

11478273
getter	setter
to be clear what i d like here is a way to define a getter and typical setter where the way that the getter compiles down to common lisp forms that already have setter car lst is written only once in the code

11478273
getter	setter
what i m talking about here is the case where the setter does the standard thing and just sets the place of the getter

11478298
scatter	graphing
i figured it out myself instead of using a bar chart i used a scatter plot with step graphing that did the trick

11478309

daemons	systemd
it is possible for systemd administrators to define certain properties as final so that client daemons may not override them

11478342
mouse	keyboard
either of your methods will work - if you have little programming background i would suggest starting with autohotkey since it mimics keyboard and mouse commands so the programming is much more straightforward and easier to understand

11478343
union	distinct
note that the join potentially returns multiple copies of some stores but because union implies select distinct that won t actually affect your final result-set.

getter	setter
what bfs could do in your case is the following btw be nice and use appropriate construtors getter and setter

11478457
post	get
here is my initial blog post on it as it can get quite long

11478458
int	double
formally it has internal linkage meaning it can t be referred to by name or linked to from other files it can be indirectly referred to through a pointer or by passing it as an argument to another function. that means if several files define static int testnum then each file has its own internal variable with that name distinct from the testnum in every other file in fact one file could have static int testnum and another could have static double testnum and another they d all be distinct and internal to each file. if you put a definition like that in header then every file that includes the header has its own testnum

11478465
getter	setter
i read that a good practice have entities light only getter and setter

octal	hex	octal	decimal
you might be surprised that leading zeroes are allowed in hex and octal literals but not decimal but the c++ spec says quite explicitly

11479307
getter	setter
as for how to actually modify the various parameters of the code you ve just got to include the necessary getter and setter for your various properties and have your text parser call the right methods

11479340
keydown	keyup
the class inputstate is basically a copy of the allegro inputstate with added functionality keydown keyup keypress for example

11479900
post	get
_request gets you get post and cookies

11479918
coalesce	isnull
i ve tried coalesce count ordernumber 0 and isnull count ordernumber 0 but i m pretty sure the grouping is causing that not to work

int	chars
within i4gl you can easily cast the digits into a chars truncate it 1 6 then cast it back to int

11479972
inherited	subclassing
a related problem with inherited is for example if you are modeling the typical student teacher problem and you try making student a subclassing of person and teacher a subclassing of person

11479983
folder	directory
it will give you a list of files and folder in each directory under the starting directory

11479998

updating my answer i mistakenly put related manager on wrong model in your case like andrey said the correct way to get entries from category is

11480005
lambda	first-class-functions
that can be achieved in a lot of ways like lambda functions or first-class-functions or function pointers etc.

11480036

11480054
hide	show
i have created this form with several select menu and a couple of jquery hide and show functions

11480065
inherited	properties
if going the object array route you can store the fill function in the object as a properties yet you will never have a reference without passing it as param or prototypal or any other kind of inherited

11480068
hide	show
use the visible property to show hide them

11480123
gtk	motif
gtk and qt are two of the most common ones these days but there are others such as motif which is older and doesn t look as nice

11480123
kde	gnome
note that the gnome desktop environment is built using gtk and kde is built using qt

11480144
int	chars
there is another reason for using like even if the performance is slower chars values are implicitly converted to int when compared so

11480166
implements	extends
so a b c d extends from s and s implements i

11480210
inherited	subclassing
because it is a class you have to create a subclassing in order to implement a new stream type and you may find that you have to code the subclassing to override all infrastructure that you inherited

children	parent
if you have a deep folder hierarchy you are probably ending up with a recursion issue as parent link to children link to children link to children etc

11480537
width	height
the problem seems to be resolved if you remove the height and width lines from the following

11480537
google-chrome	firefox
this does not seem to produce any negative effects on firefox or google-chrome either so it should be safe to remove it

11480630
width	height
then by setting a min-height and min-width on body equal to #main_container s height and width respectively no matter how short the window would become the body s dimensions would never be smaller than #main_container - no possible overflow

11480681
racket	plai
i am studying plai now i have already run chapter 3 s code in racket with #lang plai but i am a newbie in racket

11480693
gif	png
if you re worried about the size of the uploaded image and the time it ll consume then restrict the users to specific image formats and specific size for example if you re allowing a user to upload his personal message board avatar only allow really small images or maybe only gif .gif images instead of taking a huge 2mb+ png .png image and resizing it to the desired size say 52x52

11480695
width	height
i have a full browser window as3 flash cs4 parent swf which loads a third-party child swf smaller in height width and positioned appropriately centered

dictionary	map
the 2d array is actually a javascript object which function similar to a dictionary or map in other programming languages

11480791
post	put
there is a heartbeat object which is sent in a post rather than a put because as i see it they are creating a new heartbeat rather than updating an existing heartbeat

11480791
post	get
perform the post followed by a get which to me seems cleaner from a pure rest standpoint

11480791
post	get
have the post return an object which contains the same information that the get would otherwise have done

scrypt	salt
unfortunately a sha-256 still doesn t beat bcrypt or scrypt they implement key stretching salt and a scalable work factor to help as hardware improves

11481221
innodb	myisam
if you store innodb database engine you lose fulltext type indexing that the default myisam supports so you need to determine your database engine

11481249
range	minimum
so k is a scaled version of y that s in the range 0 to 1 - that is the minimum value will map to 0 and the maximum value will map to 1

opensuse	linux
for opensuse i have created a wrapper package called wixwine which gives you the candle and light commands from the windows installer xml wix toolset ready to use on linux

11481493
division	multiplication
division is generally on the order of 10x slower than multiplication on most processor families

11481493
factors	matrix	division	multiplication
the place where it makes most sense to replace division with multiplication by the reciprocal is when you re dividing a vector by a constant factors vector normalization scaling matrix pivoting

11481493
division	multiplication
most likely the compiler optimizer will recognize cases where it makes sense to substitute multiplication for division anyways

11481505
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what are some tool to help uncover why for instance firefox is rendering a page differently than google-chrome ie and safari

using a set of radio button or checkbox if several choices are to be allowed instead of a select element you can organize and style them like any other content with indentation and bolding

11481615
min	max
under test 1 it s decided that the blue pane requires proportionally more space then green and yellow blue max height 32767 green yellow max height 100 hence it squishes them down green yellows min heights are 10 pixels

11481615
min	max
under test 2 it s decided that the blue pane should receive the most amount of size as it s max size is 32767 but s min and pref sizes are 10 but it s also found that the green and yellow panes can not be smaller then 100 pixels so it allocates the remaining space over to blue which is about 100 pixels in this case

11481615
min	max
basically the difference between using only the min or only the max is coming down to the default size of these sizes min max pref

11481615
min	max
when you re using only the min the total combined max height is 98301 each components max been 32767

11481615
min	max
when i only used the min size the green and yellow where actually been allocated 200 pixels - this came down to the max size value

11481615
min	max
the docs actually say that the layout managers may ignore one or more of these max min pref values as they are simply a guide line

11481620
queue	fifo
a queue is normally a fifo 1 container while a stack is lifo 2

11481620
queue	fifo
it takes advantage of the fact that a queue is fifo and stack lifo by copying the data queue to stack then stack to queue and finally queue to stack again we have effectively reversed the order of elements in a way that will match your description

11481636

min	max
the min max functions reorder the values in the columns

11481998
put	get
php get put request body

11481998
put	get
i think the way it reads put request is like reading a file or a stream if there is a way to set the reader to the start again probably could get that data

11482019
queue	fifo
well sidestepping your question somewhat the classic purely functional implementation of a fifo queue is as a pair of lists one for the front and one for the back. you enqueue elements by adding them as the head of the back list and dequeue by taking the head of the front list

11482028

min	max
to do 2 i would first look for vertical rectangles find the maximal possible width for each consecutive min_y max_y and therefore the area iteratively in o 1 per row just by looking at the min max of 1 s in that row of the connected component

11482265
width	height
the total running time is o mxn for bfs then o width 2 + height 2 for each connected componenet for a total of o mxn + m 2 + n 2

11482403
trie	tree
a simple solution would be to pre - compute the words and build a trie tree having digits in the nodes and each leaf node would have a link to a linked list array or some other data structure of strings that can be formed using those digits

11482403
trie	tree
note since the number of digits 10 only the size of the trie tree would be limited

11482403
trie	tree
a ternary search tree tst could also be used in place of the trie tree but here but since there are only 10 digits there would not be much significant advantages of using a tst i guess

11482447
oncreate	recreate
each time activity recreate after state change oncreate additionaly adds a new tab so

11482477

put	get
also the submitvalue is a place to put a value so to get the behavior that you are seeking you should set the submitvalue to something like newcategoryclick and then define an eventhandler child under the applicationlayout that checks to see if the submittedvalue newcategoryclick then run your ssjs code that you have defined

11483682
for-loop	arrays
an arrays of numbers that follow a simple pattern in this case arrays element index plus 1 is kind of pointless when you can achieve the same thing with a standard for-loop

now width and height are properties of the object stored in the .data size which can retrieved with

11483733
width	height
you are setting attributes in your plugin but at that point you can just store the original width and height in the data object like this

11483733
width	height
this works but you could just get the saved width and height by calling it like this

prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
calling pdo prepare and pdostatement execute for statements that will be issued multiple times with different parameter values optimizes the performance of your application by allowing the driver to negotiate client and or server side caching of the query plan and meta information and helps to prevent sql injection attacks by eliminating the need to manually quote the parameters

11484669
prepare	execute
so you only call prepare once and call execute inside your loop

11484682

11485067
equals	gethashcode
please note that your gethashcode must go hand in hand with your equals method

11485067
equals	gethashcode
and if you can just use reference equality when you d never have two different instances of your class that can be equals then you can safely use equals and gethashcode that are inherited from object

11485068

11485417
client-side	server-side
i know you re looking for the php solution to find the browser but since the problems you are most likely to encounter with a specific browser are client-side there should be no need to detect it from the server-side

on unix-like systems these mechanisms are pipe fifo message queue and shared memory

11485444
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however it is only supported in the later versions of firefox safari and google-chrome and it probably won t be in the css specification until css4

11485454

so short answer is probably not what you want but if you get your head down and create the base cmakelists.txt it will be done before you research this converter much further

11485465
superclass	subclassing
if superclass method is any derived data type while over ridding in the subclassing return type can be same derived data type or subclassing derived data type

11485529

you cant use a form regardless of post get and expect the parameters to output like a url eg

11485592
post	get
tho personally i would scrap the get for the fancy url and just use post

11485601
for-loop	arrays
instead of using foreach you could just use a regular for-loop with an incremented variable i used to grab each at index i of the arrays

11485609
return-value-optimization	nrvo
moreover the c++03 and later versions of the language specification take it one step further they explicitly permit the compilers to perform the named return-value-optimization nrvo which actually eliminates a named non-temporary object

11485645
accelerometer	gyroscope
core motion uses a sensor fusion algorithm to combine the outputs of the gyroscope the accelerometer and the magnetometer into a cmdevicemotion

when you click the toggle button twice the fadeout fadein sequence is run

11485891
qgraphicsview	qmainwindow	qgraphicsview	qimage	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsscene	qimage
my way of showing this qimage is that the qmainwindow contains a qgraphicsview object and i created a qgraphicsscene and set that scene on my mainwindow graphicsview

11485907
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
here is an example of how to use a qtableview and a set of qlistview objects with a single qstandarditemmodel

this provides you a way to setup a javascript for-loop to iterate over the members of the arrays

11485967
uploadify	plupload
i came across a few options like using plupload or jquery file upload or using uploadify

11485968

my situation i have two classes class1 and class2 that both extends the abstract class with methods implements in each one

11486046
inline	inlining
the compiler only inline functions when it determines that inlining is safe and saves space

11486083
min	max
if rowid is going to be the same for each one you could order by max rowid or min rowid or add rowid to the group by statement

11486121
httpconnection	downloading
if the image manipulation and presentation is not required then you could use httpconnection to simply downloading the file

11486139
google-chrome	firefox
this happens only in google-chrome with firefox it s not possible to edit the iframe

11486150
post	put
don t have enough reputation to post a comment so i ll put this in an answer.

classic use us listview gridview

11486257
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my button looks normal in firefox but in google-chrome and safari it looks thin

11486267
google-chrome	firefox
note this works in firefox and google-chrome since the returned string format is the same

11486331
width	height
you can set a height css property to make sure both buttons are the same height and set an appropriate width too

11486459
google-chrome	firefox
see below for what happened in firefox and google-chrome s console

11486466
hide	show
depending to the table width i want to show either the first 5 or 10 data columns and hide the rest

11486466
hide	show
then i was able to use the gt selector to show the first five data columns and hide the rest while keeping the first and last two icon columns visible

11486472
mouse	keyboard
you can use windows hooks which can be used to hook to the keyboard and mouse events outside your form

11486495
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome if i try to modify it it won t change.

11486526
post	put
note - i tried each of those separately - i just put them together in this post to show options i ve already tried

11486546
google-chrome	firefox
the only way that seems to work in ie 9 firefox 12 and google-chrome 20.0 is the following

11486579
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc

11486596
post	get
the graph api doesn t work and i get error code 100 when post id likes with no parameters like the documentation says

11486637
memset	malloc	memset	calloc	calloc	malloc
if you want to just fill in zeros use memset after malloc or just use calloc

11486637
strcpy	strncpy
if you want your string to be automatically terminated with a null use strcpy strncpy to copy data into it

11486681
cpu	processors
however high network traffic not necessarily implies low performance since the nic has its own processors and does not makes the cpu stall

11486722
uilabel	nsstring
after your xib instantiated an uilabel and you get its reference using the iboutlet keyword you are then trying to use the uilabel pointer to point to a space in memory allocated and instantiated for a nsstring that s why you are having this problem

11486722
uilabel	nsstring
you simply want the uilabel to display the nsstring you just created and for that you should use the uilabel s text property

11486728
post	get
if this doesnt answer your question please post what you have tried ie give us some code to work with and you ll probably get a more informed answer

11486739
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you are calling findviewbyid from main.xml you first need to setcontentview as main.xml

11486760
queue	fifo
for your problem i suggest you use simpler ipc mechanisms like pipe fifo message queue

11486792
prepare	execute
now what i would suggest you do for improvement is to split your db access into three phases prepare bind execute

11486792
prepare	execute
for more info search google for sql prepare bind execute for your target db

11486911
width	height
last just set the margin-top and margin-left negative of the modal window based on it s height and width divided by two

11486916
integer	unsigned
the second set of 4 bytes in the initial header is basically the total file length - 8 bytes and is stored as a 32-bit unsigned integer in little endian byte order

11486940
hash	md5
what i do is as part of the build process rename all the statically referenced files to something involving their md5 hash

11486942
maven	pom.xml
while the properties files were being copied to the target directory and showed up as if they were included in the build the maven pom.xml file was set to explicitly exclude properties files from the built artifact

11486954
uiview	calayer
i assume the allocation is done right before my code is called and is due to an incorrect uiview or calayer size somewhere

11486997
iboutlet	ibaction
as far as what can be connected the keyword iboutlet marks properties or variables and ibaction marks action methods

11487020
servicecontract	servicebehavior
from servicecontract vs servicebehavior

11487020
servicecontract	servicebehavior
servicecontract affect the wsdl emitted but servicebehavior will not

11487041
carrierwave	paperclip
i not find any solution with the paperclip but i ended up using the carrierwave and it worked what i needed

11487044
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
if you allocate your primitive using malloc or calloc you must use free at the end i don t know why you d want to use primitives like this though

11487044
free	malloc
same rules are followed when you add primitive fields to your objects if you use malloc in the init then you must use free in dealloc

11487082
put	get
to get the edittext value put this inside the displayedittext

11487096
firefox	safari
firefox supports .ogg but safari and ie do not

11487103
moq	fakeiteasy
my suggestion would be to pick a feature and start unit testing it and introduce a mock library such as moq or fakeiteasy

11487131
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
finally border is included into the width percentage to workaround this you can use css3 and box-sizing border-box

11487134
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
if not try adding box-sizing border-box to make the borders get included in the width

11487167
pop-up	dialog
i have a ruby-on-rails web application that has a simple pop-up modal dialog

11487175
udp	tcp
you need to allow traffic from and to port udp tcp 53 dns

11487216
google-chrome	firefox
the pages are working in google-chrome and firefox however ie8 9 instantly throw a permission denied error even before making the request

11487298
for-loop	loops
first i don t use the for each loops but the more traditional for-loop

11487376
rss	feed
i have the following rss feed

11487376
rss	feed
this is how i am reading the rss feed

11487378
ienumerable	ilist
if i understand your question correctly you need to replace your ienumerable with ilist and then use the following approach

11487386
g++	gcc
perl scripts programs usually are not compiled into binary file - they are of course compiled but uhm on the fly - that s why usr bin perl is called rather interpreter than compiler like gcc or g++

11487390
pop-up	dialog
it is not possible to catch this exception because it pop-up a system dialog

11487395
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better

11487427
google-chrome	firefox
screenshot shows google-chrome on the left firefox internet explorer on the right.

11487427
google-chrome	firefox
screenshot shows google-chrome on the right firefox internet explorer on the left

11487463
google-chrome	firefox
now that might work on google-chrome and firefox but in ie that will probably not work and more over it probably won t tell you where or why it s not working

11487463
ready	each
you wrapped your jquery call in the document ready handler as you should but then you wrapped your code within another ready handler for each element..

11487469
children	parent
a is the parent table b is children table

11487494
ceil	floor
the rounding functions ceil floor and round work fine and return inf if the value is too big

11487494
pow	sqrt
the same goes for the degrees log log10 pow sqrt fabs hypot and radians functions

11487506
ocaml	sml
curiously no ml-family language ocaml f# sml defines replace or replaceat in the standard list library

11487543
antivirus	norton
the only thing i can think of is i have symantec norton 360 installed but i have disabled the firewall antivirus and antispam and made no difference

11487544
performselector	delegation
here you can use delegation to performselector on it

11487544
mouseup	mousedown
after that you can implement mouseup or mousedown method of nstextfield subclass

11487577
width	height
for the scale to be correct the width and height need to be at a 4 3 ratio

11487577
width	height
in testing height the height of the form is 400 so the width of the new size should be 133

11487589
int	double
on the other hand 4d 3 will work and results in a double 1.333_ because now it is double int - double double by promotion - double using the appropriate floating point division

11487602
rss	feed
you should be able to use xmlserializer to deserialize the rss feed directly without manual mapping

11487626
dictionary	map
so say you get a dictionary where all the keys map to model attributes and they represent the values you d want to update you could do this

11487669
google-chrome	firefox
this is possible in google-chrome and firefox without having to reload the page

11487683
int	double
basically i m trying to make double work with int and maybe i m missing something obvious but with the return highvalue code i m getting an error that says possible loss of precision required int found double

11487691
int	double
you are returning the highest value a double instead of the highest index an int

11487704
post	get
i tried using some example xsl shared in other post but never managed to get it to work

11487727
int	double
as for the compiler warning it means that when you try to implicitly cast a double into an int you may loose some of the information you had

11487739
int	double
to perform an int division simply ensure that neither operand is a float double

11487783
subtract	add
your problem is that you have to deal with origins too so you ll have to subtract the vector o from p than apply m add q and then o again

11487788
width	height
first you need two variables to store your width and height

11487793
folder	directory
copy the war folder to a temporary directory

11487796
128bit	64bit
so you can store the network address as a integer of 64bit the first 64bit of the 128bit address

11487806
division	modulo
in order to balance integer division you need to have the modulo in order to handle the remainder

11487808
ubuntu	linux
the program compiles without errors or warning but produces a segmentation fault when executed on ubuntu linux

11487944
children	parent
i need to group these into sub trees that consist of parent and their immediate children

11487965
cout	ofstream
depending on your os system and libraries writing to an ofstream directly could increase performance further if it uses a different buffering scheme compared to cout but it might have no effect whatsoever

since you re using scanf to convert the input to an int the value stored in a no longer represents a chars

in this case you ll probably want to use fgets to read the user input then use strtol to convert the value to a signed long integer and perform the validation at the same time

11489020

javascript function here so i don t know what it contains but if it doesn t already do so i d include code to submit the form via that javascript function submission the form once validation has been successful or returning some sort of human readable error if validation fails - that combined with using button instead of submit should solve your problem

submit	submission
some browsers will process events handlers such as onclick prior to submission forms via the submit input type

11489969
maven	pom.xml
because maven always runs things in the working directory of the pom.xml unless you configure it differently which i think you can do in the surefire plugin which is what runs test cases

11491900
vcard	vcalendar
i want to use it to create qr codes like website url youtube video google maps location telephone number skype call sms message email address email message contact details vcard event vcalendar tlephone number

11491908
post	get
find a way to get a list of all the users that shared a post i tried fql as well

11491936

i have tested this in google-chrome and firefox latest versions

11492143
maven	pom.xml
i have added following dependency into maven s pom.xml file

11492167
post	put	post	get	put	get
the complexity lies on the trade-offs between rpc procedural model of traditional webservices and the resource model which fits better when using http requests verbs get post put and delete on uri s complemented with some headers and a body

11492175
hide	show
i found it is very simple to achieve the hide and show uitabbar using the following method

11492205

11492367
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome and firefox

11492377
google-chrome	firefox
i canÃ¢ t tell why you get different results on firefox than on google-chrome unless you have left fonts to their defaults and the browsers use different defaults

11492384
hide	show
this means that the elements with the complexonly class only show when the togglebutton is not in the simple-state they hide in simple state

11492415
int	double
in numerical expressions using different data types unless specified the default choices would be int and double

11492415
int	double
expression 90.0-32 would be resulting a double since 32 is an int

11492415
int	double
double divided_by_any int long float double would result a double

11492461
jms	jta
note that database changes will roll back as well with this approach if you are using jta and not local jms transactions

11492503
min	max
the required common ancestor of start1 end1 and start2 end2 is the common ancestor of nodes with indices min start1 start2 and max end1 end2

11492521
hash	salt
the only problem i m having now is how to store the passwords on the database in a secure salt hash preferably so they can be used with the digest request and the password at no point is in an nonhashed format except on the clients browser for a few seconds

11492538
put	get
the itemgroupcontroller then has get delete and put methods

11492541
hash	salt
so on the server you just need to store hash password + salt and salt

11492851
profiling	instrumentation
the use of instrumentation time profiling has revealed that the setting of uitextfield s text property is very expensive in my app and so i would like to somehow optimise this

11492851
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the copy modifier means that the nsmutablestring that i set to the text is copied as an immutable nsstring and then set - meaning that i cannot actually set a mutable string for a uitextfield

onresume	onpause
i also checked my onpause and onresume methods they should not need a very long time

11493224
webkit	gecko
it can be reproduced by running this simple test case on gecko browsers run on webkit for a reference

11493236
octal	decimal
the parseint function is useful but it probably should be called with 10 as its second argument to avoid interpreting numbers that begin with zero as octal constants instead of decimal

11493254
rsa	aes
i am not sure about the bit sizes of the keys to use either 256 bit aes and 1024 bit rsa

11493278
interpolation	splines
it s absolutely fine if it is simplified or approximated as long as it allows me to calculate the y coordinate of the interpolation points without using any library functions for lines or splines

11493279
int	double
or do some browsers do the flash thing and cast to floats double to do the math before casting back to int

11493311
post	put
while it s a valid requirement for a transaction it seems to break the rest requirements to use put to create post to update and delete to delete

in this applet the user will be asked to insert the values for abcd and the min and max values for the x axes

11493393
interpolation	splines
alternatively you can interpolation using splines in a non parametric way that does not involve control points

11493393
interpolation	splines
using splines will prevent you getting the potential wild oscillations that you can get using basic high degree polynomial interpolation

the following .net 4.0 code functions perfectly in ie9 google-chrome 20 and opera 12 but fails miserably in firefox 13

11493806
apache	nginx
note if you are using alternative http servers like nginx you must search down all of the .htaccess files created in magento s directory tree and recreate all the .htaccess functions used by magento in your nginx setups so you have the same file directory protections as a standard apache dso install

11493812
qgraphicsview	qwidget
but if you have specific need to forward the content size of the view up to a normal qwidget scroll then what you would need to do is make your qgraphicsview always resize itself when the contents of the scene change

11494150
width	height
it means that there is no guarantee that width and height values will be visible from your background thread after they were set from ui thread

11494150
width	height
to fix it you need to publish width and height values safely using volatile modifier or synchronized block or atomicinteger

11494150
width	height
volatile modifier guarantees that any changes in width and height variables made from ui thread will be seen immediately in background thread and this background thread will receive most recent values

11494158

if you need to keep an state that will be use only by the current thread request you can add some state to a stateless service using threadlocal variables or more easily using stateful session beans

11494468
allocator	stl
tcmalloc docs claim that it does some sort of magic to make stl containers use its allocator instead of the default one but i cannot concur as i m not a heavy user of both tcmalloc and c++

11494532
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately there seems to be a difference in the way google-chrome and firefox handle middle clicks

onclick	onmousedown
however in chrome the middle click shows up in onmousedown and onclick but the link is only opened after the onclick

11494738
width	margin
you were on the right track all you have to do is subtract that fixed containers width from your fluid container with a left margin

11494806
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the same code tests fine and works as expected in firefox 10 ie 8 google-chrome safari etc.

11494816
lisp	scheme
i suggest you to write an interpreter of scheme lisp because you do not have to cope with parsing and python works exactly the same as these

11494822

in the first form you should explicitly close stdin stdout and stderr

11494841
octal	binary
these are not binary numbers but octal base 8

use a transparency color for your background-color using an rgba color value

11494993
mouse	keyboard
i really think you need an external bluetooth keyboard and mouse to be more productive

11494993
screens	tablet
also a tablet might be more suited since it runs apps in tablet layout mode versus a phone layout with everything being too large on a bigger screens

11495002
for-loop	loops
the code replaces the for-loop with a timer that calls the body of loops

11495044

scaling the parent affects all children - which is a good thing because it makes modifying large groups of display objects a whole lot easier

11495518
opencv	emgucv
that this doesn t occur in the runworkercompleted event handler is quite remarkable this must be buried inside the opencv or emgucv plumbing in a non-obvious way

11495553
exponent	modulo
i am building a public key asn.1 der from a modulo and exponent using this-

11495553

i think perhaps you should try a .cer file or generate an rsa key with openssl and use the modulo and exponent with cryptoutil

11495582
post	get
i know that i need to use post but i do not know how to get it to actually post

11495584

multiplying	multiplication
i have written programs in c++ python and java for matrix multiplication and tested their speed for multiplying two 2000 x 2000 matrices see post

11495750
children	parent
i concur with weltraumpirat that children scaling with parent is a correct behavior

11495750
children	parent
if you cannot get around with moving them out of the parent you may consider the following pseudo code which would undo the scaling the parent impact on children

11495767
factors	matrix
depending on the architecture it may be larger or smaller - there are architectures where the constant factors for strassen are so large that it s basically always worse than a simpler n 3 implementation for sensible matrix sizes

11495771

onpause - and nothing else after the screen is locked - then onresume after unlock - and no surface callbacks after then

11495864
inherited	subclassing
this helps with query load time hibernate optimizes out objects subclassing inherited with lazy loading turned on

11495878
super	extends
recall the pecs rule -- producer extends consumer super

11495878
comparator	comparable
well the comparable is a consumer and not a producer because you pass an argument of type t into its comparator method consume but no methods needs to return type t produce

11495891
mousemove	mousedown
you could set the mousemove function to display what you want then on mousedown it can navigate to the selected series data range

11495941
for-loop	arrays
key my_array returns null if the read pointer is moved past the end of the arrays which is what ends the for-loop and makes the statement after the for-loop return true if all keys were integer

11495941
for-loop	loops
if not loops ends prematurely because a key is of type string and the statement after the for-loop will return false

11495955
hide	show
some time need to identify whether elements are hide or show

11495976
width	height
you can scale them in the browser using width and height attributes or just one will maintain aspect ratio however this is bad for many reasons including bandwidth page performance and image quality

11495997
put	get
it is simple to put your app together with the designer simple to get your app to terminate simple to avoid a ghost icon in the tray simple to create a context menu simple to add popups if you ever need them

superclass	subclassing
the type field in the subclassing shadows the type field in the superclass

11496261
superclass	subclassing
if you simply remove the field in the subclassing the assignment there will populate the superclass field and your code will likely work as you expect

11496312
post	get
i was never able to get the following code to work inside my original code it would always show up as array or null i m guessing i just did not know the proper way to write it in i was able to get it to show the category if i created a single post and just wanted to show the category with nothing else

11496324

it can also do chunking to more efficiently deal with large csv-files so you can pass the chunks to parallel resque workers or mass-create records with mongoid or mongomapper

11496354
integer	unsigned
but the constructor expects an unsigned integer

11496362
ggplot2	lattice

11498287
getter	setter
so i have a question on setter and getter methods and how useful they are or aren t

11498287
getter	setter
it has come to my attention however that it s better practice to make the variables in the account class private and then use setter and getter methods

11498289
button	checkbox
how to insert the value of radio button and checkbox together into 1 row database..for example the table contains name of menu and the size of the food

11498289
button	checkbox
the database table contains food and price..so when we choose which menu we want with checkbox and choose the size of our food use radio button the value of checkbox and radio button will store in 1 row database..

11498295
countif	named
i have named several ranges in excel and would like to use them in a formula countif

11498333
getter	setter
it is better to follow a consistent style so that s why we always use getter setter - so code this like may be executed if needed

11498337
pull	push
i have a pet project on bitbucket and so far i was able to pull and push from two different networks home and office

11498352
filtering	grouping	sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
recalculation means sorting filtering grouping and all other operations except repainting

11498355
getter	setter
as a matter of fact it doesn t prevent and there s no difference until you change access modifiers for getter setter methods or add additional logic into them

11498355
getter	setter
using getter setter are a good practice and used in several approaches like pojos and javabeans but if you are not going to add custom logic into getter setter and are not going to use these approaches you will be satisfied of using direct access to the fields

11498355
getter	setter
using getter setter you can provide computed at the runtime fields that do not exists persistently in the object

11498356
getter	setter
the advantage of using setter ans getter is that you can include rules for lazy initialization validation etc

11498360
button	checkbox
how to insert the value of radio button and checkbox together into 1 row database..for example the table contains name of menu and the size of the food

11498360
button	checkbox
the database table contains food and price..so when we choose which menu we want with checkbox the value of checkbox will store in food database s table and choose the size of our food use radio button the value of radiobutton will store in price database s table

11498361
getter	setter
you can always develop an application without using getter and setter methods.as you have explained.but using getter and setter is better practice because access modifiers private public gives you encapsulation which is oops feature

11498383
getter	setter
this is called encapsulation when you are declaring some private instance variables and declaring public getter and setter method to access and change the instance variables value

11498383
getter	setter
if you are using these getter and setter methods to access set instance variables then it grantees that your program would not fail if developer changes the instance variable names

11498383
getter	setter
for example in current version you are using name address balance instance variables and are accessing them without getter and setter methods like myaccount.setname blah blah

11498383
getter	setter
but what if next version developer changes instance variable name from name to username in that case user program will break but if you are using getter and setter it would not break as developer would not change getter and setter method name according to oops fundamentals

11498446
moq	justmock	moq	typemock	nunit	moq	nunit	justmock	nunit	typemock	justmock	typemock
i ve looked at ninject structuremap moq typemock justmock nunit xunit etc.

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are just derived from uiviewcontroller

11498502
implements	extends
the only cases where you need to #include an .h from an .h is when you actually extends a class or implements a protocol

11498503
min	max	range	min	range	max
both axes may show different scales range min - max like temperature from 0 to 100 degree kelvin pressure from 300 to 900 kpa and accordingly the series will be plotted

i want when user hover it or mouseenter then next div should display and when user mouseout the visible div should fadeout

11498552
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are nothing but subclasses of uiviewcontroller

thin will still work but you may want to consider switching over to unicorn

11498595
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade my versioning of ruby i had to reinstall my gems

11498600
fadein	fadeout
this is the code you should use setting a callback function on the fadein to queue the fadeout

11498610
std	ostream	cout	ofstream
since std ofstream inherits from the same type as std cout is an instance of std ostream their interfaces are the same some methods are added to the file-handling stream but other than that they are interchangeable

11498610
std	ostream
to make sure you use the same implementation no matter if you are writing to a file or standard-output you could wrap the code in a function making it accept a reference to std ostream as in the below snippet

11498631
mongodb	bson
i know i am calculating the size of python dictionaries not bson documents and mongodb takes in bson documents but that cant turn 500kb into 16+ mb

11498652
free	malloc
now in your module you need to manage allocate and free memory chunks from this pool and not bother with malloc

11498718
post	get
it sounds like you need a http server and differentiate between http get for downloading files to the client and post to upload files to the server instead of differentiating the types with pipelines

11498756
treemap	treeset
take for example treeset or treemap in java which is a red black tree

11498851
google-chrome	firefox
see the rules for cascading in particular the section on specificity make sure your css is valid and use the tools provided by browsers google-chrome developer tools the firebug extension for firefox etc to see which rules are being applied to the elements you care about in which order

11498856
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think the embedding you re referring to is the embed in menu item which only allows for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

11498872
getter	setter
secondly backbone s model mutation observation is based on events model wrappers and use of artificial getter and setter

11498872
getter	setter
not only that this can be very inefficient due to lack of event coalescence there might be a workaround for this in latest backbone versions but the use of artificial getter and setter also interferes with the jit compiler in your browser

11498872
ember.js	backbone.js
backbone.js + ember.js

11498904
getter	setter
create public getter and setter to access those instance variable

11498904
getter	setter
getter and setter helps validating the input to the instance variable

11499056
mdpi	hdpi
you could well have those images as only mdpi and supply an hdpi version so that it atleast has a higher resolution image for hdpi and xdpi devices

11499161
uploadify	swfupload
but it s still a solid way of doing it uploadify or swfupload

11499161
youtube	vimeo
i think you should look how other companies are doing it like web picasa not really good example as most of files are less than 5mo but yousendit is a solid actor i think they re using flash but should check as well as youtube vimeo dailymotion video actors

11499173
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you re talking about embed as in interface builder yes as of ios 5 interface builder only gracefully designs user interfaces for three view controller containers uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller and uisplitviewcontroller

11499193
cos	sin
here speed_x and speed_y are sin direction and cos direction possibly swapped or with some coefficients

11499232
fadein	fadeout
iam trying to implement simple jquery fadein fadeout to my website

11499274
mdpi	hdpi
also it always helps to fire up the appropriate simulator middle size with mdpi smallest size with ldpi and biggest size with hdpi depending on what devices you are planning to support and try your layouts out

11499317
hide	show
you can add multiple view on one screen and do hide show to display multiple screens

11499359
implements	extends
though it might be better idea to create a custom basemodel that will extends the backbone.model and implements your custom logic so that if backbone gets updated etc

11499362
devise	cancan
i have setup devise and cancan only users of group admin can access rails_admin

octree	quadtree
however i can not fathom how an octree or quadtree could be used to generate a cube type world

11504771
quad	uniform
1 you use the quad oct tree to subdivide a set cube 10x10x10 and subdivide it until at-least one leaf is uniform

11504785
int	double
i created this class because the stack will be able to store strings functions pointers to functions double and int

11504785
int	double
the problem is when i push an int or double into the stack and then pop it and get the pointer to the data i m debugging it by printing out it s value therefore i basically have this

11504785
int	double
i don t know what might be wrong maybe it s the way i assign __p the pointer returned by get these are the __data constructors for int and double
