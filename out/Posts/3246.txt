hash	salt
if you want 4bn hash for every password use 4 bytes of salt

3360252
int	double
double and float can be divided by int zero without an exception at both compilation and run time

3360253
hash	salt
a salt is just applying some mutation to your raw password before applying a hash or encryption i guess so that a rainbow table attack is more difficult

perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system

3360831
ireport	subreports
i m working with ireport 3.5.0 and i m using a subreports inside my main report

3360831
ireport	subreports
i don t want to give the absolute path for the subreports expression but for example if i just give bpsubreport.jasper as the subreports expression because sub and main are in the same directory then ireport can find bpsubreport.jasper and compile the main report into bpreport.jasper but my java gwt application can t

3360968
width	height
i really need to have width and height in the output because it will be used as the input to other parser

3360983
gridview	rowdatabound
the best approach would be to use gridview s rowdatabound event

3361012

void parser nsxmlparser parser foundcharacters nsstring string

3361056
margin	height
i m not sure what you re trying to do here but if you want the listbox to reduce it height when the window s height is decreased then you have to add margin to the border so it s like

3361063

but to have the valid height width you have to read the images use pil probably not worth the effort

so unless you put the driver jar into the bootclasspath or find a way to modify how jrunscript and ant set the system classloader of the script environment the only way to get this to work seems to be to skip drivermanager entirely

3361194
getter	setter
in general the reason why you get unable to bind to property foo on a class is because you are either missing a getter or setter for foo

3361233
jar	war

3361307
ubuntu	linux
- this is done on linux 64bit ubuntu

3361353
integer	unsigned

loops	if-statement
i have myself faced even worse problem recently - i took over code where main class was about 6000 lines long with very long methods nested loops and if-statement etc

3361366
width	height
you could use jquery s width and height functions

3361382
put	get
it s good practise to never put these in so that you don t get whitespace at the end of your while and then you can t use header and get this classic headers already sent error

3361389
width	height
border 0 width 300px height 300px or url

so i searched the web to find if c++ is still used in writing nowadays applications and to my surprise firefox google-chrome notepad++ and many other gui applications on sourceforge.net are written in c++ in contradiction with my instructor s advice

3361477
superclass	subclassing
afaik the only close thing is using icriteria s expression.sql where you query the superclass but inject subclassing specific fragments with pure sql

3361477
superclass	subclassing
the other way would be using an isqlquery which at least allows the select part to be domain specific and using .addentity so you can still select your managed superclass and the where part contains subclassing specific fragments

3361482
websphere	ibm
there are also many ibm materials about websphere mq

3361496
accessor	properties
does not make use of your synthesized properties accessor

3361496

in order to make use of your properties accessor you need to add self

3361502
javassist	cglib
then - you can make a proxy using cglib or javassist around the object and whenever a method is invoked report the invocation

3361503
justmock	typemock
although this doesn t help in terms of design patterns if you want to increase testing now you could always use something like typemock isolator or telerik justmock which allow you to mock out static classes while you convert your code away from the current design

3361517
awt	swing
there are some native to java gui libraries awt swing but they are slow and don t provide interface native to platform it runs on

3361520

that way you simply replace any xml sax parser used with tagsoup and the xpath 2.0 or xslt 2.0 or xquery 1.0 implementation works as usual

3361812
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
if this is a soap enabled web service you need to first generate a client proxy by pointing svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe if you are using .net 2.0 to the wsdl that is exposed by the web service

3361833
folder	directory
hi to retrieve files from ftp server i got another very powerful library which i like to share with all of you.the name of that library is edtftpj.jar which is open source and we can easily upload and download files we can list files and folder from particular directory of remote server.i found it very powerful

execute this in your oncreate just before setcontentview

3362113
nhibernate	queryover
sadly i am using the spatial extensions for nhibernate which haven t been upgraded to support queryover or linq yet

3362223
post	get
if you want to check for either post or get method you can use the global variable

3362259
hash	salt
this allows the authentication logic to be abstracted away and not handled in code for example if you want to change to using hash salt etc

3362277
int	double
based on comments i should add that you might need to do some extra work to get this to compile since v is an array of double while bit_generator returns int

3362316
hide	show
you should probably append the overlay and container just once when initialized then just show hide append content when the user activates the modal

3362333
width	height
you have to use adobe media encoder to compress the video as flv or mp4 it should make your video below 2 mb based on your dimension of video pls mention your video dimension width and height of the video

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
of course this works a treat in firefox and safari and opera

3362428
children	parent
we have parent and need children

3362428
children	parent
if we re to do wide operations such as numpy is designed for we d best make them count - and thus the only operation we care about is building a list of children per parent

3362440
pascal	delphi
i think that the best tool is morfik ide very close to delphi ans use pascal object

3362474
google-chrome	firefox
without those google-chrome and firefox were not making successful requests.

3362477
put	get
you get a brand new site-package where you can put your plugins with the relevant project modules

3362506
superclass	subclassing
also it would be worth considering an agreement_type attribute or something similar in your superclass table for cases in which you may want to perform agreement type analysis without incurring the hit of a join to the subclassing table s

3362527
google-chrome	firefox
this function works well for firefox but not for ie or google-chrome when the html is broken

3362576

this will override your stylesheet css and would show until jquery did a hide which seems to be the symptoms you re experiencing

3362622
post	get
then you want to use httpurlconnection to do get and post requests to your struts application on the server

3362636
int	double
then you can expect the conversion from int to double to take some time and if so you will see your pauses happening in those instructions a good part of the time

3362641
umask	chmod
the file is created with mode mode as described in chmod 2 and modified by the process umask value see umask 2

3362693
google-chrome	firefox
i ran it on google-chrome ie and firefox

3362693

at this nothing different happens in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it breaks again into the debugger this time with this line highlighted in yellow and it reports that the identifier jquery is not defined

3362703
width	height
remember the is for loading the image before finding its width and height

categories won t be set because the ienumerable is populated only in your get and not your post which is fair enough as you aren t posting the whole list

3362761
coldbox	model-glue

i m generating some rss feed from my drupal site

3362910
width	height
in android a view is assigned width and height only when its rendering is complete

3362910
width	height
solution to your problem could be that you set some min height of list item so that you have atleast something to work with instead of hard coding height and width

3362980
stdout	stderr
how about replacing the make command with a make function that swaps the stdout and stderr streams

3363010
multiplying	multiplication
this is because once you have the decomposed matrices you can optimize the multiplication algorithm heavily no sense multiplying rows and columns for the zero elements

3363042
soappy	suds
in the end i settled on using suds for python web clients after experimenting with it and soappy and zsi

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the other thing to remember is that it s almost impossible to achieve pixel parity across ie6 7 8 firefox safari google-chrome opera so if some things don t look quite right in a browser that s nearly ten years old you don t always need to worry about it

3363403
post	get
if i do just json i get 500 internal server error if i do a post i get 403 forbidden error

3363468

check out the jstorage plugin here works on almost all engines that matter trident gecko webkit etc

3363484

3363596
lithium	yii	cakephp	yii	cakephp	lithium	symfony	lithium
in your case i can advice you to use frameworks like symfony cakephp lithium zend framework yii or whatever

3363630
children	parent
this is because the z-order only applies when the parent panel repaints all its children

3363658
stdout	stderr
one idea i had was that the job was blocking on stdout or stderr so i redirected both to null

3363659
post	get
when i post the same with ie7 8 i get the values as an array array 0 11_31_2 but in firefox i get it as 11_31_2

3363673
implements	extends
the set interface extends collection so all sets are required to implements the collection methods

3363692
coldbox	model-glue
since 2003 i ve used mach ii coldbox fusebox and model-glue for various projects

3363692
coldbox	model-glue
in any case if you stick with the major players coldbox cfwheels mach ii or model-glue i think you ll be pleasantly surprised at what cf can offer you

3363756
post	get
having said that since you re already in a hole yes you could duplicate all your code into command line and web versions - or you could download wget or curl and schedule these programs to invoke your urls passing the required values via get or post

3363780
post	get
for more info check out ayende s blog post the difference between get load and query by id

csla	.net
we had to do this to bypass the problem where we have a silverlight and a .net library with the same name for csla serialization

3364067
int	double
for example if you have a 32-bit double d whose bit pattern happens to be 01101010 00111100 01101010 01000001 and you write then i will be an int whose bit pattern 01101010 00111100 01101010 01000001 even though that will represent a wildly different numeric value as an int than it did as a double

3364144
google-chrome	firefox
i ask that question to say this i ve found that browsers at least firefox + google-chrome put the port int he host header

3364245
jquery	nyromodal
edit my gridview instance sits inside of a nyromodal jquery pop-up div which is why i need a non-postback solution

3364249

versioning	upgrade
unless there s something like a versioning number in the file that s been changed when you upgrade your delphi versioning i suppose the only thing you can do is scan for 00 bytes in the character data and then have it read in either a ansichar or a widechar versioning of the record based on whether it finds it

3364737
implements	extends
just for reference i m using extends rather than implements in part because the implementation details that i don t want to have to maintain for every derived class which are identical involve using reflection on this

3365100
mouse	joystick
so i have a usb controller that i m using to control the mouse on the screen with the left joystick

3365100
mouse	joystick
but for the purpose of accuracy of the mouse and clicking things on screen i d like it to be more logarithmic so as it s really slow when barely pushing and then the speed increases logarithmically as you move the joystick farther

3365150
telerik	radwindow
i m using the telerik radwindow control in one of my applications

3365240

my computer science ta told me that there is a way to use a bufferedreader along with the objectinputstream to greatly increase performance

3365290

folder	directory
which allows for creating folder off the target directory

3365430
post	get
i get an error when ever i do not upload a photo how can i modify the code so i don t get an error when i don t post anything

3365444
boost	stl
my example was intended to demonstrate the limitations of the stl but has the alternative interpretation of whatever the stl is missing boost has.

3365447
int	chars
i try to print out the int value of this chars in my array which should be 150 but i get -106

3365447

update this solution must work in opera 10.x firefox 3.6.x ie 7 8 x flock 2.x safari 4.x.

3365555
hide	show
show hide columns as appropriate

3365575
children	parent
thanks to the sorting collation the parent end up first since their second key element is and the children end up after that

3365575
children	parent
if you didn t have the child property you could make a reduce function to get all of the parent s children

3365583
put	get
this way if you put multiple widgets on a page you won t get conflicts unless you need to access the methods from elsewhere in the page but in that case you should be registering the widget with some widget framework anyway

3365613
post	get
jquery.ajax and it s equivalents post get etc are invaluable when making ajax calls

3365616
width	height
edit refactored the function so it returns both width and height in an array

3365621
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
at least it works in google-chrome opera and firefox 4.0 beta but not in 3.6

3365632
maven	pom.xml
to ignore test failures and keep maven from stopping you can add this to the section of the pom.xml

the code as it is works just fine in webkit but it isn t working at all in gecko

3365666
rss	feed
i am trying to parse an rss feed that is using the well formed web comment api and having some issues pulling in parts of the xml that contain namespaces

3365680
min	max
so i d like to store the min and max values in a column and search for a number within those values

3365681
getter	setter
your factorybean would have the required getter setter autowiring and injects them into the target object

3365686
rss	feed
on single.php i want to display a list of categories similar to the one using the_category but instead links to archive of these categories i want links to rss feed of these categories

3365807
free	malloc
when you have finished using a portion of menory we should free it.this allows the memory free to be used for some other purposes...like further malloc calls

3365835
svg	vml
you could try transforming the vml to svg on the server before running it through imagemagick

3365841
pop-up	dialog
here is some documentation for pop-up dialog

3365895
getter	setter
the downside is iwithset will always have both getter and setter even if the getter in i is removed

3365997
hide	show
depending on the selected option - if it s value is 3 - i want the div with the class the same as the label to show - then if i select option with value 4 - all other divs where class names would be populated from all options of this select element should hide and only selected show

3366011
bash	zsh
initially taken from hub which used type -t instead of which though and which failed for both zsh and bash for me

3366025
onclick	onchange
you want to use the onchange event not the onclick event

3366028
superclass	subclassing
also make sure when you subclassing your widgets you properly override event methods resizeevent ... hand off parameters to a superclass when appropriate

3366130

i also tried put instead of get but still got missing template update.erb

3366168
google-chrome	firefox
i get the response into the browser but then google-chrome says syntaxerror unexpected token and firefox says invalid label

3366270
hide	show
there are many questions related to how to programatically show hide the soft keyboard

3366278
short	base
if this is just a relatively short one-off project and you want to reduce the risk then go for 3.x and reap the benefits of the mature code base and lots of documentation

3366297
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
...the padding property is ignored by opera whereas firefox google-chrome and safari take it into account in the rendering

3366321
onkeyup	onkeydown
i think that a simple event onkeydown onkeyup or onkey press can solve this part

3366372
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera safari and google-chrome work

3366399
public	protected
say you re declaring a class with all the bells and whistles - constructor and destructor public private protected and static methods and properties magic methods etc

3366415
firefox	safari
works beautifully on firefox safari and ie8

3366429
public	protected
fields by visibility public protected private

3366429
public	protected
methods by visibility public protected private

3366441
public	protected
personally i put class variables at the top by visibility then magic methods then public methods then protected private methods

3366451
public	protected
properties next trying to maintain in order of private protected then public

3366451
getter	setter
for the methods i go for getter and setter first then other internal methods loosely grouped together followed by __construct and other magic methods with any static methods last..

3366490
put	get
if i put the highlighted code after the pdfdoc.close i get an error saying the document is not opened

3366497
dictionary	map
also notice that the dictionary actually contains a map from the original string to an integer

3366523
udp	tcp
if you want a reliable as in other parts of the system will worry about errors and retries stream of bytes between the two pcs then tcp ip is not much more complicated to use than udp

3366523
udp	tcp
both udp and tcp are accessed through sockets

3366543
udp	tcp
other answers suggests tcp ip udp rs232 .

3366553
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and ie but when i load the page in google-chrome the boxes appear as if the page were not scrolled

3366568
textile	bbcode
i honestly wouldn t be too concerned about using some basic html or use bbcode textile markdown etc. directly into your translation files

3366580
hide	show
in your list webpart you show your urls as your already do but you also create divs for your description you just hide them

3366584
post	get
so usersession.create users admin followed by a regular get post etc

3366587
hide	show
show hide controls complex tab controls

3366594
x86	64bit
i ve done this in iis for websites in the recent past and for our winforms app have set it to be x86 build so we always get the 32 bit odp providers on a 64bit os though you can do it with corflags as well

3366616
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but when the swf is embeded in firefox google-chrome or safari i get the ioerror #2038

3366636
google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome and safari both use the webkit engine

3366636
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome sends safari in the user agent string too so it will apply that to google-chrome also

3366657
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am in the process of writing a jquery plugin for 3d text and for firefox google-chrome and safari and other similar browsers i am using the css3 text-shadow property to render the 3d text

3366689
outputstream	inputstream
better use apache commons-io then you can just copy one inputstream to one outputstream fileoutputstream in your case

3366694
maven	pom.xml
as a side note maven 3 does throw a validation error if pom.xml contains a dependency with two different versions out of the box

3366727
width	height
then reshape and reposition it with glutreshapewindow width height and glutpositionwindow x y but i m at a loss as to how to manage several windows simultaneously

3366770
put	get
so we have just text like please see this link for more information get it translated and put the link tags around it

3366804
armadillo	blitz++
armadillo blitz++ -- fast array matrix cube abstractions for c++

3366804
armadillo	eigen
eigen armadillo -- linear algebra

3366808
udp	tcp
i bind and listen for tcp and just bind for udp

3366809
ssl	https
use https tls ssl

3366841
int	chars
all you re really doing is summing the value of each chars in charbuffer into newstr because a chars is really just an 8-bit int and then you return that int as a pointer through an implicit cast so it is now being treated as a memory address

3366851
hide	show
this way you can hide get variables or show to users whatever you want

3366854
pull	push
for instance if i change a file commit pull update push and then my co-worker changes a file commits pull and updates he gets a crosses branches error and has to do an hg merge

3366868
sproutcore	cappuccino
i can t speak for sproutcore but cappuccino has great easy to implement drag and drop

3366879
post	get
disabled html forms elements aren t sent along with the post get values when you submit the form

3366879
post	get
so if you disable your submit button once clicked and that this submit button have the name attribute set it will not be sent in the post get values since the element is now disabled

3366881
gdal	ogr
not listed in the post is how to install the prerequiste gdal ogr

3366881
ubuntu	linux
for that see osgeo4w on windows or a simple apt-get install gdal python-gdal on ubuntu linux

3366894
pull	push
if you want to eliminate the merge changesets which aren t actually a problem you can change pull rebase commit push instead of change commit pull merge commit

3366897
put	get
you may have to be lucky to get interesting patterns since this could be greatly affected by first piece you put on each tile

3366978
g++	gcc
the sample code compiles equally well with g++ main.cpp or gcc main.c

3366987
inline	inlining
i m not intimately familiar with vc++ but it may have a compiler-specific method of forcing or prohibiting the inlining of a function however the standard c++ inline keyword will not be it

3366987
inline	inlining
you should not worry about explicitly forcing or prohibiting inlining of a function unless you have a very specific need to do so as a result of profiling your program s execution and finding that a bottleneck could be solved by forcing an inline that the compiler has for some reason not done

3367003
ant	maven
i understood that you are migrating from ant to maven but you are imo not on the right path bending maven to make it fit in your existing project structure workflow is just not the recommended approach

3367003
ant	maven
from my point of view you re not migrating from ant to maven you re trying to migrate maven to an ant build

3367003
ant	maven
how to convert from ant to maven in 5 minutes

3367003
ant	maven
convert ant projects into maven safely in five phases

3367014
width	height
400 is the width 300 is the height

3367016
width	margin
if you are willing to use jquery you can pretty easily calculate the offset of the main body and adjust the width padding margin of the sidebar accordingly

3367018
getter	setter
in general inline getter setter functions and other one liners

3367034
ienumerable	ilist
you could use automapper for questionwithanswers but answers has to have an ilist and not an ienumerable

3367083
lisp	scheme
by lisp implementation i consider all implementations of any language in lisp family like common lisp scheme clojure .

3367106
post	get
i ll post updates as i get everything working properly

3367110
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit2 i should mention that this works flawlessly in ie8 firefox google-chrome and safari

3367122
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
there are several uiwebview in the app and for specific algorithm implemented in nsurlprotocol i need to know which one of the uiwebview sends the request

3367173
google-chrome	firefox
neither google-chrome nor firefox report errors

3367265
put	get
when you try to do things using windows batch you normally think on a text program but i want to know if there is anyway to use instead of those string inputs at the command window put on a textfield and that the messages get displayed at a msgbox

3367277
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	sip	udp	tcp	udp	rtp
ftp has a control and data port which both use tcp and multimedia applications will use sip or rtsp connections for control tcp and mulitple rtp and rtcp port udp for each data stream received

3367322
onresume	onpause
what i would advise is storing the list state for your listactivity instances in onpause to some app-global spot a singleton or whatever and loading from there in onresume

3367335
scheme	racket
the rationale for the name-change from plt scheme to racket is discussed on the racket site

3367375
executable	sfx
the 7-zip project see provides a so-called sfx for installers an image that can be use to create self-extracting windows executable

3367405
google-chrome	firefox
jquery.height is coming back with different values in firefox and google-chrome

3367405
google-chrome	firefox
measuring the pixels on-screen indicates that of the two google-chrome appears to be reporting the correct value while firefox is off by 2 or 3 pixels each time

3367405
margin	height
i have stripped all css styling that may have potentially been interfering with the height value all padding borders margin etc yet i still get inconsistent results

3367406
javassist	cglib
hibernate gives you the choice between javassist and cglib it s up to you to decide which one to use and to declare it explicitly hence the optional status

3367411
int	chars
code is clearer and easier to maintain as a general rule if it s semantically correct meaning in this case that you use chars for chars and int for int

3367465
listview	gridview
you can use your gridview listview control but use server side paging to get the data

3367483
equals	gethashcode
make sure your userteam object has proper overrides for the equals and gethashcode methods so that comparison between two userteams is accurate

3367517
width	height
vphantom inserts vertical space according to the height of its argument and has zero width

3367565
opera	firefox
tested on windows with opera firefox and works flawlessly

3367653
agile	sprint
soon i will be involved in a project that will be using the agile project management development approach with 5 or so 2 week sprint

3367656
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
this can handle png and tiff as well as the usual suspects gif jpeg bmp

3367660
getter	setter
i have tried in beans class creating getter and setter that return get string by parsing the value to dojo friendly format yyyy-mm-dd

3367660
getter	setter
if it is possible to have getter and setter for java date object to get return date and not string as i am doing now it would be perfect

3367677
junit	cactus
this means you can keep your cactus tests as junit 3.8 and your other tests as junit 4

3367685
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview which has several buttons added to it as subviews

3367701
width	height
using ie8 developer tools in compatibility mode i could reproduce the problem and find that the width and height are being assigned automatically

3367729
width	height
they both have a size with width and height and an origin

3367741
nonetype	iterable
when i try to run this i get an error message nonetype object is not iterable

3367769
hide	show
when the user hovers their mouse over an li element i d like show some hidden buttons on the li when they stop hovering hide the buttons again

3367785
mouseover	mouseout
edit note that as of jquery 1.4.3 the type of event that is reported when using hover with .delegate or .live is no longer mouseover mouseout as it ought to be

3367785
mouseleave	mouseenter
now it will be mouseenter mouseleave which just seems silly since they re non-bubbling events

3367795
int	chars
as i see it a unicode string can be conceived of as an array of int number each representing a single codepoint and the code above is basically operating on arrays of chars s already so my guess is that i should 1 extend it to handle c arrays of int

3367833
post	get
i have a cakephp application where i am trying to get a count of how many of each type of post a user has

3367833
post	put
3 maintain new columns in the user s table to track these numbers when the post are created put that would involve writing to the user account whenever a new post is made

3367845
nhibernate	llblgenpro
by the way the llblgenpro designer not only supports entity framework v4 and v1 but nhibernate linq to sql and their own llblgenpro runtime

3367858
width	height
x and y are height and width in inches

3367865
ant	maven
i think that maven is using the xml result format owned by ant and i am not sure there is an official dtd or schema

3367865
ant	maven
read this format and report on it including at least ant maven

3367865
hudson	bamboo
cruise control hudson bamboo eclipse and intellij idea

3367870
client-side	server-side
i m using httpclient on client-side and serverfileupload on server-side

3367873
textblock	itemscontrol
i solved this by using an itemscontrol and within the itemtemplate i placed the textblock and combobox controls

3367917
int	chars
chars varying - int

3367943
width	margin
you may still need to mess around with giving the div a right margin the width of the image

3367962
padding	overlapping
it will put the image to the far right of your and the right padding on the will keep the image from overlapping the text

3367978
profiling	debugging
interesting question but i doubt that this is possible - at least not without some major hacking using debugging or profiling apis

3367989
rss	feed
i know that google chrome shows some kind of raw data for rss feed though its not exactly pure xml

3367995
mouseover	mouseout
unless there s some specific reason why you want to append and remove on each mouseover mouseout event i guess i d do like derrick suggested except that i d have jquery handle the events for you

3368029
accessor	properties
in order to satisfy your invariant you will need to add a precondition to the properties s set accessor

3368033
int	chars
use ord to convert chars to their int code point

3368035
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval both execute timed js statements in relation to when they were loaded not at a specific time each day so they don t seem like a clean solution

3368077
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency did make paragraph transparency but made the image border black

3368080
inherited	properties
if it s a matter of easing the tests you could use a mocking framework like moq to avoid having to implement those properties on each class that inherited from the interface

3368082
outputstream	inputstream
if you use an inputstream to read use an outputstream to write a bufferedoutputstream-wrapped fileoutputstream

3368085
vim	notepad++
to start using vi or vim as opposed to my current tool of choice notepad++

3368097
ant	cruisecontrol
whether you use cruisecontrol or not you re going to have to write the scripts be they ant or shell scripts that are then called by cruisecontrol

3368100
memcpy	malloc
if you malloc a chunk of memory memcpy the memory from baseaddress to your own memory and use that to create the image the warning vanishes

3368114
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
support for html5 forms is quite lacking at the moment mostly it s just google-chrome safari webkit and opera that supports most of them but it doesn t hurt adding them they re backwards compatible

3368168
division	modulo
edit 2 stored range to intermediate variable thanks adrian used stdin instead of cli params thanks for the clarification jon eliminated array in favor of direct output fixed bug where an ending angle of 360 wouldn t display a line removed some un-needed parentheses used division for rounding instead of .round used modulo instead of conditional add

3368256
jobs	cron
cron jobs can be set to run every 10 minutes the url i gave shows how to do that with python and you can queue more tasks if the amount of work you need to perform on a certain occasion exceeds the 30-seconds limit that gae supports

3368256
jobs	cron
if you decide that gae has limitations you can t stand or would cost you too much for billed use of resources over the free quotas any hosting provider supporting a unix-like cron jobs scheduler should be acceptable

3368259
jobs	cron
you are lucky since google appengine provides cron jobs both for python and java

3368274
versioning	upgrade
just be aware that your code is likely to be break w versioning upgrade

3368294
shadowing	named
you are shadowing the check1 and check2 arrays because the do block variables have the same named as them

3368308
width	height
this can be done if you can detect the height width of the content in iframe then you can use colorbox.resize function to resize the colorbox again

3368322
jruby	mri
first i should mention that ruby on rails is simply ruby code and the same code can run in the jruby environment on the jvm or the mri written in c runtime

3368362
sudo	passwd
it uses air s own applicationupdater framework the one that doesn t require a ui - all goes well until the package gets downloaded and needs to be installed - at that point the air installer prompts for sudo passwd and won t proceed without some user interaction

3368377
put	get
but didn t get any clue on how i could put it in a block in my template

3368401
client-side	server-side
from this the lunascript compiler produces a functioning web 2.0 application -- the client-side javascript the server-side sql and everything in between -- complete with real-time bidirectional data synchronization

3368430
width	height
i have successfully resize iframe s height and width when it is loaded

3368483

put	get
i dont want to actually put text in the input box i just want to trigger all the event handlers that would normally get triggered by a user typing info into a input box

3368578
keydown	keyup
this means focus keydown keypress keyup and blur

expression-blend	silverlight
also can someone recommend a good book that covers how to create wpf and or silverlight applications using expression-blend 4 and visual studio 2010 together

3368690
folder	directory
the -i should point to the directory containing the openssl folder

3368701

recently i added ssl to my server and now i need to check for this and assign either http or https as the protocol

3368823
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this only happens on firefox i got no probs on safari google-chrome ie

3368855
width	height	width	font-size
width and height for the same string of characters of same font-size

3368859
prepare	pdostatement
however you should be using prepare statements mysqli_stmt or pdostatement

3368874
versioning	upgrade
according to the documentation if the package name and signing certificate do not match those of the existing versioning market will consider it a new application and will not offer it to users as an update. this would allow me to publish a new versioning of the application without the user being able to accidentally upgrade and break the application

3368882
udp	tcp
based on you re post i assume you re using tcp ip since you re referring to streaming but a socket can be used for udp connectionless protocol as well and others

3369023
width	height
the sweave options width and height influence the dimensions of the pdf file but not the size of the figures in the document

3369282
actionscript	mxml
we want to read this data from the jsp in a mxml through actionscript

3369328
disk	ram
it looks like the biggest increase in speed will come from running the test database in a ram disk based on this post here on performance tuning tips for drupal 7 testing on qa.drupal.org

3369328
disk	ram
also there some instructions here for creating a ram disk on os x although this is for moving your entire stock of mysql databases into a ram disk instead of just a single database

3369328
disk	ram
i ve been able to cut 30-50 from the test times by switching to a ram disk

3369328
disk	ram
create a ram disk

3369328
disk	ram
then i took the following steps i made sure the previous mysqld was no longer running and then started the mysql daemon making sure we tell it to use ram disk as our data directory rather than the default location

3369328
disk	ram
next was to get this data into the local testing setup on the ram disk

3369328
disk	ram
creating the symlink - this because the mysql command by default looks for tmp mysql.sock and symlinking that to our short term ram disk was simpler than constantly changing php.ini files

3369361
sorting	filtering
so far all sorting and filtering information is lost when navigating back to list.aspx

this is a bit hacky though and you should aim to use get for the idempotent requests and post for mutation requests

3369582
nsstring	nsdata
get json as a nsstring from nsdata response

3369598
hash	salt
the hash and salt you ll need to set on your own you can refer to the ecma specs and implementation notes for those details but this is a really good tutorial to just jump right in

3369606
keydown	keyup
check for keycode which keyup || keydown

3369624
keydown	keyup
it seems keydown and keyup work even though keypress may not

3369654
notepad	scite
at the moment i just use scite which for those who haven t come across it is basically notepad that colours your code in

3369688
vb6	vba
it s been a while since i ve had to work with vba vb6 but i believe including the parens causes itm to be passed by value instead of by reference

3369693

specifically when in quirks mode ie includes padding within the area defined by width while the w3c box model does not - both padding and margin are added onto the width

3369743
google-chrome	safari
keycode is now in the process of being deprecated and most modern browsers offer the key property now although you ll still need a fallback for decent browser support for now at time of writing the current releases of google-chrome and safari don t support it

3369807
actualheight	actualwidth
you can use binding to actualwidth and actualheight of your biggest textblock

3369851
loops	while-loop
also your while-loop is wrong - you should not normally use the eof function as a loops control - use

3369855
nsstream	nsoutputstream
cocoa provides three classes to represent streams and facilitate their use in your programs nsstream nsinputstream and nsoutputstream

3369861

3369911
width	height
these panels do not have a width or height set which i might not be able to fix

3369911
width	height	children	parent
i tried this in code behind but the scaling did not work correctly since i was not able to understand how if width and height propagation from children to parent really works

3369916
gridview	sqldatasource
at the moment the options that come to my mind are composing a dataset by hand in the codebehind and binding the gridview to that instead of the sqldatasource or creating a stored procedure to return the table already dereferenced

3369935
ant	maven
when you run ant with maven you can t call individual targets anyway you are binding an ant run to a maven phase

3369935
ant	maven
a lot of what you are doing in your ant task is default maven behavior

3369944
button	checkbox
you can multiselect users via checkbox and press the remove button to delete them from the system

3369944
button	checkbox
should we remove the user selections made in the checkbox when the user hits the cancel button or leave the selections as it is

3369990
width	height
you should bind grid s width and height to one value

3369998
width	height
at present i am hard coding the width and height of the controls to fill as they don t stretch

3370038
gridview	sqldatasource
at the moment the options that come to my mind are composing a dataset by hand in the codebehind and binding the gridview to that instead of the sqldatasource or creating a stored procedure to return the table already dereferenced

3370073
int	double

of course you d want to put some error handling in there but you get the idea

3370133
freebsd	linux
long time ago before everyone switched to linux and freebsd there used to be operating system named windows written by microsoft

3370157

i would suggest to wrap the argumentcount maxargumentcount and arguments in a separate class which can handle the malloc new and free delete as well

3370288
appkit	nsimage	tiff	png
in the case with appkit nsimage i really find it hard to manipulate per pixel data of the images and saving to different file formats such as png not just tiff

3370356
ostringstream	std
another option would be to use std string or even std ostringstream

3370397
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
loops through element of an arrays in more effective with a standard for-loop instead of for in loops

3370448
qstring	qurl

google-chrome	firefox
for firefox you would need to inject some browser-side code into google-chrome either as extension or plugin

3370551
put	get
i m struggling to get mocks working for a change and was wondering where people generally put their mock classes

3370584

3370700
pull	push
the other peer informs you whenever it wants about the pieces it has so it s push instead of pull

3370701
next	except
similarly easy but often better for things like characters is to project all forward facing polygons to just their x and y coordinates and similarly for the back facing polygons except that you offset them so the two sets are next to each other

3370801
width	margin
alternatively if you want to use it as a block element you should set the following properties on the label display block width xxpx where xx than 350px and margin 0px auto which means have equal distance from the sides thus centered

3370823
int	chars
all basic types - chars short int long - are already positioned in memory or inside of struct on their natural alignment the address of a variable or struct s field is divisible by the size of the variable

3370823
int	chars
after the a sizeof chars -sizeof int bytes would be added to make sure that the b s address is aligned on sizeof b .

3370826
profiling	debugging
i have defined the profiling to the same as on my phone for debugging -ing

3370834
google-chrome	firefox

getter	setter
this solution is not perfect as in beans class i am still using getter and setter to use string for my date object and parse the value inside these methods

3371154
actionscript	mxml
if it is an actionscript class or mxml component make sure you are using that class somehow in your code

3371155
post	get
if you don t want optimize you site for caching of http get data for jqgrids you can either use http post or don t use parameter

3371169
typedef	struct
one drawback of the first declaration is that when you use any ide the automatic jump to declaration often directs you to the typedef struct _something someting

3371193
typedef	struct
some people like to put all their typedef in one header file so they can typedef the struct a pointer to the struct etc

3371212
tablelayout	margins
basically you just have to add a margins of 5 or 10px on the right in your tablelayout

3371235
typedef	typename
from typename synonym creation which is what typedef does and retains

3371258
post	get
you can make the ajax file require a get or post variable

3371306
typedef	struct
there s one clear advantage of separating the typedef and the struct declaration and that advantage is clear if you separate both in different files

3371351
typedef	struct
if you separate the two things typedef from the struct declaration you will be able if needed to have opaque pointers

3371426
post	get
hope that helps to get you started - any questions please post a comment

3371467
config	ini
appsettings config file ini file nini embeddable database sqlite berkelydb etc.. whatever method you like it depends on your application size performance consideration and design

3371502

a good reference to all the extra properties that arrays inherited is the mozilla developer center article on array

3371593
folder	directory
i need to create a folder in the root directory of sharepoint 2007

3371596
put	get
but instead of trying to get around it i would put my effort into either shortening the request lengths to reduce lock contention or making cookieless requests for those requests that don t need the session at all.

3371638
rsa	dsa
rsa key generation is quite fast on a basic pc you can easily generate a dozen rsa keys per second and with discrete-log dsa diffie-hellman el-gamal or elliptic-curve based cryptosystems it is even considerably faster ten thousands new ec key pairs per second with a pc

3371640
hide	show
the widget s hide show methods should work

3371671
uiview	subviews
after creating the uiview with or without a uiviewcontroller you can add the subviews to the original view by typing

3371672
public	protected
obviously this is protected rather than public but its still a method accessible from outside of the class that has nothing to do with the class itself

3371692
portrait	landscape
and it works fine but if i change it to portrait instead of landscape then it crashes with the following error.

3371706
children	parent
also note that the simple tree example no more than two children per parent might not be very realistic and when many children exist for a single parent the display will become difficult to construct and not pleasing to the eye

3371723
integer	unsigned
array indices are strings all object properties are that is the canonical decimal representation of an unsigned integer in the range 0..2 32-2 0 to 4294967294

3371723
integer	unsigned
the limit is one below the maximal value of a 32-bit unsigned value because the length field value is then always an unsigned 32-bit integer value

3371764
min	max
you can either use the new html5 attributes for time input step min max or use an options object

3371764
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
have manually tested in ie 6 8 firefox google-chrome and opera latest stable on linux for the latter ones

3371784
ubuntu	linux
i m an ubuntu linux user and i use win xp only for my work purposes

3371859

you need to submit the form as a get request in order to put the params in the actual url but as i say any form submit will achieve this by default as that s the way get form submits work

3371935
children	parent
the above expression selects every input element with which is the 7th child of its parent -- and aparently the parent of input elements in the document that is not shown don t have so many input children

3371957
vmware	virtualbox
i regularly develop and test using development environments running under vmware workstation and virtualbox

3372000
children	parent
i would like to write a query where i find children nodes of type b that do not have a parent of type c

3372003
keydown	keyup
the default behaviour is that no keypress keyup or keydown events are fired when a password input has focus

3372033
maven	pom.xml
specify the correct version of your jre in the maven compiler plugin by default your pom.xml file will inherit the compiler-plugin from the maven super pom.xml which targets the 1.3 jre

3372034
for-loop	loops
i would leave for-loop - you can omit some part of this loops and simulate other loops

3372048
disk	ram
i know that you are using php but some web application frameworks for other languages such as happstack for haskell use an internal ram based data storage serialized on the disk

3372096
google-chrome	firefox
i ve pieced together bits and i ve got it working in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

3372105
doc	rtf
if it s an image i just want to add an image to the file if it s something life rtf doc then i can maybe embed it so the content is visible if it s some other type like mp3 or pdf then it might simply embed with an icon

3372107
int	chars
type of chars literal changed from int to chars compare sizeof a in c and c++

3372117
gesturedetector	motionevent
instead you should consider passing the motionevent to the gesturedetector first and processing the event yourself only if the gesturedetector does not with something like this

3372120
getter	setter
the best you can do is to use a lambda expression to form a for a getter or an for a setter

3372130
ant	maven
i have started playing with maven2 and i m attempting to port one of my projects from ant to maven

3372130
ant	maven
is there a way i can do it purely in maven had a look at maven exec plugin but is a bit confusing or do i have to call ant from maven to achieve this

3372216
jobs	cron
in general you would use any kind of scheduling cron scheduled jobs in the ms sql world etc. when the task you want is one or both of

3372298
int	double
therefore result type of is int is double is etc

3372319
accessor	properties
my question is is it possible to copy body of get accessor that has references to other properties in same class and if possible how to do it

3372348
textarea	textbox
it s as easy as adding a few textbox and a textarea a button to send the request to the server using a requestbuilder with the correct post parameters and display a message on success failure

3372373
put	get
one way to get other sid s with the same cid is to put the above query into a subquery

3372435
rspec	machinist
as well as rspec shoula machinist faker and the rest make ruby a real consideration if this is where you interest lies

3372526

versioning	upgrade
now when we upgrade a client s software we now have to and run all scripts that were written since the the versioning the client has running

3372574
google-chrome	firefox
this method works great in firefox but not at all in ie or google-chrome not sure about other browsers

3372599
gcov	lcov
since you re using lcov you should be able to convert the gcov .gcda files into lcov files and merge them with lcov --add-tracefile

3372646
int	chars
here s another one which is perhaps a little more high-minded in not doing the hacky chars int cast

3372659
width	height
i need to find the width and height of all rectangles in the field

3372719
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then objectoutputstream can be used to write them to harddisk and objectinputstream to read them from harddisk

3372725
udp	tcp
you have two problems you don t understand how accept works in tcp and you need to read the incoming data in udp

3372738
strstr	substr
if you actually need the substr back rather than a position strstr is a good way to go

3372860
passenger	thin
the stack which caused this problem is ruby 1.8.7 merb 1.0.12 apache load balancing to a thin cluster on production passenger on the demo server and working with unproxied thin on development

3372951
versioning	upgrade
it s free but the upgrade versioning provides intellisense support

3372959
width	height
largest hypotenuse others width or height

3372982
maven	pom.xml
to mavenize simply means to write a pom.xml and possibly move code around so that it builds in maven

3373094
hid	keyboard
i ve compiled the kernel to support usb hid and keyboard devices

3373116
equals	gethashcode
note that you will need to correctly implement equals and gethashcode in the state class

3373116
equals	gethashcode
if you just want the ids you don t need to implement equals gethashcode

3373125
equals	gethashcode
when implementing the iequalitycomparer know that distinct does validate both the results from equals are equivalent and the results from gethashcode are equivalent

3373135
hudson	phpundercontrol
i ve used both phpundercontrol and hudson to automate php builds .

3373144
put	get
if so you can put them in there and get hudson to pull them from there.

3373170
iprincipal	iidentity
asp.net mvc - set custom iidentity or iprincipal

3373191
range	median
possibly at stages through the computation you could discard the top n and bottom n values as long as you are sure that the median is not in that top or bottom range

3373196
folder	directory
i believe you would have to make the beta folder into a virtual directory so that it gets its own application

3373240
draggable	droppable
this generates a pretty little square which uses jquery draggable droppable function

3373249
stdout	stderr
i would recommend proc_open which allows you to set up pipes for stdin stdout and stderr

3373256
min	max
the x and y axes are perfect but the colormap spreads between the min and max of v

3373256
range	max	range	min	min	max
to set the range of the axes but this only takes arguments for the min and max of x and y not the colormap

3373308
getter	setter
2 the datatype of the db column bigint and the datatype of alertid long and the datatype of the getter setter systemobjectrecordid variable long match

3373318
wtforms	werkzeug
there s also wtforms which is a fairly minimal forms library that integrates well with werkzeug in my experience

3373334
for-loop	loops
i generally prefer a for-loop over a while loops when you re trying to do something a particular number of times

3373352
portrait	landscape
now after launching when the anotherviewcontroller view is displayed its initial dimensions are always same of the last orientation portrait landscape view in interface builder i saved that view xib with irrespective of the current device orientation

3373369
put	get	portrait	landscape
to get a layout with a landscape portrait easily create a layout-land folder in your projectname res the sam hierarchy level with layout folder and put your xml with landscape design into the layout-land folder

3373371
collabnet	svn
this is svn 1.6.11 running the collabnet solaris binaries

3373435

3373512
getter	setter
in general getter setter are better

3373544
inherited	properties
i want to utilise entity framework to create a content entity that pulls in the common properties so i can inherited the content entity in the article and blog entity

3373557
getter	setter
if there s no logic in getter setter except for returning assigning a value from to a public field there s no significant difference between usage of getter setter and accessing the field directly

3373559
getter	setter
the xmlaccesstype annotation takes care of telling jaxb to look at the setter and getter and not the field itself

getter	setter
the usual rationale for getter and setter is you can change it from being a simple wrapper around a private field to a rather complex computation without breaking any code using the class

3373562
getter	setter
if you re sure the getter setter will never be more than that or it will never be used that much feel free to use a pulic field i don t mind

post	put
i learn about http and need some examples of http put method structure something like this one for http post method

superclass	subclassing
however because an instance of a subclassing contains its own superclass they are still there

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox safari restart the browser and still reliably get this error on the same requests so i don t think its cookie related

3373657
put	get	post	put	post	get
in any case i can issue get post put requests no problem with the same cookie

3373679
put	get
it must have an address and if i put these objects into an array i must be able to increment a pointer in order to get the next object so every object must have a unique address and take up at least 1 byte

3373690
client-side	server-side
cookies are a client-side storage while sessions are server-side

3373690
google-chrome	firefox
in a classical session system where you assign a random id on session start a registered user can have many simultaneous session instances in different computers or even in a single computer one in firefox and three more in google-chrome incognito mode windows

3373749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the thing to watch out for is browser adoption of html5 websocket - currently in google-chrome and safari and coming soon in firefox and opera

3373755
post	get
i was hoping to get some ideas as how i can get a number of post that have been posted on our blog but within a certain date range

3373756
width	height
do some primitive math to approximate rect s width and height

3373756
min	max
to do this we compare values average vertical segment length and max y - min y

3373756
min	max
min x max y

3373756
min	max
max x min y

3373785
put	get
the javascript can get values from a property so put the value into the session state before postback

3373798
uiviewcontroller	catransition
having some basic issues with managing the total memory from adding and removeing a uiviewcontroller - but only when i add an animation to it using catransition

3373804
folder	directory
if on the other hand you want to make the project inside your eclipse workspace directory then there is a problem which is that if you just copy the sample code inside your workspace folder and do new- android project and create project from existing source for me at least it fails with the error invalid project description c users usernamme blah blah projectname overlaps the location of another project projectname

3373804
folder	directory
in this layout the android projects java projects and other projects directory are conceptually my workspaces but in reality in each case it is the nested workspace folder which is the actual eclipse workspace

3373804
folder	directory
this enables me to keep my projects contained within their respective pseudo-workspaces while not being inside their actual eclipse workspace folder which neatly gets around the problem of not being able to easily create android projects if the project directory is inside the eclipse workspace directory

3373816
fseek	fread
i am about to implement a custom vfs virtual file system for a netburner embedded device non windows using fopen fread fwrite fseek and fclose

3373830
put	get
you might want to consider the code safe while it is in memory but put in other protection to detect when and if it does get stolen

3373834
pop-up	dialog
when i try to run the installed application as a different user than the user that ran the installer the installer tries to run again it s already installed at this point and pop-up some error dialog and the application won t run

3373839
google-chrome	safari
the problem also affects other browsers but less so in the fast ones safari and google-chrome

3373839
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox still has a multi-second lag and google-chrome and safari have a very short lag not quite as short as ie but still very short

3373896
put	get
i put a try catch around the get set and now everything works well

3373908
rss	feed
in an application like this there are often many loops looping through different rss feed different rss items rss tags and so on

3373909
post	get
curl has the ability to send post and get data to the server via many different option settings

3373910
implements	extends
being classes that implcitly extends enum they can even implements interfaces

3373912
switching	screens
i want to call my datamanager after initialising the loading screens and then call a method to switching scenes

3373948
folder	directory
on my first glance through a handy macbook s library directory i saw preferences and application support folder

3373965
free	malloc
memory leak made simple whenever you allocate memory with malloc new and don t deallocate it later with free delete after finishing using that memory.

3373985
min	max
standard sql requires that columns in the select clause that are not wrapped in aggregate functions count min max etc need to be defined in the group by

3374047
for-loop	arrays
i have a list of strings that i add to an arrays then attempt to set those values in a for-loop using data that i read in

3374071
distance	mercator
my limited understanding of mercator is that it preserves horizontal distance but not vertical

3374101
put	get
media needs to update the entire state value so rather than get ting and put ting just use the modify function

3374102
folder	directory
indicates current directory so referencing . folder test.js is the same as just folder test.js

3374132
getter	setter
i thought of having just a nsmutabledictionary per model object to store all of the ivar s but that abstracts the setter and getter and may introduce a big memory footprint for so many dictionaries

3374132
ivar	subclassing
as i understand it dynamically adding ivar s at runtime to an object model is considered a bad thing because of the pointer referencing for any subclassing that may be dependent upon the model the subclassing pointer doesn t get offset unless a complete recompile is done

3374172
rtp	sip

3374320
filtering	grouping
so as the user i filtering the list of these 10 000 items based on whatever hit select all and then click grouping

3374374
codeigniter	cakephp
you might consider starting by using one of the many different mvc frameworks out there such as codeigniter or cakephp

3374388
min	max
you can use default jrockit jre for this or and change the heap size for min and max as 1024m

3374388
min	max
max heap as 1024m and min heap size as 1024 m

3374395
put	get
you ll probably have to double your backslashes in the path names however since iirc python uses backslash as an escape character so to get one backslash in the final string you need to put in two

3374408
outputstream	inputstream
you should end up with an inputstream with the file contents which you in turn can write to any outputstream to your taste

3374427
metaclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
metaclass are inherited so subclassing gets base â s metaclass

3374427
super	self
when super ... .__init__ is replaced with base.__init__ self the closure disappears #5

3374486
hide	show
if you want a simple client-side solution your question is tagged jquery so i suspect this is on the radar you could put your sub-menus in tags and then use the jquery hover function to show and hide the sub-menu when the appropriate parent item is hovered

3374501
union	distinct
especially if you use union all there should not be a performance hit as union would have to go through the result to only keep unique records actually doing something like distinct or group by

3374504
min	max
even though min max heap defined jvm would occupy max heap from system memory while starting

3374515
width	height
edit but if you want the div height to remain the same don t have the width 33 for the centertext div and keep the progresssize css the way i have mentioned

3374527
hex	binary
as a first step i d try dumping out your incoming binary string byte-wise preferrably in hex to some medium where you can read it and compare the bytes you see with the bytes you re expecting from the input data

3374560
haskell	scheme
it acts like scheme s letrec if you happen to know that meaning that it s a cross between let and letfn you can bind a set of names to mutually recursive values without the need for those values to be functions lazy sequences are ok too as long as it is possible to evaluate the head of each item without referring to the others that s haskell -- or perhaps type-theoretic -- parlance

3374653
hide	show
adds the show and hide text appropriately and lets you specify the tabular inline names in a list beforehand

3374665
punctuation	words
i want it to specifically not match html entities #anchors in urls hashtags that start in the middle of a words and any trailing punctuation after a hashtag

3374766
salt	md5	des	sha	hash	md5	hash	salt
it s quite common to salt a password then hash it using des md5 sha or newer hash

3374766
crypt	hash
php s crypt works this way although the exact algorithm it uses to hash the password may be different between versions of php.

3374766
crypt	salt
php now includes its own hashing library instead of relying on the os library which is really really important if you re using windows as crypt function on windows only supported des with 2-byte salt prior to this

3374766
hash	salt
passing the encrypted password as the second argument will usually get php to detect the salt and algorithm used to originally hash the password namely because everything other than des start with where # is a number

3374804
charindex	substr
see substr charindex patindex

3374813
width	height
pdf myscatterplot.pdf height 6 width 6

3374824
put	get
depending on what you want to do i would get rid of the or put it to the end of each variable name which should result in a number of arrays whose first element contains the desired value

3374870
nspredicate	nsmutableset
take the results of your nspredicate and put them into an nsset or its mutable child nsmutableset

3374898

folder	directory
i installed xampp on my windows side and changed the apache root directory to z www the location of my mamp webroot which is a shared folder between mac and windows

3375128
getter	setter
property tells objective-c to generate the getter and setter for this member variable when it is synthesize d in the implementation class

3375157
post	get
post the code of the other functions involved so i can get a better idea of what is going on

3375202
rtsp	rtmp
wowza can re-transmit an rtsp stream as rtmp

3375202
rtsp	rtmp
the same video can be transmitted as either rtsp or rtmp and it s just a matter of different transmission protocols

3375207
width	height
if you want the svg to fill the entire width height of the screen try this in the html document

3375207
width	height
if you wanted to fill a smaller region of the document then try removing the width and height attributes on the referenced svg root element and make sure that there is a viewbox attribute

3375266
put	get
the fastest way to get your data supported by amazon but not yet azure is to ship them a usb disk even a usb stick have them put the data in the disk and ship it back to you

3375276
codeigniter	kohana
since they are concerned about a bloated framework i suggest that instead they investigate using a lightweight php framework such as codeigniter and kohana

3375337
ant	maven
i did see some stuff about xmldiff and maven ant integration but it s kind of bare

3375356
versioning	upgrade
struts 2.1 is a major upgrade from the previous 2.0.x versioning

3375372
submit	submission
when submission data once changed submit only the rows which were changed

3375472
memcpy	strdup	memcpy	malloc	strdup	malloc
alternatively you can copy the string using the typical c techniques for example using malloc + memcpy strdup or similar but it sounds like you might want a refresher in strings pointers and memory allocation in c before you get to that

3375492
scheme	racket
racket formerly plt scheme where some interesting research is going on in contracts and testing

3375492
scheme	racket
racket is a research language but it is an extension of scheme which is pretty widely used for a niche language

3375525
verilog	vhdl
fpgas are programed with hardware description languages like verilog and vhdl

3375574
children	parent
i need to have the antrun task execute after all the children - but i can t associate it with package phase since parent gets packaged before children and i need ant to run afterwards

3375574
children	parent
and have that run package phase on all children and then run antrun run on parent

3375576
min	max
instead of min you could use max as well

3375612
postgresql	mysql
for example for most things that you would do with mysql or postgresql but having predefined columns really holds you back

3375630
folder	directory
there s a folder in the series 40 sdk directory that apparently caches the midlets it runs and keeps older versions of the same midlet there too

3375640
for-loop	loops
if you absolutely have to use for-loop which is rarely really necessary anymore afaik there is only one good loops template

3375665
children	parent
i need to have the antrun task execute after all the children - but i can t associate it with package phase since parent gets packaged before children and i need ant to run afterwards

3375667
aim	instant
talk or ytalk ntalk etalk would let the other person reply but these days instant messaging goes via a centrally managed identity aim jabber skype etc. rather than on a machine-to-machine basis

3375752
google-chrome	firefox
works with firefox google-chrome

3375783
config	ini
the problem is not related to the ini config or your realm definition

3375794
width	height
your best bet is to make the width and height the same as the lower resolution of the ipad since you don t know which way it s oriented

3375799
button	checkbox
i have a case where i would like treeview to be able to show radio button on multiple root nodes and checkbox on their children

3375826
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is there seems to be a slight gap between the list items in firefox but in google-chrome there is no gap

3375826
google-chrome	firefox
if i change the css line-height value it corrects in firefox but then breaks google-chrome

3375828
post	get
i get back a forbidden response when i try to get or post a private url

3375860
iprincipal	iidentity
it is possible by defining your own iidentity and possibly iprincipal too and constructing this when creating the iprincipal for the http request

3375874
int	chars
to convert the chars 7 into an int form

3375912
folder	directory
this way i can just add sqlservercelibrary as needed to my solutions and the dlls will be copied into the correct directory in the bin folder

3375938
jobs	cron
i have 2 other mission-critical cron jobs that run rake tasks that look identical and run fine not sure what s different about this one

3375961
setinterval	settimeout
you can more or less abuse settimeout setinterval and their derivatives like delay to simulate sleep but you re usually better off just adapting to the setinterval timeout way of doing things.

3375961
setinterval	settimeout
and in the browser that s setinterval and settimeout

3375966
setinterval	settimeout
any sleep function will most likely need to utilize settimeout or possibly setinterval

3375982
vsto	add-in
i am working on a powerpoint 2007 vsto add-in and i am running in a small issue

3376013
folder	directory
my directory structure please ignore other folder

3376032
folder	directory
i suspect your real problem is when an access database is opened a separate temporary locking file that manages the users collisions and record locks is created and keep in mind that this temporary locking file is created in the same directory as where the shared data is in this case your back end shared data folder

3376032
readonly	temporary
what this means is when the first user who opens the database can t create that temporary separate locking file then for the most part additional users coming into the database will also not be able to make modifications and will also be in readonly mode

3376066
folder	directory
as a summary you re going to make a cpanel backup minus the home directory generally the largest folder restore that backup and then rsync the home directory over to the server

3376083
versioning	upgrade
to test the app for the situation where an iphone os 3.1 has been upgrade to ios4 i run this versioning on device iphone and versioning 4.0 in iphone simulator

3376083
backgrounding	multitasking
due to application multitasking in ios4 my app does not terminate when i press the home button instead as expected it goes in the backgrounding and pressing the app icon it comes back to foreground

3376114
integer	unsigned
when i found out that classes inheriting the error class cannot extend fw_error_types enum i had to go with a generic enum and was forced to have geterror return an unsigned integer

3376118
hash	salt
insert into salt email username firstname lastname activationcode values request.querystring payer_email request.querystring payer_email request.querystring first_name request.querystring last_name request.querystring hash

3376151
width	height
so because there has to be a custom maximizing state i want to get the height and width of the screen without the taskbar

3376198
x86	64bit
i found x86 in that manifest file which is not 64bit afaict so i did more research

3376256
daemon	cron
in your position i d consider writing a daemon instead of relying on cron

3376256
daemons	systemd
your daemons could use memory_get_usage and call out out free uptime and friends to throttle the number of workers to match systemd conditions

3376256
daemon	cron
but if it s acceptably slow cron could cycle the daemon every so often.

3376265
inherited	subclassing
if you need to create a new type of error you can inherited from the base error class or a more specific subclassing

3376328
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
if you want to manipulate with javascript getelementbyid on #compv-navbar and getelementsbytagname img using that as a context

3376427
stdout	stderr
related to the consuming of stderr and stdout here s a little convenience class which i use frequently

3376434
springboard	backgrounding
it will load from springboard every time correctly even if it is running in the backgrounding

3376472
rss	feed
2 or you could provide rss feed from your cms and retrieve the rss feed via http request and parse it

3376472
rss	feed
here s also an article how to parse rss xml feed from a website

3376474
apache	nginx
some frameworks require you to tweak apache lighty nginx etc to make it a framework extension

3376487
superclass	subclassing
all fields in the superclass also exist on the subclassing so having an explicit relation is unnecessary

3376517
ant	maven
if you are someone who prefers to keep your hands off the build script files after you initially set it up and it looks like you are given you were using netbeans built in projects which generate an ant build.xml behind the scenes then you should just try maven and see what happens

3376528
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
you show how to create an nsbitmapimagerep not an nsimage

3376528
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
there is an nsimage method to convert to tiff data and there is an nsbitmapimagerep method to convert to data in several formats

3376571
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
having an nsbitmapimagerep as jwwalker pointed out that code doesn t create an nsimage instance you can ask the image rep for a cgimage version of itself and then create a cgimagedestination to write that image to a file

3376588
subclipse	egit
if i use egit or subclipse to import check out the project the pydev environment is incomplete

3376591

these mts are typically upgrade by taking 1 2 out of rotation installing the new mt versioning bringing them back online and then repeating for the other half

3376601
width	height
what i m trying to do is have a window resize to twice the height of the width

3376616
width	margin
also if you have any input on calculating width percentages based on a parent containers width and accounting for each elements border margin and qty

3376622
public	protected
make the instances variable protected and add a public get method

3376652
free	malloc
write a program that takes a chunk of memory and make your own malloc and free routines that try to divide that chunk of memory up to serve the malloc and frees and maybe take a randomiser and use it to call your malloc and free routines

3376676
uilabel	uitextview
for my specific implementation i m not simply scaling the uilabel uitextview as-is

3376680
put	get
i need to get a recordset containing the following info using a query i can put in a stored procedure

3376683
hash	salt
that s hash method salt and password hash delimited by characters

3376683
hash	salt
to test a password for correctness extract those 3 fields append the salt to the user-entered password apply the hash and compare to the hash 3rd field in the database

3376695
backgrounding	multitasking
with multitasking in ios4 the home button puts the app into backgrounding and when it comes back into foreground i want the view controller to refresh and hence viewwillappear to be called

3376697
google-chrome	firefox
one thing i noticed though is that you have invalid markup and due to this the dom tree within firefox is inconsistent with google-chrome

3376728
google-chrome	firefox
i traced it both in google-chrome and firefox firebug and what happens is very strange

3376738
int	chars
in c main is defined as int main int argc chars argv and the return from main is the return from the program

3376787
box-sizing	border-box
no element uses the border-box box model unless specified via the box-sizing property as such

3376790
sorting	grouping
certainly i can achieve this with some kind of custom grouping class and by sorting and iterating

3376830
post	get
post the question on the sahi forums and you should get an answer quickly

3376845
put	get
you could get fancy and update the visible records first before moving on to the rest of the data set -- depends on how much effort you want to put into it

3376846
jboss	glassfish
jsf 2.0 hibernate spring jbpm jax-ws so i am confused between chosing server and i am locked between jboss and glassfish please suggest me why i should use the one

3376849
hide	show
in the delegate of the navigation controller when a controller is being show that implements that method the delegate hide or show the navigation controller accordingly

3376849
hide	show
since i animate the hide or show i check the current state and do nothing if no change is needed

3376849
hide	show
if the controller being show is the root controller hide the navigation bar otherwise show it if it is hidden

3376944
cakephp	kohana
i have always likened cakephp to php and kohana to python

3376944
codeigniter	cakephp
i ditched cakephp four years ago for codeigniter

3376944
codeigniter	kohana
then i choose to go with kohana when it was created from codeigniter because kohana takes the best parts of codeigniter and fixes the bad parts

3376978
getter	setter
hiding state behind getter and setter gives you more flexibility to change the internal representation of the class state without breaking other classes that uses the state

3376978
getter	setter
getter and setter allow the class to do things when the state is accessed or mutated

3376978
getter	setter
getter and setter can be synchronized

3376978
getter	setter
getter and setter if implemented according to the java bean rules enable all sorts of object wiring frameworks

3376978
getter	setter
and the downsides of getter and setter are minimal

3376978
getter	setter
any half-decent java ide can generate a getter setter pair for an attribute in a couple of keystrokes

3376978
getter	setter
and if you let your ide generate your getter and setter they won t be buggy either

3376978
getter	setter
while getter and setter make your source code files bigger you normally don t need to pay any attention to them when you are reading the code

3376978
getter	setter
at runtime simple getter and setter will be inlined so that the performance is indistinguishable from directly reading or writing a public attribute

3376999
getter	setter
getter and setter are good for encapsulation

3376999
getter	setter
in general you do not want to blindly provide getter and setter for all fields that do nothing more than return the value or set the value

3376999
getter	setter
you should think about what part of the state of the class you want to expose to the outside and you control that by implementing the appropriate getter and setter

3376999
getter	setter
it s often a good idea to make classes immutable - in that case you wouldn t be providing setter at all just getter

3377067
put	get
most importantly put the url in quotes and set the get url field to expression

3377073
src	attr
i m trying to center a new image vertically in a div after changing the src using attr in this way

3377129
emacs	aquamacs
for a mac integrated emacs i would try aquamacs

3377140
mouseover	mouseout
i m using mouseover and mouseout event wherein which will change the images on mouseover and mouseout

3377144
hide	show
then in the success callback for your ajax call hide the spinner and show the content

3377232
vim	emacs
a veteran emacs user over 10 years and recent vim convert gotta love the extremely powerful command system and short key bindings i soon found that either the file navigation cucumber editing or refactoring support was quite lacking in those

3377257
nexus	artifactory
but in the maven land if you can t host up a corporate repository for your project nexus archiva artifactory then the file-based repository is imo the best approach

3377286

jsf	seam
i have just started looking into jsf seam so please forgive me if this is an uninformed quesiton

3377349
integer	unsigned
i personally consider this kind of warning idiotic and would turn it off but the fact that you re asking about it suggests that you might be sufficiently unfamiliar with conversions between integer types and the differences in signed and unsigned behavior that the warning could be useful to you

3377375
firefox	safari
i tried this feature with firefox safari and ie all runs fine

3377378

i could get all of the moderations for that user and then use map to get all of the post that the user moderated and then query the post database as pseudocode but i m worried that might be slow

3377483
post	get
try to use that in an implementation and if you get stuck post some more specific questions here

3377702
rss	feed
another option if you don t mind it being a gmail-specific solution note that gmail also provides an rss feed to your mailbox which you can then access with normal xml processing apis

3377804
nfa	dfa
if your regexp engine exposes runtime exponential behavior for x+x+ +y then it is broken because a dfa or nfa can recognize this pattern in linear time

3377813
getter	setter
in the long term ecmascript 5 specifies a different form of getter and setter that will eventually make its way into all browsers

3377813
getter	setter
here is an example of ecmascript 5 getter and setter

padrino	ruby-on-rails
for larger scale apps there is even the sinatra-based padrino framework with some of the niceties that you would usually reach for ruby-on-rails to provide

3377878
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up that asks you which to choose will look like the reflector one but will have to be a custom one

3377948

you can do this through ib to get an app with a portrait and a landscape layout or you can do it programmatically

3377951
ubuntu	linux
i am running on linux ubuntu 10.0.4

3378062
post	get
the workaround for this problem is to get uploadify to get or post the session id to the script however i m finding this very unreliable

3378076
width	height
but setting a width or a height will override them so put any value you want

3378124

3378261
installation	upgrade
if you have a sharepoint enterprise cal key you can upgrade your installation and then everything will work

3378293
quicksort	heapsort
there is no reason why the constant c should be the same for quicksort and heapsort

3378293
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort has always been somewhat faster than heapsort in practice but the difference has become larger recently since as mentioned before locality of memory access has become so important to execution speed

3378320
opera	firefox
the following code implements this and works in firefox opera and chromium

3378337
inherited	properties
surely the way to do this if you don t want to alter the original class would be to inherited from the original class and then add your properties to the derived class

3378339
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in firefox and google-chrome

3378421

boost	allocator
to provide efficient allocator i d like to use boost make_shared inside the create function however the compiler complains that my class constructor is protected inside boost make_shared

3378529
wordpress	joomla
if you are talking about keeping login persists within a browser session a cookie way is preferred and is in used by many sites around the world including drupal wordpress and joomla

3378609
width	height
this will constrain the height of all children of the stackpanel to the desired height of the first one or width if the panel is oriented vertically

3378612
jboss	glassfish
another point to keep in mind is jboss glassfish which implement the full java ee stack use more memory and may have longer startup times than say tomcat

3378620
i2c	spi
spi i2c and uarts for various peripherals

3378621
boost	allocator
i think that the boost manual could have explained how the allocator is used more explicitly

3378685
hide	show
you can hide the menu on a init and show it on the onload callback

3378686
postgresql	mysql
because then you can make more complex logic than the database provides and it is also database independent i can move from mysql to postgresql and vice versa and it won t be if you are putting these things in the database

3378712
uiview	subviews
since uiview s implementation does nothing and i presume the same for uicontrol you get total creative freedom to make your uiview subclass subviews be positioned wherever you want them

3378718
ubuntu	linux
recently i ve migrated to arch linux after 4 years being loyal to ubuntu

3378718
ubuntu	debian
i m not willing to do another distro-shuffle and switch back to ubuntu while debian is just too stable for my taste.

3378718
ubuntu	debian
of course you can always install packages within r with install.packages but there are dozens of debian ubuntu r packages and excuse me for saying this but it s painstaking job to track them down

3378718
ubuntu	debian
and how can i port debian ubuntu packages to arch i m

3378718
ubuntu	debian
it would be nice if arch -ers could have out-of-the-box support for r like debian ubuntu suse and fedora users

3378749
min	max
min heap 512m and max heap 1024m

3378781
post	get
in the prg scenario i would have my post action that would then either redirect back to my get action if there is a validation error or redirect to my success get action otherwise

3378883
free	malloc
eventually your program will segfault at one of following free or malloc involving the corrupted memory areas

3378887
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
if you drop down to cfpreferences you could use different preference files for different users but you d lose the convenience of using nsuserdefaults and nsuserdefaultscontroller

3378894
ubuntu	linux	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
now i ve tried it on the latest ubuntu firefox 3.6.7 opera 10.60 internal and the latest linux google-chrome beta from google 5.0.375.99 beta

3378894
opera	google-chrome
opera i do not know about but i often hear about it keeping pace with google-chrome

3378894
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
currently google-chrome is what i want to work and i expect firefox to work in the upcoming release i don t know i just hear them pushing html5 a lot and i have no idea about opera

3378910
postgresql	mysql
i have several years experience with mysql and a few postgresql and oracle

3378927
postgresql	mysql
because then you can make more complex logic than the database provides and it is also database independent i can move from mysql to postgresql and vice versa and it won t be if you are putting these things in the database

subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
there is a php port of the jama standard matrix class for java over on phpmath which provides a suite of methods for martix addition subtraction multiplication division transform etc

3378953
visualvm	jprofiler
some examples from the java world are visualvm and jprofiler

3378976
subtract	add
to generate a darker or lighter vairant a simple possibility is just to add or subtract a fixed number to all three componenents capping it at 0 and 255 0xff

3379042
required	placeholder
another approach would be to use plistbuddy to edit the contents of the plist although it ll required the script to know what entries to set to what values rather than just replacing a placeholder

3379044
ocp	principles
your major problem is that you don t want to change the class itself because this requirement is only for 1 project build i think you are considering solid priniciples one of these principles is ocp open-closed principles that is

3379051
nfa	dfa
it is well-known how one gets from an nfa for a regular language to a minimal dfa

3379084
post	get
the get and post methods formed but when i reference self.person

3379170
fink	macports
fink is essentially apt-get from linux while macports is essentially ports from bsd

3379176
document.write	getelementbyid
rather than using document.write you might want to instead use getelementbyid and then put your html in the innerhtml property of the element that you want the text to be in

3379218
boost	allocator
if you look at n2351 at the end of the allocator proposal they note that boost has implemented the feature and link to an example that was made to demonstrate its use

3379219
rss	feed
if you configure your rss feed to require some kind of authentication you can do user-based metrics instead of ip-based metrics

3379241
width	height
you need to set the width and height attribute of the

3379242
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
but you might want a dedicated reverse proxy in front of node.js something like apache nginx lighttpd etc

3379245
getter	setter
project bean i ve removed all the plain getter and setter methods

3379245
getter	setter
tracker bean again with simple getter and setter removed for readability

3379249
floor	sqrt
isqrt n is floor sqrt n

3379268
width	height
in order to do that i tried to create anew image from my array with the qimage constructor - qimage const uchar data int width int height format format

3379271
client-side	server-side
javascript is by far the most useful of dynamic languages for real-world practical work - not only is it irreplaceable for client-side work on the user s browser but node.js is rapidly making it very interesting for server-side work too

3379271
erlang	scheme	perl	tcl
there is really no syntax used by most of the dynamic languages given these huge syntax differences which grow if you throw into the mix scheme erlang perl php tcl ... so that part of your specs is moot

3379271
erlang	scheme
at the other extreme if you re not necessarily looking for immediately useful knowledge but for mind-broadening scheme or erlang might suit you best but the syntax in each case is quite different from most other languages be warned

3379273
ienumerator	idisposable
however when you enumerate over it you first retrieve an ienumerator by calling the ienumerable.getenumerator method and typically the underlying object you get back does implement idisposable

3379273
ienumerator	idisposable
as the comments indicate ienumerator does not inherit from idisposable even though many typical implementations does whereas the generic does inherit idisposable

3379282
nonetype	iterable
when i try and sort my dictionary i get an error nonetype object is not iterable

3379388
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
android eclipse emulator problem runs wvga hdpi as a mdpi screens

3379442
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i do all my subview setup in viewwillappear not viewdidappear so i dont understand why it isn t initialised in time

3379449
firefox	safari
yes doug neiner s hack solved my flicker problem in firefox and ie6 but created another issue in safari so i have changed it to

3379478
getattr	setattr
i d say python is a very good beginners language but it takes a little time to become really pythonic roughly translatable as being proficient with python s characteristics using features like generators list comprehensions getattr and setattr etc fluently

3379486
int	chars
alternatively you could split the resulting hexadecimal hash into pieces of 2 chars and convert them to int individually but i d expect that to be much slower

3379493
hash	md5
an md5 or sha1 hash in php returns a hexadecimal number so all you need to do is convert bases

3379507
googletest	cxxtest
if the googletest framework doesn t fit your needs you have another great alternative called cxxtest

3379547
width	height
which causes control edges to slightly bleed to adjacent pixels due to width height and dpi pixels not aligning exactly

3379582
hide	show
you can shorten it further by using .hover but since you re just positioning and hiding showing just do a hide show no reason to re-position

3379593
swt	styledtext
i have a simple question really swt documentation says that if you re using styledtext you either implements its api or you implement linestylelistener

3379616
min	max
i have made a max function in which i am calling the min function

3379627
button	checkbox
if you wanted to you could use click handlers to send variables to a function to build the query on the fly using say checkbox and a button or link to getscript

3379644
ienumerable	ilist
i agree with dbones on using ienumerable ilist instead of arrays - you ll end up writing .toarray many times over -

3379658
google-chrome	firefox
i don t care about cross browser compatibility as long as it works in current firefox and google-chrome

3379660
int	double
in my application i ve created the tlist type list intended to store int or double

3379666
folder	directory
i ve read the stack overflow article about obstructed folder files and that folder is now not listed in the repository but it s still showing up with a warning icon when i do a cleanup tortoisesvn reports that it s not a working directory

3379666
folder	directory
when i try to cleanup it s parent folder i get an error that cleanup failed because data is not a working directory

3379720
ant	maven
i am new with maven i have a task to change building of an ear from ant build to maven build

3379720
jar	war
thanks a lot for posting i read the given links how i understood from there the war file and the ejb jar should be deployed to artifactory company repository so that its could be added as dependency in pom file from ear

3379729
icollection	iqueryable
it has similarities to your construction just because a collection supports crud as well the approach i tries means that you can have code that isn t necessarily aware of dealing with a repository as it can be programmed against the icollection or iqueryable interface.

3379769
int	double
using int double or decimal you ll not be able to store the value with the comma

3379773
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome make a request to the actual page itself

3379773
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and earlier versions behave the same as safari and google-chrome but version 3.5 addressed this issue bug 444931 and no longer sends a request

3379793
quicksort	heapsort
introsort goes a step further though -- to limit the worst case complexity if it sees that quicksort isn t working well too much recursion so it could have o n 2 complexity it ll switch to a heapsort which guarantees o n log 2 n complexity and limits stack usage as well

3379793
quicksort	heapsort
therefore even if the quicksort it uses is sloppily written the switch to heapsort will limit stack usage anyway

3379795
int	chars
now as far as i understand the algorithm see my original post for the full code and as the code for the initialization of m2 clearly shows these arrays are meant to hold int numbers not chars so one would think the correct allocations should look like

3379803
hide	show
i m trying to find a good way to make a tap show hide my menus in the same way as ibooks

3379803
hide	show
in order to allow the touches to go through but then of course both things happen and i can t cancel the menu show hide

3379818
int	chars
despite the misleading name chars types in c language are ordinary integral types just like short int long and such

3379818
int	chars
so if in your application it is important to save as much memory as possible it might make sense to use chars instead of int

3379818
int	chars
on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int

3379848
hide	show
if that doesn t do the trick you can always conditionally show hide placeholders from within the nested gv itemdatabound event when e.item.listitemtype is header

3379854
int	chars
in c chars is an int type -- you don t need an ord to get its int value

3379868
integer	unsigned
you should save as an unsigned integer in your database and format on display but still on server-side if this is what you mean by backend.

3379870
width	height
the solution that finally worked for me was to set the inner imageview to have a fixed height and width larger than the largest image add a lot of padding and then set android scrollx and android scrolly in the xml to get the images placed where i needed them

3379880
opera	safari
noted differences in opera mobile early safari neither displaying source like my example above

3379885
min	max
note that rand also accepts min and max arguments in the form of rand min max

3379904
jlist	jfilechooser
specifically i am writing an image viewer program that uses a jfilechooser to select images and on the left side a jlist that shows the contents of the director

3379906
getter	setter
i just don t understand how to use a getter and a setter on a non-static

3379927
udp	tcp
i ve deliberately omitted the transport to use tcp udp whatever

3379932
awt	swing
your form is awt based not swing based so i m afraid my advice on using swingutilities would probably not have helped you even if you had implemented it correctly

3379946
quicksort	mergesort
update here s an example for what i mean a bug in libc from 2000 where quicksort would start thrashing virtual memory because the quicksort implementation would switch internally to mergesort because it though there is enough memory to hold a temporary array

3379981
put	get
i put those into the mysql_connect line but get the same error

3380000
put	get
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

3380017
post	get
after doing some more searching i finally stumbled upon a post here on so which asks the same question here android get real path by uri.getpath

3380025
ubuntu	debian
port from arch no idea as debian and ubuntu work for me

3380043
fadein	fadeout
if you want a fadein fadeout effect on each update try this

3380062
memcached	apc
nothing is shared unless you ve gone out of your way to do so like caching things in apc memcached

3380070
superclass	subclassing
destructor so delete calls the children destructors or a protected non-virtual destructor which prevents the superclass from being delete d as a superclass it must be delete d as a subclassing thus calling the appropriate destructor

3380118
int	chars
considering that chars is 1 byte int is 2 bytes and long is 4 bytes

3380121
nsstring	nsdata
i m not sure about the nsstring version of writetourl atomically but the nsdata version says that it only works with file urls so i wouldn t be shocked if the nsstring version was the same

3380131
folder	directory
this folder seems like completely the wrong place for my project files why don t i have them in my own directory

3380151
getter	setter
for example you can check for null values during the getter or setter

3380160
post	get
when checking that variables passed via get and post are correct i might have something like this

3380166
int	chars
with no padding and assuming sizeof int sizeof chars sizeof long 4 the size of the outer struct will be 13

3380172
pull	push
anyway there are only two methods that i know of called pull and push

3380209
accessor	properties
i m trying to figure out how to use introspection to identify properties on row-objects that are column accessor

3380227
gif	png
the best way i could think not very cute one is to convert the gif to png jpeg and then turn it to gif again p

3380236
rss	feed
looks like there is an rss feed of latest songs

3380236
rss	feed
another thing to be conscious of when you write a program that downloads a site or rss feed is how often your scraping script runs

3380236
put	get
if you have it run constantly so that you ll get the new data the second it becomes available you ll put a lot of load on the site and there s a good chance they ll block you

3380246
gif	png
using phps gd functions and outputting a png instead of a gif

3380252
width	height
so i want to have an image resized to 30 of its original height width

3380261
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
before displaying the listactivity i perform a database query and then hook that data up to the list using a simplecursoradapter

3380287
range	max
this is much better than computing the max each time you add a revision as it avoid a range scan of revisions

3380289
google-chrome	firefox
users are complaining about my site saying that they sign in form is not allowing the firefox and google-chrome browsers to remember password

3380292
post	get
i want to be able to post something to the first table which has only two cells city and city_id via php and then get redirected to the second table where someone can post detail about places of the city houses squares ect city_id is the foreign key here whith an one-to-many relationship

3380309
geany	notepad++
geany is a great lightweight editor -- like notepad++ for linux only better

3380323
width	height
if i give layout_height as fill_parent the view appears very small 35 of width and height

3380340
comparator	comparable
if the items you have itself already implements comparable and its default ordering order is already what you want then you basically don t need to supply a comparator

3380385
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
please be sure to test your image alignment in firefox safari google-chrome or opera 9 or 10

3380398
put	get
so the basic algorithm is to keep everything in the hashmaps and then to search for differences just get an array of keys and search through to see if that key is contained in the other list and if it isn t put it into a storing the value there

3380408
addition	multiplication
in the php part you can use the bitwise operator but you ll first have to convert the string into an array of integers and then do an inner product with the one-time pad xor taking the role of multiplication and concatenation taking the role of addition

3380435
profiler	perf
i don t care about perf for my usages and you shouldn t either unless you have a good reason to and you find out via your profiler that this code is the bottleneck

3380456
gif	png
i m working on a project in php that needs to render dynamically-created svg images to png or gif if not png format

3380458
opera	firefox
the following jquery code works in ie firefox opera

3380458
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome safari the text is selected--very briefly--but then the mouseup event is fired and the text is deselected

3380496
width	height
but from the looks of it it appears all you need is an algorithm to determine the width height and angle of the foot print well probably the darkness instead and then just have an animation on a path geometry to move it

3380508
try-catch	exception-handling
also it is interesting why am i getting exception-handling when i call createifnotcreated for existing database commented try-catch block in appenddb

3380608
versioning	upgrade
note i did get into few issues so i upgrade my versioning to sql server professional

3380659
hash	md5
you just need to append all pairs then append your private key and finally compute the md5 hash of the resulting string

3380661
put	get
as other answers have suggested it may be better to put this helper method into an external class - that way you can get your code under test to deal with edge cases and you also get some reuse

3380673
innodb	myisam
switching from myisam to innodb fixed this

3380679
flac	ogg
it might be a bit more than you re looking for but it is more capable than nssound and supports formats flac musepack ogg vorbis that core audio doesn t handle natively

3380699
children	parent
it would take a huge different when i am searching for a parent window or page that x name was set in it if the elementname searches up meaning starting from near current element up the tree levels children then it s better to use the ancestortype since it won t search the siblings just the ancestors

3380720
post	get
read the record in the post table and use a table hint with rowlock xlockx to get an exclusive lock

3380737
inherited	properties
or you can use mapedsuperclass to map all of your inherited properties whitout using any hibernate jpa inherited strategy

3380754
min	max
it also uses min and max to ensure that

3380786
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
lack of narrow clone capability prohibits an svn cvs like workflow in bazaar hg git so i m hoping they ll be motivated to find some way to do this

3380786
cvs	svn
even svn without real branching tagging support seemed like a step backwards from cvs imo

3380817
implements	extends
in joda i saw that instant class extends abstractinstant and implements readable which is already implements in abstractinstant

3380824
post	get
points will be displayed below the users post count once i get this working

3380846
ant	maven
outside eclipse i use maven ant or the command prompt to invoke the weavers before running the application code

3380905
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you need to see default or current style properties for any element you can use firefox with firebug or google-chrome safari opera developer tools

qsort	strcmp
i believe you can use qsort in combination with strcmp to accomplish the first part

3380949
for-loop	arrays
i know i could run another for-loop with a new arrays and transfer them manually but a one step solution would be awesome

3380952
folder	directory
if you just drag in images into the xcode project tree if you copy them the images will be copied to the root of the project directory instead of the images or other folder you might have set up

3380965
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
however when checking to see if my code was working properly across other major browsers google-chrome opera and safari i found that none of my custom javascript seemed to work

3380988
mouseout	mouseenter
also if you re doing mouseenter and mouseout you might as well just use the hover event that does both of those

3380993
ocaml	prolog	ocaml	scheme	scheme	prolog
more recently i learned functional languages like ocaml scheme and even logic languages like prolog

3380993
scheme	prolog
for example scheme s use of call cc simplifies backtracking a tool required to answer several problems and prolog s logic specification although inefficient due to its brute-force nature can drastically simplify and even automatically solve certain problems that are difficult to wrap one s brain around

3380993
lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
it even makes me question my admiration for said paradigms worrying that i cannot be successful as a lisp scheme prolog programmer in a programming competition

3381080
ftell	fread
here is the updated code with fread and ftell

3381091
ada	pascal
also you can notice that most algorithmic books feature psedudocode in style of pascal or ada and very very rarely - lisp

3381130
haskell	scheme
undergrad students these days may start with scheme haskell python etc. but high-schoolers often self-taught less often. in fact many of the eastern european participants still use pascal and are more amazing with it than the rest of us will ever be with any language

3381131
profiling	debugging
i use jprofiler for profiling and eclipse s debugger for debugging

3381133
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
rather than implement the cors version of xmlhttprequest the ie team have gone with there own propriety object named xdomainrequest

3381133
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
the usage of xdomainrequest has been simplified from xmlhttprequest by having more events thrown with onload perhaps being the most important

3381163
mouse	keyboard
with keyboard and mouse combination

3381167
public	protected
for more information how public private protected work in ruby read this dcarrera ruby 0.3 chp_04 features.html

3381180
free	realloc
if realloc fails it returns null but doesn t free the original memory

3381180
fseek	ftell
also fseek followed by ftell may not give a meaningful result for binary files

3381180
realloc	malloc
you shouldn t cast the return value of malloc or realloc in c since a is implicitly converted to any other object pointer type in c

3381181
backgrounding	multitasking
xmpp will allow your iphone app to receive data even when in the backgrounding using the new multitasking features listening for a socket and i m pretty sure you should find ready to use servers for lamp or at least open source implementations

3381181
backgrounding	multitasking
note that the ios4 multitasking api doesn t support polling in the backgrounding so your only other option should be push notifications

3381187
versioning	upgrade
if your running anything before that then your obviously not upgrading the jvm because of stupid policies scared of the unkown and therefor aren t going to upgrade to newer versioning of software

3381188
interpolation	splines
may i suggest cubic splines interpolation

3381196
quicksort	mergesort
if you look at the arrays.sort methods all the sorts on primitives use quicksort and the sorts on use mergesort

3381200
mouseover	mouseout
it fires the mouseover and mouseout events every time the cursor moves over the various contents of the messages

3381207
backgrounding	multitasking
there s more information about ios 4 multitasking available in apple s guide to what s new in ios 4 and the ios 4 application programming guide s backgrounding tasks section

3381293
post	get
i run it on everything sent via post or get and my goal is to prevent any kind of mysql injections or whatever hackers do

3381307
innodb	myisam
i need both myisam tables and innodb tables in my database i am using hbm2ddl to create them

3381322
int	boolean
however in some situations the current value cannot be provided as an int so this class also provides a boolean isinteger to allow api users to know when intvalue can be safely invoked

3381351
width	height
the result is quite bad as i said the thing returns the image with the right width and height but it s empty so i guess i don t mess the thing up with the threading bit

3381360
teamcity	luntbuild
teamcity luntbuild - depends on team which use this tools

3381390

i m using .net httpwebrequest or webclient class

3381729
onclick	onmousedown
the default methods of onclick onmousedown etc

3381735
google-chrome	firefox
also a good way to debug javascript is to open up google-chrome s console or in firefox use firebugs console and when you perform the action it will usually inform you of a problem or lack thereof

3381741
haskell	ocaml
i want to learn ocaml or haskell and i want to do it by writing a simple game

3381775
width	height
if we simply increase the width and height of an image the width and height will grow in the viewport but what we really want to do is constrain the width and height to what it is on page load and have the image become larger within those bounds

3381845
itemscontrol	gridsplitter
a scrollviewer with a grid with several gridsplitter and a itemscontrol

3381907
put	get
if you add a target called static library you will get the equivalent of an assembly just put all the sources in the target and decide what headers should be published and what should be hidden to the user of your library

3381913
ant	buildr
it s mostly wrapper code around the ant task using antwrap the buildr java integration and inserting it into the project lifecycle

3382053
hash	md5
then the server calculate the hash sha1 md5 or some other from the information send from the client and sign the respond with the server s private key or servers certificate

3382059
dictionary	map
if you store your matrix as a coordinate map any language which has a concurrent dictionary implementation available should do the job for you

3382069
width	margin
right is liquid so no width but to prevent #left from overlapping you give #right a margin of the width of #left - margin 0 0 0 200px

3382072
background-image	background-color
all you have to do is replace the second divs background-color property with the background-image property and nest that div inside your existing div

3382113
post	get
either user get and escape whatcontent or use post and pass whatcontent as the data parameter

3382222
post	get
so instead of returning clonex1 likes your post i get undefined

3382231
post	get
i ll post a note on microsoft connect if others can verify that they too get this problem and of course i hope that either jon mads or eric will take a look at it as well

3382231
post	get
i ll post a description below of how to make the projects if you rather want to get your hands dirty

3382231
invalidprogramexception	badimageformatexception
this in turn leads to odd problems at runtime everything from the result of the method call being considered optimized away the original question or a crash with either badimageformatexception or invalidprogramexception or one of the similar exceptions

3382231
invalidprogramexception	badimageformatexception
i ve seen both invalidprogramexception and badimageformatexception depending on what the cast ended up as

3382316
width	height
now i want to convert it to the proper rect swap x y width and height so i do

3382320
gif	png	gif	ico	png	ico
ico files are mainly image files if you change a jpeg or gif png into ico extension it works fine so if you keep image type cheking it will do the job

3382363
width	height
an alternative might be reduce the width so that the height is always 100px

3382391
width	height
yes browsers can resize images based on width and height attributes however you have no control over the quality of the resized image

3382393
screens	tablet
how about on a standard touch screens laptop tablet or the like i don t have one so i can t test but i would imagine that support is included because as far as i know that table interface just replaces mouse control so as far as the browser is concerned the end-user is really just using a mouse

3382423
int	chars
a chars or short type takes 8 bits and an int can take up to 64 bits

3382423
addition	multiplication
one option if other operations like addition multiplication are not important is to allocate enough memory to store each bcd digit plus one bcd terminator

3382423
addition	multiplication
storing this way will make other operations like addition and multiplication trickier though

3382440
hide	show
i have a div and when you click on it used toggle and show and hide a list div underneath the button

3382443
aptana	radrails

3382498
webclient	webrequest
and then i want to download some sub page html using webrequest or webclient

3382512
drools	jess	jrules	jess
have you thought about using a rules engine such as drools jess or jrules

3382562
lxml	beautifulsoup
look up beautifulsoup or lxml

3382616
webclient	webrequest
if you can retrieve the necessary cookies from the webbrowser control after they are set by the site you are logging into you should be able to use those same cookies with webrequest webclient

3382622
post	get
post and get are class constants and requestmethod is a class variable

3382622
post	get
i have updated the method to specifically check for get and to throw an exception when the request method is not get or post

3382655
public	protected
protected means this is public for my derived classes private for anyone else

3382692
disk	ram
store your oracle database on a san based filesystem you can give it enough ram say 3gb that the whole database is in ram and so disk seek access never stores your application down

3382692
disk	ram
if you can t afford a san mount a ram disk and install your database on there then use db level replication like logshipping to provide failover

3382699
hebrew	thai
hebrew and leelawadee for thai and

3382716
backtracking	greedy
in theory there should be no cases where a choice between greedy and non-greedy causes a re to match in one case and fail in another -- it should only affects what gets matched and as you mention performance not whether the match succeeds at all since res are supposed to backtracking for the purpose

3382769
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
no expensive multiplication division or modulo operators

3382808
hash	md5
i just want to be sure what hash algorithm was used on these strings i m not sure if it s md5

3382812
folder	directory
i want the images folder to be a folder in the same directory as my script file wherever it may be stored

3382827
hash	salt
any hash function worth its salt will spread the hash values evenly throughout the entire output space so if you have just a bunch of outputs there s no way to tell hash functions apart

3382877
hash	md5
it fits md5 hash form length-wise but it could be just as well sha1 hash stored in char 32 field

3382879
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
have a look at datainputstream dataoutputstream objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

3382901
outputstream	inputstream
sockets neither deal with nor with but with inputstream and outputstream which are used to read and write bytes

3382917
sorting	filtering
filtering and sorting during search

int	boolean
com.google.android.googlelogin.googleloginservicehelper.getaccount activity activity int requestcode boolean requiregoogle

3383169
tinyint	boolean
for legacy issues i need to map the boolean to a tinyint not to a bit

google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox but for some reason the page i want to get is not loading in google-chrome v 5.0

3383209
wan	lan
eddiec is right if the computers are located inside the same sub-network lan or if the computers ip is their interface to the internet wan public ip

3383215
hide	show
i am trying to avoid redundant show hide effects if possible since not every instance of this sliding pane have such requirements

3383245
vim	kate
kate has vim mode

3383254
hide	show
i will probably use some jquery for collpsing a decade block that show or hide the ten years inside it ten little boxes when clicking those boxes users will be taken first to the detailed year page and then to the detailed event page in case thhey cklick on one of the events

3383271
listview	gridview
i have tried using a listview gridview but it seems to use too much space when there are only a few items below each category

3383300
postgresql	mysql
this question is for both mysql and postgresql

3383311
rss	feed
your rss feed only contains seven items

3383311

browsers will not trim rss feed

3383311
rss	feed
you need to find a bigger rss feed

3383314
children	parent
i have a typical one to many relationship between the parent and children

3383314
children	parent
i am wondering if i have parent that know about their children is it

3383323
super	self
return super caradmin self .get_form request obj none kwargs

3383330
many-to-many	one-to-many
if the relationship is truly one-to-many and not many-to-many then you would leave parent_id on the child table as the foreign key and drop the parent_has_children table altogether

3383336
children	parent
if the relationship is 1 parent to many children the same child can only belong to exactly one parent then the standard modelling approach is to reference the parent table from the child table via one of the parent s key columns usually the parent s primary key pk

3383400
hide	show
cookie value show hide

3383404
explode	implode
fetch the whole string from memcached explode the values into an array remove the element you want to remove implode the new array and store it back into memcached

3383437
int	double
this result is not surprising in the first d you passed a double where an int was expected

3383438
int	double
both printf statements are invalid because you re using a format specifier expecting a int but you re only giving it a float double

3383473
post	get
i am supposed to send a post request like that to the web server and get a string returned to me

3383508
pop-up	dialog
if by jumping window you mean the modal dialog that pop-up this can be achieved by using the jquery ui dialog plugin

2 put all the code you have in onstart into oncreate

3383528
rss	feed
there s also an rss feed uri in the header of the project home - updates tab

3383528
firefox	safari
safari and i assume firefox exposes it or you can extract it from the page source

3383537
int	double
an int is a 32-bit value and a double is a 64-bit value

3383543
decoder	encoder
the reason this wasn t working for me was because of an issue elsewhere in my code where i stupidly neglected to implement the message response encoder decoder

3383551
getter	setter
hibernate does use reflection and in some cases the object s id might be a private member with private setter getter because it is of no use in the java domain

3383552
width	height
you can either create a large size image 2000px width height and set it as a background with background-position 50 50

3383581
hide	show
i need a way to show in one view and hide in one view

3383606
hash	md5
file_attribute_directory check is much faster than a check based upon the md5 of the file which requires opening and performing the actual hash of the file

3383621
getter	setter
using capital letters for regular methods and camelcase for getter and setter means that more important regular methods are not cluttering up the namespace with gets sets

3383621
getter	setter
so within the class since things go in ascii-betical order your real methods come first and your getter and setter last

3383643
post	put
as we re not allowed to put any serious development into the legacy site it s also in old school asp a language i don t care to learn. i can t do a proper single sign-on solution so i proposed the following on login the legacy site performs an ajax post to the login controller of the new beta site logging the user in there it then simply proceeds with the login on the legacy site as normal

3383643
hash	salt
the other idea i had was to pass a salt hash of the user s details across with their username when they try to access the 2nd site

3383644
profiling	debugging
debugging and profiling come to mind immediately -- they need to be able to get a more complete view of the internals of objects

3383645
rss	feed
one of the things i do is follow the rss feed of r questions on so

3383656
mbunit	nunit
alternatively mbunit has the option of creating parallelizable tests and as mbunit has pretty much the same syntax as nunit it might not take that much effort to make the switch

3383664
put	get
if you just want to get all string literals out of your c# code to put them into your resource file i suggest not to parse your c# code but the il code generated by the c# compiler that ist much

3383680
freebsd	linux
however freebsd has a good linux compatibility layer where you can run linux binaries that are compiled against the linux syscall interface on freebsd

3383680
freebsd	linux
see chapter 10 linux binary compatibility of the freebsd handbook for more information

3383702
free	malloc
also this snippet by itself does not free the malloc d memory although i m assuming this is done elsewhere

3383720
rtp	rtsp
in red5 we are adapting an rtp rtsp library written using mina

3383725
post	get
since the post request in a post redirect get prg pattern returns a redirect 303 see other status code on success is it at all possible to inform the client of the specific flavour of success they are to enjoy eg

3383739
free	malloc
malloc and free are like nsobject alloc and nsobject release in objective-c

3383739
free	malloc
a malloc without a free is then by definition a memory leak

3383742
3des	aes	rsa	aes	rsa	3des
we ve even done simple stuff like rsa 3des and aes encryption and decryption in hw

3383755
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba

the result should include object ilist icollection ienumerable and icloneable

3383876
put	get
to get the desired variable definition simply put the instruvtion from the above code in the body of the variable

3383895
ostringstream	std
for rounding to render to gui use std ostringstream

3383949
folder	directory
as stated by raulriera your problem probably lies in the cfdirectory call to create the new folder it will error out if the directory already exists

3383962
hide	show
consider using the element and rather than adding new ones hide show them to ensure functionality in non-js browsers

3383979
gtk	gdk
appears in gtk and gdk crashes

3383986
actionscript	mxml
autocomplete for actionscript files seems to work great but i don t seem to get the same result when i am editing actionscript inside the script block in a mxml file

3384012
put	get
also the myapp file has to get put in usr lib myapp

3384020
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome safari on my mac panel1 renders above panel2

3384020
google-chrome	firefox
but on firefox google-chrome on my windows machine it renders underneath

3384046
webkit	gecko
this occurs in both webkit and gecko

3384132
google-chrome	safari
my problems is that some tables do not display the right side borders with browsers that use webkit safari and google-chrome

3384135
free	malloc
write custom memory manager that ll override new delete and will provide malloc free alternatives if you use them that will grab large chunk of memory lock all unused memory with virtualprotect

3384135
stderr	fflush
dump a lot of text debug information into file or stderr - parameter values arrays everything you suspect could be related to crash fflush after every write to file otherwise some info will be lost during the crash

3384140

first you can create a directory hard-link or junction from the system drive android folder to the one in your user profile

3384173
cdr	cons
cons car x word cdr x

3384208
int	double
the general pattern for dynamically allocating a 2d array of type t where t can be int double etc. is

3384233
getter	setter
if your object literal has a value property it cannot have getter or setter and vice versa

3384233
getter	setter
your object literal cannot have more than one getter or setter with the same name

3384235
getter	setter
javascript getter and setter

3384239
getter	setter
javascript does in fact support getter and setter now

3384239
getter	setter
john s article does a good job at mentioning several different ways of defining getter setter on javascript objects but doesn t do a good job at describing when each method is applicable

3384239
getter	setter
getter and setter with javascript

3384294
rss	feed
rss feed readers will periodically update without being asked to by a human

3384384
rss	feed
you add a library that allows you to generate rss feed

3384413
mouse	keyboard
we first notice that simple functions like find usages return bogus results or nothing then it slows down considerably and finally the mouse stops working while the keyboard becomes extremely slow

3384486
multiplying	subtract
one possibility for a compact timestamp for replay purposes... set the time as a floating point number of seconds since the epoch with time.time multiplying by 50 since you said you re repeating this 50 times a second the resulting unit one fiftieth of a second is sometimes called a jiffy truncate to int subtract from the similar int count of jiffies since the epoch that you measured at the start of your program and struct.pack the result into an unsigned int with the number of bytes you need to represent the intended duration -- for example with 2 bytes for this timestamp you could represent runs of about 1200 seconds 20 minutes but if you plan longer runs you d need 4 bytes 3 bytes is just too unwieldy imho

3384522
getter	setter
for this simple example you could alternately use an atomicinteger rather than synchronizing the setter getter

3384531
hide	show
and in general what is the best way to show and hide dom elements

3384546
free	malloc
i would propose you use only c++ stuff here and not mix in c malloc free

3384604
uptime	reboot
it would be used in my case for an irc chat bot that i would have load and instantiate plugins on the fly so that i would no need to reboot the bot and uptime would be very long

3384606
int	boolean
also as someone rightly pointed out deleted now bitwise or deals with int not boolean

3384620
firefox	safari
i wrote the tests in python and am using rc to run the tests in ie7 8 firefox and safari on the mac so far so good

3384623
lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
there are probably more people taking a course in java right now than the total number of people who ve ever written any lisp scheme or prolog

3384720
queue	fifo
one approach to implementing a set of threads executing in a fcfs manner would be create a fifo queue protect it with a mutex and within this queue put tokens that allow threads to know when it is their turn to run

3384725
atomic	interlocked
essentially for atomic assignment to int64s you should look at using the interlocked class

3384725
atomic	interlocked
in particular check out the section labeled atomic and interlocked

3384796
hide	show
in your html tags put an id to each span you want to show and hide on hover

3384800
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
either how to do synchronous request of just the head after redirect or how to block nsoperation where an nsurlconnection is used until nsurlconnection asynchronously fetches the header information

3384804
goto	break
the goto statement along with break and continue in some languages also lets you structure programs to behave like overlapped scopes

3384814
hash	md5
the first one i am certain i can achieve but the second project is going to be pretty difficult i believe as unlike most hash calculators out there i do not only need to check individual files for sha md5 crc-32 crc-16 but i also need to check compact flash through a usb-connected sandisk cf reader and eeproms through a com or usb connection as well

3384850
pop-up	dialog
when user selects this task from the menu a new dialog window pop-up and takes parameters required from the user and it has a progress bar which shows the progress of the task

3384870
integer	unsigned
for a 32-bit unsigned integer this should move a value up to the closest power of 2 that is equal or greater

3384871
jar	manifest.mf
i checked manifest.mf in this jar - it contains right main-class but when i type java -jar target burner-1.0-snapshot.jar i still see an error failed to load main-class manifest attribute from

3384871
jar	manifest.mf
i discovered that now there are two manifest.mf files in the jar

3384918
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank shall be converted to the type of the operand with greater rank

integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

3384918
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type the operand with unsigned integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3384918
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands shall be converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

3384919

3385297
post	get
because get and post do not have the same semantic value

3385297
post	get
get requests should be generally safe to perform at any time without compromising the system while post requests should be used when doing something important like accepting a monetary transaction or in a less dramatic way post a comment or something like that

maven	pom.xml
we have been using maven with osgi we declare the bundle dependencies in its pom.xml and you don t have to worry about them anymore

3385623
int	chars
a good rule of thumb is to choose the variable type according to its semantics chars is for ascii chars int for int and so on ... rather than to its size except to align your structures

3385623
int	chars
on a 32bits architecture the size of a processor registry is 32bits so using accessing a chars 8 bits takes two operations while accessing an int is only one

3385644
int	chars
in simple case int vs unsigned chars gives the same code for me

i am having iis anonymous authentication set for website on server.however i want to use active directory group to validate user credentials.here is the setting in web.config for folder security

3385687
int	chars
the case of int versus unsigned chars is more complex

3385687
int	chars
an int will be at least as large as a chars or the chars obviously couldn t be the smallest addressable unit of memory and it must be able to hold any value from -32 767 to +32 767

3385687
int	chars
this may or may not correspond to any actual machine. the chars will be 8 bits and the int likely 16

3385687
int	chars
operations on int are likely expensive so a chars might be faster

3385687
int	chars
although chars types especially unsigned chars can be used as tiny int doing so is sometimes more trouble than it s worth

3385687
int	chars
the compiler will have to emit extra code to convert between chars and int making the executable larger and unexpected sign extension can be troublesome

versioning	upgrade
upgrading to a newer versioning of python will be the best solution but if for some reason you can t upgrade you could update the code to use the and-or trick

3386233
stdout	stderr
i would expect ignoring that stdout and stderr are printed in my contrived example - but first line should exit with 0 which i would expect ruby would interperate as false and display exit failure sure so the logic is wrong the ternary needs to be flipped - but the second line should exit with the opposite status and it doesn t

3386260
getter	setter
because you can transparently from client code s perspective change the implementation of the setter getter wheras you cannot do the same if you expose the underlying property directly as it would not be binary compatible.

3386265
post	get
when you pass the object to jquery.ajax or the get post wrappers it will be serialized into get or post variables not sent as json so your object would be converted into something like this

3386483
post	get
a common example of command query separation on the web is post redirect get

3386483

stateless	stateful
pop or imap work through http wouldn t make much sense stateful vs stateless but my understanding is that socks would allow me to do what i want

3386768
hide	show
their reasoning is that the user is often going to be entering data in a modal form so they are trying to be helpful and keep the keyboard visible where ordinarily various transitions within the modal view can cause the keyboard to show hide repeatedly

3386770
post	put
now based on my previous post it is my understanding that any object that uses idisposable needs to be put in a using and sqldatareader inherits from idisposable so i need to put it

3387477
min	max
what you are doing currently is subtracting max from min while the numbers are still of type int - which necessarily overflows

3387477
min	max
a signed int is fundamentally incapable of representing the difference between its min and max

3387489
children	parent
in css the overflow hidden is set on parent containers in order to allow it to expand with the height of their floating children

3387835
int	chars
in c a chars is a type of int and it s most typically one byte wide

3387835
int	chars
in other languages a chars is a completely different thing from an int as it should be and has to be explicitly encoded to turn it into a byte

3387835
serializable	deserialization
the things you want to google for are serializable and deserialization

3387876
int	double
note that this works on double so if you want a float or an int you will need to cast

inherited	subclassing
perhaps you could pull out common behaviour between your error classes into a single base class called error and then inherited from this to produce more concise or project-specific subclassing

3387993
equals	gethashcode
i had a few problems with how i implemented gethashcode and equals for the isnmpdatasource implementations but formalizing a definition of equality pretty much fixed all those problems

3387998
width	height
with iframes you may run into scrollbar issues if the content is loaded from an external site and the width and height is not known in advance

3387998
width	height
the very hacky solution to reporting the width and height from a remote site being loaded in an iframe was simply not worth the trouble

as a third alternative you could also define and match against the uppercase version though i would advise against this unless you have a good reason for creating a capitalize requestlist

3388082

3388319
expression-blend	silverlight
i am a bit confused about the difference between silverlight and expression-blend

3388319
expression-blend	silverlight
meaning you can use silverlight without having to use expression-blend there is much demand for silverlight developers but i from what i know silverlight is pretty easy to grasp

3388321
unsigned	short
edit the and operator makes it unsigned since the sign bit is the first bit of the short and you copy the 8 bits holding the value of the byte to the last 8 bits of the short

3388332
width	height
you should then be able to specify width and height exactly and uniformly across all browsers

3388363
rss	feed
the problem lies in building my rss feed

3388372
put	get
i could manually add a virtual folder not application because i would need to access some sharepoint site s data to my sharepoint site in iis and manually edit site s web.config file to register my http module and add my custom configuration section as well either putting my dlls into gac or put them in the _app_bin so i don t have problems with cas but i don t think that s a good thing to do because this web application may get deployed in an environment where this shouldn t couldn t be possible

unsigned	short
now if you ve provided the actual code there is no difference between uint16 and uint32 since you ve defined them both as unsigned short

assuming that only keyboard and not mouse input is captured you could type the password out of order moving the cursor with the mouse

3389126
width	height
definitely avoid doing this if the bitmap s width x height x 4 45 mb give or take

3389203
width	height
in javascript you can get the height and width of the viewport and this will give you an idea of how big the user s window is

3389228
children	parent
basically i m trying to implement a design where each item has a parent that will be of one specific type and children that will be of a different type

3389228
children	parent
then itemb would have a parent of itema type and children all of itemc type

3389228
children	parent
itemc would have parent of itemb and children of itemd type

3389228
children	parent
i thought it would be neater to do this using generics to avoid unnecessary casts since i know what type the parent and children will be for each of my inherited classes

alternatively you could use the abstract class and a marker type system.void would be ideal but i don t think it would compile for the end cases and check for it from the parent children properties and throw an exception

google-chrome	firefox
i found a workaround using in the browser instead of appears to work in all three of internet explorer firefox and google-chrome

3389360
folder	dir
had the same issue in my case the cause was that the web.config file was missing in the virtual dir folder

3389367
children	parent
to be honest i would probably just declare the separate classes with their own parent children properties of the right type

3389367
children	parent
the only thing you are repeating here is the parent and children property field

3389367
children	parent
unless of course that functionality needs access to the parent children â but then youâ re back to square one even in your solution.

public	protected
they re different than normal variables as they don t have the in front of them and can t have any visibility modifiers public protected private before them

3389518
boost	stl
boost qt the stl .

3389519
post	get
and all the get and post values are magically cleaned or removed so i don t need to worry about someone elses sql-injectable plugin

3389539
width	height
even when customizing the div where the image is injected the width and height of the div are overridden and set to 300x57

3389590
typedef	struct
i prefer to use typedef for the struct

3389634
subclass	abstract-class
make outboxmanager an abstract-class and provide a subclass per vendor

3389659
subtract	add
doubling a digit is trivial and if the result is greater than 10 you just subtract 10 and add a carry to the next digit

3389665
nsstring	nsdata
the value parameter can be only property list objects nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

3389690
folder	directory
the source directory has two folder in it media and source

3389751
apache	nginx
alternatively there might be a way of getting nginx to restart itself on code change - it s certainly possible with apache and mod_wsgi

3389780
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox and google-chrome iron

3389908
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable implements ienumerable so when you call asenumerable you are changing the extension-methods being called from there on ie from the iqueryable -methods to the ienumerable -methods ie changing from linq to sql to linq to objects in this particular case

3389909
installation	upgrade
obviously if this is your only customer then you either need to accommodate their needs or convince them of the need to upgrade their .net installation

3389912
ienumerable	iqueryable
the problem is that an iqueryable what the statement is before the asenumerable call is also an ienumerable so that call is in effect a nop

3389935
put	get
probably not the most efficient answer but you could do a query before this one to get the number of entries in the table and then put that in the showposts numposts part of the query you have here

3389938
tabcontrol	tabitem
i m using the tabcontrol class in wpf and i ve noticed that the content of each tabitem has a default margin of 4 pixels on all sides

3389951
int	chars
you could split the strings by the space chars convert both parts to int and then use linq

3390025
hide	show
basically - at the beginning of the tellafriend function i ve looped through all of the elements of the table row tr with the class dn and used hide to hide it - then if there are still any missing values - they will show up again

3390066
disk	ram
additionally wikipedia says you can use the ram disk to access but again gives no reference to the implementation

3390067
jar	war
i include this jar along the gwt-servlet.jar in the web-inf lib of the war

3390088
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
as of ios 3.2 uiscrollview does not listen to touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended etc

3390094
width	height
these buffers are really just big 2d arrays each the width x height of your screen

3390096
wordpress	joomla
some of the most popular content management systems like drupal joomla and wordpress are built with php

3390108
filtering	grouping
these are all essentially fairly similar - they are all displayed on users activity streams on the grouping pages that they are posted to on the user profiles of users who posted them and filtering in similar ways - show me everything that happened in the last 7 days for grouping x with the tag y

3390115
idictionary	ilist
the keyedcollection class is a hybrid between a collection based on the ilist generic interface and a collection based on the idictionary generic interface

3390200
hash	salt
if you use varchar either make sure the bytes are either valid characters or force the bytes to ascii before you save the hash and salt

3390214
profiling	benchmarking
as ever i d go for the clearest code until you have benchmarking profiling data to indicate that this really is a bottleneck

3390259
expander	grid
i would like to combine the two middle grid into an expander and see how that looks but just wrapping them into an expander is not possible since it can only have one child

3390262
mp3	ogg
i ve got a bunch of audio files let s say ogg or mp3 with metadata

3390274
width	margin
find out what the lowest resolution your customers use is and shave 50 or so pixels off that for scroll bars and a little margin and use that for your width

3390282
mp3	ogg
you take an existing mp3 or ogg client look at what library it uses and then write a binding for said library to r using the existing client as guide for that side -- and something like rcpp as a guide on the other side to show you how to connect c c++ libraries to r

3390446
rss	feed
i m working on making a modification to a site built with asp c# and one of the tasks was to add in the display of 2 rss feed - one from the site s internal blog and the other from the site s twitter account

3390484
hash	md5
the problem is that the same code on the same file gives different md5 hash results in each environment

3390484
hash	md5
it is the same code on each end and i am using python 2.6.5 for both windows linux environments when i run this on the same file in different environments i get md5 hash that do not match

3390547
google-chrome	firefox
i can t find a good way of doing this with firefox or google-chrome

3390549
apache	nginx
using apache or nginx i always create development sites based on real projects such as which after adding to my .hosts file the browser has no problem using

3390553
boost	stl
templates and stl boost

3390581
folder	directory
turns out that you can put any jar file into the ext folder c program files java jdk1.6.0_21 jre lib ext and c program files java jre6 lib ext and java will automatically considered it part of the classpath check it out ext directory java glossary

3390621
codeigniter	cakephp
two of the most popular frameworks that i m aware of are codeigniter and cakephp

3390705
hash	md5
most md5 sha1 libraries return hash base64 encoded in which case varchar would suffice

3390763
midi	osc
if html5 is an option you could try to generate osc events using websockets and convert them to midi signals using a server proxy

3390773
children	parent
you can do a depth-first search over the tree without needing to cache the minimum and maximum values for each subtree in a single pass but you have to be careful as comparing the values between and parent and its children is not enough

3390800
int	boolean
i have managed to write int and boolean with no problems just cant get past the text problem on my own

3390816
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade if possible or find a versioning of the massivecoupon package that is compatible with python 2.4

3390826
filesystems	hfs
the resource fork is implemented in all of the filesystems used for system drives on the macintosh mfs hfs and hfs plus

3390826
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems provides applications the ability to create alternate data streams of information

3390849
hash	md5
a token would be fine i would use an md5 or sha1 hash for it

3390863
post	get
you could also redirect them to a special site where they have to click a button spezified in the mail to verify their identidy or let them enter a pin from the mail so you can be sure not to send all critical data per get but per post important in a public place

3390913
getter	setter
here s my class hierarchy lombok generated constructors getter setter ommitted for brevity

3390967
mvp	presenter
i can t help but look at this problem and think that a mvp presenter per view not screen is a more elegant solution

3391004
mouseleave	mouseenter
in parts of our program we slide it out based on a mouseenter event and slide it back in on a mouseleave event however we are currently using a 3rd party library s treeview for this which i have been tasked with replacing

3391004
mouseleave	mouseenter
the scrollbar does not fire mouseenter or mouseleave for the control and that makes using mouseenter mouseleave for sliding out the control unusable since the user can not use the scrollbar

3391004
mouseleave	mouseenter
in the previous question i was given the advice to use spy++ and attempt to attach to wndproc to handle mouseenter mouseleave for the scrollbar

3391011
opera	firefox
both statements are true for firefox 3.6.7 and opera 10.60

3391024
pull	push
just replace git pull with git svn rebase and git push with git svn dcommit and you can actually keep 90 of your git workflow and still be talking to an svn server

3391034
equals	gethashcode
the benefit of doing that is that you can use the struct as the key to a dictionary the equals and gethashcode methods should already work adequately

3391049
put	get
as such what i really want to do is make a call to the database get data back and put the data in the appropriate locations in my existing rails friendly mysql database

3391062
client-side	server-side
i just don t get this javascript based serialization server-side when javascript runs in the browser and is client-side

3391063
hide	show
if the user touches the button which moves along with the user scroll i am planning to show or hide the nav and tab bar

3391087
width	height
i maintain a small perl library that extracts width height from images for people who want that functionality without using a larger more generalized library

3391180
width	height
but there might be a default width and height

3391180
width	height
i think that the width in pixels of the metafile is the 5th cardinal of the file and the height in pixels the 6th cardinal

3391202
yslow	pagespeed
3 hour expiry might not be enough time for the yslow pagespeed stuff and they might complain about it

3391209
put	get
and for some reason it just refuses to simply put that base64 back into the byte ...there must be some other way to get it to work.

3391214
backgrounding	multitasking
however after killing the process from multitasking running in the backgrounding the app tries to resume from the point where it left and it freezes which means i cant start the app anymore

3391269
hash	salt
if an attacker is able to obtain the hash and salt from the database using sql injection or an insecure backup then he has to find the plain text by brute forcing it

3391269
hash	salt
john the ripper is commonly used to break salt password hash

3391277
public	protected
remember - public protected and private are controls on default visibility nothing more

3391293
metaclass	subclassing
if the answer involves metaclass note that class a is itself a subclassing of another class -- django.db.models.model -- with a pretty elaborate metaclass.

3391342
awt	swing
it is able to run java code under the clr including some awt swing support

3391356
chown	chmod
if you have a script or a command you could put it in bin and set the appropiate owner and permisions using chmod and chown

3391362
rss	feed
i want to write a shell script to get an image from an rss feed

3391373
width	height
exactly as he said i had to bind my top level container layout width and height to scene.width and scene.height

3391379
width	height
yeah i know it suppose to get that automatically if no height and width defined in the container where you re placing a user control

3391384
nsstring	nsdata
on the objective-c side a combination of nsdata and nsstring

3391385
width	height
setting a font size for a text so that it fits a static width height div best or splitting text with images and tables to screens yet still i think your case is not worth messing with javascript

3391386
children	parent
if i load the entire table with fetch join on the parent and children a single select loads all the records and i can happily traverse the tree

3391386
children	parent
i m just trying to figure out a way to support a simple nested item s list where i can retrieve any parent node and its children with a single select

3391394
width	height
i know it can be done by overriding onsizechanged and manually modifying the new height width but that causes flicker since it is resized once before the event is called to a size not matching the aspect ratio and then resized again to the correct aspect ratio

3391403
width	height
just don t set the width and height properties

3391403
width	height
it will then take on whatever width and height its child requires

3391406
post	put
i put the stuff i learnt in a blog post which hopefully you will find useful

3391412
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the apt-file command will tell you what package you can install to get a particular file

3391412
ubuntu	debian
if you re going to compile a c or c++ program on debian or ubuntu start by installing the build-essential package

3391413
width	height
also the code does not determine where it is the best width or height to use for splitting the matrix into subranges for x or y coordinates according to the matrix size

3391413
width	height
it just uses the same static subrange sizes of 16 for both coordinates but it could be conveniently any other small power of 2 but a non power of 2 would slow down the int indexof int int and int offsetof int int internal methods independantly for both coordinates and up to the maximum width or height of the matrix.ideally the compact method should be able to determine the best fitting sizes

3391413
int	double
but this code shows how you assign non-zero values and reallocate the data array for additional non-zero subranges and then how you can optimize with compact after assignments have been performed using the setat int i int j double value method the storage of this data when there are duplicate subranges that may be unified within the data and reindexed at the same position in the subrangepositions array

3391413
int	double
the improvement is visible in the double getat int int method

3391413
multiplying	subtract
however if get access is very fast and set is quite fast compact may be very slow if there are lots of common subranges to compress for example when subtract a large non-sparse randomly-filled matrix with itself or multiplying it by zero it will be simpler and much faster in that case to reset the trie by instanciating a new one and dropping the old one

3391413
factors	matrix
tries can avoid all collisions and can then warranty to save linear o n time to o 1 time in the worst cases where n is the number of possible collisions which in case of sparse matrix may be up to the number of non-default-value cells in the matrix up to the total number of size of the matrix times a factors proportional to the hashing filling factors for a non-sparse full matrix

3391416
button	checkbox
note i dont want the click function because i use another button to tick or untick 20 checkbox at the same time for example

3391427
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve also been able to disable page caching in ie and firefox but cannot do so in safari and google-chrome

3391427
google-chrome	safari
hitting the back button still shows the form-filled data in safari and google-chrome

3391458
width	height
it s just my guess but i d try covering everything with a transparent div 100 width height while dragging and assuring it s above iframes and under the dragged thingie

3391549
cos	sin
do the sin and cos functions take radians or degrees

3391599
int	boolean
using bits you re able to store a lot of boolean switches into a single int

3391614
put	get
reverse their order to get the bytes to put in the id value

3391634
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome safari but in ie8 the parent div with the yellow border in the bottom will not resize

3391641
width	height
to keep proportions the same you need to multiply both the width and the height by the same scaling factor

3391641
width	height
in the code below i ve added two additional constraints the resulting thumbnail width or height will always be 1 and the scaling factor will will always be 1 so that the thumbnail isn t larger than the original

3391675
accessor	properties
also notice that i was able to get rid of the set accessor on the canexecutethread properties as it was no longer required with this solution

3391707
128bit	64bit
that allow to achieve atomicity on load store operations that are larger than the machine s native pointer size 64bit operations on 32bit processors and 128bit operations on 64bit processors

3391708
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
after trying around i found a solution if i implemented all these interfaces - icollection ilist ilist icollection ienumerable it started working in blend

3391764
typeerror	attributeerror
put_an_explict_exception_here should be replaced with something like attributeerror or typeerror or valueerror or maybe something else

3391766
nswindow	nsbutton
then just to make sure i created a new project no code at all and i can reproduce the issue with a clean nswindow with a nstoolbar with one nstoolbaritem with a nsbutton in it

3391828
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu also has their rcpp version of the rcpp debian package so you could just do sudo apt-get install r-cran-rcpp but that may be a dated version alas

3391891
width	height
i am now setting the cropper s width s and height vars to defined values that fit my website structure

3391951
implements	extends
maybe this was somehow more efficient to implements or maybe they were thinking that as the calendar class is supposed to be extensible to any calendar so if you wanted to create say mayancalendar extends calendar that you could then define new constants for katun and baktun and so forth and it would work with the existing set and get functions

3391986
apache	nginx
i have nginx as a reverse proxy for apache using mod_wsgi to run django

3391986
apache	nginx
edit 2 the problem is definitely either with nginx or the interaction between nginx and apache

3391986
apache	nginx
so either nginx is dropping the port or somehow apache is getting confused by nginx acting as the proxy.whatever

3392006
rss	feed
i have a tab that parses a rss feed

3392018
google-chrome	firefox
i have not tested if this will effect firefox or google-chrome though

3392022
int	chars
of basic values chars int

3392097
public	protected
in php if you don t redeclare protected public static fields in the subclasses they will all belong to the same reference set

3392157
pop-up	dialog
the partial view with this script is a jquery ui dialog listing addresses and i want to pop-up another jquery ui dialog on top of it to edit the record clicked

3392164
photoshop	paint.net
then read that in with photoshop or paint.net or something and use the eyedropper tool

3392169
post	get
you have to pass the data in data you can t pass the data in the url if you use post you can only do so with get

3392188
width	height
is it left top right bottom or top left bottom right or top height left width etc.

3392196
post	get
this blog post can get you started

3392206
google-chrome	safari
for me soap worked for safari but did not work in google-chrome android

3392220
geocoding	geocode
the google geocode which supports reverse geocoding returns address_components

3392265
unsigned	short
odp is typedef d to unsigned short

3392267
dictionary	map
i load these aliases into a dictionary object and then when i have a name to map i convert it to lowercase to avoid any problems with differing capitalisation and then look it up in the dictionary

3392286
comparator	icomparer
check out the two parameter overload of binarysearch which takes an icomparer as the second parameter - you then need to create a small class that inherits from icomparer that will compare the names of two of your track objects and pass an instance of this comparator into the binarysearch

3392294
put	get
you do not necessarily lose flexibility as you can present automatically created information at the template level for example a picture named like the year or the decade to be put in the page or link human generated one to a given page with views for example you could have nodes of type year description that you tag with the same taxonomy you use for events so that when you filter with the taxonomy term 1945 you will get a list of nodes events and one node year description in your result and the template views will take care of using different node types in different way

3392324
put	get
don t know if this helps but i put my validation attributes against my model so that wherever i use the model i get the same validation

3392351
width	height
now it has a width and a height but nothing is showing up inside of it

3392406
abc	subclassing
subclassing an abc can and does give you plenty of methods implemented for free by the abc on top of those you re having to define yourself

3392413
pull	push
since they intend to be a cms for editing already made static sites you may use it and if needed you can pull some page from ftp edit it and then push it back

3392474
hide	show
the more recent scaladoc may be slightly more helpful in particular the new version of scaladoc allows you to show hide concrete members so you can focus on what you must implement

3392488
integer	unsigned
typically your method needs to take an unsigned integer argument

3392512
width	height
what i would like to do is insert dynamic values for height and width in javascript i get them like this

3392512
width	height
now i need a jquery selector or command to select the rel attribute of all the links on page that are wired up to shadowbox see shadowbox value in rel and if they contain shadowbox and height and width replace those two placeholders with actual values at runtime

3392534
hide	show
i want this effect but working like the above page the visible div hide when you click to show another

3392545
post	get
the problem is that i have not been able to find a way to get the comments for a specific post if i have only the post url and the blogid

3392545
post	get
the postid cannot be reliably scraped from the html as far as i can tell and it seems like the postid is required to get the comments for a single post

3392545
post	get
also the get most recent post for a blogid api call is only helpful if the post is one of the most recent 10 or 15 so if it is a slightly older post i probably cannot use that option

3392572
post	get
i have tried capturing the ajax requests thinking that i could get the raw request once and just have to change like a pagenum post parameter or something to load in a new page but it turns out they do some funky stuff with asp that has some very long hex string post parameters that change on each request

3392579
sorting	grouping
but i think you can use the nsdateformatter to chop the time component that you don t care about when sorting dates into grouping

3392651
treemap	treeset
hashset and treeset are basically the same as hashmap and treemap except the key and value are the same thing

3392696
outputstream	inputstream
the client uses outputstream and inputstream just from the socket.get

3392696
outputstream	inputstream
the client also uses outputstream and inputstream

3392755
google-chrome	firefox
everything looks fine in firefox and google-chrome but in internet explorer the last image is pushed down vertically a bit

3392771
post	get
normally a form would use the post action but in this case if you refresh the page with the posted form you will not get anything in query string because query string only gets passed via the get action

3392774
post	get
in asp there are two primary methods of passing parameters in the url string via get or from a form post

3392794
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i recently read that in stringwriter and stringreader are used for writing and reading from stringbuilder

3392811
uilabel	uibutton
then you can possibly use the uibutton playing with some of its settings like user interaction or selection color and put your own uilabel uiviews in there

3392828
nstextfield	nstableview
i m trying to access the array data source in my nstableview to allow replacing the string that is in the row with a new string.the app consist of an nstextfield for data entry and a button to add the entry so that it s displayed in the nstableview

3392855
put	get
in this case you can leave out those comments so you can put everything in a single line and get rid of the newline characters n

3392860
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox but opening it on google-chrome gives me the following error

3392899
width	height
i wouldn t change it s height and width because the visual elements are setup for a fixed size

3392946
multiplying	add
for left multiplying by two and add 1 if it was above 2 32 - 1

3392961
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am developing and testing upon ubuntu firefox 3.6.7 google-chrome 5 and opera 10.60

3392976
uiview	cashapelayer
one way would be to add a cashapelayer with a circular path either directly to the layer of the uiimageview or as the layer of a new uiview that is added to the uiimageview

3392990
post	put
because each new request in app engine creates a new handler the entity i d like to alter and put using post has to be retrieved again

3393019
post	get
i actually have a post on so that i m trying to get people involved on here

3393037
width	margin
set a margin and remove the float width on #content like so

3393056
post	get
method not allowed use post or get

3393057
folder	directory
the idea is to use the dialog s behavior that when a valid directory is entered into the file name box if open button is pressed the dialog switches to that folder

3393128
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
also not sure if this is an option but your app as an oob app will not be restricted to security checks in clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml

3393128
post	get
upon further review of the post and comments i believe tom please confirm this that the need isn t to get a screenshot of the user s instance of the sl app running on their own box which something like customer support in silverlight would take care of pretty well

3393171
internationalization	localization
however if you want to do internationalization and localization you can use them

3393188
mongodb	bson
mongomapper has a proxy object called objectid - in this case you want a bson objectid which represents an id as it is stored in mongodb itself

3393267
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
unless you actually want control at the level you have implemented you could consider object streams see objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

3393288
public	protected
for imports from the same package methods and data which have no access specified public protected private are also visible

3393303
post	get
use http post to send information from the client to server and get to retrieve information from the server

3393308
public	protected
once you ve made the source inaccessible you expose the api with public protected classes enums and interfaces

3393318
swt	swing	awt	swing
you will have to learn a ui toolkit such as awt swing swt etc

3393322
ant	maven
another option would be to use the maven antrun plugin and ant filtering capabilities with the filter and or the copy tasks but the above looks just fine

3393380
aggregate-functions	sum
try the sum aggregate-functions on the wins field and restrict it using where to that specific date range so date 6 14 2010 and date 06 06 2010

3393412
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the user-space layer is malloc and calloc realloc free

3393412
memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

3393489
put	preflight	put	get
but in my case i use basic authentication which is trickier because i need to put the credentials into the xmlhttprequest directly and that produces preflight requests in firefox replacing get by options and my grails application doesn t deal with it

3393499
post	get
you should be checking the http response status code sent by the server to determine whether to send a get or repeat the post

3393502

width	height
width 50 and height 50 sets the width and height attributes to half of the parent element s width and height if i m not mistaken

3396510

just make sure you take off any height width 50 attributes first

3396515

but when i change my jpa implementation to hibernate i get serializable deserialization exception on gwt layer when i pass entity beans but it is okay on eclipselink jpa

3397489
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission
if it s as part of the onclick event for a submit button or the onsubmit event for a form the usual cause is that you ve forgotten to prevent the form from submission normally - so the page refreshes and the ajax call is lost

3397506

3397705
mktime	strtotime	subtract	add
never use math like 60 60 24 7 to add subtract days because of daylight time saving use strtotime or mktime instead

3397738

3398133
rss	feed
so how i think it works is that each supplier provides an rss feed which the comparison website connects to

3398133
rss	feed
each product has its own unique code provided by the manufacturer and this is supplied in a standard tag in the rss feed

3398133
rss	feed
for example book publishers may provide rss feed containing the blurb on the back of each book the isbn publishers name authors title obviously rrp genre fact fiction and some other useful information all in tags such as isbn isbn here isbn

3398518
subtract	add
just add 1 5 of the next element and subtract 1 5 of the first element in the current window at every step

i think that what you might want to use is the modulo which will give you the rest of the division

3398568

my problem is that by wrapping it all up in a for-loop like this in between the pdf and dev.off functions is that the for-loop doesn t seem to wait for ggplot to do its thing and blazes through its loops very quickly and outputs an invalid pdf

3398575

width	height
the outline is not actually a part of the box it does not count in any way towards the width or height of a box

3398703
width	height
maybe you got confused between size and width height attributes btw i got confused at first when you said field

3398703
int	chars
in that case its value refers to the int number of chars

3398703
width	height
now in case of the dimension attributes width and height

3398719
free	malloc
since i want to create request structs in different places once using literals on the client side and once using chars that i read from a socket on the server side i was wondering if there is a function to make sure that i don t try to free the literals while still allowing me to free the message i have created using a malloc

3398731
jasmine	qunit
i ve been doing my unit testing with jquery qunit but i recently started using jasmine and i recommend it 200

3398751
width	height
using padding to pad-out the correct height and width gives mixed results in different browsers

3398764
setinterval	settimeout
instead return a status to your ajax request that the file doesn t exist yet and then have it wait using setinterval or settimeout and try again after so many seconds

3398774
opera	firefox
in opera it is 1 in firefox 2 in ie some large number

3398785
width	height
you can specify width height on absolutely positioned elements so the css would look something like this

3398793
calloc	malloc
note that it is not only string literals that would cause the problem any pointer to data not dynamically allocated on the heap by malloc or calloc would fail so simply detecting if a char points to a string literal in c even if it could be done portably would not help

3398795
put	get
the same providers give their sms service for free when used from their website maybe because they get to put ads there

3398827
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
presently i validate on upload for 100kb and bmp gif jpg and png

3398839
hibernate	gilead
using gilead formerly known as hibernate4gwt for hibernate integration

hibernate	gilead
second while the two first integration strategies will work with any jpa provider hibernate is the only jpa implementation currently supported by gilead but openjpa and eclipselink supports is planned

3398860

it sounds like you may need to use views arguments to filtering your results if you are pulling different grouping based on a single view

3398887
qlistwidget	qgraphicsscene	qlistwidget	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i need to drag from a qlistwidget or something similar and drop on a qgraphicsscene and create a subclass of qgraphicsitem at the drop location

3398890
yslow	pagespeed
you can use tools like yslow and pagespeed both are firefox extensions to get a feel on how fast performance wise for your site

3398890
yslow	pagespeed
there are other things you can do to increase front-end performance other than reducing amount of data both yslow and pagespeed will tell you those

3398919
cos	sin
also sin two_pi cos two_pi will not neccessarily return precise 0.0 and 1.0 values

3398932
gdal	ogr
look into gdal ogr bindings

3398966
folder	directory
then i looked inside my home folder and found the following directory

3398981
folder	directory
user can create documents and folder they don t have to be real folder directory

3398998
width	height
if i have a table element i can make the content scrollable with some javascript fun including accouting for the scroll bar using the width by making the thead fixed height and the tbody fixed height then setting scrolling to auto on the tbody

3398998
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but in google-chrome the heights on the thead tbody are ignored and the whole table grows vs scrolling as intended

3399006
getter	setter
either make _kind public and remove getter and setter or use binary serialization

3399019
calloc	malloc
i cannot catch how to use calloc instead of malloc

3399060
filtering	grouping
the sorter will reorder products into different grouping based on filtering and selecting

3399105
width	height
you should not rely on size width height attributes but instead focus on semantics when doing the markup

3399108
serializable	deserialization
i was able to get valid serializable and deserialization with project designed like so

3399135
oncreate	onstart
it should work in oncreate onstart and onresume after you ve instantiated your layouts

3399154
stdout	stderr
you re indeed ignoring the stdout and stderr streams of the process returned by runtime#exec

3399212
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade the quartz versioning from 1.5.3 which is on the jboss to the currently latest 1.8.3

3399224
firefox	safari
the below code works like a charm in firefox and safari but fails in ie

3399229
children	parent
if i guessed the markup wrong then you can adjust it using the parent find children and siblings functions in jquery

3399290
sfdoctrineguard	sfguard
if you re using sfguard or sfdoctrineguard

3399368
punctuation	words
the problem i am facing now is that when punctuation is at the end of a words it can sometimes be wrapped to the next line

3399370
put	get
put the database id in the session and get the rest from the database

3399383
bash	zsh
several shells bash ksh zsh already have means for tcp access

3399414
put	get
you should also call suprocess.process in the main thread to get the sub-process started and be able to obtain its .pid to put in the list and pass the resulting process object to the babysitter thread which waits for it and when it s done reports and removes it from the list

3399430

images in the gif jpeg and png

3399480
free	malloc
if you re just trying to make sure that malloc ed memory is free you can call

3399491
width	height
you can use safari.application.openbrowserwindow to open a window but i haven t been able to find the documentation to specify a url or height width of the window

3399509
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql support offset that is usually used with a limit clause

3399587
facebook	fbconnect
in groupon they are using fbconnect to access their facebook application based on the login success they are allowing me to access their deals

3399587
facebook	fbconnect
i had used fbconnect package to post some message to user s wall using my own facebook application api

3399596
setinterval	settimeout
the return value of setinterval and settimeout are just integers used internally to reference the timeouts so storing an integer with .data isn t a problem

3399649
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t in firefox google-chrome and i don t think it should in ie

3399716
width	height
for example you can bind the width and height of an hbox container to the scene height and width so that whenever scene resizes the hbox container resizes as well

3399768
inherited	subclassing
inherited implies a specific kind of relationship between classes and subclassing

3399768
inherited	properties
you can build view model base classes and inherited from them but you can t really meaningfully do that with views because views are built through composition and not by implementing properties and methods

3399768
textblock	itemscontrol
in the view i have have a datatemplate that lays out the hyperlink and textblock inside a dockpanel and the datatemplate for the view model contains an itemscontrol that s bound to the commandlinks collection in my view model

3399789
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions such as sum work against the set of data defined by the group by clause

3399816
multiplying	add
the sum peratiorn first multiplying the columns than add

3399824
qobject	qlist
otherwise you could perhaps create a mix of qobject and qlist that can emit signals to notify xmodel of changes but i think the first approach is better

3399834
maya	3dsmax
or photoshop 3dsmax maya zbrush

3399888
ant	maven
use something like ant or maven

3399907
mef	prism

one last thing i d like to try to avoid implements a new control that extends treeview

3399978
post	get
get loads and when i save post prompts for login which continually loops

3400004
put	get
the get and subsequent possible put are wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity

3400086
folder	directory
i am running using code blocks on windows also strange but the permissions of the output directory are all changed after the crash and the folder files are all set to read only

3400117
minimum	max
you can add password salt minimum max pass length complexity options pass attempts etc

3400198
google-chrome	firefox
and this in other browsers tested firefox google-chrome

3400227
printf	strlen
a string is just an array of char s so all you need to do is loop from 0 to strlen str -1 and use printf or something similar to format each character as decimal hexadecimal

3400232
google-chrome	firefox
the iphone does not have any problem rendering it nor do regular browsers ie8 google-chrome firefox etc

3400252
ocp	principles

so i m extending a social media class that i have that works with twitter tumblr posterous and bit.ly already to work with myspace

3400275
dictionary	map
this particular dictionary doesn t work too well but the general idea is to map out the pattern formed by the letters

3400292
stdout	stderr
i ve tried the suggestions here redirecting stdout and stderr to files adding a vfprint option adding an -xcheck jni option but to no avail

3400321

3400369
hide	show
depending on what i click true or false this will cause my table to show or hide accordingly

3400420
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
and there are two obvious ways to convert one to another first is to convert it into integer first and get the result not interesting way second is to implement own multiplication and addition in base-3 and compute the result multiplying digit values to respective power of two straightforward and heavy

3400434
mouseleave	mouseenter
however you can create one by updating a flag at mouseenter and mouseleave -- which is where brian driscoll s suggestion of .hover comes in

3400455
width	height
actually if you ve already organized everything into layouts then you might be able to just bind the top level layout container s width and height to the scene.width and scene.height

3400455
width	height
i don t think top level layout controls are managed by anything so you may be safe just setting width and height of the layout control directly

3400455
width	height
if that doesn t work then you might have success binding the layoutinfo width and height

3400466
firefox	safari
local testing showed no problems ie firefox safari all ok

3400466
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
once i move to a hosted test ie firefox and safari all display as intended but google-chrome offsets all the buttons right about 8-10 pixels

3400471
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
generally you have to change the cpu affinity because a process can migrate between processors cpu affinity linux journal 2003

3400490
affinity	processors
to specify processors affinity for a thread use the setthreadaffinitymask function

3400490
affinity	processors
you can possibly check if the issue mentioned in msdn is the reason for your problem by specifying a processors affinity for your process by calling your executable using the start command

3400518
cpu	affinity
now if you want to force an application on a specific core you can manually set the cpu affinity

3400570
soundpool	audiotrack
if you are the one opening the socket use mediaplayer or soundpool or tonegenerator or audiotrack or something to play back a beep

google-chrome gives me the integer value of 20 but firefox gives me the correct value using firebug of 516

3400623
boost	stl
realised that templates are incredibly powerful and don t need to be slow and use of the stl and boost is much more widespread than 10 years ago

3400624
for-loop	arrays
your outer for-loop moves the counter one step to the left assuming you write your arrays from left to right

3400627
inherited	properties
you could try to create attributes that inherited from the built-in ones and specifically check for the presence of an enabled properties via an interface before performing their normal validation

3400673
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
those properties are even supported in ie 5.5 firefox 1.0 safari 1.0 and opera 7.0

3400688
rss	feed
install wp in another directory as pointed out and then use a plugin like wordpress â º absolute privacy â wordpress plugins to restrict access to those logged in and turn off rss feed

in one part of my app i want to have a uiview with a uisegmentedcontrol just underneath the navigation that will filter the uitableview

3401063
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the second problem was to actually move all the static methods from a superclass to subclassing this is a cludgy form of inherited after all

3401063
glassfish	weblogic
the byte code manipulation originally was done dynamically when classes loaded but i ran into some class loading problems in glassfish and weblogic and decided to implement static bytecode manipulation

3401085
inherited	properties
write your own authorization attribute simply inherited from the existing one and add an additional public properties message to it where you can also provide some sort of a message with attribute declaration like ie

3401103
hide	show
hide the icons with the show desktop icons item in the view menu then run the below

3401108
put	get
and if the 1px-wide empty cell on the right is a problem i can always put another one on the left to get it symmetrical and less visually annoying but as a matter of fact with a 0-border-spacing on the table and a 0-padding on each cell the 1px-wide empty cell is actually not visible...

3401151
atof	strtod
atof strtod might be the fastest way to deal with it if the string is already in the memory

3401151
disk	ram
modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable

3401174
filesystems	ntfs
it s not specific to windows per se but filesystems microsoft uses fats ntfs etc.

3401176
int	chars
the argument must be a pointer to a signed int where the number of chars written so far is stored

3401182
int	chars
the argument associated with the n will be treated as a int and filled with the number of total chars printed at that point in the printf

3401201
width	text-align
furthermore if you want to center it horizontally you need to specify width 100 to body the outer container and give text-align center to inner container

3401223
int	chars
it is used to figure out how many chars got printed before n appeared in the format string and output that to the provided int

3401258
nsstring	nsdata
php outputs text so you will have to read that nsdata as nsstring and then parse out the array data according to the format specified by var_dump

3401283
solaris	bsd	bash	zsh
here s a way that works with any posix shell ash bash ksh zsh ... but only on systems that have dev fd which includes reasonably recent linux bsd and solaris

3401283
bash	zsh
like walter s similar construction using the simpler method available in bash ksh93 and zsh the output of wc and the output of sort may be intermixed

3401327

it s not so complete than bold or opf of course no uml nor ocl but it works and is tested with delphi 7 up to delphi 2010

3401372
min	max
passing will give you the mean min max etc

3401432
ubuntu	linux
i had trouble installing wxruby under x64 ubuntu linux so i tried under windows 7 what worked for me was

you could wrap each collection of divs in another div as to constrain the parent s children to just those divs

3401559
postgresql	mysql
mentions offset is supported by both postgresql and mysql

3401613
children	parent

3401751
floating-point	integer
floating-point and integer data types are fundamentally different and are not directly convertible

3401795
multiplying	division
therefore a fraction-handling methodology is never assumed when multiplying integers but the same cannot be said for integer division

3401844
httphandler	httpmodule
the best way to accomplish this is to convert your httphandler into an httpmodule and make sure that all requests pass through your custom module before being handed off to mvc

3401857
hide	show	google-chrome	safari
the click doesn t seem to trigger in ie safari google-chrome but the initial hide show does it also triggers the default behaviour and links to mypage.html# i ve tried a preventdefault

apache	lighttpd
web servers like apache and lighttpd compile and run fine on an iphone

3402095
magento	oscommerce
there are packages like magento and oscommerce the latter of which i ve used with pretty good success for php but that s the thing -- they rely on the lamp stack

versioning	upgrade
this hql worked just fine in an earlier versioning of nhibernate but it broke with the upgrade to nhibernate 2.1.2.4

3402149
pull	push
if this criteria isn t important in your case perhaps their conclusion won t be your conclusion but i do think it is worth reading the push vs pull section of their paper to determine for yourself

3402182
disk	ram
on rackspace the only way to add disk space dynamically is by also doubling ram and monthly cost which isn t necessary

3402236

3402311
nstextfield	nstableview
two iboutlets one for the nstextfield and one for the nstableview

3402324
g++	gcc
now i understood emphasis on the past tense this to be some form of fail safe checking system within some portion of the machine code spat out by the magical gcc or g++ compiler or what have you

3402325
inherited	properties
setting textblock.foreground works because that properties is inheritable see properties value inherited so the textblock will get the value from its parent treeviewitem

3402337
ironruby	ironpython
there s also nothing inherent in the languages themselves that makes them require a gil so you can run your application with jython jruby ironpython or ironruby if you really want to share state inside a single process

3402373
cpu	processors
the processors s mmu detects this and it throws a cpu exception

3402401
portrait	landscape
by default the layout is configured for the landscape orientation so in the case that the app starts in portrait mode i need to take extra action to configure the views properly for display in portrait

3402401
portrait	landscape
the problem here is that it always returns portrait even if the app is starting in landscape

3402405
min	max
using this you could then do what you want min max random alternate min and max or whatever

3402415
int	chars
most of these answers explain what n does which is to print nothing and to write the number of chars printed thus far to an int variable but so far no one has really given an example of what use it has

3402490
trie	tree
if auto-completion is needed when a partial word has been entered a prefix tree trie may be used

3402500
pull	push
there s a pretty fundamental difference push vs pull

3402558
post	get
if the exception is not being caught by your catch blocks you should make sure you have a top-level exception handler around your startup code and also application.dispatcherunhandledexception then once you ve caught the exception post back with a stack trace and i m sure you ll get an answer quickly

3402575
xslt	xquery
if so you can use the collection function in xslt or xquery to point to a directory that contains the xml files

3402575
xslt	xquery
using either the xslt or xquery below

xslt	xquery
also the xquery was about 8ms faster than the xslt

3402622
udp	mtu
a the limit on a udp datagram payload in ipv4 is 65535-28 65507 bytes and the practical limit is the mtu of the path which is more like 1460 bytes if you re lucky

3402678
folder	directory
so if you are not already i would extracted the files and write them to disk in their own folder dispose of the zip file at this point and then iterate over the files in your newly created directory and perform whatever actions you need to on them

3402694
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
whenever i setup firefox or google-chrome or opera to use the proxy on localhost 8000 there are no connections made to the proxy and i can no longer connect to any page though that is probably because it isn t connection to the proxy

3402748
inherited	properties
this way the datagridview will inherited the properties of the panel

3402831
maven	pom.xml
let maven do the copying - should not copy individual files yourself and break the pom.xml

doesn t matter what i do i simply can t get this to play a sound in firefox or ie or google-chrome for that matter

3402905
setinterval	settimeout
i find passing strings to settimeout and setinterval just leads to problems

3402942

3409124
comparator	comparable
it is just a simple comparison with an extensive match in comparator or defaulting to plain equals if not a comparable type

3409246

i thought that the easiest way to do this would be to create a password field annotated with transient and a hashed password field that is set just before the object is persistent with a method annotated with prepersist and preupdate

shouldn t the values of transient fields stick around at least until the entity is persistent

the existence of submodules and the fact that .gitmodules contains the full path for folder content submodulea and folder content submoduleb causes part of the history to be inconsistent since .gitmodules refers to a nonexistent directory structure once filter-branch is used

3411400

fibplus datasets support interesting separate transactions feature that makes possible to write applications which are very similar to bde applications but at the same time use firebird transactions more effectively and support other firebird specific features

3411445
expander	togglebutton

i do most of my ruby development in an ubuntu vm just because it is easier to get everything together under linux i imagine the same applies to osx

i ve used both and found that for unit testing only junit works very well but in terms of system testing i would recommend testng

3411951
junit	testng
for example in junit one test failing in a suite usually means you have to re-run your entire suite but in testng you can simply rerun the test that failed

3411983

mockito	easymock
update mockito has added android support as of version 1.9.5 and easymock has added android support as of version 3.2 by factoring out those bits that generate code at runtime and making them pluggable by using dexmaker instead of cglib.

3412672
mockito	easymock
you can immediately forget anything based on cglib mockito plain easymock since cglib relies on byte code generation and won t work on dalvik it also relies on the java beans package which is also not part of android

3412672
junit	mockito	junit	powermockito
we use junit 4 + powermockito + mockito and mock out classes like context and textutils in a base class from which we inherit every normal junit test

3412790
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview subclass with several subviews and i want to handle these events in the class

3412814

superclass	subclassing
the superclass should not even know of the existence of the subclassing much less perform operations based on the fully qualified name of the subclassing

3418152
superclass	subclassing
most likely it ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad it s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of its subclassing are

3418188
filtering	grouping
to filtering out duplicates on the left hand side which will also cause duplicates on the right you ll have to remove the grouping on

pick your battles but i d ask for the person to clarify the naming convention seeing that they ve suggested using the same convention for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

3419898
for-loop	arrays
also you should probably use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays

3419909
move	drag
by lock i mean the user can not move resize drag minimize or maximize the window

3419963

3420115
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i don t want to define the myobject properties separately on each subclassing since then i lose the advantage of inherited

3420160
inherited	properties
you should know that the hasownproperty method checks only if the properties physically exist on the object own properties but we have also inherited properties for that case we can use the in operator for example

3420160
inherited	properties
as you can see obj inherited from test.prototype and the a properties is not an own properties but it is available through the prototype chain

3420163
integer	unsigned
unsigned long long is the largest of the c standard integer types it must be able to represent at least 2 64 ndash

hide	show
listen to window-state-event on your window intercepting iconify changes so that you can hide your window instead of it being show in the taskbar

3420214
superclass	subclassing
instead you declare constructors in the subclassing and have them chain to the appropriate constructors in the immediate superclass via an explicit super ... call .

3420239
super	implements
but i can recommend the tool autohotkey autohotkey.com which makes implements these tasks super simple

3420290
quicksort	mergesort
with a nice sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort you ll be able to select time slices

3420325

ant	maven
the accepted way of compiling and running java is to use ant or maven and then build those on a build machine

3420498
ant	maven
you do not need eclipse or any other tools to build just a java jdk or sdk the names are interchangeable and either ant or maven on your computer

3420498
jar	war	ant	maven
you would put the java code directory structure on the machine and run it through ant or maven and then would end up with class files or jar ear war or whatever you are developing to

3420531
bash	zsh
in your shell run the following script or it s zsh equivalent i whipped this up in bash before i saw the zsh tag

3420674
haskell	sml
some language like f# sml and haskell have much much more powerful type inference removing the need for all those ugly type declarations although explicitly annotating allowed types or set of types can make intent more clear while preserving static typing

3420708
children	parent
there are also nested children of the same effect if then boolean so their parent if then boolean isn t set to true until the very end

3420740
charindex	substr
in sql server tsql patindex will be better for this situation than charindex to get that starting point of the substr

3420747
for-loop	loops
t be a for-loop except that there isn t one such example where a certain program using the while loops cannot be replaced by the for-loop because of its limitations

3420802
post	get
i ve checked with some companies like openmarket.com and it seems they have to broker this access with tier 1 telecoms like att verizon etc.....then they abstract and provide a gateway i lease a shortcode and their gateway and use their api to post get the mms data

3420835
post	get
client can then resend the 123 using post or get that really depends on what you want

inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
databinding magic happens due to inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

3420912
treemap	linkedhashmap
these may be applied to a treemap as ordering extends comparator or a linkedhashmap after some sorting

3420912
comparator	comparable
to alleviate this you could add your key to the comparator like so presuming that your keys and values are comparable

3420912
comparator	comparable
note that this will still not work if your keys compare to 0 but this should be sufficient for most comparable items as hashcode equals and comparator are often in sync...

3420920
firefox	safari
this is the latest version of java with firefox and safari

3420934
pygtk	pygobject	pygtk	gio	pygobject	gio

i use gcc g++ at the moment but i can switch to vc++ since gcc s inline asm gives me headaches anyway

3421107
innodb	myisam
mysql can use a number of different database engines the two main ones being myisam and innodb

3421107
innodb	myisam
innodb has always had full transactional capability whereas myisam has always been very high speed

3421107
innodb	myisam
you ll need to either transition to using myisam tables or change mysql s configuration to enable innodb tables making sure your version of mysql has support for it

3421113
hide	show
there is a simple link to navigate to the next section which triggers a div show hide

3421113

if it validates then the show hide function would proceed them to the next part

3421172
vim	emacs
both of them work well with both vim and emacs

3421192
typedef	struct
the best you can do is to declare two struct - one containing c function typedef for each method the other mirrors the class data layout

3421218
width	height
the first parameter to drawimage is the image element or canvas element to draw the next 4 are the x y width and height to sample from the source and the last 4 parameters are the x y width and height of the region to draw in the canvas

3421218
width	height
you would just need to pick the width and height for the source sample based on the zoom level and the x and y based on where the mouse is clicked minus half the calculated width and height but you will need to ensure the rectangle isn t out of bounds

3421280
gridview	objectdatasource
i use objectdatasource and bind ienumerable person to my devexpress gridview

3421334

3421482
folder	directory
given a folder i want to make sure that all the files on that directory are deleted

3421555
unsigned	short	int	chars
some error reporting and you have a lot of flexibility for what type to store signed unsigned versions of chars short int long long long size_t ptrdiff_t intmax_t

3421555
int	chars
you can use d n to store the index of the first chars after the int that s read in another variable and thereby check to see if the entire string was converted or if there s junk afterwards

3421555
octal	hex
you can choose any number base from 2 to 36 or specify 0 as the base to auto-interpret leading 0x and 0 as hex and octal respectively

3421555
int	chars
since these functions take a pointer to pointer argument you also get a pointer to the first chars following the converted int for free so you can tell if the entire string was an int or parse subsequent data in the string if needed

3421565
coldspring	model-glue
i have model-glue coldspring running in my wwwroot under my project

3421687

but by all means if you have the budget i d recommend getting yourkit as it provides more sophisticated features and better metrics that visualvm don t have

3421817
spaces	delimiter
i have string with number on ints seperated by spaces delimiter

3421840
children	parent
when you implement it you have to pass the children of the deleted node to the parent of the node

3421840
children	parent
if you use arrays to store the information you will have an extremely hard time deleting items that have both parent and children and updating the lft and rgt valuse would be very hard

3421842
put	get
you may want to put the code that you want to anyway get executed irrespective of what happens in your try or catch block

3421885
addition	multiplication
i suppose that by elementary matrices you mean only those which do the elementary operations of row swapping row multiplication and row addition

3421885
multiplying	transpose
note that the t2 matrices appear in reverse order transpose because they must multiplying together to form u1 t

3421901
try-catch	exception-handling
generally speaking possible exception-handling are usually handled with a try-catch block

3421904

3421990
getter	setter
the dogs puppies are maintained in a collection in the dog class with getter and setter

3421990
jlist	jtable
when i add a puppie to the dog selected in the jlist it is not reflected in the jtable immediately

3421990
jlist	jtable
the jtable is bound to the jlist and not the dogs list with selectedelement.puppies as binding expression

3422056
width	margin
i had the same problem the div sidebar floating left was hidden by the main content div that had a 200px left margin and inherited the width from the parent div i used a pre-made theme for a wordpress installation

3422056
width	margin
you have two way to solve this 1 you call the hidden div first or 2 you delete the main content margin and give it a precise width and most important you assign it float right

3422059
submit	submission
the page i am writing at the moment is for submission assignments where the student selects an assignment from a drop-down menu and then uploads the assignment and submit

3422059
submit	submission
on submit all the information about the submission goes into a mysql table and the file is moved to a permanent location on the file system

3422096

3422129
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie firefox and google-chrome

3422181
ubuntu	debian	rubygems	rvm
if you use and debian ubuntu is a debian take a look at rvm because debian cripples rubygems

3422181
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	gedit	emacs	textmate	textmate	gedit
we ve got emacs vim textmate gedit here

3422189
firefox	safari
this thing is working in normal browsers like safari firefox i.e etc.

3422239
put	get
why don t you put a list of products on you website and make it somehow small or move it out of sight so google follows the links but your customers don t get distracted

3422248
firefox	safari
on microsoft platform the function works fine but it fails when i switch to non-microsoft platform such as firefox or safari

3422342

vim	emacs
emacs vim is ok too

3422364
postgresql	mysql
sqlite for local development while mysql or postgresql for production

3422364
postgresql	mysql
my advice sqlite is easy to learn while give a try with mysql or postgresql you might not know when your clients going to ask you to develop on them

3422364
apache	nginx
but for production i prefer modrails.com where you can choose between apache nginx

3422425
mouseup	mousedown
i ve created a small example here that uses drawimage and scale to zoom in on mousedown and out on mouseup

3422427
put	get
why don t you put a list of products on you website and make it somehow small or move it out of sight so google follows the links but your customers don t get distracted

3422436
getter	setter
modern ides such as eclipse can automatically generate getter and setter for you so this way troubles can be avoided

3422476
folder	directory
actually i have tried it by storing lod details in log folder in my directory which was working fine

3422559
valgrind	callgrind
linux valgrind callgrind cachegrind

3422574
getter	setter
the simplest example is java s getter and setter as mentioned by sjoerd

3422574
getter	setter
both getter and setter follow a well-defined pattern a getter returns a class member and a setter sets a class member s value

3422574
getter	setter
if you want a getter or setter to behave in a slightly different way you may add some parameters to your template

3422599
firefox	safari
firefox wasn t working for a while and recently started to work but the problem seems to be remaining in safari

3422599
google-chrome	safari
this seems a little odd because i d have expected safari and google-chrome to behave in the same way

3422630
versioning	upgrade
we used this approach not to upgrade from a previous versioning of wix but to get away from a commercial tool that didn t meet our requirements any longer

it s only true for processors where an unsigned integer is held in 16 bits

3422792
unsigned	short
if you add two unsigned shorts together and put the answer into a short the total can never be more than 65535 because a short can t denote that large a value

3422837
onfocus	onblur
for most events but especially for onblur and onfocus since you can t cancel the default action of them anyway

3422889
hide	show
it should hide the irrelevant set of form elements and show the relevant set

3422897
for-loop	loops
wat i want is tat each time for-loop completes 1 loops it should wait or sleep for 100millisec so tat it can give a fadding effect..

uiview	subviews
i have a uitableview which is a subviews of a uiview then that uiview is a subviews of a uiscrollview

3422933
portrait	landscape
so you will have only one uiviewcontroller for both portrait and landscape mode

3422944
portrait	landscape
also make sure to create and connect outlets for portrait and landscape views in your nib

3422983
division	modulo
note that is the modulo which computes remainder after division and is the integer division operator

3422998
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
that is why you have different behaviors for different browsers each browser interprets the css files as they want and that s why you have to tune up your css files for ie firefox google-chrome opera etc.

3422998
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the best way to make your css files work in almost all the browsers apart from ie6 is writing the css file using the w3c standards firefox google-chrome opera and ie9 are supposed to be w3ccompliant

3423035
folder	directory
to make things even clearer create a subdirectory with all files and more subdirs and optionally an index.html in the root directory so the user only has to copy one folder plus one index.html

3423158
folder	directory
put your images in a spearate folder not in your virtual directory for the application

3423231
vb.net	vb6
there isn t an event like that in vb6 although vb.net has mouseleave

3423250
post	put
all i know is that it occurs when editing or creating an item so either post or put requests but the problem is it is not on one specific area of the application it simply eventually happend from time to time all over our forms

3423266
integer	unsigned
i asking because integer unsigned save 2 space vs integer

3423278
ienumerable	iqueryable
here res is an ienumerable or iqueryable of an anonymous type and i is of that anonymous type

3423320
post	get
if you have any other solution please post so that we can get a better solution

3423337
stdout	stderr
the only current limitation is that it is not able to differentiate between stderr and stdout meaning that it will merge both of them

3423346
int	chars
we have an alpha numeric string up to 32 chars and we want to transform it to an int bigint

3423357
udp	tcp
i am using tcp for communicating with an arduino just open a socket and wait for a connection using an ethernet shield while watching reading about various other project that use some sort of network interface for communication they all seem to use udp instead of tcp for communication

3423368
division	subtraction
because the division operator has higher precedence than subtraction

3423407
folder	dir
the line dir a d b gives you an output of multiple lines giving you all the parallel folder because i go up a level using pushd ..

3423432
qfile	qdatastream	qiodevice	qfile	qiodevice	qdatastream
try to open the qfile with | qiodevice append then qfile seek then create the qdatastream on the qfile object

3423446
int	chars
i know that there is crc32 but it only provides an 32-bit int in php and this 32-bit int are at least 10 chars long so a huge range of int number is unused

3423455
quicksort	mergesort
the internal sorting algorithm is most probably quicksort or mergesort

3423465
width	height
when running the file 1641x3121 through the script which creates one thumbnail with a max width or height of 150 and another of 400 we get a perfect thumbnail 78x150 and a small view image sized properly but which is cut off and stretched 211 x 400

3423511
post	put
i use that in my .net projects as post compilation event to put the last revision in the assemblyinfo of the application adding it to the app version number

3423517
nunit	mstest
mstest - fair enough this is not nunit but it does generate tests and should be considered

3423555
folder	dir
and i need to copy content from all of them into one folder keeping the structure of content copying all files into one dir using flatten isn t a solution

3423577
hash	md5
you can log in using ssh and make a md5 hash for the file remotely and a md5 hash for the current local file

3423589
int	chars
and fiddle with the value of delta until you get the desired results or redesign the column so that you can use int or chars types

3423599
int	chars
your compilation error is caused because columnname returns a string and the only indexer string defines is an int indexer that returns the chars at the specified position

3423614
width	height
furthermore any event type can be passed in and the following jquery methods can be called val css html text data width height or offset

3423631
iprincipal	iidentity
when talking about authentication and authorization you should create your own implementation of iprincipal and iidentity which are then set within the thread thread.currentthread

3423631
iprincipal	iidentity
the iprincipal goes on the thread and it holds onto your iidentity

3423635
width	height
other special properties are mapped this way val css html text data width height and offset are treated special here

3423654
metaclass	subclassing
and if you don t want to modify the existing metaclass you can subclassing it

3423659
subscript	superscript
it works fine in all the case but in some case like superscript or subscript its not working

3423771
min	max
you can use min or avg instead of max it shoulnd t matter because there s only one value for each parameter per item_id

3423776
width	height
i ve found that you can arbitrarily place subplots by creating them with the axes function that takes a list of top left width height but this would make the code a little messy and arbitrary

3423792
put	get
if you get error error no 1242 subquery returns more than one row try to put any before your subquery

3423834
move	drag
this circle can be move around on the canvas by some drag drop stuff i did in code behind so its position is not fixed

i have bound the slider s value to an ellipse s height and width

3423837
pdfsharp	itextsharp
itextsharp and pdfsharp

3423839

uwsgi	cherokee
i have successfully deployed a django app with uwsgi + cherokee

3423860
uwsgi	cherokee
i cannot find any guide or step-by-step specific for uwsgi + cherokee

width	height
you can bind your canvas.left and canvas.top to your height and width via a valueconverter

3423888
width	height
store the old values for width and height or the old slider value

3423888
width	height
add dx to width and height property

3423889
pop-up	dialog
one of the functions in the test tool is to close dialog pop-up from the tested application

3423895
ant	maven
ivy is not a drop in replacement for maven it s a dependency manager for ant

3423903
width	height
the problem is that you are using the slider to adjust the width and height

3423903
width	height
width and height are not calculated around rendertransformorigin

3423913
margin	height
the left margin will ensure it clears the menu and that any content beyond the height of the menu is indented accordingly

3423921
put	get
if you use a single connection handle all get and put activity from multiple threads is synchronized through the connection handle

3423921
put	get
if you use many connection handles the get and put activity can occur in parallel

3423985
width	height
by mode here i mean video width height and fps frame per second

3424013
short	base
in short achieving the desired construction control flow is easy to do without adding the the ability to call base constructors in arbitrary locations and there s no compelling benefit to adding the feature

3424075
ubuntu	linux	textmate	gedit
personally i use textmate when i m at home on osx and gedit and redcar when i m at work on ubuntu linux

3424108
ant	maven
so no we don t have a better way but i have a fuzzy vision for how things could be better if we switched from ant to maven

3424119
hypersql	hsqldb	javadb	hsqldb
some good java databases that offer in memory support are apache derby javadb but it is really oracle s flavor of apache derby again hypersql better known as hsqldb and h2 database engine

3424172
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a very basic uitableview with an attached uisearchbar and here s the flow of what happens

3424172
uitableview	uisearchbar
uitableview is empty user taps uisearchbar and brings up keyboard

3424194
webchromeclient	webviewclient
i think the problem with your code is that you enable javascript on the default internal webviewclient and or webchromeclient then you replace those with new ones that now have new properties

3424250
post	get
any suggestions on how to resolve this so i respond to the post data as well as get

3424272
nunit	mspec
your best only option it to use a standalone test runner such as nunit mspec etc.

3424273
width	height
i m just setting it s width and height to the browsers size so everything but the scale is the same

3424273
width	height
the next numbers are width and height

3424273
width	height
the numbers are width height scalex and scaley

3424282
min	max
aggregation queries group by having sum avg max min

3424324
udp	tcp
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

3424324
udp	tcp
you can easily write a udp stack from scratch on your own tcp is a bit harder doable but harder

3424324
udp	tcp
tcp has built in retries and other things so you dont lose reliability with udp directly it is what you do with it that could compare

3424324
udp	tcp
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

3424324
arp	udp
you can do things like only implement arp and udp and nothing else although ping is useful but somehow painful and you can cut corners on arp rarp depending on what you need to do with this thing

3424324
udp	tcp
there are times when it is useful embedded desktop or server though i still ask that question every time and have to justify the use of tcp over udp otherwise i wont use it

3424376
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome

3424579
hide	show
when the user clicks on the header the next body section should show hide and update the + - icon

3424585
charindex	substr
right now to parse a large amount of text i use charindex to get the index of the char then i substr the text to remove up to that first index

3424596
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
even though nswindowcontroller has -windowwillload and -windowdidload methods for you to override the nsviewcontroller class introduced in mac os 10.5 does not have corresponding -viewwillload and -viewdidload methods

3424603
width	height
so when the user has the device in landscape the page width increases and the page height decreases

3424617
charindex	substr
i think the charindex or substr functions will solve your problem

3424625
jobs	cron
currently it s using some hacks to trickle his massive email sendouts using cron jobs and queuing with the database to avoid going over the limit mediatemple set

3424635
uiview	uiwindow
you need to subclass the uiview that contains the uiwebview or the uiwindow and then relay the touch event

3424657
width	height
by default they are set to stay the same width and height and stay the same distance from top left corner of the parent view

3424676
rss	feed
i have a requirement to grab images from an rss feed and display these images in much the same way as browsing your picture library and i really dont know where to start first

3424701
switching	screens
i have a wonderfully working view that i have finished and now i d like to be able to switching the view to a brand new blank white screens to display

3424725
put	get
in linux if i put a command in a script that contains an alias i see that it doesn t get expanded

3424726
charindex	substr
you need to combine substr charindex strpos to do this but it not fast operations

3424761
post	get
for example the logger the request information a currently authenticated user get post parameters etc

3424763
stdout	stderr
you might want to consider something like ipc run3 too to allow you to gather the output from stdout and stderr to use as you see fit

3424798
autocomplete	autosuggest
however this construct is limited to one autosuggest word it autocomplete only the first word

3424800
width	margin
specifically how can i induce the width to expand such that its outer width including margin fills up the container

3424839
backgrounding	multitasking
some weeks ago when apple released the sdk4 i made some changes to my app to support multitasking it plays audio in the backgrounding

3424854
for-loop	loops
it s small point not worth much debate but i would consider swapping the foreach loops for a plain for-loop

3424894
ubuntu	linux
with ubuntu linux

3424895
pop-up	dialog
it pop-up a dialog box with the error

3424923
sorting	filtering
to gain some of these benefits try adding meta-data to your model object by adding attributes from the system.componentmodel.dataannotations namespace. try using collectionviewsource to implement filtering sorting and naviation of your collection

3424941
width	height
then set li width height and then add overflow hidden

3424955
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 5.0.375.125 and safari 5 underneath that same bold text where the images should be there are just two outlined squares and nothing else

3424955
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 5.0.375.125 and safari 5 by pointing these two browsers to the url which can easily be done by adding the pound symbol # or by clicking the youtube icon in the follow us on social networking tray the images will be sized the way i would like them to be upon first visit

3425016
subtract	addition
in others yet you ll want to keep in addition to the date some indication about the fact i m saying feb 28 but i really would want feb 30 if it existed so that adding or subtract another month to that can set things right again and the latter obviously requires a custom class holding a data plus s thing else

3425062
hide	show
and i ve made a form to test it checking unchecking checkboxes to show hide some visibletabpage controls i ve added http.. csharp.pastebin.com mkgjgx2g

3425062
hide	show
certain number of clicks on checkboxes in a random sequence the application starts to allocate more and more memory and use some considerable amount of cpu to show hide tabpage controls

3425066
int	boolean
the reason that the bool conversion is preferred is because std string while part of the standard library is not a built-in type like int pointers and boolean

3425094
titlebar	window
i want to detect that it has happened so that in my windowstyle.none window with custom chrome i can implement the proper behavior for double clicking the titlebar

3425108
accessor	properties
you can use this helper cil reader to traverse bodies of properties accessor and reconstruct them with necessary modifications

3425226
cpu	processors
processors id - using wmi it returns a value for the cpu model it s not unique no

3425233
uwsgi	cherokee
5000 it s the port use for the communication between cherokee and uwsgi

3425276
width	height
when the object is first constructed it s essentially positioned at 0 0 with it s expected width height as such

3425351
width	height
i have a large component say width 4000px height 200px and would like to be able to see it entirely even on a small screen

3425366
subclass	accessor
the main reason why is because a subclass might override your accessor and do something different

3425366
subclass	accessor
the subclass s accessor might assume a fully initialised object that all the code in the subclass s init method has run

3425366
subclass	accessor
similarly the subclass s accessor may depend on the subclass s dealloc method not having run

3425434
getdate	dateadd
specifically he lists dateadd ms -3 dateadd wk datediff wk 0 getdate + 1 0 as a way to get this weekend

3425435
post	get
what browsers will do with field names and values that contain non-ascii characters is the same for get and both types of post form it encodes them using the encoding the page containing the form used

3425441
firefox	safari
i have only tested this in safari firefox and ie latest versions of each in spring 2010 but it worked in all of them

3425445
submit	submission
the full story is i want to disable the submit button on a form s submission to prevent multiple submission

3425575
erd	diagram
make sure you know the culture what is a table what is a row what is a column what is a tuple what are keys foreign primary candidate alternate super what are triggers what are the normal forms what is an erd diagram what is relational theory

3425650
listview	gridview
later on i replaced the listview with gridview using search replace but only the inflated one worked from that point on

3425656
google-chrome	firefox
tested browsers firefox 3.5 google-chrome ie8 with and without compatibility mode

3425723
minimum	max	min	max
also you can add a function like min or max to select the person with the maximum or minimum age

3425736
binutils	bfd
i actually trying to compile an application that uses bfd library a part of binutils using mingw

3425748
rar	zip
for packers that include the filename rar zip tar you could of course just make the filename really long -

3425766
maven	pom.xml
i d like to add this dependency into the maven pom.xml file so the other developers on my team don t have to individually each apply this to their systems

3425816
inherited	subclassing
multiple inherited meand that you have 3 classes a is subclassing of b and c but neither b is subclassing of c nor c is subclassing of b

3425816
inherited	subclassing
normal inherited does allow chaining like a is subclassing of b which is subclassing of c

3425851
folder	directory
if you really don t want to put the settings file in the trunk folder then you do have one other option replace the settings file in the stylecop install directory

3425855
int	chars
and also because by convention variables called c are chars but here it s an int

3425891
put	get
just put a blank line between your get block and your set block

3425944
coalesce	isnull
in addition you should consider using coalesce instead of isnull since coalesce is the iso standard

3425999
postgresql	mysql
i am an experienced programmer 16 years with a strong background in web development using python postgresql php mysql

3426017
post	get
get or post requests or use a data section in a post request to send for example an xml-formatted document that describes the action to be taken

3426021
post	get
in each case the magic butterflies represent a scalable cloud communications infrastructure that handles all the complicated telephony stuff required to send receive calls and text messages so that you don t have to worry about anything beyond get post and xml the stuff you re used to working with every day as a web developer

3426075
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this appears fine in firefox ie8 google-chrome safari and opera - but not in ie7 and ie6

3426076
width	height
draw the object boundaries as relatively positioned divs with height and width set

3426076
gif	png
another way to reduce the need to render on the fly - render once all tracking frames for each object as the polygon on a transparent background png or gif

3426085
serializable	deserialization
this is cache-friendly and memory efficient but i m concerned about the cost of serializable deserialization on every access

3426096
mouseover	mouseenter
i think it d be wise to try mouseenter in place of mouseover

3426107
htmlspecialchars	domdocument
by either escaping those characters with htmlspecialchars or perhaps more appropriately using a library for building xml documents such as domdocument or xmlwriter

3426110
coldfusion	railo
also worth mentioning that railo an alternative cfml engine to adobe coldfusion allows you to use the symbols in tag-based code if there is no ambiguity with closing tag the condition is wrapped in parentheses

3426118
versioning	upgrade
at this point i d recommend just waiting a few more weeks presumably until the next versioning comes out and upgrade

3426146
hex	binary
you could translate the number to hex and print off the hex representation in binary

3426269
spaces	delimiter
one was pulled from a database and the other was made using spaces delimiter user input and then explode

3426269
spaces	delimiter
this was the output of the user submitted values spaces delimiter and using phps explode function

3426373
hide	show
how to hide or show line from php designer

3426408
stdio	fflush
i believe you are encountering the buffering of standard io stdio which in c is commonly bypassed via fflush in that language

3426418
processors	hyperthreading
this is caused by hyperthreading in your i7 processors

3426435
hebrew	cjk
cjk chinese japanese korean arabic hebrew etc

3426439
profiling	debugging
you need to do what jamie keeling said and run it through a profiling or even just debugging it and see if you get stuck in some big loops

3426484
disk	ram
if using double means you have to cache to disk vs pure ram your difference will be huge

3426496
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave insted of mouseover because mouseover is triggered every time the pointer moves into the child element and mouseenter only when the pointer moves into the bound element

3426498
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i develop using google-chrome firefox and safari

google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome

3426552
postgresql	mysql
windows and mysql oracle postgresql

3426559
getter	setter
in general you need a lot more than atomic getter setter for most kinds of thread synchronization

3426559
getter	setter
the setter gains a synchronized block and the getter assuming a retain property gains a synchronized block a retain and an autorelease

3426559
getter	setter
edit and yes the autorelease has to be in the getter not the setter

3426579
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it s a pure javascript-implementation of firebug that runs directly in any browser at least in all major ones ie6+ firefox opera safari and google-chrome

3426702
charindex	substr
use substr and charindex as suggested in your duplicate other post

3426743
free	malloc
one good reason to do it is so that you have matching malloc s free s

3426743
free	malloc
if code gets moved around a programmer will naturally look for the matching free to go with the malloc

3426773
free	malloc
keep it simple for every malloc there must be a corresponding free

3426782
for-loop	loops
i understand that str ceases to exist once loops terminates but i also thought that the scope of i was confined to the for-loop as well

3426873
inherited	subclassing
i ve found the discriminator feature but it seems to only apply when you have subclassing in an inherited hierarchy

3426879
for-loop	loops
this is legal in c++ - the outer i is hidden - but it s illegal in c# regardless of whether the inner scope is a for-loop a while loops or whatever

3426903
button	checkbox
i have a static form with about 20 questions texts textarea checkbox dropdown radio and it posts to a post page with a submit button

i ve also tried making the field protected and public clean rebuild solution restarting vs targeting x86 and .net 4.0 specifically on every project in the solution and other non-sensical measures to get rid of this exception but to no avail

3427141
width	height
you can add width height and display inline-block too if you want to adjust the logo box size

3427250
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
this should work well in latest versions of all the modern browsers such as google-chrome safari and opera

3427261
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 or safari webkit 3.1 check out -moz-transform and -webkit-transform

3427290
codeigniter	cakephp
you re usually going to see urls like these when the host in which the server is running does not support .htaccess but the programmer still wanted to have pretty urls - i know for a fact that cakephp has their urls look this way in this situation as does codeigniter

3427300
width	height
html doesn t normally specify the width or height of an image unless it s been specified in the tag itself

3427300
width	height
the other solution which could prove to be a bit of a pain is to check the rendered width height of the image on the server side and provide that in the img width height attributes

3427338
hide	show
you can show and hide several elements from this class including gridlines formulas and outlines

3427340
google-chrome	firefox
in my experiments ie and firefox would let me go 2 back to the parent iframe to access functions but google-chrome gave me a security violation

3427359
onclick	onfocus
as you can see onfocus or onclick it is supposed to animate the expansion of the textarea from it s initial height 20px to it s expanded height 60px

3427359
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari the textarea loses focus so the user is unable to type in the box

3427373
hide	show
to use the status bar activity indicator you can show and hide it like this

superclass	subclassing
option b has the drawback that if you add a new property to your superclass you need to add a new column to each and every subclassing s table

3427492
google-chrome	firefox
from my tests line-height 14px to match the firefox height and line-height 13px to match the google-chrome height

3427503
getter	setter
i would use a getter setter on the objective-c class and pass it to the function as context info

3427527
tcplistener	tcpclient
sending a message to that program is simple enough with tcplistener and tcpclient

3427548
getter	setter
so if you had public property project as icalculatedpath without declared getter and setter this is called an automatic property which i believe was introduced in vb.net 4.0 vb.net will automatically generate _projection

3427567
pop-up	dialog
it pop-up a dialog box with the error

3427619
hide	show
my situation is that i want to hide and show the controls when tapping anywhere on the pagecontent thats not a button and have the controls show much like the iphone video player

3427698
fast-forward	merge
if one of sides didn t do any work since last branching point since merge base the situation is either fast-forward the branch you are on is simply updated to the tip of the branch you are merging or up-to-date there is nothing new to merge and the branch you are on stays unchanged

3427719
squash	branch
github_master â we squash commits from the release branch into single â œ release â commits on this branch as well as tagging releases

3427719
squash	merge
this will merge all the changes from a specific ref squash them into a single set of changes and leave the changes staged

3427736
subclass	accessor
subclass your delegate so that it includes an accessor that tells you when it s editing

3427757

3427904
postgresql	mysql
changed from mysql to postgresql in my rails config

3427963
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
long term i think the html.actionlink which you see in the asp.net-mvc futures library is the way to fly

3427977
post	get
i assume i need to use get or post but i don t understand how to use those to send anything except text entered by the user

3428000
min	max
note that in cases where the values don t start at 1m or in case there s large gaps between the min and the max you will get a lot of zeros in-between the counts

3428009
ienumerable	ilist
which also does convert it from ienumerable to ilist not just evaluate it.

3428036
stdout	stderr
posix only specifies 0 1 and 2 shell ensures that whatever is started gets the file descriptors and libc in application s context also expects them to be the stdin stdout stderr

3428050
implements	extends
the technical problem that all enums implicitly extends java.lang.enum thus they can t extends another class only implements additional interfaces is no accident

3428050
implements	extends
update so you need to have distinct sets of bands for different types of stars - this can be implements using distinct enums extends a common interface

3428144
maven	m2e
up until now i ve been using wicket s web based quickstart but i just realised that m2e allows me to create maven projects from archetypes within eclipse

3428162
put	get
when i run project i get this message on netbeans out put and emulator did not start

3428207
content-length	content-type	outputstream	inputstream	content-disposition	content-length	content-disposition	content-type
if it s located outside the public webcontent for some specific reasons in a fixed path at server machine or in a database then create a servlet which gets an inputstream of it and writes it to the outputstream of the response along at least the content-type content-disposition and content-length headers

3428337
ssl	https
https is a different thing proxy can t read encrypted ssl connections and just interprets a single connect line sent before the https traffic

3428346
wordpress	joomla
i would like to do a site in php mysql using either drupal joomla wordpress that allows me to have class list with description date and students can sign up to pay for it

3428349
superclass	subclassing
you could define a common superclass interface with subclassing for both normal characters and character classes groups

3428353
put	get
or perhaps easier just uses a object and wrap that with a class that has the intelligence to put get the correct types

3428369
outputstream	inputstream
closing this socket will also close the socket s inputstream and outputstream

3428370
mouseup	mousedown
inside the pseudowindowcontainer.cs class i create some event handlers to listen for mousedown mouseup movemove events

3428378
pop-up	dialog
supports pop-up dialog like alert confirm login etc

3428405
folder	directory
simply put the protected directory above your document root that is store it next to the folder where your php scripts are store typically htdocs httpdocs or sometimes just www

3428405
folder	directory
the idea here is that php can access any folder on the server but apache won t let the user navigate above the root directory

3428433
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
one example of this is to act as if you are using a case-sensitive langauge even if you re using a case-insensitive one

3428446
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
you could simplify this code a lot by making capturecurrentframeimage return an nsbitmapimagerep instead of an nsimage since you never actually use an nsimage for anything here

3428478
hide	show
how can i make a button that says show picture and when it s clicked it changes to hide picture

3428479
web.py	cherrypy
i ve used several including web.py gae s webapp and cherrypy

3428480

3428480
hide	show
i tried to set these styles on the element corresponding to the column i want to hide show

3428480
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however it only seems to work in firefox but not in safari or google-chrome

3428542
folder	directory
similarly the folder that holds your compiled zlib library should go into the linker s list of search directory

3428549
libpcap	wireshark
i am trying to save the output of this file in libpcap format and although the file does get saved and the right data is written into it wireshark is unable to open it

3428554
width	height
if the sortable elements has its width border etc the intersection-calculation could be a little off since width and height don t return the correct values in this case

3428636
stateless	stateful
as a rule though this indicates you are treating the web as stateful rather than stateless

3428656
int	double
instances to convert into the json type are provided for double int etc but not for rational -- though there is actually no good reason for this as the instance is trivial

3428669
google-chrome	safari
i m trying to write to a global error handler that can work in google-chrome and safari

3428685
ant	maven
we re optimizing our maven configuration from previously using ant and i ve just read the maven by example book from sonatype

3428692
accessor	properties
my suggestion is to simply store the mkcoordinateregion s struct values latitude longitude latitudedelta and longitudedelta as separate properties and then on your model class provide a custom accessor that assembles these into a mkcoordinateregion object

3428697
dependency-injection	singleton
also most dependency-injection schemes have some way to mark a class as a singleton

3428734
freebsd	linux
i am deciding whether the company view that end users should not mess around with product internals can be squared with the linux gpl or whether i should bite the bullet and switch to freebsd

3428757
allocator	stl
stl collections store elements by value allocator and releasing space for it

3428768
yacc	bison
it s generally used by automated code generation tools like yacc or bison to set the line number to the value of the line in the actual source file rather than the c source file

3428768
yacc	bison
trust me unless you want to get deeply involved in the internals of lexical and semantic analysis or you want a brain haemorrhage you don t want to go through the code generated by yacc bison may generate nicer code i don t know but nor do i really care since i write the higher level code

3428768
yacc	bison
we may be bent and twisted but we re not usually malevolent - that line was put there by yacc or bison itself to do you a favour

3428854
yacc	bison
of course in this case you are looking at a file that was written by a tool probably named yacc or bison that is used to create parsers from a description of their grammar

3428854
yacc	bison
the documentation for yacc bison or whatever the tool is will likely also be helpful

3428869
free	malloc
it is my understanding that in general malloc 0 will allocate the memory which should still be free later

3428955
svcutil.exe	basichttpbinding
i have a .net wcf service hosted with basichttpbinding -- i m successfully calling this service from another .net application i ve used the visual studio svcutil.exe to generate the proxy class via add service reference

3428959
boost	allocator
you can find more information in the boost pointer containers library documentation which explains the clonable and clone allocator concepts

3428996
gridview	sqldatasource
without using codebehind file test.aspx.cs file or no c# code or javascript how to populates gridview only using sqldatasource gui or html tag in aspx.file when i specify text in textbox and hit click the button control in current test.aspx page

3429009
super	implements
when implements savings copywithzone you call super copywithzone

3429044
integer	unsigned
your numbers are large so use a 64-bit unsigned integer data type such as unsigned long long

3429067
rss	feed
i m having trouble figuring out why the rss feed appears blank for one page but not another

3429101
unix	bsd
i m trying to get mingw and msys working so i can build iconv and libxml2 in windows but i m finding . configure and make are giving lots of bsd unix related errors that aren t specific enough to google and not descriptive enough for me to figure out

3429101
zlib	libpng
i got the newest libpng zlib and curl built with no issues but i see there isn t much support or how-to s for these libraries like there was for the others

3429124
public	protected
it is a very dangerous tool especially in production so i d strictly recommend to include it in a password protected administration environment and deny public access

3429147
sequence	permutation
you can construct a collection of sequence where each sequence is a permutation of your loop variables i j k .

3429147
sequence	permutation
you pass a sequence 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 of any length where each inner 1 2 sequence replaces one of your loop variables and you get back a sequence of all permutation of the values

3429167
getter	setter
they are -- or at least were at some point -- big on keeping the language as clean as possible. their approach was instead the java bean specs which specified a naming convention for getter and setter

3429167
getter	setter
ides that know the spec can more-or-less fudge the view of the getter and setter as a single property for design purposes

3429190
put	get
oh and if you have any influence on the xml format try to get ppl to always put that value intoa value tag even if it s just one

3429212
int	double
for a second i thought this may have been because i changed the numbers themselves to int types but i made them double again and it was still kind of screwy

3429253
getter	setter
you might want to have a look at project lombok which is a kind of extension to java using annotations to make it possible to write more concise code it can for example automatically generate getter and setter for fields

3429258
int	double
you should also stick with using double and not int

3429352
uilabel	nsstring
i have a nsmutablearray of some instances of a custom class it has a nsstring cgpoint and a uilabel

3429488
int	chars
i wonder if c c++ can actually do this sort of replacement of bit patterns of length that do not fit into a chars 1 byte variable or even int 4 bytes

3429497
tabcontrol	tabitem
upper part of tabcontrol consists of tabitem controls

3429520
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome already support it or the latest versions anyway

3429576
gridview	onclientclick
i am manually binding the gridview from a database and don t want to rebind the grid just to highlight the row but i can t seem to add any javascript to the onclientclick event it seems to either show the getpostbackclienthyperlink or the row highlight javascript

3429603
emacs	textmate
google for textmate theme emacs and you can also find midnight and blackboard converted to emacs color-themes

3429604
tabcontrol	tabitem
here is a nice article on customizing the tabcontrol and the tabitem controls

3429627
gdi	directdraw
gdiobj a free utility provided by feng yuan as a sample program for his book windows graphics programming win32 gdi and directdraw might be useful

3429653
filesystems	ntfs
using windowsxp ntfs as filesystems and php 5.3.2 there was no problem with this test script

3429668
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo not to ask passwd

3429707
centos	linux
redhat or centos linux 64-bit

3429723
apache	lighttpd
although technically possible to run on tomcat it s more conventional to run php sites on apache or lighttpd

3429745
dictionary	map
i have already a dictionary map old and new link for changing

3429760
vim	textmate
commandt for vim is very much the comparable feature as in textmate

3429783
int	chars
is reading an int value from the input stream and is not processing the newline chars then when you come back to point where you get the name at which point a new line is still in the reader s buffer and gets consumed by the stringgetter returning an empty value for name

3429810
writetofile	nsdata
now i can save the audio data using writetofile atomically nsdata method but the audio won t play

3429830
visualvm	jprofiler
jprofiler visualvm etc

3429878
put	get
i thought that was the point of the parameters passed to the datetimefields or are they just defaults and since i ve set editable false they don t get displayed on the form hence don t get submitted in the request and therefore don t get put into the form

3429900
getter	setter
that way you can clearly name your fields and getter and setter making your code easier to read and extend

3429909
swt	swing	awt	swing
options i see are awt swing and swt

3429914
georss	kml
the most common standards are kml georss gml

3429920
setinterval	settimeout
also setinterval is preferable over settimeout in your case to avoid stacking up your calls in the long run therefore you should not rely on settimeout nor setinterval for a 1 second interval but you should have a variable to calculate the exact time span between each calls

3429922
rss	feed
but why don t you take the rss feed from

3429922
rss	feed
i use that one for fetching twitter rss feed

3429967
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
possibly you need to forget about the hash and just loops over the arrays with a for-loop that increments by 2 each time round

3430016
hash	md5
suppose you have a md5 hash encoded in base64

3430016
hash	md5
base64 md5 hash can shrink down to 6 22 132 bits which

3430057
awt	swing
awt is obsolete though some of its classes and design form the underpinnings of the swing api

3430057
swt	swing
here is my take on the differentiators between creating applications in swing and swt

3430073
public	protected
classes in standard c++ cannot be public or private or protected inside outside a namespace

3430100
hash	md5
if you re using the md5 sha or hashlib modules for example you don t need to encode it as anything in the first place - just call .digest instead of .hexdigest on the hash object

3430119
post	put
instead of sending your files with a form multidata over http post you can send your files with a little bit of javascript with the http put method to your server

3430124
int	chars
ruby doen t have any primitives like int chars etc in java so every value anything that can sit on the right of an assignment statement is an object

3430147
rtsp	sdp
i am working on a project in which i need to stream an sdp file from rtsp server

3430159
bitarray	bitset
it seems this is called a bitarray in c# in java it is bitset

3430215
rational-numbers	integer
store your rational-numbers as a division of two integer numbers and in most situations you ll be able to store numbers without any precision loss

3430218
inherited	properties
so in all while c# shares a c c++ inherited with java it also has an inherited that java does not share which made properties seem like a good idea to c# s creators but not to java s

3430218
getter	setter
if a property was both fully public and had no additional functionality in getter or setter which is the case with automatic properties i d rather just have a public field encapsulation is no argument here as fully exposing it publicly by-passes that anyway but the differences between fields and properties works against that

3430249
int	chars
the tag bits determine how the value bits are to be interpreted as a pointer and to what or as a direct constant such as an int or chars

3430249
int	chars
a plain vector is an array of such objects so there is no indirection in a vector of int or chars

3430258
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie firefox - all ok but safari nope it just wont fire

3430296
client-side	server-side
but you state preferably with sql ce i think you always have ce client-side but that it is not yet supported for the server-side

3430484
int	boolean	int	double
first we avoid using objects by using java primitive types boolean byte int double and long to represent our data for processing

3430519
retaincount	dealloc
i have an view based application and when i checked if the dealloc method was workin i saw that doesnt...debug and debug then using retaincount i discover that my viewcontroller retaincount gets crazy on the program start...its easy to reproduce..

3430524
getter	setter
you only need to add generate getter and setter yourself

3430582
post	get
that will create a url link a get not a post and the acceptverbs httpverbs.post would have forced no match

3430622
google-chrome	firefox
if you look in firefox or google-chrome you can see that it creates a subtle effect

3430638
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
now this all works just fine from firefox or safari and other uses of relative urls work fine in google-chrome iframe src urls images scripts css etc but google-chrome just won t pay attention to those .load requests at all

3430638
firefox	safari
and safari or firefox to the same file urls always do what i expect and load the content.

3430669
post	get
for example if i want to search for conti i get thsi url type post

3430695
daemons	launchd
on mac os x use a launchd script for shell daemons

3430713
daemons	systemd
use your systemd s daemons facility such as start-stop-daemon

3430758
mouse	keyboard
machine dependent means fundamentally dependent on the hardware that comprises the computer - ram can be accessed via the cpu+ram bus so isn t necessarily part of this - however video cards external storage mouse keyboard etc

3430787
int	chars
adding int to main puts it at 36 chars

3430837
inline	inlining
the main use for the inline keyword is not to request inlining but to indicate that the function may be #included in multiple translation units without causing multiple definition errors

3430845
post	get
it is not trivially possible no the easiest way would actually be to write your own template context processor that checks for example if something like is set then sets dictionary values based on some other get or post data

3430845
super	self
return super mymodelmanager self .get_query_set .filter preview false

3430848
int	chars
suppose we ve got two int and chars variables

3430848
int	chars
assuming we re discussing a platform in which length of an int variable is longer than or equal to three bytes i want to access third byte of this int and put it in the chars variable with that said i d write it like this

3430855
put	get
putting a particular sequence of bits through an x86 processor will get you completely different results than if you put the same set of bits through say an arm processor

3430860
inline	inlining
of course it won t inline calls when they re done through an explicit pointer to the function that is stashed away at some points and used at others or when the function s address is passed as a parameter to some other function - but that might affect the inlining of specific calls not necessarily other calls to the same function that are done differently

3430885
button	checkbox
think of a ui with a couple radio button checkbox text boxes and sliders to control the parameters

3430958
serializable	deserialization
i m not sure why i didn t look into this sooner but it occurred to me that there must be something available in .net that gives you class serializable deserialization for free and of course that comes in the form of the xmlserializer class

3430958
serializable	deserialization
i m thinking that in my particular case i either suck it up and allow the members to get overwritten bad or i go back to my original way of doing things which is to just write all of the serializable deserialization code myself

3430966
prepare	execute
create a prepare statement from each row and execute

3430974
maven	m2e
regarding #2 check out m2e plugin for full maven integration in eclipse

3430987
pop-up	dialog
i have the dialog pop-up and disappear but i don t know how to populate the listview after the thread is done

3430995
serializable	deserialization
you can create a pure data transfer object with r w properties and use it for serializable deserialization

3431013
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason the mario game that resig links to plays sound for me in firefox but not google-chrome or safari

3431057
g++	gcc
in this case i would include the c header as extern c in my c++ file call the function compile the c object using gcc -c and pass the result to g++ along with the actual c++ sources

3431214
width	height
the green box is fixed width fixed height

3431257
portrait	landscape
now i could just come upw tih an option for the portrait orientations however truth be told it would be ugly and non functional hence my desire to work for landscape only in this particular instance

3431293
put	get	post	put	post	get
in fact once a couple browsers support the proper html5 spec form methods get post put delete i ll be dumping this js hack for it

3431303
submit	submission
have a separate submit button in the form for submission the order

3431314
pull	push
git pull origin master or push

3431326
stateless	stateful
if i understand correctly making a stateless page is achieved by making the page bookmarkable and making sure that no stateful components are added to the page

3431330
nsmenuitem	nsmatrix
now the nsmenuitem not an nsmatrix

3431351
onresume	onpause
we call it with onpause in the activity s onpause function and onresume in the activity s onresume function

3431355
int	double
for example if you have too functions called foo one of which takes an int and the other of which takes a double in files intfoo.c and doublefoo.c you can compile them like this

3431374
wordpress	joomla
if the standard modules plugins themes templates from wordpress drupal or joomla fill your needs then using a cms can be a lot faster than building a site from scratch

3431432

powerpc	i386
if only powerpc and i386 are present while you require x86_64 then the library cannot be loaded

3431517
hide	show
that s a simple task in asp.net webforms if you want to show hide a control all you need to do is set visible true or visible false

3431517
hide	show
however i dont know how to accomplish that in mvc.i have a div in my view that needs to show hide depending validation on server

3431517
hide	show
i need to show or hide it dynamic but needs to be controlled by server

3431518
post	get
i also believe that u get what i mean by this post and what i want to accomplish.

3431587
int	double
average needs lists of numbers int double float ... or a conversion function that produces numbers

3431677
spaces	delimiter
as defined the arguments property is of type string so you could only pass spaces delimiter arguments to the process the same way you would when calling it at the command line

3431678
margin	border-color
for instance margin and padding are the shorthands of their -top -right -bottom and -left components and border is the shorthand for border-width border-color and border-style which are all shorthands for their properties

3431702
width	margin
put your content in a container div that s set to a specific width and them set the left and right margins to auto margin 0px auto 0px auto the margin values refer to top right bottom and left in that order same for padding in css in the css

3431704
cos	sin
i have defined a class in c++ which holds an array of scalars of type t for which i want to define operators like sin cos etc

3431713
width	height
if it is important to maintain an exact row height the easiest way to achieve dynamic vertical centering in webkit is to use a wrapper div with properties like this keeping the height on li and the width on #wrapper as you mentioned before

3431722
django	web2py
i am a current web2py user but find i still go back to django once in a while where i started

3431722
django	web2py
specifically when working on projects where i want to make use of some specific django apps plugins extensions that don t yet exist in web2py

3431722
django	web2py
one thing that i can t live without in web2py which i am looking for a solution for in django is the way to create html forms from a db table and being able to then customize their look and layout in the view without javascript

3431764
inherited	properties
the real difference is that they effect inherited properties differently

3431764
background-image	background-color
that in mind it s generally best to apply background to the most general abstracted rule of an element and then overwrite properties on more specific instances using classes or ids with background-color background-image etc

3431790
versioning	upgrade
there are newer beta versioning of xampp that come with newer php upgrade

3431809
superclass	subclassing
to subclassing a class the superclass s full declaration must be available to the compiler

3431817
octal	decimal
the leading 0 means that the number is in octal base 8 rather than decimal base 10

3431818
octal	decimal
05000 is octal notation 2560 is decimal notation

3431836
onresume	onpause
i d try using reflection to see if onpause and later onresume when you want stuff to start up again does what you need

3431873
uitableview	uisearchbar
uinavigationcontroller + uitableview + uisearchbar + uisplitviewcontroller

3431879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i can t understand why this works as a plain userscript in ninjakit and also actually works in firefox opera and google-chrome it just wont work as an extension in safari its soooo annoying

move	drag
when you drag a file to the application you made it will move it to your directory

3436129
nsstring	nsobject	printf	fgets
i m not a wonderful c programmer and having to get into printf scanf and their instabilities or even worse fgets and their ilk isn t exactly putting me in a comforting setting for this reason exactly i love nslog with its comforting default namespace and its automatic nsstring and nsobject parsing

opera	safari
those outrageous big headers in opera safari and ie took minutes to load

3436182
ubuntu	linux
windows only was the worse but i prefer it with a virtual machine loaded with a ubuntu server 10.04 it helps you in deployment also as the most servers have linux i have samba - access to the ubuntu files through windows explorer and it is working like a charm

3436182
ubuntu	linux
mac os x is also a good choice but it isn t as good as ubuntu for me i am used to windows graphical environment and the commands in the command line sometimes is a little different mac osx is unix it isn t linux and it doesn t use x windows so it is a little tricky to feel comfortable you have to learn a lot more to get the productivity you already have with windows

3436182
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate

ubuntu	linux
sure under os x you have many nice tools available like textmate but there are many others in ubuntu linux available too

3436326
textmate	gedit
gedit can replace textmate quite well when using the right plugins and for big projects i would always prefer netbeans for rails and java

3436372
addition	multiplication
even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching

3436372
addition	multiplication
in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it

3436393
jobs	cron
the problem is that if there s 700 jobs in the job_queue each run of cron does only some of them so i need to run cron several times

3436393
jobs	cron
i m aware of drush cron but this also does only some of the jobs each run so needs to be run again manually

inherited	subclassing
so the thought experiement was to determine what would happen if i wrote a version of inherited that inserted stub functions onto the subclassing that delegated back to the prototype for you

3436515
inherited	subclassing
all the work that was done in the inherited method to map base class methods to the subclassing appears to have been lost

3436515
inherited	subclassing
the big mystery for me here is the disappearance of the methods that i added to subclassing during the execution of inherited

3436542
width	margin
the width used should be the width of the images plus padding and margin after any margin collapse

3436557
fadein	fadeout

3436720
hide	show
however i was wondering if there is a way of getting which continue button was pressed that is of which form so to just have a piece of code that basically checks and hide the current form and show up the next one without requiring id s or such

3436731
jsf	tapestry
as part of improving refactoring the codebase - we would like to upgrade to a more modern mvc framework so as to eliminate the need for action form classes and to use annotation-based configuration when possible etc but keep the overall classic-mvc style not currently interested in making the leap to jsf tapestry gwt flex play etc

3436735
children	parent
but if you re using jquery the parent method lets you trivially-easily find an object s parent so in that case i d recommend just making the continue buttons immediate children of their respective forms

3437295
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you can t append objects to a file with an objectoutputstream and get them back again because objectoutputstreams have headers that won t be understood when you read the file back unless you can organize to know where the boundaries between appends are and create a new objectinputstream each time as appropriate

3437297
width	height
i ve got all the maths and ratio stuff worked out it s just a matter of extracting the height and width from the and then replacing those with the new dimensions

3437318
sudo	passwd

subtract	add
when you add or subtract 1 from a pointer you ask it to point to the next or previous object of that type in memory

code using these operators should be modified to use std min and std max instead

3437433
min	max
there s a std min and std max in c++ but afaik there s no equivalent in the c standard library

3437435
minimum	max	min	max
earlier iterations of g++ not the c compiler used these operators for giving you the minimum or maximum values but they ve long been deprecated in favour of std min and std max

getter	setter
i used to create each action class which is dealing with same beans and of course there are same codes variables and their getter and setter duplicated in each action class

3438466
int	chars	int	double
the second implementation uses one thread to read the file at the byte level one thread to decode the chars from bytebuffer to charbuffer and multiple threads to parse the fields i mean parsing delimitted text fields into double int dates...

3438492
int	chars
f is a string and the query is expecting an smallint-value because i guess that chars is mapped to some int values

if you want to hide the data in your list views from a group of users visitors and show them to another group of users admin

3438566
qiodevice	phonon
given that the question is specifically about using qiodevice however and that you mentioned that reading from a wav file was just your intitial approach i ll assume that you actually need a streaming api one which allows the client to control the buffering rather than handing over this control to a higher-level abstraction such as phonon

3438566
qiodevice	qfile
it is a good choice if the qiodevice being used is one which is provided by qt qfile qabstractsocket etc

3438579

3438711
stdout	stderr
exec only places the output to stdout in the output array however various imagemagick tools also output messages to stderr

3438711
stdout	stderr
you can redirect messages from stderr to stdout and hence also get them in output array by appending this at the end of your command

3438711
stdout	stderr
alternatively if you want to be able to differentiate where the messages were originally output you can use proc_open that allows you to specify separate pipes for stdout and stderr and capture output from them separately

3438718
folder	directory
you can not directly create folder in root directory of a web-server by programming

3438718

children	parent
i have tested for one parent to many children and the children primary key is set to a generated childrenid

3439021

but somehow i cannot do it using composite key my guess is that as parentname in children is a primary key but will only be filled after parentname in parent has been filled well sth like that

3439036
spaces	delimiter
where c would be the third and last token with delimiter being spaces and and a the first one

3439072

i am struggling to get my head around how a post processing technique works

3439088
onmouseover	onclick
set an onclick onmouseover event handler

3439094

3439432
getter	setter
for instance ruby objects don t have public attributes only getter and setter

3439432
getter	setter
but you can automatically create multiple getter setter with a single line like attr_accessor attr1 attr2 attr3 .

3439502
strsplit	read.table
if you can t get read.table to work you can always fall back on readlines and extract the file contents manually using for example strsplit

3439538
post	get
there is some information here on how to get that working and see other post on that blog

3439627
keydown	keyup
i d go for the bug mainly because if you put the keydown and keyup events in there it shows that that they are fired only once each of them but the textboxchanged event is fired twice

3439714
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
so you can try to use methods like touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent and touchesended withevent to detect user actions

3439721
hash-collision	key
for example if the write operation triggers an array resize or if the two key are a hash-collision

3439726
put	get
get the first number from selectnums array and put it in the row with the smallest count and put in on the ticket in that particular row

3439800
unsigned	short
i know it is possible to assign an unsigned char to an unsigned short but i would like to have more control how the bits are actually assigned to the unsigned short

3439800
unsigned	short
so i can specify where the 8 bits from the unsigned char should be placed in the bigger 16 bit unsigned short variable

3439800
unsigned	short
it will and should always return an unsigned short since it will sometimes calculate an 16 bit crc

3439845
x86	64bit
check if the module is compatible with an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of regsvr32.exe

3439880
mouseup	mousedown
edit another aspect of the problem is that the non-scrolling actually triggers js-eventhandler click mousedown mouseup inside my webview which leads to surprising app behavior

3439883
width	height
in theory if you use that bytearray as the source for an image tag you ll be able to get the height and width that way once you add that image to a container

3440033
lisp	smalltalk	interpreted-language	compiled-language	interpreted-language	smalltalk
2 you have to distinguish between true compiled-language classic c++ interpreted-language classic lisp vm based languages smalltalk pascal and the newer breed of hybrids that present a vm up to the user but can recompile on the fly on the host machine using peephole optimization c# java - an interpreted-language will always be slower than a native compiled-language - native compiled-language do not have execution engines all others have one form or another of an execution engine

3440066
int	double
t i write a for-loop like this for int i 1 double i2 0

3440317
textarea	textbox
you are setting the textmode to multiline in the string you are passing to parsecontrol you will always get a textarea that s how the textbox control works

3440333
getter	setter
you could continue to use the generic superclass but this would require moving the field to the entities where they would have types defined then have abstract internal getter setter for those fields that return object that the generic methods would call casting to the generic type

3440352
post	get
it would appear you re using using get query parameters but sending the ajax request via post

3440371
google-chrome	safari
this however does not work at all for me in google-chrome safari

3440379
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox etc but returns an empty file in internet explorer

3440392
typedef	struct
in c you can not refer to a struct without using the struct keyword unless you create typedef name which resolves to the struct name

3440392
typedef	struct
struct and typedef live in a different namespace if you want to

3440392
typedef	struct
however in c++ both struct and typedef names go into the same namespace

3440392
typedef	struct
this declaration actually created two things called edgenode a typedef for the unnamed struct and an incomplete type struct edgenode that is not defined anywhere

3440405

3440490
serializable	deserialization
i then serializable to xml and when i deserialize information about casing is lost - the deserialization is made to the dictionary with genericequalitycomparer which apparently is case sensitive because it doesn t find my keys if they are not cased correctly

3440490
serializable	deserialization
the deserialization worked the whole time it is just that it deserializes the serializable dictionary to one that does not use case insensitive keys

3441533
abc	isinstance
this may also be needed in 2.6 or later perhaps for the purpose of making your own registrations to add types you care about that haven t already be registered onto numbers.numbers -- if you want to exclude some types that claim they re numbers but you just can t handle that takes even more care as abcs have no unregister method for example you could make your own abc weirdnum and register there all such weird-for-you types then first check for isinstance thereof to bail out before you proceed to checking for isinstance of the normal numbers.number to continue successfully

3441849
inherited	properties
element.style only contains style properties that are defined in the element s style attribute and not style properties inherited from blocks or external css files

3441850

this library looks reasonable you could probably load each url s contents hand it to the library and if the library successfully parses it mark it as an rss or atom feed

3441869
mouseup	mousedown
you ll need to record when the mouse is down and up using the mousedown and mouseup events

3441878

also look at ftell to record a position that you can jump back to using fseek

3442498

division	modulo
very fast division modulo

3442550
inherited	properties
value inherited the properties s value depends on the value in its parent ancestor object

3442550

you have to delegate the getter and setter to getvalue and setvalue so that the clr property and the dependency property system do the same thing

3442557

it still has problems even apart from the factors of what wsgi on 3.x will actually mean

when my business objects need it later during the call they will access it as a properties of a base class that all my objects inherited from

3442995

worse protected data like public data cannot easily be restructured because there is no good way of finding every use

3443000
versioning	upgrade
either make sure you have leerc___.afm at the given path or try to upgrade to a more recent reportlab versioning

3443091
hide	show
you could put classes on the s you want to hide and then use toggle to show and hide them

3443119
free	malloc
c s malloc and free and c++ s new and delete do very different things

3443119
free	malloc
but initially i would keep the malloc and free calls and just abstract them with c++ unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise

3443162
public	protected
use a public constructor and a protected constructor in the base class the public one to create a base class object that then also creates your member variable with new and the protected one to be called from derived class constructors

3443162
inherited	properties
anyhow propably something is wrong with your class design inherited means a is a association so usually all properties member variables of your base class are also part of the derived classes

if the footer is very fluid then you will have trouble forcing it down and there is no properly elegant solution for the layout you are describing flexbox will do it on webkit and gecko though

3443288
free	malloc
there is no garbage collection in c if you call malloc somewhere you better make sure that you call free somewhere else

versioning	upgrade
on a versioning upgrade of the page i need to prompt the user regardless

3443309
post	get
i ve actually been through this same problem on the windows mobile platform and the only thing that worked was to extend the webbrowser control using c++ to capture the post get vars before the request is sent

3443309
post	get
so although it is not possible to get the post get vars used for your basic auth on a standard webbrowser control it would be possible if you use an extended control such as the sample i linked - in fact many extended webbrowser controls are created because of problems very similar to yours

3443313
post	get
i ve done this because i get http 500 errors when i do a post and try to parse my parameters via data request.data

3443313

uiview	calayer
if they all animate i d definitely use uiview calayer

3443482
width	height
a mutable square is not a mutable rectangle because mutable rectangles should provide the ability to set the width to 2 and the height to 3

3443482
width	height
neither is a mutable rectangle a mutable square since mutable squares should have the property that if you change the width the height changes

3443482
width	height
so mutable rectangles whose width and height happen to be equal aren t the same thing as mutable squares at all

3443554
public	protected
in the interests of data-hiding and oo-design though it should almost never be public or protected which is just a fancy way of saying anyone can mess up my data

3443581
for-loop	loops
then don t use a for-loop use a while loops instead

3443581
for-loop	loops
for me a for-loop always implies a simple iterative loops using a counter

3443581
for-loop	loops
however if i encounter a while loops i feel like things must have been too complicated to to express them in a simple for-loop

it currently just show and hide the box1 div which is all the code is supposed to do

3443960
width	height
a square has just one property width which is also its height

3443960
width	height
a rectangle has both a width and a height

3443960
width	height
now you could implement your rectangle as a separate class that has a height and width but then you d have two classes with a width - square and rectangle

3443974

since here message processing is cpu bound 100s of mailbox processors will all wake up and start spawning thread pool threads

background-repeat	background-position
also background-repeat is supposed to be defined before background-position although most browsers will understand the values in whichever order they are given

3444337
cpu	processors
as cache is a cpu concept and is meaningless for c language and c language has targets processors that have no cache unlikely today but quite common in old days definitely no

getter	setter
i am trying to understand when and why to use getter and setter

3444352
ssl	https
i know that the broken machine is indeed proxying traffic through fiddler as i see the fiddler ssl cert when i go to https sites

3444389

cos	sin
x y cx cy +r cos t sin t

3444412
post	get
i m trying to get the post-id my post

3444431
getter	setter
the reasoning behind getter setter is to protect the class from being broken when a user alters a field in an invalid way and they allow you to change the implementation of your class while leaving the publicly exposed properties unchanged

3444436
configobj	configparser
i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library

3444451
pop-up	dialog
http auth means the user gets a pop-up dialog window asking for a username and password it s less usual than the self-rolled version

3444461
getter	setter
if other classes will need to view something in your class you ll need to expose a getter but not a setter

3444461
getter	setter
no getter unless necessary no setter unless necessary and setter should perform any small logic necessary to verify input before accepting it if appropriate

3444461
getter	setter
that said avoid the other trap putting lots of code in getter setter

3444471
portrait	landscape
in the xib i have two uiview a landscapeview for landscape and a portraitview for portrait

3444471
switching	screens
then mycontroller switching between these views depending on the screens orientation by setting its view property

3444481
allocator	stl
note though that i d still store the items in the stl container by value -- unless your object is huge overhead of heap allocator is going to mean you re using more storage and are less efficient than you would be if you just stored the item by value

3444495
getter	setter
like others mentioned use getter setter when you want the object members to be available to other objects

3444499
x509	pkcs#1
in the case of public keys the obvious choices are as a pkcs#1 rsapublickey asn.1 structure der-encoded or as an x509 subjectpublickeyinfo asn.1 structure der-encoded

3444507
ssl	https
the only problem is when i create and apply the proxy it works just fine over http but when i pass it a https ssl url it gives me the following errors

3444527
rss	feed
if it helps try to preload data fetch rss feed and all that at the start and when you ve got most of the important bits that don t require refreshes loads frequently display the app

3444544
post	get
i have a relatively simple example of an mvc page that is using jquery to make a post to get some json data and then just show a success failure message when it is done

3444579
hash	md5
the password should be scrambled usually done using the md5 hash algorithm and stored in the database in the same way

3444596
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this sets the referrer to b.com on opera safari and google-chrome but not ie or firefox

3444632
inherited	subclassing
and i think that you should also read about the various inherited strategies to represent inherited at the database level single table per class hierarchy table per concrete class joined subclassing supported by jpa as they don t provide the same level of support for polymorphic queries

3444632
inherited	properties
inherited properties from superclasses

3444645
folder	directory
i am hoping to loop through folder in a directory and repeat this procedure

3444666
configobj	configparser
configparser has a really bad api configobj is supposed to be good but i have never used it for ini files i usually implement my own parser

3444683
apache	nginx
after some extra digging i found a setting in the production.rb file config.serve_static_assets which was set to false and since i m not running apache or nginx the static files where not served

3444753
javadb	hsqldb
if you don t want a full-featured database use something like hsqldb or javadb

3444764
portrait	landscape
i am doing this to overcome the landscape-only camera limitation present in android 2.1 and below by having the activity be in landscape but placing my camera overlay into this framelayout overlay to cause it to appear as if it was portrait this is how layar does it to accomplish this i m adapting jeff sharkey s code to rotate views

3444764
portrait	landscape
so on my g1 instead of a 320x480 portrait view over a 480x320 camera view in landscape i get a 320x320 box in the middle showing my portrait view with the sides chopped off

3444804
web.py	cherrypy
can i use node.js web.py cherrypy etc.

3444809
ilist	iqueryable
you can do it yes but it won t have the desired effect since assuming dc is a linq to sql data context an iqueryable is not a collection of data it is a stored query which will execute later you will need to store an ilist or similar you could still return it as an iqueryable if desired though that could be confusing to others

3444828
x86	64bit
using a 32-bit client on a 64bit os can be tricky and it is safer to not install it in the program files x86 folder

3444886
portrait	landscape
when the app starts it has proper orientation landscape but when i change my view it becomes portrait and becomes again landscape only after rotating device 270 degree not 90 lol

3444902
range	minimum
this extends to the integer types too - the c standard integral types have minimum range eg

3444902
int	chars
signed chars is -127 to 127 short and int are both -32 767 to 32 767 long is -2 147 483 647 to 2 147 483 647 and long long is -9 223 372 036 854 775 807 to 9 223 372 036 854 775 807

3444904
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in google-chrome firefox and safari

3444906
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in this case view controllers that have views which are managed by a tab bar controller are sent the viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear

3444917
explode	implode
implode is the opposite of explode

3444919
apache	nginx
a front-end apache or nginx or similar accepts the initial web request

3444919
apache	nginx
the results are fed back into apache or nginx via mod_wsgi to the user s browser

3444919
django	web.py
just have lots of httpd nginx front-ends that spawn django or web.py or whatever which all share a common database

3444948
versioning	upgrade
if you lock your users into your current api on every release you re providing motivation for them to not upgrade to your latest versioning - this is the opposite of the intended motivation as this increases your support requirements you have to support more older versioning and keeps users from using your latest and greatest features

3444957
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you can just use the usual fileoutputstream and fileinputstream classes to respectively write to and read from the disk

3444957
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
change your pdf generator to write to fileoutputstream and change your file servlet to read from fileinputstream

3444965
for-loop	arrays
this doesn t work it would require a 1d arrays according to the error i get i don t know why datasource gridview would be limited like this i have read up on some very ugly solutions to it but really all i need is to just write a nested for-loop to output n columns and n rows to the asp.net page

3444976
width	height
a good way to do this is to create a vector that operates in x y dimensions x being the width of your image and y being the height with the value for each dimension applying to the x y pixel value

3444980
portrait	landscape
there are two landscape modes and two portrait modes

3444980
portrait	landscape
for instance if you flip to one of the portrait modes let s say with home button on the bottom from landscape left you are going to get a 270 degree rotation

3444990
concave	convex
if it s concave you ll have to be very careful to not let your fill lines cross over the border or do some pre-processing and subdivide the original poly into two or more convex ones

3445015
integer	unsigned
there is a property ipaddress.address but it s obsolete i don t know why since if you don t need sorting or control over the ip classes the best way is to store it as unsigned integer that has a max value of 0xffffffff which equals to 255.255.255.255 in decimal representation

3445023
nsstring	nsdata	writetofile	nsdata
you will not likely be customizing writetofile since the way you assemble xml data will probably be with nsstring or nsdata on an iphone which already have the i o methods you need

3445044
pull	push
i can commit pull push etc

3445077
jquery	simplemodal
simplemodal and every other jquery modal i know off will reverse display none when they show the modal...they re actually expecting this

3445087
gif	png
again i am unsure how transparency data is stored for certain image types gif png etc but this will be extractable and would serve as an effective simplified cut out to compare with your data sets transparency

3445087
trie	tree
comparing trie tree should be reasonably easy and could possible provide effective results

3445099
post	get
by the way it looks like your request is idempotent so consider using get instead of post

3445186
hide	show
if your requirement is to first hide it and show based on some user action i would use jquery to do the hiding

3445203
boost	stl
otherwise you ll either 1 want to use stl containers of smart pointers like boost shared_ptr which is legal for stl containers or 2 manage the lifetime of the pointed-to objects some other way

3445205
stdout	stderr
capturing stdout stderr exit_status etc

3445290
textview	imageview
conceptually i want the rest of the screen to be a vertically oriented content region for displaying either the text textview of the url and get text was clicked or the image imageview in the case where it was an image and get image was clicked

3445331
mouseover	mouseout
i have some code that adds mouseover events and mouseout events to all a tags on a page

3445374
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am trying to figure out how to use a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller and uitableview together

3445403
textview	imageview
since you want the textview and imageview to be on top of each other you might look at using a framelayout instead of the linearlayout

3445431
int	boolean
it is noted that there are answers on how to do this with a string or int value but i can t find a boolean example

3445449
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i personally use google-chrome not for testing but i m expecting the webapp to be used across safari ie7 ie8 and firefox

3445474
mouseout	mouseenter
once the dim class is removed on mouseenter this no longer responds to a mouseout event

3445486
int	chars
internally factor s are int with an attribute level chars vector see and which is clean

3445518
button	checkbox
however when i tried swapping the checkbox with radio button the radio button do fill in upon clicking

3445558
hide	show
if this is the case then you could add mywidget to that same parent view and so long as it is last in the subviews array it will show up on top as you show hide the other two views

3445577
rss	feed
rss feed are typically managed on the server and consumed by the client

3445600
maven	pom.xml
if you make maven work in online mode it will always try to update or download missed plugins or pom.xml which is not necessary

3445603
width	height
would cause problems with the interaction i ve let them all display one after eachother in a column and used a div of set height and width with overflow hidden to obscure the rest of the cards instead

3445608
slideup	slidedown
i m attempting to animate it either using animate or slideup slidedown

3445634
mouse	keyboard
do more with the keyboard less with the mouse

3445694
button	checkbox
when i choose the checkbox then click the print button all the information of a particular applicant will be printed.take note that each document was printed on a new page

3445696
gradle	ivy
someone on the gradle list suggested using an ivy packager resolver

3445697
post	get
as i think function addtocard will post get to server using ajax

3445701
put	get
it would be easiest i think to put that into the dom and get it from there then remove it from the dom again

3445709
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but ie 8 does not support preflighted or credentialed requests while firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome all support such requests

3445736
pull	push
because your tfs builds will push to a drop location made available people pull rather than you pushing new releases

3445736
versioning	upgrade
when consuming applications have the need or bandwidth to upgrade to your newer versioning of the internal assemblies they pull

3445815
profiling	debugging
also if you re looking for something a little more portable try blackbird.js one of the coolest little debugging tools i ve seen though nowhere near as frilly as firebugs it will work in any browser and provide your log messages and profiling with a visible place on the screen

3445821
post	get
i need the username password to be scrambled at the client-side before sending it over via http get post

3445854
draggable	droppable
draggable will revert unless it encounters with a droppable element

3445854
draggable	droppable
to make draggable disappears onmouseup i ve created a dummy droppable to accept the drop

3445855
fadein	fadeout
i m trying to write some js replicating jquery s fadein and fadeout functions

3445884
setinterval	settimeout
what you should do is re-engineer it so that instead of creating many settimeouts at once which is inefficient you instead tell your settimeout callback function to set the next timeout or you could use setinterval and do the incrementing if your values inside that callback function

3445886
opera	firefox
it looks like the async property has been discovered to have an effect on dynamically-appended scripts at least in firefox and potentially opera though it doesn t yet support the property

3445886
opera	firefox
firefox and eventually opera will need the async property to be set to ensure that this always happens

3445891
snmp	mib
if your organization adds or updates a new mib file use the mibcc.exe tool to compile the mib file so that the snmp management api mgmtapi.dll can use the mib objects in the new or updated mib file

3445925
inherited	subclassing
if you absolutely have to create a subclassing that inherited from uitableview and override the touch-related methods in the implementation

3445945
int	chars
you can make a simple function which would xor each chars value with some int and make a hex encoded string

3445964
superclass	subclassing
put another way not all of the capabilities of the superclass are used in the subclassing in this case

3445992
rss	feed
if you look at the checkins rss feed you ll see that david miller has been doing a lot of good work to add functionality

3446064
mouse	keyboard
personally i had an issue always having to reach for a normal mouse looked at various option eyetracking voice touchscreen and ended up changing the keyboard to a ibm trackpoint end result being my hands never leave the keyboard and my typing speed and accuracy improved due to not having to reposition my right hand

3446067
width	height
this can be wrong defined size for swf object width and height which results in showing part of the swf s background

3446078
post	get
you can use get or post

3446082
hide	show
it will show one picture and hide 4 others and when you mouse off a link it will go back to a default picture

3446102
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol where every tabitem is a view generated for a viewmodel using a datatemplate similar to this

3446111
firefox	safari
however in safari as well as firefox under certain conditions there seem to be some sort of rendering artifacts that prevent this from looking as intended

3446143
put	get
you shouldn t need to care about what s inside the black box just so long as you know what you need to put in and what you ll get out of it

3446176
hide	show
i use jquery in my page to hide buttons which i dont want to show unless needed

3446182
int	chars
int spawn funcptr func void arg 0 int grp_id 1 const chars threadname

3446201
portrait	landscape
but if i change the screen orientation from portrait to landscape and back again a few times i always get an outofmemory exception

3446201
onresume	onpause
in onpause i call mbitmap.recycle and then on onresume i call the above code again to create the bitmap and set the imageview

3446201
onresume	onpause
changing the code i had the call to getlastnonconfigurationinstance in oncreate and removed all code in onpause and onresume

3446210
macports	homebrew
unfortunately the is very normal with macports and is the reason that people many have switched to homebrew

3446234
postgresql	mysql
take for example what happened to us recently one of our devs used mysql and was using a special mysql-only like syntax which didn t work on our postgresql production database

3446256
formview	detailsview
how about a formview or detailsview possibly a datagrid and definitely some validators

3446257
printf	strcpy
so i tried converting the integer to a string using printf and then using strcpy to copy that string into one of the elements of the array of strings that has to be passed through execve

3446272
puts	gets
the reason works is because you set the pointer to point to a string that already exists the compiler generally puts that 123 into pre-initialised memory and it just gets loaded

3446273
listview	gridview
usually you don t need a custom control to make a specialized view for a listbox listview or gridview

3446283
button	checkbox
i need to first disable the order button when the windows loads and enable it after selecting check some items checkbox and vice versa

3446286
put	get
to get around this use you can put the left brace before or after the dollar sign

3446308
post	get
so say you wanted to get truly related items based on tags from a post and then show them from the most related to the least related

3446311
button	checkbox
bind a command to the button and implement the canexecute method to check the status of the checkbox and either enable or disable the button and use the execute method to invoke the functionality that you want on the button

3446316
children	parent
jquery has the has selector so it s possible to identify a parent by the children it contains updated per afrowave s comment ref

3446391
nsstring	nsdata
when i try to convert a nsstring object into a nsdata object i use the following code

3446432
jobs	cron
it s a lot easier to validate a simple find script than to validate every one of your cron jobs

3446434
g++	gcc
just the gcc compiler suite it includes g++ which is an open source compiler

3446541
unix	bsd
mac os x is one flavor of bsd unix

3446548
internationalization	localization
form label is view-specific it will deal with localization or internationalization it would be better to just put it on the view not in the presentation-model

3446596
children	parent
its slightly offbeat as when you talk of parent we assume you would be considering its children at some point

3446637
folder	directory
in order to make things work on our build server i also created a library folder inside the winforms app s project directory with the cr x runtime files i need as well as a library folder inside the web app s project directory with the cr xi runtime files

3446726
pop-up	dialog
a dialog with registered components pop-up

3446739
jhat	jprofiler
i have used jprofiler for profiling our application.but it hasn t been of much help.then i used jhat.using jhat you cannot see the heap in real time.you have to take a heap dump and then analyse it

3446745
fast-forward	merge
if you haven t made any commit on master that means the git merge mybranch was a fast-forward one master head simply move to mybranch head

3446831
width	height
this div element let s call it a container has a fixed width and dynamic height no constraints

3446841
integer	radix
try to use the radix parseint dobnum 10 to parse your integer in base 10

3446919
put	get
attribute and get the same file name - minus the .cs and put that in the element

3446924
nsmutablestring	nsstring
because of the nature of class clusters string objects arenâ t actual instances of the nsstring or nsmutablestring classes but of one of their private subclasses

3446955
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
now i d like to receive the output from the script on an qtextedit more specific qplaintextedit

3446960
width	height
i m initializing the uiscrollview with the same bounds as the viewcontroller s view bounds and set the auto resize mask to flexible height width so it will still occupy all the screen

3446960
portrait	landscape
this works well when the view controller is pushed in portrait mode the orientation changes works great but if i push it in landscape mode the scroll view isn t occupying all the height but rather it looks like it scaled weird

3446960
portrait	landscape
now if i remove the autosize mask the scroll view is in fact covering the whole view when entering both in portrait and in landscape mode but then the autoresizing doesn t work

3447007
nsstring	nsdata
after that i grab the .text value from the uitextview convert it from nsstring to nsdata then upload the nsdata object to a http server with a php upload script

3447015
getter	setter
change the logic so that the action that would result in a change of the boolean does actually update the boolean field and the getter setter is really just a getter setter and does not compute anything

3447049
int	double
double roundtosignificantfigure double num int precision

3447055
folder	directory
all the files are generated but the images and js folder is missing in the doc directory

3447065
subtract	add
a cash sale would immediatly subtract the sale from stockonhand and add it to soldstock for an order you would leave stockonhand alone and merely add the sale to reservedstock when the stock is finally invoiced you subtract the sale from stockonhand and reserved stock and add it to soldstock

3447109
google-chrome	firefox
the example above works well in firefox google-chrome etc

3447128
inline	inlining
one exception to this is that it may well affect inlining - so if you have a method which is being called in a tight loop you may find it doesn t get inline if it has try catch blocks

3447144
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql you can use limit 1 as above

3447348
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in ie8 not the firefox 3.6 or google-chrome 5

3447357
nhibernate	automapper
in reality what happens is that automapper tries to map as many relationships as possible causing nhibernate to lazy load all the child entities i m seeing select n+1 happening all the time

3447363
apache	nginx
another solution but a little more complicated use a http proxy server apache nginx etc. that will serve directly static resources css images html pages and forward to tomcat only dynamic resources jsp and .do actions for example

3447472
hide	show
every time i click on a button i want to show the proper items and hide the others

3447563
getter	setter
a general rule of mine is to put only getter setter in headers

3447581
put	get
another is that if the vector is popped or otherwise shortened in the meantime then at best we get to the point where i just put a comment in the code above at worse it errors as they pop again after we obtain newsize and then accessing retval becomes invalid

3447589
post	get
the action method works file for get requests but i m still struggling with forwarding the incoming post request

3447593
switching	screens
you need to load a screens on didfinishlaunch that screens is generally called splash screens do the animation in it and at the end switching to your first screens

3447735
int	chars
i need to convert decimal number stored in an int to a array of bytes aka stored in a unsigned chars array

3447785
entity-relationship	diagram
i think that what you are really doing is relational modeling even though you are using entity-relationship diagram

3447832
queue	fifo
fifo queue for each appdomain in the

3447832
queue	fifo
fifo queue for â œnativeâ work items

3447845
greenhopper	sprint
i too have been plagued by the same problem and have found the feature request in jira greenhopper to add a new field for sprint to allow tracking of sprint and release version information independently

3447947
nsurl	nsdata
you should check if there s another class method in your file that blocks the ui for example nsdata s + nsdata datawithcontentsofurl nsurl url

3447968
keydown	mousedown
so you might also want to listen to mousedown and keydown events if you want your ui to provide a consistent behavior

3448028
integer	unsigned
the first one would be like std is_integral or boost is_integral but usable with user defined types for example a class wrapping an int say int_wrapper true if the type behaves like an integer and whose representation is like standard integral types if t is unsigned but the definition of an integral type is very rigid in that it consists of a list of these types

3448030
min	max
thx for replying i need the column can be dragged to resize so i cannot set the max and min size

3448043
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome you have to choose between having a context menu or having mousewheel scroll capabilities

3448125
width	height
scale the x y values to lie between 0 1 divide x by width y by height

3448125
width	height
scale the x y values by the width height of the smaller grid - xsmaller ysmaller

3448148
min	max
also set min and max width of column same as set with setpreferredwidth

3448157
folder	directory
these 6 steps create a script in a folder called bin in your home directory

3448200
getter	setter
getter and setter for each of your

3448226
fadein	fadeout
replaced fadein fadeout with animate since fading results in a display none sets dimensions to zero and thus causes the page to jump when it disappears

3448235
folder	dir
the dir itself contains spec folder with some controllers models and fixtures but without spec_helper file

3448298
hide	show
which renders as follows and a panel pnldependants and i need to hide it when radio button selection is no and show it when its yes

3448344
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the method works in firefox and opera but not in google-chrome and safari

3448344
google-chrome	safari
when i look in the debugging tools of google-chrome and safari they say uncaught typeerror cannot call method getelementsbytagname of null

3448404
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both support the method

3448411
post	get
that means i m generating the html code myself instead using asp.net and i m working with the get string and post stream directly

3448425
sudoers	visudo
just append your command to the sudoers file list by using cmd visudo this cmd requires root priviledge as below

3448428
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
the file exists in the device in my main bundle and i ve got both the avfoundation and audiotoolbox frameworks added

hide	show
then either of them is changed it s checking that the result was and it was .checked if that s the case show the panel otherwise hide it via .toggle bool

3448523
hide	show
the .closest and .next are to go up to the then to the next element the since that s what you want to hide show

3448538
post	put
an extension of this try sending streams from xmlhttprequest in a page or httpwebrequest in a .net client application using both post and put you may have to change iis settings to allow the put through as this the overlap of working on that along with your experiments here will cover some knowledge that has some real applicability even when you are using all the toolkits

3448552
sorting	filtering
talking about sorting try to sort and filtering categories when you query the database instead of in the code

3448580
octal	binary
this is about how to do number conversion between binary to octal octal to hexadecimal binary to hexadecimal

3448580
octal	decimal
example convert decimal 20 to octal

3448580
hex	binary
this way you can do for anything binary hex from decimal

calloc	malloc
c difference between malloc and calloc

3449064
calloc	malloc
calloc is initializing the memory before you use it but malloc does not

3449066
daemons	systemd

3449073
calloc	malloc
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

3449155
onmousedown	onmouseup

memset	calloc	memset	malloc	calloc	malloc
calloc ... is basically malloc + memset if you want to 0 initialise the memory

3449169
calloc	malloc
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

3449169
free	malloc
so if you just need to allocate some memory and then copy some stuff there you are free to use malloc

3449255

3453646
accessor	properties
this indexer or paramterful properties as jeffrey richter calls them needs to have it s set accessor implemented as shown above in the code snippet

x beyond auto for iterators yet so the first question would be would features like decltype or auto help me to achieve what i want

3453787

another thing about this code you ve passed the constant 10 as the width and height of your off-screen bitmap as well as using it for the width and height params to the bitblt that does the copy

3454025

i d start out creating a uitableview and layering a frame around it and trying to mimic uipickerview

3454700

3455222
goto	break
in c# switch statements you must explicitly state to break or goto another case or goto default

3455246

super scrape self .__init__ none

3455269

3455472
post	get
alright so before i really get into this post i am going to have to warn you that this might not be an easy fix

3455478

3455631
serializable	deserialization
if it s for reading writing to from disk write serializable and deserialization functions

3455662
public	protected
the more visible levels are protected subclasses can see it and public everyone can see it

3455662
public	protected
before making something public or protected think about the interface carefully because it gets difficult to change it later

3455689
superclass	subclassing
if all methods and fields were private subclassing would have nothing in common with their superclass except their type

3455689
public	protected
a better question for discussion would be outside of private and public why have protected and the default access modifiers

3455798
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is really just a way to organize uiviewcontroller

3455831

3456252
width	height
from what i understand of layout_weight the closest comparison i could find is when you pass some in html for the width or height of your div

3456252
width	height
in our context the weigth seems to refer to the of width or height your widget should get for itself compared to its neighbours in a given viewgroup

3456313
post	put
then you grab all this and put it in a http request adding these parameters in post and send then to a php page that will deal with sending the email

google-chrome	firefox
yes i know that start firefox is actually start google-chrome but

3457180
disk	ram
moving the obj directory to a ram disk can be more efficient without having to buy new hardware if i o really is a problem - but it usually isn t

mousemove	mousedown
this is not ideal though - if the mouse button is pressed when the mouse is hovering over another control on the form then it doesn t appear in the mousemove event that the button is pressed as hans pointed out the other control captures the mousedown

3457903
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
if that s a problem then combining the hit test in mousemove while separately tracking mousedown and mouseup on the form should work

if you want to increase the area by 20 multiplied by 1.20 multiply both the width and height by the square root of 1.20

3460020
getter	setter
basically it was a map instead of a pojo having a number of getter and setter

3460233
stdout	stderr
if you re working in a unix-like environment it would be possible to do something like to redirect stderr to stdout

3460287
width	height
another way to do it would be to set the region of interested on the bigger image using the width height of the smaller cvsetimageroi will do that and then perform the blend with cvaddweighted

3460370
stdout	stderr
the problem is errors are written to stderr instead of stdout

3460383

3460658
accessor	properties
do i have to define accessor methods for all these properties gettitle or can i just refer to the properties directly like this

3460662

tstringgrid	tdbgrid
mxexport can export a tdataset tstringgrid and tdbgrid to differents file formats including rtf and ms word

3460704
getter	setter
public properties don t need getter setter methods but it makes you slightly more prone to errors

3460704
accessor	properties
using accessor also let you enforce validation on data whereas setting public properties directly can allow any data to be set

3460704
getter	setter
if you take advantage of php s magic functions you can write a dynamic getter setter method for access to private protected properties

3460813
getter	setter
i d say one shouldn t use unnecessary loads of setter getter especially in php or your application could get remarkably slower

int	chars
the secondary key for an e_int is an int for an e_char is a chars etc

3460881
equals	gethashcode
if you do find that accessing the dictionary is slow though then you want to pay attention to this and either fix the gethashcode method or create an iequalitycomparer which lets you define outside rules for gethashcode and equals for use with dictionaries hashsets etc

3460897
ready	each
as i see it in the case of 1 although each master acts as a branch everyone is expected to merge between each other s work with a mostly linear flow whereas in 2 everyone is expected to merge a common master into their branch and push changes from their branch into a common master when they are ready

when i post i get back a soap response and am unable to easily parse it

3461141
int	chars
you can convert from any .net unicode chars to an unsigned 16 bit int as they re utf-16 code units

3461141
integer	unsigned
you can then combine two unsigned 16 bit integers into a 32 bit integer very easily

3461141
integer	unsigned
alternatively you can just convert each code unit into a 32 bit unsigned integer to start with and shift and combine in the same way

3461164
express	node.js
2 blog rolling with mongodb express and node.js

put them each in a div and hide show those divs as appropriate

3461199
getter	setter
i believe i understand what java beans are java class es which contain a no-arg constructor are serializable and expose their fields with getter and setter

3461199
getter	setter
but most curious is the requirement to have fields all accessible via getter and setter

3461199
getter	setter
if it s an issue with doing more than simply setting the value couldn t the reflection use a getter setter over a field if the method exists

3461201
firefox	safari
the above works perfectly in firefox and safari giving a me a rounded fieldset with desired border shape size color and the correct background color

3461219
getter	setter
getter setter are frowned upon in most scripting languages

3461219
getter	setter
the use case for getter setter are elaborate filtering and validation schemes

3461219
getter	setter
unless you come up with a concrete attribute it doesn t make sense to prepare hollow setter getter seldomly transform the values anyway

3461263
autoresetevent	manualresetevent

the applied width is 50 of the parent container + border + padding + margin so this will behave differently at different widths but this kind of works

3461445
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am experiencing no issues at all in safari ie google-chrome or firefox on my computer the menu is on top of the video as it should be but on the iphone and ipad - the flash content gets replaced with a big clickable youtube button that opens the youtube embed inside the youtube app and that big button is above the menu

hence just running through the chars in the absolute path of the uri for the image everything after the host from the first onwards adding them their int value to each other and then do use the modulo of that part of the hostname

3461507
hash	hmac
you must be sure to use a cryptographically secure hash algorithm with hmac i d suggest sha-224 or better and you must remember that although you can authenticate without revealing the key password this way your data still has to be transmitted in cleartext so this can t be used as a substitute to ssl for things like credit card transactions etc

originally persistance was something that required the use of an application server such as glassfish jboss geronimo etc. but afaik you can do use it in desktop apps with no server component

3461603
stateless	stateful
you use stateful session beans when you want the server to remember details about each client you will use stateless beans when you don t need to remember client specific details

3461624
for-loop	loops
changing the final part of the for-loop to i++ means it will perform one iteration each loops and stop once the twentieth iteration finished

3461635
int	chars
chars and signed chars are actually two distinct types unlike int and signed int which refer to the same signed int type

3461635

try-catch-finally	sqlexception
i m java beginner but i thought that when using try-catch-finally i don t have to declare the exception using throws sqlexception

3461787
getter	setter
even the more generic of the implementations abstractmbeaninfoassembler assumes getter and setter to get the jmx attribute values

3461881

i m trying to take a 32bit int save each byte in an array of chars then reconstitute the int

3462489
mouseup	mousedown
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to accomplish but if you want an action to be repeated at set time intervals after the mousedown you could set a recurring nstimer in the mousedown method that gets cancelled as soon as there is a mousedragged or mouseup event

3462490
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller that contains a uitabbarcontroller which contains a uiviewcontroller

getter	setter
i see you access filepath just by its name not through the getter setter

3462763
pull	push
push work to be done onto a queue object and have the thread pull it off and do it

3462775
serializable	deserialization
we have been using binaryserialization with our c# app but the size and complexity of the classes which need to be serializable results in sloooooow deserialization and large files

3462792
client-side	server-side
if you re controlling the iframe entirely client-side and never need to make server-side requests with that iframe it s proably easier to style a div to appear like an iframe look into the overflow property where you ll have far simpler and more direct control to the dom contents of that div

i would like to be able to add another jmenuitem - about - to the far right-hand side of the jmenubar

3463053
getter	setter
creating a getter setter method for each function is not plausible imho

3463072
google-chrome	safari
as an added note the versions of websockets that currently are implemented in google-chrome and safari are two different drafts and work on the current draft is still under very heavy development so i don t even believe it is realistic to say that websockets support is functional at the moment

3463072
firefox	safari
the currently shipping version of safari has a broken implementation it doesn t send the right header firefox 4 has just deprecated websockets so it won t ship enabled and ie9 isn t looking good either

3463083
sum	datepart
i m using them because i think it s easier to understand the individual components than one big select where you refer to datepart mm o.orderdate and sum od.quantity everywhere

3463103
cpu	processors
for instance for a message like i would search online about cpu throttling and store a brief information of what i understood links that i visited and throttling on centrino my processors - i wouldn t have done that if i didn t search online for that message

versioning	upgrade
recent versioning of cpan.pm ask as first question whether the rest of the configuration should be run automatically so it is advisable to upgrade cpan.pm manually first tarballs repo

3463142
getter	setter
if you can t stand getter and setter i d suggest a configuration object like a map which could be given to the constructor and or a setter of your main gui class

3463161
post	get
this question is related to this post find maximum value of all child elements and get its parent element in xslt

3463171

this is reported as working in pretty much all current browsers opera 7.x + all platforms mozilla 1.x + all platforms ie 6.x + windows safari 1.x + macos konqueror 3.x + linux bsd but if you have to go back to ie 5.x it starts to fail

3463230
opera	firefox
however i tried to launch the applet with opera instead of firefox and it appears that opera doesn t let my applet use its php session and as java or at least icedtea doesn t handle php sessions itself i can t make my applet work

nsevent	nssplitview
in short when placing an custom extended class of nsview with an overload implementation of - void mouseup nsevent theevent the mouseup doesn t get called when its wrapped in nssplitview

3463303
division	modulo
you need to first shift the months from base 1 ie jan 1 to base 0 ie jan 0 before using modulo or integer division otherwise november 11 plus 1 month gives you 12 which when finding the remainder 12 12 gives 0

3463304

in portrait mode it looks fine but in landscape mode regardless of which orientation the app was launched in the jqtouch page is wider than the viewport

3463310
folder	directory
in the bottom of the extended logging properties window will be a log file directory path along with the name of the folder and naming convention used for the log files

3463340

you would be better off tracking idle time of keyboard and mouse via using windows hooks

3463423
mouse	keyboard
here is a project codeproject processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# to get you started

3463423
mouse	keyboard
you can do something like this once the keyboard and mouse haven t been used for x minutes

3463427
hide	show
very easy to use and gives the website the little extra if you add values to hide and show

3463492

even better have no database at all and have your application be capable of deploying the database itself using a schema versioning upgrade set of scripts

3463500
firefox	safari
with other latest to date browsers safari and firefox the ui tab displays nicely

3463511

the difference between the forms is that exit and return from main calls functions registered using atexit or on_exit before really terminating the process while _exit from or its synonymous _exit from terminates the process immediately

3463562
post	get
abort is mostly useful in debug mode with the purpose to immediately stop the program and get a stack trace for post mortem analysis

3463568
inherited	properties
essentially the most useful purpose of partial methods is for a code generation system to provide an api for extending the capability of its properties and methods without using inherited

3463577
inherited	subclassing
they might have an object.create method somehwere in the form of .clone or something but it s obscured from the tutorials and documentation in respect to object inherited and subclassing

3463620
versioning	upgrade
your ui_tabs css jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css should be upgrade to the equivalent 1.8 versioning you can find a url to to this in the top of the css file assuming you haven t modified it afterwards that link will take you to themeroller with the same color image configuration so you can get the generated 1.8+ versioning

3463625
viewdidload	viewwillappear
and crafterm as for popping back just make your own leftbarbuttonitem by adding this code in viewdidload or viewwillappear

yes you re right ieee754 kind of for gpus like gtx 260 but current ati and nvidia generation is supporting ieee 754-2008 on high-end parts

3463741
disk	ram
the only way i could think of downloading the document to memory and avoiding disk altogether is to create a ram disk but that could get pretty complex and requires an admin installation to install the ramdisk driver

3463760
jsf	wicket
keep in mind scopetype.page makes sense when you have a server-side based component model framework such as jsf wicket and so on.

3463793
int	chars
c is int above since eof is a negative number and a plain chars may be unsigned

3463799
for-loop	arrays
now each time the board changes you can write a function that prints out the board again using a nested for-loop like you did before except now you ll be accessing the 2d arrays instead

3463913
bash	zsh
to the best of my understanding your question coproc s available in zsh ksh and also bash v4+ might be similar to what you have in mind

3464024
firefox	safari
in newest ie firefox and even desktop safari mac and pc things work as expected

3464024
width	height
the button width is fixed the text wraps and the button height automatically is increased to show the wrapped lines

serializable	deserialization
you should have a serializable deserialization mechanism for class person first

3464065
equals	gethashcode
validationresult should have overriden equals and gethashcode

3464069
put	get
you have to grab it from the operationdescription objects when you re applying your custom behavior to insert your idispatchmessageinspector implementation and put it somewhere you inspector can get at

3464093
put	get
you get the idea just put the appropriate version in

3464116
equals	tostring
system.object only has a handful of operations that it supports - tostring equals etc

caldav	webdav
caldav is basically specialized webdav which is basically http

3464205
jar	manifest.mf
say i have a jar with a jar inside lib somejar.jar and ofc the manifest file is inside meta-inf manifest.mf

3464212
spaces	delimiter
this seems like a lot of code just to get each string delimiter by spaces or spaces

3464216
post	get
to get ours working on the iphone side we set the post data in a nsstring as base64 encoded then sent it to our server as a http request

3464216

you ll notice it is the same as above except we are using a post instead of a get

3464250
backgrounding	multitasking
unfortunately this simple native app does not have any complex functionality multitasking backgrounding audio nor is there any way to add it

3464250
backgrounding	multitasking
so if you want multitasking or backgrounding audio you cannot enable full screen mode

3464278
processors	hyperthreading
what i am trying to do is find out if there is a way to determine the number of cores in the processors not including hyperthreading as a core

3464278
processors	hyperthreading
for example on a dual core hyperthreading processors system.environment.processorcount will return 4 because there are 2 physical cores both with hyperthreading

3464315
getter	setter
also note that java has no concept of proper properties either and typical good practice is to use getter setter and to not name your variables starting with upper-case letters

3464338
min	max
the most common solution to this is to determine a min max of both lat and long and then do a predicate based on those

3464338
instances	transient
for instances you could have a transient value called currentpoint and you could then kvo on the resulting array such as

3464361
operands	decrement
the operands of the preï x increment or decrement operator shall have qualiï ed or unqualiï ed real or pointer type and shall be a modiï able lvalue

easyhook	detours
i would recommend microsoft s detours c++ x86 only or easyhook c++ c# x86 x64

ienumerable	ilist
edit if c# 4.0 is not available you can always fall back to either untyped ienumerable or ilist

3464471
hide	show
the button show or hide a panel containing the dynamic control list

3464481
bash	tcsh
i know if your shell program is bash or tcsh it uses readline library to do line editing so the control-k function is handled by readline and is stored in a kill-ring buffer inside your shell program

3464663
width	height
in the documentation for displayobject it states that the width and height of the displayobject can not be changed if it is empty

3464709
post	get
get values have to come from the url somehow so if you want your inputs completely hidden you ll have to use post instead

3464734
unsigned	short	int	chars
the difference would be even more extreme if i wanted to keep each possible original numeric type separately signed chars short int long long long unsigned chars unsigned short ... rather than converting them up to the largest signed unsigned floating point type before storing them

3464764
folder	directory
you need to delete the folder of the specific plugin from the wp-content plugins directory and then upload the older version

3464788
typedef	struct
i come originally from a c world where there was no real difference between language-defined types like int and types that you made yourself with typedef or struct

3464814
post	get
see here for some reasons click on the error correcting category on the right-hand side to get a lot more crc-related post

3464848
initializer	class-method
the class is not meant to be initializer directly though it s ok to do so by passing an open sqlite3 connection to a db with an appropriate sqlitedict table but through the two class-method create to make a new db or wipe out an existing one and open which seems to match the op s desires better than the alternative have __init__ take a db file path an an option string describing how to open it just like modules such as gdbm take -- r to open read-only c to create or wipe out w to open read-write -- easy to adjust of course

3464849
gif	bmp
so html css js content is compressed ok and i see in headers content-encoding gzip but not with image formats jpeg gif and even bmp

3464876
width	height
i m hoping to find a way to get the current viewable window s position relative to the total page width height so i can use it to force a scroll from one section to another

3464882
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you should also override gethashcode and ideally the and operators

3464895
post	put
from here i d like to put my post variables into a database but i don t seem to have access to the post variables

3464933
post	get
to get you started take a look at this particle generator and the opengl es blog post of the project s author

3464949
post	get
everything works except for the security exclusion using the spring secured annotation in the java class when i am not logged in i can enter messages through the sayhello flex ui and see them post on the server get the reply back

3465031
division	modulo
use of signed division modulo in general with negative numbers since c s version of it disagrees with the usual algebraic definition when a negative number is divided by a positive one and rarely gives the desired result

3465057
put	get
for example if you put the function definition inside a function you get a new copy of the function each time

3465098
integer	unsigned
i have a 64-bit unsigned integer with exactly 1 bit set

3465115
cos	sin
an example is if i have two menus sin x with slot 0 and cos x with slot 1 both click events pass 1 to settrackedline no matter if sin x was clicked or cos x was

3465149
width	height
the reason you can t change an empty object s width and height is that they are ultimately derived properties

3465149
width	height
along with the object s content scalex and scaley are what really determines the object s size - width and height are really just convenient ways to adjust the scale

3465154

you could move width and height into one type and move the initialization code into an initialization helper function

3465395
division	modulo
update here s at least one 64-bit version i just developed myself but it uses division actually modulo

3465406
getter	setter
the problem is that there re two much setter and getter messing up the source code editor

3465406
getter	setter
i know there re some libraries can eliminate setter and getter by using annotations or aop techniques this is not allowed in my project

3465421
getter	setter
i d rather place the business methods above the setter and getter and place something like this between them

3465428
dictionary	map
to map a point to an object you would need to wrap the point in an nsvalue object and use that as the key in a dictionary

3465455
width	height
you should add inline getters for the width and height instead of public const member variables

3465467
getter	setter
- control folds getter setter main methods constructors other methods separately

3465553
for-loop	loops
if you still don t want to you can create a scrollview plus a header in a textview in your xml for instance and then in your java you use a for-loop or a while to loops on your database result and every time you have one set of data ready you create a new textview and add it to the scroolview

3465565
integer	unsigned
in practice on most unix-like systems it will be a 32 or 64 bit unsigned integer signifing the number of seconds since the unix epoch midnight januari 1 1970

3465581
int	chars
it returns an int because it needs to return eof which is not a chars

3465581
int	chars
to get around this many functions that give you back a chars will actually give you an int and use one of the int values which don t have an actual chars equivalent such as -1

3465608
getter	setter
you can extend the class and access instance variables throught method accessors getter setter if they are public

3465687
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
the core concept of inherited is that as a subclassing you get all of your parent class s public and protected members included in your subclassing for free

3465775
getter	setter
if you have too many getter and setter confusing you with business methods it sounds like it is time to refactor into two separate classes

3465778
inherited	properties
by default a winform app will inherited windows theme but you can explicitly change some ui properties like color font etc

3465808
int	chars	int	boolean
for int chars byte short boolean float reads writes are always atomic

3465830
google-chrome	firefox
this happens both in firefox and google-chrome

3465844
inherited	properties
the hasownproperty method is used to check if the enumerated properties exist physically in the object because the for-in can statement visit inherited properties

min	max
your listbox control is single-selection - its properties min max and value is scalar and 0

3466011
min	max
listbox but not popup can be multi-selection if property min max in this case value can be an array which implies also empty and empty string will not cause problems

imperative	declarative
i wonder what imperative vs declarative steps in rspec is all about

3466083
imperative	declarative
what i have understood is that declarative let you do whatever you want as long as the result passes and imperative is more verbose

3466168
google-chrome	safari
for both google-chrome and safari vertical scrollbar appears

tcpclient	networkstream
i m using a networkstream tcpclient to asynchronously receive data using beginread

3466332

dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
i have looked at reflection.emit dynamicmethod briefly but it is not serializable

3466524
apache	lighttpd
i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes

3466524
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd will handle keep-alive and client requests while child processes of apache gets to serve dynamic pages faster because of the very low latency communication between lighttpd and apache

3466524
apache	lighttpd
given that i already have a dedicated lighttpd server for my static contents img vid css js html etc. and another dedicated apache server for my dynamic pages php i would like to implement this technique if it really has some performance gain

3466573
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd is great for a static cdn coupled with apache for the database-interactive scripts

3466597
division	multiplication
a bit shift is a multiplication or division by 2 n and a power operation would be more readable than multiple multiplication or division operations i think but i m not sure about the performance

the original idea for designing this is to have several tab links that show hide corresponding divs to have search functionality in a partial view reused in two divs and to update the search results using ajax so that an entire order can be created without multiple post to server only using some ajax calls to get data to limit load on server

3468424

executing a command from java always should read the stdout and stderr streams from the process

now the button would create a new tabitem your custom-created one perhaps and add it to the observablecollection of tabs you have as the itemssource for your tabcontrol

3469092
tabcontrol	tabitem
4 well your tabcontrol should use a observablecollection of tabitem as itemssource to be notified when a new one is added removed

3469137
short	base
hopefully that makes sense but the short version is to try using a base tag if your application needs to run in any arbitrary location

i have configured specflow to target the mstest framework instead of nunit by specifying it like this in the app.config of my specs class library

3469444

currently itâ s easy to get the content since itâ s just a simple query selecting post by date but it troubles me to see how to make the most effective design when extending it

3469953
fast-forward	merge
when there are no changes on trunk git does a fast-forward merge and simply sets the local master branch to the commit on your branch

3469953
fast-forward	merge
git-svn doesn t know how to commit fast-forward merge back to trunk in fact it thinks master now is pointing to the svn branch

3469957
submit	submission
if you don t want the form to submit if the location isn t found the easiest way would probably be just query the server before submission

3469975
min	max
i want to add vertical rectangles behind each plot that are horizontally positioned by the min and max starttimes of each fcycle where fphase dark

i have found that if you don t at least eat the stdout and stderr eventually you will run out of memory

3469996
inject	interceptor
when you inject interceptor into a handlermapping bean those interceptor apply to every handler mapped by that handlermapping

3470037
memcpy	memmove
unless i m misunderstanding the question you should probably just use memcpy or memmove

3470045
getter	setter
in order to serialise an object into application settings each type involved in your case both parent and child must have a public default constructor and the properties that need serialising must have public getter and setter procedures

3470068
gridview	repeater
i have a gridview that displays all trips - within that gridview i have a repeater that displays the countries visited during that trip one to many

3470076
stdout	stderr
so you have to take care of the stderr and stdout handling if you want your program to be remotely robust

3470119
int	chars
why we need a in scanf for inputting int and why not for chars

3470160
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but i am getting an intermittent error in ie

3470168
width	height
i ve tried adding a width on #brz #slv and #gld and i ve tried adding a height to each

3470183
int	chars
which is true since a chars is basically an int

3470184
ready	each
then i can start immediately a thread for each function but the actual work of each function will start only when it s ready

3470233
google-chrome	firefox
you can play this all day long in firefox google-chrome etc

3470239
int	chars
your chars stream is also an int it stores the location in memory of a block of chars type either a single chars or the first chars in a continuous block

3470239
strlen	strcpy
because you are working with strings you could also make use of the strcpy function potentially paired with strlen

3470242
folder	directory
move them as well as the jar s in folder 2 1 to a single directory named lib

3470278
post	get
if you get stuck with this please post a question on our forums .we re happy to help you

3470294
min	max
...would generate the same sql - it s certainly more readable but linq may potentially execute the min max queries immediately as the value is being stored in a double - it s possible that by defining the type of minsize maxsize implicitly it would treat it as an iqueryable of double

3470300
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
anyway the problem is that this code functions fine in ie7 firefox google-chrome opera etc

3470335

if usb composite device doesn t show up then try browsing to the usb_driver folder in your android sdk directory for step 5 then try step 5 and 6 again

3470453
google-chrome	safari
as i understand it both safari and google-chrome use webkit

3470453
google-chrome	safari
presumably webkit doesn t handle things like font and control rendering or google-chrome and safari on windows would look identical and yet they don t safari has that fuzzy text thing going on among other differences

3470512
postgresql	mysql
between is ansi standard and always inclusive - oracle sql server mysql postgresql sqlite will all return the same data assuming similar data type

3470513
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome do indeed look different but that s because they both have different implementations of webkit

3470513
google-chrome	safari
awesomiumdotnet provides its own implementation just as google-chrome and safari do of control rendering

3470560
nunit	mstest
i thought i could simply change the app.config of this existing project to point at the mstest framework and stop using nunit but vs2010 never recognized the tests despite the correct creation of the stubs by specflow s custom tool

3470564

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in some of the more up-to-date browsers that support html5 firefox google-chrome safari the multiple attribute will work

3470623
hash	salt
the reason is that an attacker could try all likely passwords dictionary words people s names etc. the standard solution to this problem is to concatenate the password with a random string called a salt before computing the hash you do someting like sha.digest salt+password .getbytes

3470623
hash	salt
the salt makes it impratical for the attacker to precompute all hash of likely passwords

3470623
hash	salt
usually the salt randomly generated when the user chooses his her password and it is stored next to the password hash in a user database but from what you show of your scheme there is no such thing

3470624
for-loop	arrays
when i go through the for-loop to look at each element of the arrays containing the images the uiviews overlap and show one photograph on top of the other i would like to know how to separate them into the next section of the paging scroll view

3470657

i ended up extracting it from the .svn folder in the current working directory

3470684

the lxml api documentation states the same but also mentions that the implementation of getiterator in lxml diverges from the original elementtree behavior

3474950
httpresponse	request
when you call a soap method soapy runs its own request function which returns a valid httpresponse object

3474989
hide	show
then show hide modifytextof item y and item z

3475026
int	boolean
java has no 8-bit unsigned byte java can t convert an int to a boolean value java has no first class methods java has no pass by reference semantics etc

3475101
post	get
as mentioned in the comments post some code and configuration to get clear answer

3475107
int	chars
assuming 32-bit int and 8-bit chars sizeof int 4

3475123
folder	directory
normally you create a lucene index in application servers like jboss and tomcat in the current directory . index folder is created in bin folder which is not a good idea at all

3475129
getter	setter
if you have a getter you d probably want a setter since these are usually used with private variables like i described above

3475130
width	height
the display property tells the browser how to draw and show an element if at all - whether it should be displayed as an inline element it flows with text and other inline elements or a block -level element it has height and width properties that you can set it s floatable etc or an inline-block it acts like a block box but is laid inline instead and some others list-item table table-row table-cell flex etc

3475134
rss	feed
in my recently project i work with multiple rss feed

3475177
width	margin
sum of width of element column including margin and padding must 100 or width of the main column in pixel

3475177
google-chrome	firefox
div .clr to fix the height of div.main in firefox google-chrome ie6

3475185
rss	feed
you ll find that it s the loading of the rss feed rather than parsing it that takes the time but you might find that this is due to the time each rss feed takes to generate

3475189
margin	height
of course it s always possible to add a fixed size top margin but the top panel have different height on different android units

3475193
post	get
start by going through this tutorial step by step -- if you get stuck somewhere along the way you can always come back here and post follow-up questions

3475267
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
when running on firefox 3.6.8 google-chrome 5.0.375.126 and safari 5.0.1 on os x 10.6.4

nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not

3475279
serializable	deserialization
for instance serializable deserialization of some structs

3475279
int	double
#define struct_description structname mystruct member int a member double b member long c

3475302
post	get
i want to send a ping to my server using an ajax get or post right after they close the window

3475337
rss	feed
you can load the rss feed in parallel with curl_multi

3475363
webrat	cucumber
ideally this would use webrat so that cucumber could correctly manage resetting the database on its own and so that i wouldn t need to run an instance of the server for the cucumber tests to work

3475363
webrat	cucumber
however since the oauth plugin and the underlying gem make the http requests i can t think of an easy way to go through webrat without generating all of the requests on my own writing the code from the oauth gem into my cucumber test

3475408
gif	png
if someone uploads random garbage claiming it s a png or a gif you can detect that after looking at just the first few bytes

3475444
cpu	processors
with processors that support instruction breakpoints or data watchpoints the debugger will ask the cpu to watch for instruction accesses to a specific address or data reads writes to a specific address and then run full-speed

3475530
client-side	server-side
the fragment cannot be seen from the server-side it can only be accessed by client-side scripts

3475543
post	get
how can i get the session id and cookies so that i can post it with the security image string

3475575
getter	setter
so in your case you should have appropriate accessor getter setter method for isdecorated in both action and actiondecorator

3475645
post	get
i am trying to get querystring value using post method but value is not retrieved

3475672
equals	compareto
it seems you re using the compareto to check for equality in that case the correct approach is overriding the equals method

3475696
inherited	properties
an object inherited properties even if they are added to its prototype after the object is created

3475709
jsf	seam
this is related to jsf and seam but might give some inspiration

3475714
public	protected
accessing protected or private variables from public is incorrect thats why they are protected or private

3475720
chunked	transfer-encoding
i am writing directly to php output via fwrite and have tried both standard output and using transfer-encoding chunked encoding the chunks as required but no matter what i try the browser waits until all the data is written before displaying a download dialog

3475732
put	get
if i put a breakpoint on a method i know is called before the form is displayed i get the hollow breakpoint warning symbol that tells me the breakpoint will not currently be hit

3475898
width	height
secondly try using css inline styles to define your width and height like so

3475945
versioning	upgrade
so does work...but only for versioning 1.3.7+ as of the time of this answer the current versioning is 1.3.9 so if you want to use instead of just upgrade

3476000
keydown	keyup
keydown keyup event

3476016
width	height
it looks like above mentioned method ignore parameters startx starty width height when creating bitmap frame

3476119
postgresql	mysql
i tried with postgresql and with mysql innodb and both allowed

3476133
int	double
since you are dealing exclusively with int you may get a slight performance benefit from using them rather than double

3476149
lisp	smalltalk
but yes there is still a problem you can only solve with image based languages like lisp or smalltalk

3476153
postgresql	mysql
looks like you re working on the wrong database no fk s or mysql with the wrong engine and or settings postgresql works fine when having a fk

3476214
integer	unsigned
i have a table whose size i d like to keep down and one of the columns can be treated as a 5-byte unsigned integer

3476214
integer	unsigned
this stores effectively an unsigned integer from 0 to 2 m-1

3476233
oncreate	setcontentview
if you want to change the theme of an activity you need call settheme in its oncreate method before calling setcontentview

3476319
textblock	itemscontrol
the itemscontrol did not apply the template to either the button nor to the textblock control

3476335
int	chars	int	double
wrap_api myfunc1 param int k param double r param chars s

3476369
int	double
64-bit int long int64_t unsigned long uint64_t should do the trick or if you need decimals double or long double

3476393
google-chrome	firefox
this happens under firefox 3.6.8 and the last google-chrome on ubuntu an windows xp vista

3476465
submit	submission
i want buttons to submit when i don t have javascript turned on and i want to execute javascript instead of submission when javascript is turned on by way of changing the input type to prevent postbacks and to attach event handlers

3476473
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
realloc and malloc and free have full access to the entire datastructure that makes up the heap

3476473
free	realloc
in that datastructure is information about the sizes of blocks which realloc needs to know and so does free

3476509
sin	sqrt
i would like to shorten it and write sqrt x and sin x

3476545
post	get
the user fires off ajax post by making a change in the ui these fire off a get request on success that updates the ui

3476545
google-chrome	firefox
when the earliest of the get requests takes a long time the later one which is much quicker is delayed until the slower one finishes in firefox google-chrome but not ie

3476545
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox success2 is being held up until success1 completes -

3476590
goto	break
of all this is easy to find just goto section 6.3 of the c99 standard or chapter 4 of c++ and dig up the clauses which describe how the operands are converted to a common type and this can break if the common type reinterprets negative values

3476601
post	get
you get in trouble say you didn t do it post a link to your history see the post isn t there

3476609
nunit	moq
i m trying out the new razor view engine with mvc 3 preview 1 and would really like to write a simple unit test using nunit moq

3476715
setinterval	settimeout
check the settimeout and setinterval functions

3476724
hide	show
however while jquery works great loading the results from the class file it doesn t execute to hide the container of arabic and reference when it s loads the search results nor does it run the click event when the user clicks on the quote to show the container as firebug show

3476727
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
all browsers implement a getelementsbytagname and getelementbyid

3476788
post	get
this would be possible if your form uses get or even if you don t distinguish between get post when you evaluate the form

3476815
onfling	gestures
you can implement a gestures deductor and on its onfling event you get two parameters from motionevent class

3476843
int	chars
a pointer is a set of variables and to differentiate them besides the number of variables values int chars has to be different

3476894
ant	maven
note 2 i know a lot about ant but am a noob at maven but havent had any problems with it till now

3476897
post	get
its giving exact value in alert box on change but when i am using post method or get or even .ajax its not giving any output

3476897
post	get
i just need to post some values and get some info from database to show in the div just below that select box

3476920
put	get
i managed to get the modal view working but when trying to put a uinavigationcontroller in it it just comes up with a blank screen

3476947
int	double
reading and writing raw arrays of int and double will be faster than converting to and from text but then you need to worry about byte ordering differences in sizes for different platforms compilers structure padding etc

3476948
post	get
was thinking about creating a single class called request to handle and clean post and get variables but being new to the singleton pattern i m not sure how to implement it

3476948
post	get
ideally i d like to have 2 functions post name clean and get name clean - clean being a boolean to determine whether to trim escape the value

3476954
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
create a uinavigationcontroller initialize it with your uiviewcontroller at its root and then present the navigation controller modally

3477093
post	put
since this is my first post and i can t post more than one link i put all three screenshots on the same jpg

3477177
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have access to both the .htaccess and httpd.conf and apache2.conf as this is a vps on linode

3477178
firefox	safari
finally it should look the same on ie 7+ firefox 3+ safari 3+

3477215
post	get
now as you see on the link it requires three variables id uid and buid and i want to send it post not get so the user can t see the variables in address bar

3477218
content-disposition	content-type
i don t think your content-type and content-disposition headers are correct

3477247
.htaccess	httpd.conf
with regards to you attempting it with the carat and it not working this is likely a paths issue and the exact solution depends on whether the rewriterule is located in the httpd.conf file or in the .htaccess

3477247
.htaccess	httpd.conf
as a generally rules patterns you are matching in httpd.conf will be preceeded by a forward slash wheras ones you are matching against in a .htaccess will not

3477287
bimap	hashmap
you may want to subclass hashmap to create your own bimap

3477309
toolchain	binutils
so you need to cross-compile gcc and the whole toolchain at least binutils - this is quite simple because the . configure scripts of gcc binutils gdb etc

3477333
post	get
i ve only recently been getting involved with php ajax jquery and it seems to me that an important part of these technologies is that of post and get

3477333
post	get
second i ve also seen post and get outside of php also in ajax and jquery

3477349
switching	screens
the program i m working on in c# .net framework 2.0 calls for the ability to switching over to a remote mode and send ascii data to another screens via bluetooth

3477365
stdout	stderr
stdout here is the combined stdout and stderr of the child process that has been started with win32pipe.popen4 ...

3477372
width	height
i know i could use the write function but i want to be able to specify the height and width

3477374
post	get
get and post are two different types of http requests

3477374
post	get
so essentially get is used to retrieve remote data and post is used to insert update remote data

3477374
post	get
http 1.1 specification rfc 2616 section 9 method definitions contains more information on get and post as well as the other http methods if you are interested

3477384
post	get
if you are working restfully get should be used for requests where you are only getting data and post should be used for requests where you are making something happen

3477387
javassist	cglib
i solved this dependency problem by switching from cglib to javassist in hibernate

3477388
inherited	properties
it is basically impossible to do what you ve described with the code you gave because all elements have to be contained within the body tag and since the opacity properties inherited everything on the page will turn half transparent

3477402
post	get
get post are not related at least not directly to php ajax jquery or similar

3477402
post	get
and there s much more to http protocol than just get and post

3477406
post	get
post and get are two http request methods

3477414
post	get
also if you are using post variables across navigation of pages the user will get a warning asking if they want to resubmit the post parameter

3477414
post	get
typically they look the same in an http request but you should just stick to post if you need to post something to a server and get if you need to get something from a server as that s the way they were intended

3477420
post	get
the only big difference between post get when using them with ajax is since get is url provided they are limited in ther length since url arent infinite in length

3477423
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
on modern unix bsd solaris linux macosx etc the ssh daemon comes pre-installed by default

3477456
post	get
a post unlike a get typically has relevant information in the body of the request

3477456
post	get
a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url. besides keeping the url relatively cleaner post also lets you send much more information as urls are limited in length for all practical purposes and lets you send just about any type of data file upload forms for example can t use get -- they have to use post plus a special content type encoding

3477520
post	get
get requests expose parameters to users post does as well but they are less visible

3477582
portrait	landscape
the answer is always that the device is in portrait orientation even if i clearly have it in landscape

3477620
width	margin
you might be able to use margin-right on both divs but fix the width of the parent and set overflow to hidden in order to chop off the extended margin - but i m not sure about compatibility on that kind of thing

3477637
folder	directory
within majorclasses folder you will now have to create a directory for each namespace

3477640
pop-up	dialog
this code works fine when using outlook meaning that it pop-up a new email dialog and returns the correct error code if user for example decides not to send the message by closing the message dialog

3477652
free	malloc
then when at any point program s malloc returns null you free the 5 megabytes and call malloc again which will succeed and let the program continue running

3477704
int	boolean
i m using a record composed of strings boolean int currencies and arrays of other records inside a method of a class

3477712
free	malloc
keep in mind that when you are getting null from malloc it means both physical and virtual memory have no more free space meaning your program is swapping all the time making it slow and the computer unresponsive

3477724
post	get
use post instead of get

3477733
equals	gethashcode
objects that implement equals and gethashcode correctly

3477791
versioning	upgrade
we did use httpclient 3.1 but run into problems due to the change in ntlm protocol with newer versioning of windows so we upgrade to the latest versioning

3477796
implements	extends
it s mostly used as a scripting tool in apps to extends or implements functionalities

3477800
superclass	subclassing
casting from a subclassing to its superclass is allowed

3477804
logmein	hamachi
the machines are vpn d together using logmein hamachi

3477853
hide	show
i have a tabbed layout that show hide sections when a tab is clicked

3477896
gif	png
using a gif or png function will create an image containing the text a simple text string as expected

3477896
gif	png
gif and png functions work fine and as expected

3477900
google-chrome	firefox
it appears this code will request the file in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

3477924
width	height
to start cgrect is a structure that has 4 parameters x origin y origin width height

3477924
uiview	uiwindow
the reason you could not find initwithframe in uiwindow docs is because it inherits the method from uiview

3477924
uiview	uiwindow
pointers if you are in xcode and right click on an api defined class uiview uiwindow cgrect etc you can go to find text in documentation and the apple docs for the class will pop right up in xcode

3477940
int	chars
foo never changes in size because it doesn t have a chars array or an int array

3477940
int	chars
rather it has a string object which in turn probably has a pointer to a chars array and a pointer to int

3477944
width	height
the width and height reported by the canvas seems to be scaled by the screen density

3477952
free	malloc
if you re writing c++ you should be using new and delete instead of malloc and free

3478021
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
we have some javascript code that resizes elements adjusts height width padding margin etc. based on the dimensions of a parent element specifically the height and width of the parent we use in the calculation

3478021
width	height
the parent div height and width is defined in a external css file and is used to include the stylesheet in the section of the page

3478021
width	height
however in safari 5 occasionally the resizing fails because the parent height width is incorrect which appears to be because the stylesheet has not loaded before the javascript

3478021
put	get
i can put the resizing code inside a settimeout and delay it by 1 second or so and get it to work reliably but this is not a releasable solution because it is too slow and still varies by machine

3478021
width	height
i m considering trying to place the height and width inline so it is rendered from the server but this requires significant app code change and tighter coupling to the ui and i d like to avoid inline style if possible

3478028
outputstream	inputstream
the streams in java - subclasses of inputstream and outputstream are perfect examples of the decorator pattern

3478139
updatepanel	scriptmanager
to execute the init everytime the updatepanel changes you need to register the script using scriptmanager

3478147
webrat	cucumber
adding in a then show me the page step in cucumber so the page that webrat sees opens in the browser showed the you are being redirected. response with a link to an example.org link

3478156
alertdialog	progressdialog
when the server responds the progressdialog is dismissed and an alertdialog is shown

3478166
put	get
when i put two new namedpipeserverstream in the same executable i get the same error.

3478174
put	get
use url.action to get the url and then you can put insert the hyperlinked image normally rather than trying to use html.actionlink

3478183
division	modulo
using modulo division i feel like people have forgot about this guy

3478191
cassini	iis
the default asp.net web server that launches from within visual studio cassini is a little buggy on my development machine so i like to publish to a local iis instance on my dev machine and look at the web application there

3478214
accessor	properties
note your current implementation leaves you no way to assign values to these properties so you probably want to add a private or protected set accessor to the class properties

3478267
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the idea is to click on a dropdownlistfor change which then invert twice a collection of checkbox by using the click function of them

3478279
getter	setter
i usually try to go for roy osherove s method and only test things with logic not straight getter setter or pass-throughs

3478304
getter	setter
for example you may consider that it s not useful to test setter and getter

3478364
width	height
whenever i want to animate height or width without setting a fixed value as when collapsing expanding a panel i manage to do it by animating minwidth minheight maxwidth and maxheight properties instead

3478365
post	get
it is a post request not get

3478386
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
i read that it was best to use strip_tags htmlspecialchars and nl2br

3478395
free	malloc
as memory may become fragmented due to malloc free it becomes difficult at best in many cases to prove that future calls to malloc will not fail

3478460
ant	myeclipse
when i run an ant build myeclipse happens for v6.0 and 7.5 formats my code

3478469
ssl	https
i have a problem of ssl exception when i upload data to a https server

3478478
google-chrome	firefox
however by my testing resetting a javascript created element i m using prototype in my example but it shouldn t make a difference works in firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 5 without needed an additional onreset handler but not in ie6

3478529
client-side	server-side
that form attribute states that gets or sets a boolean value indicating whether to force controls disabled on the client to submit their values. so i think you need to use the client-side disabled property not the server-side enabled property as in

3478570
free	malloc
if the cause of memory exhaustion is lack of physical resources on the machine due to other processes using too much memory those other processes could claim the 5mb after you free it if the malloc implementation returns the space to the system

3478570
free	malloc
as we ve seen in the first paragraph due to race conditions your malloc 5mb and free it approach does not work

3478660
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

3478675
width	height
i m developing a c# .net custom control and i want to prevent the user while in design mode from resizing the height while allowing them to reize the width

3478676
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to do a bulk transaction using sqlite on google-chrome and safari

3478698
jtree	jtable
i ve set up my frame with a jtree on the left and a jtable on the right and used a borderlayout to accomplish this

3478698
jtree	jtable
however as soon as i put any data in my jtable it expands to cover nearly the whole frame and my jtree with it

3478708
equals	gethashcode
the disadvantages i see is that you need to know to override the gethashcode and equals method for every scenario

3478726
getter	setter
ensure that after calling the .dispose method that all function and property getter setter return an objectdisposedexception

3478753
put	get
so to get around this i put the into the handler for the form s shown event

3478789
width	height
for it to work you have to make sure that the width or height properties actually have a value this depends on your particular application so it s difficult to help you without having more info

3478815
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
events like manualresetevent or autoresetevent

3478832
width	margin
if you want to change more you can keep the margin by removing the width property from your label and the .masterstyle and then adding a float right style to the div

3478848
put	get
note because i don t know where you get your categories to test i put those inline in the stylesheet

3478869
post	get
i can see you are calling executing a get from a while you have given code of handling post in b

3478891
jobs	cron
in the cron jobs list i call the shell script

3479032
int	boolean
this also means that wherever the compiler generates code to translate such a pointer to an int or a boolean it must be taking care to look for that special bit pattern

3479102
hash	md5
the md5 digest creates a cryptographic hash of the data supplied to it

3479102
hash	md5
what you need to do is take the encoding md5 hash then base64 encode you did on the original password and apply it to the newly supplied password

3479102
hash	md5
the point of cryptographic hash like md5 is to make that very difficult

3479102
hash	md5
on the other hand md5 is not considered a very secure hash anymore

3479102
hash	md5
you d be better off using sha1 or sha256 but remember you can t change the existing stored passwords from their md5 hash to another hash without the original password which you don t have you can t just convert your database of stored passwords

3479109
xlib	xcb
whatever you do use xcb and not xlib

3479111
hash	md5
the md5 hash algorithm is like all hash algorithms one-way

3479111
hash	md5
the only way to recover the original password is to try every possibility until you get the one whose md5 hash matches what you received

3479120
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
you can simplify the code by using simple vector subtraction addition instead of the multiplication with a translation matrix

3479141
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
once you ve got an inputstreamreader you could create a bufferedreader and read the contents line by line or just read buffer-by-buffer and append to a stringbuilder until the read call returns -1

3479213
mouse	keyboard
i d like to play with multitouch on the emulator but my machine doesn t have multi touch support it s just a standard mouse keyboard setup

3479255
put	get
because if you do put it in a shared_ptr and it falls out of scope the object will get freed when the class may still need it

3479283
primefaces	openfaces
as far now primefaces and openfaces are one of the few with full jsf 2.0 support

3479328
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

3479349
put	get
in the get you can put whatever data retrieval code you need

3479383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari the characters appear exactly as expected

3479396
onclick	onchange
try the onclick event rather than the onchange event

3479432
firefox	safari
this works for firefox and others but not safari

3479449
retaincount	dealloc
this causes the runtime to not dealloc objects and instead complains if you send messages to objects with 0 retaincount

ironruby	ironpython
i think i m leaning towards supporting ironruby and ironpython since it seems simple to implement support for them but can those languages also be used to script windows or other applications in general and thus scripts for your application could have more features than what you laid out

3479496
free	malloc
also the design must of course take into account that free needs to make space available to malloc again somehow

3479507
super	extends
if you extract a strategy instead of extends a super class the problem is gone

3479535
onmouseover	onclick
i removed the onclick behavior in place of the toggle and the onmouseover is for an effect on a different image

3479548
memcached	apc
what many user do is store the bad words in the database or a file and read them into a cache such as memcached or apc and then look to see if they are in the cache first and if they are not read from file and then put them into the cache

3479570
free	malloc
simplistically malloc and free work like this

3479570
free	malloc
when there is no memory left on the free list for a desired allocation malloc calls brk or sbrk which are the system calls requesting more memory pages from the operating system

3479602
folder	directory
manually create a new virtual directory within iis that points to the folder you created

3479610
allocator	stl
it seems to shield my bundle plug-in from stl specializations implementations that inlined their allocator

3479662
spaces	delimiter
the usebackq makes the backticks delimit a command to execute instead of searching a literal string or file tokens sets the number of variables to place the parsed line in starting with i and delims sets the delimiter including the trailing spaces used to parse the line into those tokens

3479693
filtering	grouping
what i want to do is take a certain grouping of entries filtering by card and rec_date then determine how long the person has been working during the day and the length of each workspan how many breaks he she has taken and at the end of the week get the total number of hours worked

3479797
versioning	upgrade
instead to upgrade an existing package the right approach is to install a new versioning in a separate location say usr local and invoke the new versioning by an absolute path reference usr local bin ruby or manipulating the shell path environment variable if necessary

3479797
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
many people prefer to use one of the 3rd-party open source package distributors such as macports fink or homebrew each of which has its own package manager and installation locations

matplotlib	scipy
note because of other problems i just installed a fresh copy of python26 matplotlib numpy scipy

3479913
hash	md5
if you re trying to compare the contents of the new password with the older passwords you can t use an md5 hash

3479913
hash	md5
as jherico noted md5 and all hash are one-way meaning that you can t get the original text

3479920
punctuation	words
basically i m breaking my words on any character in the punctuation p or separator z unicode character categories

3479940
punctuation	words
this solution might be overly simple in the way that it removes punctuation and parses words but should demonstrate the idea

3479965
hide	show
and the weird thing is if you don t use toggle or show hide position works perfectly

3479981
stdout	stderr
os.system does not let you parse stdout stderr

3480008
post	get
ok so one simple way of reducing the ability to hack your site would be to use post variables rather than get variables

margin	haslayout
my general-purpose fix for ie-6 padding margin issues was because we don t support it anymore to give the offending container element the ie-proprietary zoom property with a value of 100 to trigger haslayout

3480067
gridview	detailsview
basically let us assume i have a paged gridview with 10 items in it and something like a detailsview to edit those items

profiling	debugging
now you can start a debugging or profiling session using the zend studio browser toolbar or from the remote debugging or remote profiling buttons in studio

3480082
client-side	server-side
i d think that the order would be something like html css server-side client-side

3480100
vbscript	jscript
not sure about other scripting languages such as powershell or perl but in vbscript jscript there doesn t seem a way to do this

3480100
vbscript	jscript
first of all windows script host doesn t provide access to windows api so you can t intercept the wm_endsession and wm_queryendsession windows messages as suggested in the article you mentioned from vbscript jscript

3480180
mouseover	mouseout
perhaps if i can manually fire the mouseout event for the first column the reset will allow the mouseover event to fire properly

3480235
folder	directory
start the console windows xp run - type cmd and move to the platform-tools folder of sdk directory

3480258
children	parent
one of the key notions in a parent child dimension is that though a father may have many children and grandchildren a child may only have one parent

3480281
for-loop	loops
i don t even know how to write a for-loop that would do what i need and i have the feeling that the r way would avoid for loops

passenger	unicorn
if you are looking at a new setup think about passenger or unicorn

3480324
ggplot2	lattice
in that cause lattice or ggplot2 will be very useful

i see right there with lipo that i386 and powerpc are both there but apparently it only likes i386

3480347
post	get
in snippets get and post parameters are part of the snippet lifecycle

3480368
width	height
i m playing around with a canvas inside of a viewbox and unforunately the only way to see the elements in the canvas i have to assign it a height and width

3480368
width	height
however the problem is that my height and width values come from my viewmodel via databinding

3480370
powerpc	i386
the output of lipo says that the size of the powerpc slice is just 246 bytes while the i386 x86_64 slices have 2 3 mega bytes each

3480996
wordpress	joomla
and having tried both joomla and wordpress i found wordpress much easier to get started with

3480997
client-side	server-side
in regards to integrating your framework i work mostly with asp.net mvc and it would be interesting to see how it translate server-side validation logic into client-side constraints

3481004
spaces	delimiter
a name can only start with a letter character this includes underscore then the next characters can be letter characters ot numbers or the hyphen but the spaces is a delimiter and is not allowed as part of any name

3481024
sorting	filtering
if you are just displaying data in the grid and not supporing sorting and filtering it may be easy to just update the underlying table via javascript

3481032
folder	directory
as a rule it is best to limit the number of directory as google is supposed to add weight to pages that are higher level not nested in multiple folder

3481035
serializable	deserialization
you can implement the iserializable interface and provide a constructor which takes a serializationinfo and a streamingcontext object to gain a finegrain control of the serializable deserialization process

3481049
put	get
my filter needs to get the id of the object that i put in return redirect but unless i uncomment params.id fooinstance.id above my filter gets null for params.id i must be missing something dealing with scopes of the variable

3481092
int	double
the parse_ini_file function evaluates int values as php string even if they aren t enclosed in double quotes

3481343
int	chars
takes each chars from the input lines as an int

3481367
int	double
that wouldn t work on platforms where a double is less than 64 bits but it would work on many platforms without 64-bit int

in order for the images to load before the resize occurs so that the resize wouldn t find an incorrect width and height since it wouldn t have loaded yet instead of nesting it within the document ready function

3481682
hide	show
i ve tried to do a variety of things i ve seen here in stack overflow such as inotifyproperty a converter to hide the button which didn t show the button when i checked the check box and i ve tried to do things in the overridden_click fct such as findname - but have had no success

3481696
int	double
why exactly do they return double if it s always returning an int

3481699
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome on my macbook the video plays full screen in the background

google-chrome	firefox
while i thought that most browser compatibility issues were mostly browser based and not os based apparently the same site does not work in firefox and google-chrome on pc s

3481706
int	double
rounding it to cast to an int was deemed by the language designer less common then rounding and keeping as a double

3481707
innodb	myisam
the amount of space you have to define indexes depends on the table engine - 1 000 for myisam and 767 for innodb

3481734
ceil	floor
an alternative explanation is that the .net math module uses code written in c in which floor and ceil return floating-point types

3481750
hide	show
i also can t find function for show hide a window. maybe i search through a wrong diretion...

3481801
getter	setter
to get around this i m checking both in the setter and the getter if the trasnform object passed is of type mytransform

google-chrome	safari
every where its working fine but in safari and google-chrome the right image comes in next line and i am not able to understand why this is happening

3482178
128bit	64bit
however it is a large_integer 64bit not the full 128bit identifier

3482180

you should be able to for example add a uiimageview with your background image as a subview of your app s uiwindow underneath the uinavigationcontroller s view

3482227
hide	show
i have a delphi 2010 app which show hide the desktop icons under xp fine

3482275
folder	directory
for example a folder or directory is really little more than an analogy of the physical objects with the same names

3482315
implements	extends
for instance i know that there are decent implementations of parsers for the standard twitter syntax of mentions dms replies and so forth should what i am discussing extends that work or be implements entirely in parallel

3482389
cdr	cons
the primitives are atom quote eq car cdr cons cond lambda label apply

3482429
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	portrait	landscape
if i use a uinavigationcontroller to display my uinavigationbar this bar is much slimmer in landscape mode than in portrait mode

3482429
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
everything fine so far as i want this behavior but i have one view which isn t handled by an uinavigationcontroller and so i just dragged and dropped a uinavigationbar from interface builder into the view but this one has always the same size and i can t see a way to tell the uinavigationbar that it should resize

3482434
min	max
when i logged threadpool parameters before invoking begininvoke it indicated that min threads 2 max threads 500 available threads 498

folder	directory
install files that you plan to update to the programdata folder instead of the user defined directory and use this directory as an override folder

3482511
children	parent
instead of deleting all children of a parent node only the parent node has been removed

3482665
google-chrome	safari
even with google-chrome to safari there are things you could do in google-chrome you can t do in safari and visa versa

3482683
next	except
the italicized part is what i m having trouble understanding because from my tests it looks like a java string can most certainly contain uffff and there doesn t seem to be any problem with it except obviously with the prescribed characteriterator traversal idiom that breaks because of a false positive next returns when it s not really done

3482698
int	chars
of course a java chars being just a 16-bit unsigned int doesn t really care about the value it holds as well

3482704
post	get
when i return a application models post i get

3482735
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
it should work okay to escape the string when storing it and applying nl2br possibly in combination with htmlspecialchars to prevent users from entering raw html when the data is output

3482737
move	drag
your most concurrent operations seem to be a user agent that will move a block and a timer that will drag it down to the floor

3482749
post	get
i do get a http 1.1 ok but the response text is the same page i posted to - the login page which suggests that my post did not actually succeed

3482756
cdr	cons
given x and l cons returns a new cons cell with x as the car of that cell and l as the cdr of that cell

3482762
cdr	cons
the two places in a cons cell are called car and cdr

3482762
cdr	cons
as you can see in such a structure the values are always in the car of a cons cell and the cdr points to the rest of the structure

3482762
cdr	cons
cons simply constructs another cons cell with x in the car and a reference to list in the cdr

3482774

3482949
memcpy	realloc	memcpy	malloc	realloc	malloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc	free	malloc
what realloc does in c is likely to be just a malloc memcpy and free anyway although memory managers are allowed to do something clever if there is enough contiguous free memory available

3482998

to each their own but i d avoid the office and openoffice tools like a skunk because they play so poorly with git svn cvs etc

3483156
int	double
at present when i m trying to use represent a phone number with int double longs i seem to store random numbers and not the numbers i meant to store

3483166
int	double

3483173
ubuntu	linux
i have just started looking at the latest version of ubuntu linux

3483187
jobs	cron
if it is running the most likely problem is that the environment under which cron runs your jobs is nowhere near the environment your shell gives you

fltk	motif
there s also fltk tk and even old motif is still kicking around

3483218
openssl	gnutls

3483302
min	max
sqlserver datetime columns have different min and max values than a datetime variable in the clr

3483315
django	web2py	web2py	tipfy
if you re familiar with django or web2py tipfy s routing is a huge step forward

3483338
union	distinct
we use union all since we re going to select distinct afterwards anyway and this way we have a single distinct operation rather than repeating it

3483396
hide	show
what i want to do is using jquery when a link is clicked the div of only that particular link should be show and the rest should hide

3483402

from what i ve read ironpython should work with cpython compatible libraries but out of the box it doesn t seem to work

3483493
getter	setter
you did not break encapsulation rules because the already indicates you want to expose the getter setter for name

3483496
rss	feed

3483573
int	chars
chars literals like a and p can be automatically converted to int using their ascii values

3483573
int	chars
if it does then assigning weights to a chars literal makes the code more readable than assigning to an int

3483576
int	chars
technically it would also be possible using a but there d be all sorts of integral conversions from chars to int and the program would just be confusing

3483616
int	chars
so i understand that chars literals are turned into int

3483620
jprogressbar	jtabbedpane
enclose the jprogressbar in a jpanel and add that jpanel to the jtabbedpane

the boost identity_matrix class for example has two template parameters the type and the allocator to be used so it could not be used to instantiate layer the allocator parameter has a default argument

3483882
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is a must because client-side validation does not ensure not-validated data will arrive in the server

3483929
width	height
it is good practice to always specify widths height in images regardless of browser - in the case of preloading it is acceptable to use width 1 height 1 at the preload stage since the html dimensions of the image don t affect the download itself

i m using java to parse the rss feed

3484094
lisp	scheme
my experience as a lisp newb is that common lisp style macros are much easier to learn than scheme s macros

3484094
lisp	scheme
on the other hand though there obviously are people that are convinced that this is necessary otherwise there wouldn t be implementations of scheme macros in common lisp

3484121
lisp	scheme
clojure because it is based on the jvm has no concept of a memory image like some common lisp or scheme implementations

3484122
hex	binary
well the iphone id looks like a hex string so converting both to binary and xoring the bytes ought to do it

3484170
inherited	subclassing
you seem to be slightly confused about subclassing and inherited

3484179
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to successfully request .xap files using firefox and google-chrome

3484307
lisp	scheme
i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene

3484314
put	get
put it in your web.config or app.config and then system.web won t look to the underlying system to get its proxy config

3484379
stringbuilder	printwriter
just replace printwriter by new stringbuilder and then at end do response.getwriter .write builder.tostring

3484380
client-side	server-side
client-side checks are good for maximizing the user-experience and speeding up the feedback to the client that they need to fix something and to reduce the amount of problems encountered in the server-side checks

3484422

if you re running on linux unix try not consuming stdout stderr

3484471
webstorm	aptana

3484558
post	get
what i m doing - i have an aspx page from which i originate a get and then a post to a https page with a view to login to it

3484558
post	get
i have spent quite a bit of time comparing my get and post construction to a browser get post using fiddler protocol analyzer and my requests are fine

3484558
post	get
when i run my page i can see the correct get and post but i get a 302 found object moved error

3484558
post	get
i then simulated the exact get post

3484558
post	get
my post and the browsers post are exactly the same except the 3 viewstate variables i fill it correctly from the get

3484558
post	get
- something fishy in the viewstate values which can only be because the browser sent it to me in the first place there is no corruption in my parsing the get viewstate variables and using it in post it s perfectly fine

3484587
integer	unsigned
since unsigned integer will roll into its max value when decremented from zero you can try the following provided n is less then that maximum value someone please correct me if this is ub

3484599
boost	stl
you could just use the stl s shared pointer std tr1 shared_ptr which for all intents and purposes is boost shared_ptr

3484636
int	double
if you store data in pure binary form the metadata is crucial to make any sense out of the data again are these numbers single or double precision or int and of what length what are the arrays dimensions etc etc and issues with archiving and retrieving paired data metadata pairs can and in practice do occasionally make perfectly good datasets unusable -- a real pity and waste

3484645
mouse	keyboard
since your sprite doesn t have a visible area it will not receive keyboard or mouse input

3484680
integer	unsigned
arithmetic on unsigned integer types is guaranteed to use modulo 2 n arithmetic where n is the number of value bits in the type and behaviour on overflow is well defined

3484680
integer	unsigned
-1 converted to an unsigned integer type of which size_t is one converts to 2 n - 1

3484847
width	height
i used the values from the width and height attributes of the svg tag and it seemed to work

3484850
textview	listactivity
but in order to create a scrollable list i think i must use listactivity but i want to create an activity so the only scrollable part is the list and the textview and buttons are fixed

3484881
superclass	subclassing
eclipse 3.5 has no built in option for that particular case but i would anyway suggest that you have a separate constructor in the superclass which the subclassing invokes through super ... in its constructor

3484881
superclass	subclassing
if you for instance add a filed in the superclass you would need to remember to update the subclassing as well

3484891
lisp	scheme
because they use a different non-scheme language scheme macros are less powerful than common lisp macros in the almost-formal sense you can do arbitrary compile-time computation with them but it s hairy and convoluted

3484891
lisp	scheme
that s the best argument i ve seen for scheme macros over common lisp ones if you are building a complex language on top of scheme you are less likely to introduce subtle macro bugs if you stick with the standard macro system

3484943
int	chars
all default datatypes int chars bool etc are automatically managed for you and do not and cannot be released for all intents and purposes

3484954
128bit	64bit
this can easily be defeated even in 128bit md5 through use of rainbow tables much less the author s hacked together 64bit version

3484960
postgresql	mysql
i am not new to software developing but in the last years i was almost completely involved with web applications development most likely to php with mysql postgresql

3484961
free	malloc
alloc and release are objective-c idioms that largely replace c s malloc and free functions but all of them ultimately are asking the computer to set aside memory on the heap and all of that memory must ultimately be returned either through an autorelease pool a release message or a free call

3484966

nginx seems to be the preferred route here unless you need specific apache features

3485121
apache	nginx
if you re using passenger both apache and nginx are supported

3485121
postgresql	mysql
however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

3485137
glassfish	resin	jboss	resin	jboss	glassfish
if you really want to move to java ee 6 you ll need a java ee 6 server either supporting the full java ee 6 specification or only the web profile like glassfish 3.0.1 glassfish 3.0.1 web profile jboss 6.0 resin 4.0 web profile implementation

3485164

one cannot assume that more than one spaces is delimiter

3485195
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
if the width of a button element isn t wide enough to contain the button text firefox and google-chrome give the button more height ie v7 at least will just cut off

3485244
maven	m2e
the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough

when the flex sdk converts mxml to actionscript it generates a lot of databinding code

3485453
post	get
submission works properly 2 post and 1 get

3485499
hash	md5
unfortunately large free webspace providers are another thing to take into account the countless .blogspot.com domains if you download the alexa top 100.000 free csv file you can at least get a good overview of the most used of these that should get you for a certain percentage covered for these domains when comparing alexa rating with stumbleupon pageviews with delicious bookmarks alexa sometimes only takes the topdomain while delicious really md5 s every url so 1 alexa -- multiple delicious md5 hash

3485524
udp	tcp
if that doesn t work you can open a tcp or udp socket to the ports and see if anyone is listening

3485558
stdout	stderr
a likely cause is that installing the packages starts background processes that keep one or both of your pipes stdout stderr open

3485558
stdout	stderr
a proper daemon replaces its original stdin stdout stderr with dev null or a log file after it has finished initializing

3485580
stdout	stderr
my guess is that java doesn t think the script is over until the pipes it passed to it via stdin stdout stderr are closed by the sub-process

3485580
stdout	stderr
that is there are no more active reader processes on stdin no more active writer processes on stdout stderr

3485580
stdout	stderr
this problem generally arises when your script forks off background tasks like newly-installed services which inherit stdin stdout stderr

3485580
stdout	stderr
if on linux check proc fd for any new services and see if their stdin stdout stderr is the same pipe that your java process passes to your script

3485580
stdout	stderr
then it replaces stdout by opening var log another-log.log and replaces stderr by cloning stdout

3485580
pipe	file-descriptor
this means the the new file-descriptor 3 is open for writing on the pipe that was originally passed in as stdout

3485580
daemons	systemd	stdout	stderr
programs that expect to be systemd service daemons will often close file descriptors 0 stdin 1 stdout and 2 stderr but may not bother with any others

int	double
your compiler probably aligns int and pointers to multiples for 4 bytes and the double to multiples for 8 bytes

3486977
int	chars
chars are promoted to int but we want to be unsigned int

3487011
int	chars
the reason is that c2 is first promoted to int before doing the bitwise or which causes sign extension to take place assuming that chars is signed and can hold negative values

3487011
unsigned	short
while not strictly necessary you may cast c1 to unsigned char too for consistency if short is 2 bytes long it won t matter that c1 was sign extended beyond those 2 bytes

3487013
int	chars
to solve the problem cast the chars s to unsigned chars and then to int to prevent overflow or even the appearance of the possibility of overflow before shifting

3488093
superclass	subclassing
that is a subclassing s may invoke protected constructors members of a superclass c only on instances of s

3488109
width	height
i would like use a panel whose children have coordinates specified as percentage of total panel s width height

3488109
width	height
use a canvas with fixed width and height and put it inside a viewbox - this is a simple solution but when resizing the viewbox the whole content of canvas is resized too

3488151
floating-point	integer
if your architecture has both integer and floating-point divide instructions the compiler will emit the right instruction for the case specified by the code

3488151
floating-point	integer
the language standard specifies the rules for type promotion and whether integer or floating-point division should be used in each possible situation

3488151
floating-point	integer
if you have only an integer divide instruction or only a floating-point divide instruction the compiler will inline some code or generate a call to a math support library to handle the division

3488160
sorting	grouping
after sorting i need to have a new xml sorted and grouping by and all should be summed for each grouping

3488183
codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
kohana symfony and codeigniter are all worthwhile

3488220
uiview	subviews
my first thought is a uiscrollview to scale a uiview subviews and have the uiview subviews contain another subviews that does not resize vertically but only does horizontally when bounds change and disable vertical scrolling

3488220
uiview	subviews
maybe i could skip one of these uiview subviews and have only one do everything

3488223
post	get
i need this to make a link send a post request instead of get

3488226
mergesort	in-place
implementing mergesort not in-place in c++ and i m having real trouble with the code with no idea why

3488283
inherited	subclassing
scott is writing in a c++ context of course but paul haahr gives exactly the same advice for java phrased as don t subclassing concrete classes -- and i generally second it for python though i do favor the gang-of-four s softer phrasing prefer composition over concrete class inherited but i understand that both scott and paul are often writing for an audience which needs very direct and strongly phrased advice almost phrased as commandments rather than advice not softer phrased one that they might too easily ignore in the name of their convenience

3488328
stdout	stderr
now the problem is that i have no idea how to assign stdin stderr stdout into it because the stdin etc are handlers no io handlers

3488330
wan	lan
-- either lan or wan -- for true durability as a given server could

3488367
actualheight	actualwidth
for each child use their xratio and yratio along with the actualwidth and actualheight of the relativecanvas to calculate and apply values for their canvas.left and canvas.top attached properties

3488381
mp3	wav	mp3	flac	wav	flac
i ve got about 100 media files that need to be encoded or transcoded from wav to flac or from flac to mp3

3488381
decoder	encoder
i ve got 4 cores so the worst case transcoding by piping the decoder into the encoder still only uses 2 cores

3488409
rss	feed
i m looking for an objective-c library for an ios app that will parse and display articles form an rss feed

3488431
config	ini
the is related to the ini config setting allow_url_fopen

3488459
getter	setter
if you do have properties that are completely local to the view controller a common pattern is to write your own getter and setter rather than using synthesize and create the object in the getter if it doesn t exist

3488479
floating-point	integer
this results in the compiler assuming that the method takes an integer argument instead of a floating-point argument

3488479
floating-point	integer
thus the caller converts your 100.f value into the integer 100 which is then interpreted by the function as the encoding of the floating-point number you are observing

3488537
button	checkbox
besides the fading you may clear all inputs in that function by using input .val and input .removeattr checked for radio button and checkbox respectively if there are any that is

3488548
folder	directory
i save it as a .py file within a module folder i created within the python directory

3488599
cos	sin
because arbitrary point on circumference with center cx cy and radius r has the following coordinate it directly follows from cos and sin geometric definitions - ratio between lengths of corresponding cathetus and hypotenuse

3488617
cos	sin
just look at what sin and cos actually mean in a circle

3488617
cos	sin
if you have a point on a circle which forms an angle alpha the cos alpha is the x-part of the point a sin alpha is the y part

3488698
google-chrome	safari
i recently tested a cappuccino app i was working on with google-chrome and safari

3488707
implements	extends
tracking changed and deleted content can be done by introducing a you can extends a to implements this

3488733
width	height
i think you ll find the issue is the old box model problem basically ie uses a different model for where padding margins etc are in relation to the entity width height

3488770
implements	extends
urllib2 doesn t offer a way to do this so you d have to extends some of the classes it uses and implements rate limiting yourself

3488788
chown	sudo
sudo chown root root etc init.d lowvol.sh

3488807
width	height
have all height width float all in one defintion then override the background color for each of the #id values

3488851
passenger	thin
works well in front of passenger mongrel and thin

3488851
passenger	thin
as a result of this i am probably going to use thin or mongrel until passenger 3 comes out

3488855
children	parent
it takes a parent page id and an array of all pages and returns a filtered array that only contains the pages that are children of the parent page

3488901

inside this class s header file is the property for uiview samplesubview which is a subviews of sampleview

3488923
rss	feed
im using php to create a sorta rss aggregator that stores data from multiple site rss feed into a mysql database

3488960
hash	md5
md5 is fastest and produces hash that is 32 characters long

3488974
int	double
the rule is pass by const-reference unless the type is primitive built-in like int double etc. if the types size is less than or if you are going to need a copy of it anyway

3488996
post	get
after also tried various attempts with creating foo and trying to assign values but they all failed and i decided to post this question to get some nice answer that helps me understanding c a little bit more

3489002
public	protected
as you test the controller if you have already tested lower levels then you can mock out the lower levels so that your test will go quicker but everything should have a test all the public and protected methods not just the public ones imo

3489012
subclass	abstract-class
i m thinking of making key and abstract-class and making each subclass implement the strongly typed aspect

3489021
rss	feed
maybe you need to scrape the page and generate your own rss feed

3489065
punctuation	words
if you also want punctuation to serve as words delimiters you d have to add or clauses for that as well hence why it s a hack

3489067
g++	gcc
gcc g++ with multilib

3489067
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ compiler add -m32 to the command field the field should now say g++ -m32

3489067
g++	gcc
do the same for gcc g++ linker

3489067
profiling	debugging
i only added the -m32 flag only under the release profiling so my debugging builds are still 64bit

3489076
post	get
you issue the request get or post - get in your case and pass a callback instance

3489082

3489149
free	malloc
if you are worried about memory and i doubt 25 bytes will be an issue but then you can just use malloc and free and then you just have an extra 4-8 bytes being used for the pointer

3489228

3489331
innodb	myisam
mysql has different engines - myisam innodb memory.

3489338
stdout	stderr
yes generally you should be able to see anything that s printed to stderr or stdout

3489338
stdout	stderr
and yes you should be able to redirect stderr and or stdout to a file

3489338
stdout	stderr
this makes it easier to use stderr which is unbuffered vs stdout

3489359
internationalization	localization
here i provide some informations about internationalization and localization under the google app engine framework

3489366
superclass	subclassing
what i would like to do is to call a method from a superclass in a subclassing

3489366
superclass	subclassing
specifically i want to be able to add the subclassing as a child of the superclass but without physically having to type addchild in the superclass but i will have to type it in the subclassing

3489366
superclass	subclassing
for now i m just trying to call a method in the superclass that draws some text from a subclassing

the issues feels like a buffering or a throttling issue but while looking at the internal code of the ftp classes i don t see anything unusual and i m specifically setting it not to throttle

3489444
stateless	stateful
stateless and stateful enterprise java beans

3489480
for-loop	loops
you can also use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop

i am thinking of using either rss or atom in my project but also enhancing the feed with some of my own special attributes specifically used by my project

3489590
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython

i d write my own uislider subclass and implement all the touch handling myself in hittest withevent using uislider just to do the rendering you can get the relevant min max rects by calling thumbrectforvalue or whatever it s called

3489747
yacc	cup
you may want to use a parser generator like cup or yacc as a lot of the dirty work is done for you but with a language as simple as bf it may be overkill

3489759
button	checkbox
i mean i have a save button too where when i click save and none of the checkbox are checked i would like it to validate but not validate where it throws an alert

3489766
skip-lists	tree
thus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you only need to lock locally while read-heavy data structures are probably better implemented immutably where a tree is a more natural data structure

3489777
put	get
any ideas i want to put up this link to get as many people to donate as possible

3489788
int	chars
it would seem to be saying print 16 chars of a long unsigned int

hash	md5
5 or 6 characters and decide to map out the entire md5 hash for all the values inside that range storing the results in a database to use for reverse lookup

3489873
salt	md5
if you precompute the entire md5 space and reverse it that doesn t mean jack dandy if someone is using key strengthening or a good salt

3489890
vim	emacs
i like vim but i would prefer not to switch because i am much faster and more comfortable in emacs

3489929
getattr	setattr
it is something i will only do if all other methods fail me or if all other methods are overriding setattr and getattr

3489975
hide	show
i am trying to dynamically show hide table rows sections when turning a uiswitch on or off

3489992
inherited	subclassing
the problem is that it is too easy for someone to forget that a particular subclassing inherited from intrusivebase and they then store it in some other smart pointer like a scoped_ptr or shared_ptr

3489994
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
they work fine in firefox 3.6.8 but don t work at all in google-chrome 5.0.375.126 and safari 5.0 6533.16

client-side	server-side
if you were trying to do this on your own site you could easily do it by referencing the querystring parameters in whatever server-side language you built the site with or on the client-side via javascript

3490204
wordpress	expressionengine
i know that alistapart jasonsantamaria.com change.gov ilounge and many more high quality high traffic sites run on expressionengine but i m not totally convinced it s worth the price given that wordpress can surely do the job well enough in 90 of cases

3490208
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
support for udp tcp and icmp

3490211
hide	show
the way i use it is by creating a subclass of uitableviewcontroller and defining a handful of methods to show and hide the hud view

3490224

put	get
if the object is really big and you don t feel comfortable returning it with a get method maybe you could put its contents into an sqlite database and optionally expose it as a contentprovider

3490479
put	get
a route is defined by 1 an http method get put head... 2 a uri pattern specified with syntax which will apparently be familiar to webby rubyists 3 a destructuring form used in binding parts of the request map to names available in the body 4 a body of expressions which needs to produce a valid ring response in non-trivial cases this is usually just a call to a separate function

3490520
put	get
get put problem

pyqt relates to cpython in a way that is very different than .net relates to ironpython

3490601
cpython	ironpython
while ironpython is built on top of .net pyqt is a binary semi-automatically generated set of bindings specific to a version of cpython against which it was compiled

3490604
getter	setter
clearly this won t work if your monadic function makes essential use of some properties of the monad its working with like the availability of a getter and a setter for state etc

3490606
min	max
the sensor itself can communicate certain error messages through status codes in cases when it s no longer able to acquire data when it s functioning outside its max min operating conditions etc

3490612
postgresql	mysql
i suppose postgresql could have higher metadata overhead than mysql or has to extend its data files in larger chunks but i can t find anything obvious that postgresql wastes space for which migrating to mysql is the cure

3490634
qstring	qfiledialog
to open the the file in its default appication where the path will be the qstring returned by qfiledialog getopenfilename

3490640
range	max
i could just get the tweets and work out the date range with javascript but the documentation states the the max you can get is 200 tweets so if the tweets from the date range i want aren t in the last 200 i can t do it

if the parent container s width is reduced a line wrap may occur in the list which will change the height of the content

3490850
alloca	malloc	free	alloca	free	malloc
alloca is completely replaceable by malloc and free

3490852

i m trying to get teamcity to run nunit tests as set up in an nant script as follows

3491006
put	get
this can be done by creating test suites to put and get messages from the queue and having your proxy do the transformation

3491010
hash	md5
you can use a hash function like md5 or sha1

3491010
hash	md5
that s impossible since the message space is too large for your hash there are 2 1024 messages vs 2 128 possible hash if you are using md5 but these functions are meant to be collision resistant and hard to reverse

3491069
nsstring	nsdata
so when the xml parser gets to the binary tag it inserts the data to nsdata object and the rest of the tags will be inserted to nsstring

3491097

3491242
vb.net	vb6
i m redesigning an old vb6 application into vb.net and there is one thing i m not sure on the best way to do

3491246
getter	setter
first you can declare your properties that map to file system data as transient and go to file system when getter setter are called you have to override them

3491249
client-side	server-side
gwt is client-side approach -- all the code running at the client while zk server-side approach -- all the code running at the server but they have an option to write some of application code at client

3491287
onresume	onpause
you would instantiate in your activities oncreate and possibly open in onresume close on onpause

3491317
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
finally you should use using statements for the sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader so that you dispose of them appropriately

3491321
put	get
you should pass it through awk first to get rid of the unwanted lines and optionally put on line numbers so that you can still tell what the real lines are

3491412
integer	fractions
that consumes 2 spaces for fractions part and one space for decimal point leaving only 2 spaces for integer part of the number

3491513
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i understand that ie temporary installs the font only for the period the font is required but can find no mention of how this is handled for firefox safari google-chrome opera etc

3491570
pop-up	dialog
in my application i need to offer a global search shortcut key like you see in google desktop if you press ctrl+ctrl at any time regardless of which application is active and has keyboard focus a dialog box must pop-up where you must be able to type a search text and press enter

post	get
for get post and cookies

3491734

3492064
int	chars
however after some googling i found out that even if a chars is always 8 bit long the underlying representation could actually be a 32 bit int

3492064
freebsd	linux
so my impression is that char is maybe not the best way of representing a string in a message that will be sent over a socket from freebsd to linux or input some other unixes if you want to ...

3492064
freebsd	linux
what is the best way of representing a character array string in c that will be sent over tcp ip in a nix linux freebsd etc. platform independent way

primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces	richfaces	icefaces
now you can either write your own components or use frameworks such as primefaces icefaces richfaces etc

3492157
hash	md5
one way to try would be to hash the value out using like sha1 md5 and use a session on the server side to store the same value and assert the hash match

3492187
getter	setter
i could probably achieve this behavior myself too as long as the first set goes through a method by dynamically defining getter setter

3492206
hash	md5
a typical way to avoid this is to use a one-way hash algorithm to store it in the database such as md5 or better sha1

3492207
cpu	processors
i ve installed intel vtune analyzer 9 to get call-graph and counter-monitor data from a win32 application on a windows 7 pc with amd turion x2 tl-58 processors but it gives an error saying the cpu architecture can t be identified properly data collection is not available

3492222
getter	setter
i feel if you write normal data bean which is having getter and setter then will be more better than this..

3492224

3492575
public	protected
if the base class has a protected internal or public field property so does the derived class the internal has some odd cases

3492575
short	base
and a final note on inheritance you should avoid inheriting for functionality in short that is just because you need the same functionality in two unrelated classes you shouldn t create a base class to hold that functionality rather you should create a third class and inject and instance of that class or similar approaches and you should think a lot about liskov substitutional principle when designing the public interface of a class when it s not sealed

3492579
translation	localization
this way you will be able to use native localization functionality of .net platform and still be able to store translation in any place you want

3492585
subtract	add
i thought about making a extension to simply call datetime.mylocaltime and there use timeinfo to add subtract the correct hours

portrait	landscape
which isn t that difficult to do though is perhaps fragile as it assumes the navigation bar status bar etc will be the same height in both orientations and you d have to manually take account of the toolbar being different heights in portrait vs landscape - i just want to make sure i ve not missed a more straightforward or common way.

3496504
superclass	subclassing
i found that the subclassing can only access variables which are set in the constructor of the superclass

freebsd	linux
gcc x86 32-bit tested on linux freebsd

3496516
x86	64bit
gcc x86 64bit tested on linux

3496524
width	height
make sure to assign your grid.row within your image or control but do not sign the controls height width properties

3496539
free	malloc
your main question asking why java doesn t use malloc and free comes down to a matter of target market

3496593
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
i understand that any collection here i am talking about regular non-generic should have implemented icollection ienumerable and ilist incase of regular object collection or idictionary in case of dictionaries

3496593
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
ilist is derived from icollection and ienumerable

3496593
ienumerable	icollection
icollection is derived from ienumerable

3496593
ilist	ienumerator	ilist	icollection	ienumerator	icollection
arraylist are implementing ilist icollection and ienumerator

3496609
ironruby	ironpython
it s certainly very easy to host powershell -- assuming that it s pre-installed on your target pcs-- so it s a very viable option but i think that in general it s just as easy to do it with ironruby or ironpython

3496609
ironruby	ironpython
also the work to host powershell only gets you powershell -- whereas you can leverage the same work to get ironpython and ironruby working

3496645
addition	multiplication	min	max
i m not sure if this actually answers your question but my understanding of the text you quoted simply says that the mandel function is just another function like multiplication min max addition etc that can appear in your genetic program

3496663
versioning	upgrade
idea appears to be the leader of the two although i had to upgrade to the eap versioning of the ide when i switched to 2.8

3496672
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
that will mean your mycollectionclass implements ilist icollection and ienumerable

3496672
ilist	ienumerator	ilist	icollection	ienumerator	icollection
arraylist are implementing ilist icollection and ienumerator

3496691

most solutions i ve looked at have a pay with paypal button so i assume a form post is necessary to go to the paypal site but ideally we d want to get there via a 302 redirect

3496838
filtering	grouping
i have information on grouping validation roles and rights navigation filtering actions workflow so i should be able to do much better layouts

3496891
google-chrome	firefox
on ie firefox and google-chrome i could open a new client but trying to hit the same url again would instead return a jnlp file

3496897
ready	each
in short the idea of these tools is not to skip phases but to avoid the cost of the initialization of the jvm of the maven engine of plugins etc at each build by caching them in a ready to re use environment

3496999
kde	gnome
gnome libraries don t necessarily mean that someone s running the whole gnome desktop environment but then gnome and kde aren t window managers

3497043
pull	push
so basically i am trying to code the simplest example that can push and pull with both twitter and facebook and eventually not just status updates but all kinds of content from facebook as well

3497043
pull	push
so i would create some kind of base architecture and then hook in my social network accounts to be able to push and pull with my system

3497054
dlsym	dlopen
if you actually wanted to implement something that would dynamically link to different toolkits you could try something with dlopen dlsym but that would be insane

3497058
mouseout	mouseup
i think you need to define a mouseout for movieshow that does the same thing as mouseup

3497063
width	height
if you select the field go to the layout palette palettes menu - layout shift + f9 and select the expand to fit box next to the width and or height it will expand when more text is entered

google-chrome	firefox
i ve compared the output from firebug in google-chrome and firefox vs the developer tool in ie8 and i can t see a difference in the html

3497149

then i found out the theme builder versioning was old and need to upgrade to confluence 3.3.x to use the newest versioning of theme builder.

3497164
mvp	presenter
this is checkers written using mvp model view presenter so it s a hitch to hook it up to use html5 wpf etc

note that the getdelegate is not portable the result of this method is implementation specific the above code works in jboss for glassfish you d have to adapt it - have a look at be careful while using entitymanager.getdelegate

3497211
lisp	scheme
this isn t exactly for lisp but for scheme a lisp derivative but we used this free as in beer text in my programming languages class

3497249

then you can create an servlet which gets an inputstream of the html file by fileinputstream and writes it to the outputstream of the servlet response as obtained by httpservletresponse#getoutputstream the usual java io way

3497285
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover method accepts two functions to fire for mouseenter and mouseleave

3497298
ocaml	scheme
it is also considered a functional programming language like scheme and ocaml because it has closures and supports higher-order functions

3497315
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
the best approach is to use an intermediate controller like nsobjectcontroller nsarraycontroller nsdictionarycontroller or nstreecontroller

3497334
int	chars
your order table in each database would have an id column int and machine identifier chars a b c... so in case you ever needed to combine dbs into one each order would still be unique

3497405
draggable	droppable
it isn t working though - i basically want to make the draggable above droppable into any ul that has the class type sortable

3497419
dllmain	getprocaddress
my best guess is that the dll that you re loading is calling getprocaddress in its dllmain and specifying an invalid ordinal

3497503
gridview	repeater
i decided not to use datasource and use my own i gave me more flexibility to bind the repeater no need for gridview within the gridview before moving to the next row

3497551
hebrew	persian	hebrew	thai	persian	thai
including persian thai islamic hebrew etc.

3497585

there is no limit of 60k tcp or udp sockets you just think there is

3497670
folder	directory
ping is the folder that contains my project and it sits inside the xampp htdocs directory on my computer c xampplite htdocs

3497671
hide	show
but in any case if you must hide show the console window i would steer clear of using findwindow for this task since there is a much more reliable api for this getconsolewindow

3497764
integer	unsigned
it s not linux it s tcp ip design limitation - port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer thus 64k limit

3497767
free	malloc
it s better to either have a third parameter to combine into which the result is placed or to return a malloc d char array and ensure that you free this at some point

3497770
lisp	scheme
it contains the description of a scheme compiler written in common lisp

3497795
int	boolean
that class has a several strings a boolean and a int

3497851
next	except
the next thought i had was doing the same thing except instead of using executeglobal to replace the function with a variable use it to replace the function with another function which simply returned the singleton

3497942
webkit	gecko
gecko and webkit require a to be inserted at the end of empty paragraphs otherwise they are automatically deleted

3498047
hide	show
you can give it a try here instead of show hide this uses .toggle bool and we re selecting the matching element by transforming the id replacing test with example and fetching that element

3498061
folder	directory
add the dll to a folder in the project and set to copy to output directory

3498073

mockups	balsamiq
also try to work to give your client an early representation of what they will be getting using a tool like balsamiq mockups

3498153
for-loop	arrays
thus it is better to use a traditional for-loop with a numeric index when iterating over arrays

3498164
int	chars
could be a lot of reasons maybe you are using chars 5000 instead of varchar 5000 maybe you are using bigints instead of int nvarchar when all you need is varchar etc etc etc

3498184
put	get
beware however that you ll get little help from the ide to put the dll in that spot

3498206
lxml	beautifulsoup
for scraping often-badly-written html beautifulsoup perhaps but not necessarily as included in lxml

3498214
asterisk	ivr
if you want to build your ivr quickly and easily you d be better off looking at something like tropo.com tropo s parent voxeo own adhearsion or twilio.com they ve done a lot of the grunt work for you and setting up asterisk is not for the faint hearted

3498253
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uitableview and basically i m making some in app settings and if the first section s uisegmentedcontrol is toggled to index 1 then i want to display a new section but if index 1 was previously set and the user selects index 0 then i need to remove section 2

superclass	subclassing
unfortunately it seems that calling self _get_class_name from the superclass calls the parent class implementation even if the subclassing has overridden it

3498513
fiddler	charles
or you could utilise charles proxy or fiddler to sniff the traffic to see the performance etc

3498530
cassini	iis

3498917
width	height
so when you apply transformations to the loader eg height or width you are not modifying the transformation of the loaded asset but its parent container the loader instance

3498931
multiplying	add
you could even add a formula to multiplying the hours worked by your wage to see what you have made

3498955
imperative	declarative
you can use the imperative principalpermission or the declarative principalpermissionattribute to assert that a user meets some authorization criteria to invoke a certain method or block of code

3498960
put	get
and importing something from inside a module a practice i personally abhor but that s another issue must also ensure the module is loaded if it s already in sys.modules it doesn t of course need to be loaded again but if it isn t it must get loaded and put in sys.modules

3498996
single-quotes	double-quotes
also you have to escape single-quotes within single-quotes but not single-quotes within double-quotes etc

however when it actually compiles the file doesn t get put in the right place and the command that was executed according to the log was tlb . filename.tlb

3499002
width	height
i need to able able to set a max height and width for the gallery as a percentage of the page dimensions

3499034
client-side	server-side
a good answer would address the need for client-side scripting the xss issue and the server-side component necessary to get around the xss issue possibly with pseudocode or snippets

3499070
hash	md5
whatever it is so long as it s consistant you can consider it more or less like an md5 hash

3499070
hash	md5
you match it against a hash version you store in your database and if it matches you authenticate her by generating a token maybe another md5 hash that is good for an hour or so

3499131

3499301
equals	gethashcode
operators gethashcode and equals object and now it is working nicely

3499332
integer	unsigned
it s an unsigned integer - by definition its smallest possible value is 0

3499332
int	chars
for unsigned int types other than unsigned chars the bits of the object representation shall be divided into two groups value bits and padding bits there need not be any of the latter

3499362
width	margin
margin 0 auto on the div with the explicit width set should center it

3499393

turns out you can do directory symlinks in ntfs filesystems

3499415
firefox	safari
however i have a shadow effect on a new site that works the same as the red strips that works on firefox safari ie8

3499420

3499475
division	modulo
mod is modulo it s the remainder of a division

3499479
stdout	stderr
i am not quite sure i fully understand what you are doing but it you could intercept stdout and stderr of the process

3499491
int	chars
here t chars and u int

3499491
int	chars
even though in normal circumstances chars is convertible to int this does not hold good for explicitly specified template arguments

3499510
hex	binary
0024e865a023 hex converted from binary with received-string.encode hex

3499528
google-chrome	firefox

i like to have all my external dependencies in a lib folder under the sl project so i copied over the dll from the installation dir of the control toolkit to the lib folder but if i try to add reference to the dll from this location vs is still picking up the reference from the installation dir

3499610
google-chrome	safari
i m testing on google-chrome on mac os x although it doesn t work on safari either

3499611

i d imagine its a bit harder to do in flash as most of its projects require heavy user interactivity drag and drop with mouse keyboard input to move etc...

3499785
hash	salt
use a little bit of salt and make a hash using sha1 or so

3499803
getter	setter
accessing the fields via the magic getter and setter like doctrine is doing it does not cost that much time

3499803
getter	setter
the creation of getter and setter is some kind of micro-optimization that will may cause you a lot of trouble

3499812
pop-up	dialog
if you call this script download.php then linking to will make the browser pop-up a download dialog for file.mp3

3499822
width	height
return the width height and the url of the object

3499825
innodb	myisam
myisam or innodb is irrelevant

3499831
put	get
that s your problem - you have to create a subclass of uitableview and put the function in there before you will get those touch events

3499909
hash	md5
the trouble with a pure sha x or md5 password hash is that by-design these algorithms are very fast this makes it very sensitive to brute force attacks

3499909
hash	salt
of course if you don t salt your hash there are tons of rainbow tables that make cracking all the passwords in your db trivial

3499921
demo	shareware
shareware software are just a demo version of the full software developed by small software company and the modification and other usability lies with the development group.here end user dependencies is more

3499935

3500062
jar	war
is it ear or war + jar s

3500090
width	height
specifically if i resize a catiledlayer to half the width height size 1 4 the area the image inside it will suddenly scale to a further 1 2 the resized frame leaving 3 4 of the frame empty

3500197
hide	show
i can move the slider up and down to hide or show the map

3500297
int	double
i built a struct named fraction with three properties double value int numerator and int denominator

3500312

internal protected or protected internal which is the same means externally protected from outside the current assembly and internally public from within the same assembly

3500356
division	modulo
in particular for uint32_t there is an assembler instruction that does division and modulo in one go called divl

3500374
post	get
a redirecttoaction will always perform a get never a post it returns a http 302 to the browser which will then issue a get request

3500388
maven	pom.xml
i use maven to build my web app projects when i add some dependent library to the pom.xml file it again adds some more dependent jars to the project recursively

3500406
google-chrome	firefox
people still running ie6 may be in large organisations as their systems don t get upgraded as often but you ll find that most people in these organisations would have downloaded and installed firefox or google-chrome

3500413
jar	war
the only way i can think to fix it is to move the grails- .jar files grails-web.jar to some kind of shared jar folder not sure where that is in liferay and remove them from the portlet war files

3500512
maven	pom.xml
i already have user-defined properties in the pom.xml and in profiles.xml ....my problem is how to execute following from maven

3500514

3500586
children	parent
if it is a parent term all nodes belonging to the children term are displayed i ve set depth 0

3500611
mouseout	mouseleave
if you make the dropdown options children of the button that opens the menu then add a mouseout mouseleave event listener to the button that opens the menu that listener should apply if the mouse is outside of the button that opens the menu and the children since they are now part of the menu

3500611
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
another option would be to add a mouseover mouseenter and a mouseout mouseleave listener on the image and the menu and set a timeout after each mouseout mouseleave for about 1 second that will check for a variable set by the mouseover mouseenter handler and see if it changed - if so then there has been another mouseover mouseenter ie

3500611

this limits the user to setting per your requirements the value of this value property to data types int boolean or string

3505006
rsa	aes
first of all rsa can be used to encrypt a message so aes is unnecessary

3505006
post	get
this would require the session id to be sent as a get or post request by the client when the hand off occures which could open the door to session fixation

3505009
typedef	struct
typedef struct

3505026
rss	feed

postgresql	mysql
make sure you study up on both html and a database language most likely mysql postgresql is another popular platform for retailers.

3505034
mvp	presenter
when i ve done mvp in desktop apps for example the presenter retrieved the model from the database directly or using a repository - the model wasn t anything to do with data access

3505056
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven 2 the dependency will be automatically included unless someone has explicitly excluded it from your pom.xml

3505063
jar	war
when you add jar in the web-inf folder they are packaged as part of your war file assuming using some build tool like ant and when your application is deployed or run it resolve dependencies using those jars

there isn t a way to direct mouse keyboard events to a particular process in win32

3505114
children	parent
when using jquery s accordion in a nested fashion i want to ensure that when a parent element is clicked opened any open children are closed rolled up

3505123
maven	pom.xml
it seems that the maven release plug-in spins up a new instance of maven which it seems is using the default pom.xml rather than our differently named pom.xml

3505130
width	height
unless you have specified height width figures specifically which disables the layout manager from handling it

3505143
post	get
dumb post get downvoted and go away

3505185
gtk	fltk
i would rank these popular toolkits from most to least snappy fltk fox gtk tcl tk swing qt

im using magpie to pull rss feed from several websites

3505340
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have a nsmutabledictionnary and when i use setobject forkey with a nsstring key it works when i try objectforkey but if i put a nsmutablestring in the key argument of the setobject forkey method it s not work when i call objectforkey it return the last object in the dictionnary.

3505357
implements	extends
i m also thinking if it s possible to extends the import loader to implements the db loading

3505368
hash	md5
after you authenticate a user you start a session and in that session you store md5 username+time and also store a cookie on users browser of md5 username+time then on subsequent page requests you could check your session hash matches the cookie hash to assert the user is who they say they are

3505368
hash	md5
md5 is not a good hash for this type of thing but hashing in general can help in situations such as these

3505370
hash	md5
md5 is a one way encryption hash

3505370
hash	md5
it doesn t decrypt anything rather it creates you a hash code that you can use to compare with other md5 hash

3505371
hash	md5
it generates a one way hash of the input data using the md5 algorithm

3505443
mouseout	mouseleave
sure use the mouseleave event handler rather than mouseout

3505447
mouseout	mouseleave
try to use mouseleave instead of mouseout i didn t checked but it may work.

3505448
mouseout	mouseleave
unlike mouseout which fires even when entering children mouseleave won t

3505448
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

3505525
stdout	stderr
the problem is i need to be able to assert stdin stdout and stderr as parameters to stat stat stdin buff where buff is the pointer to the insertion point for the struct data returned in memory

3505525
stdout	stderr
my file descriptor table in my simple os reserves 0 1 and 2 for stdin stdout and stderr

3505527
aggregate-functions	sum
if you were to group by nid you d need an aggregate-functions afterwards such as count or sum etc

3505537

the implementation of strdup contains a malloc

3505541
post	put
here s a sample i put together that post an entity to a wcf rest service using jquery on the client side

3505602
folder	directory
so the answer to your question is at level 1 file names are restricted to 8+3 characters a la dos but directory folder names are restricted to eight characters with no extension unlike dos if i remember correctly

3505615
min	max
you use delegates like min and max to determine this and for numerical data there are also delegates like avg and count

3505623
google-chrome	firefox
using the file api test from mark pilgrim s page i got a false sanity checked in firefox 4.0 nightly and google-chrome 6.0.490.1 dev and both returned true

3505626

i need to match beginning of string any set of chars and underscore then any multi-digit int that is not 1 2 9 or 10 and end of string

3505633
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function

3505640
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
use the folderbrowserdialog to select a folder or use the savefiledialog to pick an individual file for saving

3505646
stdout	stderr
on a posix system you can use fileno to convert from a stdin stdout stderr to an integer file descriptor

3505657
google-chrome	firefox
the questions can be answered correctly when ie or google-chrome is used but firefox refreshes the page and increments the session variable

3505676
slug	permalinks
each destination permalinks ordered alphabetically by destination slug name

3505698
ninject	spring.net
the windsor container is an inversion of control container like structuremap ninject spring.net or unity

3505716
inherited	properties
i inherited from that class above and in my derived class i do this on my properties

3505718
post	get
since each post or get is mapped to an individual controller and method it becomes less necessary to track things like view state

3505772
post	get
i need nginx to reverse- proxy get and post requests of the form

3505773
put	get
this was put together pretty quick and dirty so you ll want to modify it to suite your needs obviously but hopefully this can get you started in the right direction

3505855
pop-up	dialog
i have a pop-up dialog a div with a high z-index which contains some input elements

3505858
qtcore	qtgui
i have also tried find_package qt4 4.6.2 components qtcore qtgui required

3505864
put	get
i can get the addresses geocoded and put out on the map but i m not able to do it very quickly

3505866
super	extends
i m currently using a different approach in that i ve extracted all the common fields identical column names into an mappedsuperclass and have created two separate classes one for each entity that extends from the super class these classes just have the same fields with different column names where applicable

3505877
printf	strtol
it uses strtol string to long and printf to convert from string to int and back respectively

3505879
free	malloc
additionally c++ s new and delete could actually request a larger amount of memory from malloc and use the extra for book keeping like storing the address of the destructor function and so the pointer you passed to free would not actually be one that was malloc ed

3505894
free	malloc
the standard says you have to match the allocation deallocation function perfectly new - delete - malloc - free

3505894
free	malloc
however may store the number of elements in the allocated chunk of memory in which case the address returned by points inside some block allocated by malloc not to the beginning which means you can t free it with free

3505900
versioning	upgrade
so could i increment the versioning number in the code and then export it to the marketplace and when the user boots up the upgrade versioning for the first time then onupgrade will be called

3505907
tunnel	packets
im creating a program that connects to a proxy and then tunnel to another server to send tcp packets this is my code

another problem i m facing is with this simple js in ie firefox works in google-chrome

3505951
width	height
i needed to give the width and height parameters to

3505952
google-chrome	firefox
also load up firebug firefox developer tools google-chrome ie or fiddler and see what the actual outgoing http request looks like

3505976
children	parent
your change event needs to be on the parent because that s when you want the children to roll up

3505982
qthread	qmutex
i ve been looking into the qmutex class along with qthread s wait function

3505989
width	height
what you want is for your div to use width auto and to dynamically change the height of it to always keep the footer at the bottom of the page

3505995
width	height
you need to specify the width and height in percentage then

3506082
pull	push
i figure there has to be some plumbing command that git uses when determining which objects need to be transferred during a push or pull - i m just not familiar enough with the internals

3506097
alertdialog	progressdialog
progressdialog is an extension of alertdialog so make an alertdialog and set it up manually with your own graphic in the center to spin away while it s loading

3506107
phpunit	simpletest
just found easy to start tutorial about unit testing with php that uses simpletest instead of phpunit

3506150
initializer	class-method
so i m using static class members so i can share data between class-method and static methods of the same class there will only be 1 initializer of the class

3506207
post	put
following convention you should make the route method post rather than put

3506207
post	put
put requests are generally used for updating existing records post for creating new

3506222
pop-up	dialog
edit looks like this behaviour is implemented in silverlight â we can pop-up file dialog open save only by mouse click or other user-initiated action otherwise a securityexception will be thrown

3506229
emacs	aquamacs
you may wish to look into aquamacs which is a further refinement of emacs for os x

3506229
emacs	aquamacs
the emacs wiki page on aquamacs is very helpful

3506233
udp	tcp
extract the udp header assuming the packet isn t fragmented or using tcp

3506388
settings.bundle	plist
but now i see that there s something called settings.bundle that also has a plist in there but some other stuff too

3506414
free	malloc
4 delete and malloc and free and new don t go together

3506455
jboss	weblogic
i found out that liferay sun java system portal server weblogic portal server and jboss portal server should be capable of running google gadgets and i d like to know if this is true

3506461
post	get
at tasks i may be wrong about this name cause i m not using english version of iis mark second option and paste get head post debug

3506497
min	max
that s because oracle requires you to define all the columns not wrapped in an aggregate function min max count etc

3506507
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
start by designing all of your pages on a standards-compliant browser firefox google-chrome safari etc.

3506516
int	boolean
in more recent versions of java the wrapper classes int and float and boolean etc... can auto-box meaning you can do the following

3506529
width	height
you could also use rendertransform.scalex scaley instead of adjusting the height width of the canvas

3506533
google-chrome	firefox
i know all about firefox google-chrome iespell etc

3506541
opera	google-chrome
initial request to a method are around 30ms but over about a half hour i can watch using opera s dragonfly and verified with google-chrome s tools too my request times slowly increase

3506545
implements	extends
in order to do that i would create either an abstract class or an interface depending on the rest of your architecture and then make the words class either extends it or implements

3506546
innodb	myisam
since you re using innodb tables the easiest solution is to create a new myisam table with only the text content and an index to join with the original table this also helps with seek efficiency in some common cases

3506551
free	malloc
wrap new malloc and delete free and bookkeep all allocations deallocations

3506554
iboutlet	ibaction
the problem is when i create iboutlet and ibaction in thirdviewcontroller and go to ib to link them to the things in the third view none of those show up so i can t make the links to the things showing in the view

3506555
valgrind	memcheck
it s worth noting that valgrind memcheck will spot 4 of your items and helgrind may help spot the last data races

3506576
mouseout	mouseleave
i fixed this by removing the collapse on mouseout and then created a mouseout event for the submenu ie when the mouseleave the submenu it collapses

3506598
width	height
i ended up setting the height and width of the body to the height and width of the uiwebview thusly

3506654
getter	setter
age is exposed with a getter and setter

3506666
rss	feed
so i have this program that grabs the rss feed at and displays a list of the available dogs basically filling out each item in a listview with an image of the dog on the left and the headline about the dog on the right

3506760
ant	maven
in other words what i mean is moving from ant to maven to build your test-lib and setting up a multi-modules project

3506762
puts	gets
the way spring does it is there s a service layer that gets its transactional methods wrapped in an interceptor that pulls the connection from the datasource and puts it in a threadlocal variable where the daos can find it

3506768
aggregate-functions	sum
since both methods do the same thing i would like have just one method where i pass the ienumerable and the aggregate-functions sum max as parameters

3506781
strdup	malloc
a solution with strictly c89 without malloc strdup and more flexible for variable input-strings

3506949
implements	extends
public class viewnewsactivity extends activity implements runnable

3506967
nsfilemanager	nstask
for non-blocking io code for nstask nsfilemanager also see the source code of doctor

subtract	add
if i add on to the time it works fine but if i try to subtract it doesn t

3507099
post	put
you can explicitly add a route to accept a users with put to create users but it won t replace the existing post route

3507117
button	checkbox
javascript 1 when the button is clicked it checks if at least one checkbox is selected

3507117
button	checkbox
javascript 2 when any checkbox is checked and update button is clicked check all of them or uncheck all of them if any checkbox is unchecked

3507131
hide	show
when the user starts to type hide the button div and show the text div

3507144
width	height
from delving into the vcl source the only solution i ve been able to find is to override tcustomform s createparams method and change the x y width and height fields of the params parameter but that feels like a hack

3507149
fold	catamorphism
reduce the whole collection down to some single value computing the sum or the average or the standard deviation of a list of football scores in category theory that s called a catamorphism in functional programming it is fold or reduce in smalltalk it s inject into in ruby it s inject and in .net aggregate

3507180
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox works fine opera is great and google-chrome works well also

3507203
int	double
if you need to parse very large numbers larger than int double and don t need the exact value then a simple regex based method might be sufficient

3507204
post	get
is it based on url and http get post requests

3507267
introspection	typechecking
my one-sentence description of why it s an awesome language is that its generic programming compile-time introspection template metaprogramming facilities are good enough to give you almost flexibility of a duck-typed language while its execution speed and static typechecking rival or exceed c++ and c#

3507267
freebsd	linux
cross-platform the reference dmd compiler supports x86 windows linux mac os x and freebsd

3507317
width	height
solved it will resize only if width is larger than 800px or height is larger than 600px

3507318
x86	64bit
build your tool using the x86 platform as opposed to any cpu and it will be loaded as x86 code even on 64bit systems

3507355
hide	show
i m using the animatewindow api to show or hide a form with a slide animation

3507355
hide	show
there s 2 buttons in the main form one to show another form and the other to hide that same form

3507363
dictionary	map
use a dictionary or a hashmap to map the number of points to the string

3507368
sage	maxima
behind the scenes this is really using maxima a component of sage

3507371
subobject	instances
a class instances that is a base of a derived class is sometimes called a base class subobject so in some sense a base class is a distinct part of your derived class

3507384
for-loop	loops
and for the first trial change the code to have a graceful exit which in this case means gracefull continue - have to use for-loop and increments in loops to be able to do continue at all

3507457
iboutlet	ibaction
or you might have unsaved header files with iboutlet and ibaction first try saving those

3507480
min	max
i have a couple of ideas in my head such as finding the difference between the max and min of that list and using that to generate a list of ceilings

3507482
jquery	simplemodal
my c# skills are coming along and i ve written a complete invoicing system in it but i don t know squat about getting this simplemodal or any jquery integrated and working inside asp.net 2008

3507505
min	max
and of course you can always just sort into max - min n for n uniform sized buckets

3507507
post	get
when you change a post a number of objects get fetched into memory to be updated

3507510
inherited	subclassing
different problem than op had but you can also get this error if you try to subclassing from a module instead of a class you try to inherited my.module instead of my.module.class

3507539
uiview	subviews
i have a uilabel that is a subviews of a larger uiview

3507550
public	protected
the solution is to make default qobject constructor protected or public or call other constructor overload from the default chiprojectdata constructor

3507551
post	get
method post and remote true just get squashed on the end of the url instead of actually making it an ajax post

3507555
ceil	floor
and i m currently stumped by how to implement the common rounding functions floor ceil and round to even

3507600
children	parent
but i still get node when accessing children parent and i have to cast it whenever i want to use special functions even in specialnode functions

3507655
children	parent
of course this is assuming that specialnode s always have other specialnode s as parent children

3507656
mouse	keyboard
this allows you to have the window update as you navigate your code via mouse or keyboard and locate all references of any symbol the caret lands upon

3507656
dxcore	coderush
please also keep in mind that coderush is build upon the dxcore a framework which allows users to create their own plugins for use alongside each other and coderush

3507835
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m restyling a button and that includes providing a controltemplate and also adding some triggers for mouseenter and mouseleave

3507855
hide	show
i cant figure out how to hide then show the main form once login has passed

3507878
width	height
and then use width and height to make it bigger or smaller

3507889
children	parent
a child is not a type of parent i certainly hope my children aren t for at least another decade but that s another matter

3507914
width	height
you can set a width and a height on the link in your stylesheet

3507914
google-chrome	firefox
this renders correctly in firefox ie and google-chrome

3507925
hex	binary
i have some binary data in hex editor it looks like

3507948
xts	quantmod
your best bet is to use quantmod and store the results as a time series in this case it will be xts

3507961
width	height
however there s a bug with uiview auto-sizing when the parent view s height width become small and everything breaks when it becomes zero mdash

3507961
width	height
it might just be that uiview height width can t go negative

3507970
free	malloc
he will use malloc and free unsafe pointers and preprocessor to define inline functions

3507978
int	double
for example if you stored the 64-bit pattern for the int 4 into a double you d see 0.0 when you printed it

3508015
post	get
since it is rest based you can do crud from virtually any client that is able to do a http get or post

3508046
ravendb	couchdb
i would possibly consider a different datastore such as couchdb or ravendb

3508052
firefox	safari
i m pretty sure safari has a default left position of auto while firefox gives you a position in pixels

3508065
children	parent
but in order to implement drag and drop i need to get the parent children and the opaque pointer that internalpointer returns

3508082
pascal	delphi
well i think the easier way to perform this may be creating a dll in delphi that detects if your program is running and ask the user to close it put that dll in your setup and use the flag dontcopy check in under pascal scripting using dlls for an example

3508095

3508116
min	max
and what i am attempting to do is for each unique name in the first column retrieve the min value for column 3 and the max value for column 4

3508116
min	max
so the final input will look the same a tab-delimited file except that it will have the 1st 2 columns for each unique name then the 3rd and 4th columns be the min and max values mentioned above

3508137
hash	salt
prepend the password hash with the salt and save it in the password column

3508153
decimal	ieee

3508174
profiling	debugging
if you re using eclipse there s also a profiling suite that s very helpful in debugging and optimisation

3508197
rss	feed
ignore the rss feed

3508230
windows	wow64
wow64 stands for windows 32 on windows 64

3508230
windows	wow64
by the way if you are running the x64 version of windows you can see which processes are running through wow64 because they will have a 32 appended to the process name in the process list

3508231
hash	salt
the point of salt is to thwart rainbow table attacks where the attacker has precomputed the hash of a big number of strings in order to find a reverse correspondence from hash to original string

3508231
hash	salt
it s pointless to prepend the salt to the hash password because the attacker can simply strip the salt

3508231
hash	salt
store a hash of the salt+password together with the salt

3508233
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome but not on ie

3508239
teamcity	nant
i have a set of simple wix 3.5 installers developed using votive that i can compile happily in vs2010 but when i try to compile them via nant and msbuild on teamcity teamcity - nant - msbuild - wix i get the following error

3508241
x86	64bit
the cross-compiler is meant to run on x86 machines even though it will run on a 64bit copy of windows via wow

3508244
post	get
also you don t specify whether this edit action is get or post but i assume it is get

3508244
post	get
most commonly the get methods use parameters of type string or int most likely those are slugs or ids of somekind and post methos use parameters of type viewmodel not entity

3508316
prng	random
this is very close to a real random number generator where as dev urandom can be generated by a prng if the entropy pool runs dry

3508323
put	get
if there s a specific value you want to get in your script put in the full oid identifying the target

3508333

i seem to be stuck though with having to first applying the read.zoo method to create a zoo objects before being able to convert it to an xts object

3508353
postgresql	mysql
i have to say i don t know a thing about ms access but if it s anything like mysql postgresql oracle then for the object-relational mapping i d go with hibernate the basics are really really simple and adding users books finding them according to some criteria etc

3508369
int	chars
what i don t understand is why a chars array is treated somewhat different from say int and gets destroyed when you exit the function

3508374
public	protected
you have access to this classes and their public members or functions or even protected if the class where you are referring to them is in the same package

3508391
public	protected
by extending them you can keep a method signature thats its accessor public protected etc return type void int someobject etc and its parameters but make it act completely different

3508391
public	protected
that is you write your own class and inherit all of the public protected method of the upper class

3508412
subtract	add
this class has public methods that add subtract and report the balance of euros and pounds

3508415
opera	google-chrome
the problem that i am having is that both opera and google-chrome don t display this the way i expect

3508462
pop-up	dialog
note that the dialog will not be able to display pop-up windows because in this case it is itself effectively a pop-up window

3508463
pop-up	dialog
the greasemonkey install dialog should pop-up

3508479
min	max
function compute_box line 408 in geocell.py takes the cell as an argument and returns the corresponding instance of geotypes.box -- an object with attributes east west south north corresponding to the min and max lat long of the cell

i m relatively new to programming in general so be gentle | i m trying to start a new activity from a basic one that displays a couple of text inputs a checkbox and a button

3508565
rss	feed
i have created a cron job to scan rss atom feed but want to know if there is a timeout on this

3508576
pull	push
as for during push and fetch pull those are implemented in c so they re not directly calling any exposed plumbing commands

i was able to build gcc 4.5.1 on macos x 10.6.4 recently but i built and installed the gmp mpfr and mpc libraries myself - in usr gnu64 a non-standard location that i use for stuff that i install for my own benefit

3508591
mpfr	mpc
i had similar problems on linux plus a problem with a regex in opt-functions.awk - easily fixed with two back-slashes in front of an open brace and found that there were updates to the mpfr and mpc libraries since i built on macos x

try looking up the stl design of allocator

3509536
udp	tcp
the posix c api is fairly portable the gnu libc documentation provides examples of udp and tcp clients and servers that i usually turn to when i m scratching together another server or you could use the boost.asio library for a more c++ experience..

3509553
hide	show
just call hide_spines before show and it will hide them in all of the figures that show displays

3509578
serializable	deserialization
when serializing i d use ntohs htons or ntohl htonl see their man pages to always make sure the serializable is in network byte order and the deserialization is in host byte order

3509635
put	get
this works just fine the first time that i put in the info but if i try to edit the order the total_price doesn t get updated because update_total_price doesn t get called because self.saved is not nil

3509648
profiling	debugging
if you need it temporarily for debugging purposes you could use sql profiling

3509755
post	get
i see that there is already some great advice and methods suggest for how to get the post back control

3509775
filtering	grouping
i think it would be easier if you were to include the grouping in an extra column of sheet1 and then you could use pivot tables for sheets 2 3 to show filtering views of the underlying data

3509783
children	parent
my tree class stores a value parameter a parent reference and a list of children

3509793

the height and width of these tiles is arbirary as long as the area constraints are met and the tiles need not all be the same size

3510060
powerpc	i386
library frameworks python.framework versions 2.6 bin python is typically the path to the python.org installer python or possibly other non-apple python which indeed includes only 32-bit architectures powerpc and i386

the apple-supplied python 2.6 in 10.6 is built using a 10.6 sdk and includes 32-bit and 64-bit archs i386 x86_64 and powerpc for compatibility

3510075
websphere	ibm
the ibm websphere application engine service was configured to be started by the local system so the wasservice.exe and the java.exe services are started by the local system and when jacob runs and calls msword.exe the msword.exe started by local system also till now everything is ok but since i was invoking the applypolicy method which apply the rms on the document so the msword.exe was trying to apply policy using local system and that is wrong because when you are trying to apply rms you must apply it by the user you logged by it to the system domain user which can apply the rms policy over a document

3510075
websphere	ibm
so to solve the problem i changed the user who is responsible for running the ibm websphere application engine service from local system to real domain user go to run - services.exe search for ibm service and changed the logon user and everything is ok now

uicontrol	uibutton
these are defined on uibutton s ancestor uicontrol

3510137
int	double
int float or double of the

3510195
free	malloc
when malloc doesn t have enough free memory in its reserve pool to satisfy an allocation it grabs pages from the kernel in chunks of at least 4 kb and often much larger so you re probably writing into reserved but un-malloc ed space when you initially exceed the bounds of your allocation which is why your test case always works

3510250
addclass	removeclass
i want to animate addclass and removeclass on this interface that i ve made

3510281
chmod	mkdir
the way to do it is to use mkdir 2 to create the folder populate it with the files you want it to have use stat 2 to get the current permissions mask out the write bits then use chmod 2 to set the permissions

3510329
width	height
want to get width of this image to and height to

3510334
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
instead use fileinputstream and fileoutputstream wrapped in an inputstreamreader and outputstreamwriter respectively

3510392
width	height
however both the width and height values you specify may be adjusted to ensure the popup fits on screen and is not covered by the keyboard

3510430
width	height	width	margin	width	font-size	margin	height	margin	font-size
note when copying the text from the textarea to the div make sure to copy relevant css properties that may affect the offset width height padding margin border font-size line-height etc.

prepare	execute
the query only needs to be parsed or prepare once but can be execute multiple times with the same or different parameters

3510565
public	protected
i found out that object constants in php always have public visibility so it is not possible to set them to protected or private like this

3510640
google-chrome	firefox
maybe in firefox and google-chrome the selection change event leaks trough to the div but in ie it doesn t

3510647

if other modules only write to cout stdout logger should write to cerr stderr

3510680
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got a jquery function that s posting to the server using .ajax and it works fine in ie google-chrome and safari but in firefox no post values are being received by the server

3510684
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

3510684
accessor	properties
the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

3510684
getter	setter
essentially its simpler syntax for declaring properties that have simple getter and setter

3510687
post	get
session id s should always be passed using cookie and never passed as get or post

3510700
getter	setter
you can mix and match different visibility levels of the getter setter too as long as you still obey the same rules as traditional properties

3510709
hide	show
and show hide enable disable components based on state of checkbox

3510759
free	malloc
when i used to work intensively on c c++ at work we used rational purify that in practice replace the standard malloc new in c++ and free delete in c++ and it is able to return quite accurate report on where the program did something it was not supposed

3510774
screens	hdpi
you only need to use hdpi if you want to provide different assets for different screens densities

3510783
accessor	properties
if i have an accessor and default properties in a base class as follows

3510867
button	checkbox
i need to check whether a specific area is a checkbox radio button or text field

3510867
button	checkbox
if its a checkbox or radio button it doesnt have a length no strings in it otherwise if its a textfield i need to check whether or not it contains characters

3510887
int	chars
it s used to specify that a string value of len value chars is to be packed after those two int

3510947
put	get
however if the pages are going to disappear after the match then i wouldn t put them on the site map as they may get indexed then disappear which may have a negative impact on your search engine rankings

3510954
mri	rubinius
be sure to use a ruby implementation which can actually execute parallel threads not all of them can mri yarv and rubinius can t for example.

3510970
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchescancelled	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchescancelled
i am using touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended and touchescancelled in the view below

3511001
rel	attr
even if you have more than one element the attr method will return the desired attribute for the firsts known element so perhaps your .jstree-clicked class exists elsewhere without a rel attribute

3511004
min	max
min index to max index

3511031
for-loop	loops
to visualize these things expand the for-loop to a while loops

3511117
silverstripe	kohana
drupal kohana or silverstripe

3511120
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
i prefer to use immutable objects for passing the data around in the application instead of using objects with mutators setter and getter also called javabeans

3511124
realloc	malloc
edit besides most malloc reserve bigger chunks than asked for to avoid to many copy operations when calling realloc

3511128
pdfsharp	migradoc
migradoc pdfsharp requires x

3511128
sharppdf	migradoc	itextsharp	migradoc	itextsharp	sharppdf
the test code used for itextsharp which produces errors on my testserver is listed below the code for migradoc and sharppdf is just as simple

3511133
hide	show
anyway what this code does is it hide show the province input when the option selected is usa notusa

3511133
hide	show
partially because the input show and then hide in 1 or so seconds

3511150
modifiers	sealed
i think sealed should be included in the list of access modifiers in c# language

3511153
rdf	owl
xml processing programming language compilation and rdf owl triple stores spring to mind as applications where interning is likely to be beneficial

3511179
opera	firefox
i need to display the newly generated excel from tables using apache poi in a web browser whatever it is firefox opera or ie

3511204
equals	tostring
java.util.arrays - has many array-related utility methods like equals tostring etc

3511215
modifiers	sealed
properly said you still need to add an access modifiers if you use the sealed keyword unless the default access modifiers suits you

3511215
modifiers	sealed
the sealed keyword is called the sealed modifiers because it modifies a class or method to be sealed off

3511215
modifiers	sealed
this is like a boolean switch a class or method is either sealed or it is not regardless of its access modifiers

3511277
modifiers	sealed
all the following valid class definitions feature sealed classes but they all have different levels of access so you can see that sealed isn t an access modifiers and hence isn t listed as one by microsoft

3511287
min	max
the condition on the min and max areas is necessary for this to work

3511321
prng	random
windows uses microsoft crypto api capi when the dev random string is used to state the required prng source the securerandom.source property in the jre_home lib security java.security file

3511327
children	parent
you can give it a try here this crawls the parent and removes the class from their children when entering and restores it when leaving give the demo a try i think this is what you re after

3511363
put	get
get xml nodes number then loop through xml and read each node element then put it in the array

3511388
inherited	properties
i am binding the datagrid s itemssource to an observablecollection of type rowviewmodel which is inherited from dr.wpf s observabledictonary of type cellviewmodel and i want bind to a properties of a cellviewmodel

3511388
converter	multibinding
certainly the multibinding is never set here since the converter is never called checking in debug

3511394
post	get
maybe you should post the error message the generator produces so we can get that error out of the way

3511405
google-chrome	firefox
i need to make a web app that i would be able to install as a desktop application on a client pc database jetty+war firefox google-chrome sth portable

3511414
uiview	subviews	move	drag
the idea behind it is as you touch an object you can create an uiimageview that represents it maybe semi-transparent like drag drop on the desktop works add it on the main uiview as a subviews and move it around by intercepting the dragging in the touchesmoved withevent method

3511454
listview	gridview
background i m populating lots of asp.net c# gridview and listview from a database and subsequently users may export them to excel

3511486
min	max
i use a hash-of-hashes to store the min and max information because it makes the code more declarative and because it s flexible

3511501
decimal	ieee
though note that exactly what form the decimal strings are allowed to take is outside the scope of ieee 754

3511501
decimal	ieee
the current version of ieee 754 seems to be a bit different in this respect judging by the publicly available draft version version 1.2.5 it just requires each implementation to specify bounds -î î on the exponent of the decimal string with î large enough to accomodate the decimal strings corresponding to finite binary values in the largest supported binary format

3511541
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
change width and height to actualwidth and actualheight

3511541
width	height
line polygon etc which are defined via points have undefined width and height

3511541
actualheight	actualwidth
when rendering to a bitmap you should use actualwidth and actualheight

3511548
getter	setter
exposing the guts of objects via getter and setter should probably not be the default choice

3511561
mef	prism
the latest prism 4 went to beta on august 2nd and now adds mef support managed extensibility framework to the other features pl mentions

3511619
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
as for micro-optimizations whenever you know that an integer is divisible by some quotient then it is possible to replace the division by a multiplication with the inverse of the quotient modulo 2 64

3511623
google-chrome	firefox
as alopix mentioned you can use the html5 event onhashchange for ie8+ google-chrome 5+ and firefox 3.6+

3511682
stdout	stderr
someone told me that whenever a c++ program is run three files stdin stdout and stderr are opened and he gave this link in his support

3511710
stdout	stderr
if you are asking if these files actually exists somewhere have a look at dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr

3511816
stdout	stderr
examples of special files on windows are the standard streams stdout stdin and stderr as well as serial ports like comn which can be opened with openfile

3511853
min	max
but this gives the same recursive condition except that we pass along the max and min of those items we ve already selected to throw into the mix instead of adding a constraint on i2 or whichever other variable s turn it is

3511888
chown	chmod
so i guess doing a chown and chmod on your archive after creating it will prevent unwanted users from accessing the file if all you need is a file that can only be read by a certain group

3511922
debian	linux
update3 target platform is linux debian on x86

3511930
width	margin
wrap it in a another and give the parent a width 100 property and the child a margin 40px

3511942
jboss	glassfish
i m developing j2ee app on glassfish v3 which will remotely call ejb deployed on jboss 5 app server

3512079
width	height
you need to find the greatest common divisor and divide width and height by it

3512231
portrait	landscape
if your only interest is your interface orientation ie landscape or portrait orientation of the device you should not use uidevice orientation or the uideviceorientation constants if you will but rather use the uiapplication statusbarorientation which uses the uiinterfaceorientation constants

3512233
jung	jgraph
here a few more jung gvf jgraph

3512258
firefox	safari
in my friends firefox and safari everything is smooth

3512286
postgresql	mysql
i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

3512320
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
if you replace nsmanagedobject by nsobject in piece and player and you still get the issue it might be worth reporting a bug to apple

3512333
jobs	cron
my plan is to write a bash script and run it in cron jobs when it finds the system is idle then it starts a process the process which will download the big files preferably wget automatically and when i use the laptop then the process is killed

3512333
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux is there a way to find proper idle time of a linux mahine

3512333
mouse	keyboard
idle no keyboard touch pad or mouse clicks

3512339
post	get
note that the above applies on post requests only i expect you re using post here for get request parameters you need to configure it in the servletcontainer level

3512368
post	get
on powerup sometimes it takes 3 to 5 seconds to get the active data connection on phone when this happens service fails to do http post as there is no data connection

3512386

3512461
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
specifically an interface with a uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller both present in the view

3512510
keydown	keyup
schoolboy error - i was so focused on keydown that i forgot i could use keyup instead.

3512555
ati	nvidia
or you could force antialiasing for all opengl programs with nvidia or ati tools.

3512572
resharper	justcode
i only installed resharper 5 about three hours ago - guess that didnt last long - back to telerik justcode p

3512593
children	parent
attributes never have children and their parent is the containing element

3512605
int	double
i made my own point class because the system.drawing.point uses int when i needed double

3512613
distance	polygons
you can generate thin screen-oriented polygons instead and set the fragment s alpha according to the distance to the line

3512633
ant	maven
you should use build tools like maven or ant for such tasks

3512652
post	get
i check the response xml but didn t found any way how to post my id and get it back

3512695

i am trying to upgrade jackrabbit versioning in my project from 1.6 to 2.1.1

3512737
move	drag
currently when i drag a rectangle inside of the first canvas it also move the rectangle in the second canvas

3512737
move	drag
what i want to do is when i drag rectangle a to the left rectangle b move to the right and vice versa etc

3512742
daemons	systemd
since being a daemons over time it may walk the systemd into a corner.

3512815
int	chars
so array i is pushed as chars and handled by printf as int

3512817
google-chrome	firefox
the code works as it should in firefox and google-chrome

3512817
google-chrome	firefox
there are no errors in firefox or google-chrome just ie

3512824
parentviewcontroller	pushviewcontroller
you ll receive a warning because parentviewcontroller may not respond to pushviewcontroller animated but with a nslog you ll see that your parentviewcontroller is actually a uinavigationcontroller

3512828
int	chars
the problem is not memcpy unless your chars type really is 32 bits rather than 8 it looks more like int sign extension while printing

3512836
opera	firefox
firefox somehow doesn t seem to have a problem with those numbers though and i don t get them at all in opera so i m not sure what your php script is doing there

3512838
int	chars
you should mask off the higher bits since your chars will be extended to int size when calling a varargs function

3512855
ostringstream	std
it attempts to use a std ostringstream to convert the value to a std string using the formatting conversions supplied by output streams

3512859
equals	tostring
tostring on both guid s they were equals thats odd

3512881
int	chars
when passed to printf the chars are promoted to int types which effectively means a sign extension

3512881
hex	binary
as the value was only slightly negative coming from a narrow signed type post conversion the value is close to the maximum possible unsigned int value it has many leading 1 s in binary or leading f in hex

there will be 1-3 children rows for each parent row

3512948
put	get	children	parent
i would like to get all of the children information with the parent information in one row when exporting the data from the database so it can be put into a csv file

3512970
post	get
scott guthrie has a blog post that describes how to get linq to sql to work with stored procedures

3513062
children	parent
since there is a variable number of children per parent the only way it can be done in sql is presenting all gifts semicolon separated in a single record

3513074
min	max
note that this could result in an infinite loop if you provide a min and max that force mt_rand to return an exception character

3513083
yacc	bison
the classical approach would be to use bison yacc for as a lexer respectively parser and many newer tools are currently available like antlr

so put margin true and use your css to make sure that the margin-left on each item corresponds to the width that will enable your item to be centered

3513260
fflush	gets
both sides of the fork inherit the unflushed buffer so when each side of the fork hits the return statement and ends it gets fflush twice

3513260
stdout	fflush
before you fork you should fflush stdout

3513261
min	max
the simplest solution would be to just search for a random number from min to max - number of exceptions

3513265
rss	feed
you can see an example using a combination of superfeedr and kwwika within a web application that lets you subscribe to any rss feed or track keywords within rss feed here

3513268
junit	testng
you can use testng instead of junit which doesn t care about the method being private or public

same here goes for flagfrag which should be unsigned short

3513362
int	chars
the standard does not require the compiler to pack the bit fields into a single storage unit int chars whatever

3513362
int	chars
so even with the pragma i would expect those 2 bitfields to take up 2 chars or int

3513370
codeigniter	cakephp
use a php framework such as cakephp codeigniter etc

3513371
post	put
but you have to put the following in your application_controller to access the facebook_session this was non-obvious and only discovered from another person s obscure post

3513372
int	chars
your #pragma pack directive is right but i think the underlying type of your bifields verlen and flagfrag are int instead of the chars and short you were expecting

hide	show
a quick test with slightly modified code show that a variable hide the struct by the same name

3513565
width	height
i m a bit unclear on some of your input parameters but i m assuming that you have rectangle height and width the number of rectangles and the ideal height-width ratio ie preferred gridheight gridwidth

3513565
width	height
if this is the case then i d probably start off by normalizing your dimensions so for the purpose of the following calculations we say a unit of width is the same as the width of a rectangle and likewise for a unit of height

3513565
width	height
if your height width ratio in real units was k then your height width ratio in rectange units would be k rectwidth rectheight

3513565
width	height
we can then approximate our height add width to give ourselves our preferred grid aspect ratio by saying gridheight gridwidth n and gridheight gridwidth k

3513565
width	height
required final grid aspect ratio 1024 768 k assumes that 768 is width and 1024 is height - i kept wanting to put it the other way around as a standard screen resolution

3513565
width	height
looking at this we can see intuitively that width 5 and height 20 will be our best match

3513565
width	height
but that will waste more space i think possibly actually minimizing the product of the width and height here migth be the best calculation but i m not sure

3513582

subtract	add
then write mutators to add or subtract one from the value represented by the object and handle carrying between fields and an accessor that allows you to check if the value is zero

3513916
subtract	add
then have a loop where you subtract one from the input number and add one to the output number until the input number reaches zero

3513932
client-side	server-side
the trick however is that silverlight is a client technology so the server-side piece would house all that shared logic and you d need to then interface that through a web-service your client could talk to but that goes without saying when it comes to silverlight client-side technologies

3513934

i knew that editor would play important role in my daily work that s why i have invested close to the week of my spare time to learn both vim and emacs

3521006
post	get

post	get
this question is not about when to use get or post in general

3521290
post	get
i have found plenty of information on the differences between get and post in the general sense but i did not find a definite answer for this particular scenario

3521290
post	get
as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post

3521290
post	get
everything i have read so far suggest that post should be used for destructive actions whereas actions that do not alter the internal state of the application -like querying and such- should be handled with get

3521328
post	get
to be correct get post or other verbs are actions on some resource addressed by url - so its generally about resource s state and not about application state as such

3521335
primefaces	richfaces
for example richfaces and primefaces can also be done ajaxical

3521347

however other application issues might prefer get over post for some state-changing requests and i do not think there is any problem with this

3521384
installation	upgrade
clarification we upgrade office installation to 2007 but the application still uses hssf and xls format

3521391

put	get
from this you should be able to get the distance between each of your zipcodes and put them into a table then you can do searches on just these

3521572
serializable	deserialization
better idea is either copy constructor as bloch recommends or serializable and deserialization via xml for example

3523501
superclass	subclassing
if for some reason this all-around-win solution is not available to you there are hacks and tricks subclassing pickle.pickler use directly an instance of your subclassing rather than the base one as pickle.dumps does override the save method so it traces the type obj before delegating to the superclass but upgrading to the right most up-to-date protocol -1 is guaranteed to be on any given python version the most advanced one that version supports would be a good idea anyway if at all feasible

3523529
put	get
also i ve been unsuccessfully reading about ways to do this and i get the impression i might have to have the publisher put a new snapshot on all the subscribers systems to do this

3524180
sorting	grouping
this would make it easier to show warnings and errors different than other things you could use collectionviewsource for sorting and grouping etc

3524629
gridview	detailsview
a master page shows a gridview of database records and clicking on edit for a given row brings up an edit form with a detailsview

3524652
int	chars
if an int parameter costs 3 instructions and a chars parameter costs 1 you could pass an extra chars parameter for the extra 1 bit you re missing

3524795
jstl	taglib
to be clear using jstl instead of scriptlets is perfectly fine you should only avoid the sql and xml taglib as they are intented for quick prototyping only

3524817
google-chrome	firefox
this problem doesn t come in firefox and google-chrome

3524873
ant	maven
i use a project building tool like ant or maven to make some very specific steps of my build like your o or d tasks for example

3524900
tabcontrol	tabitem
i am creating a sl app that has a tabcontrol with dynamically created tabitem which are added via code behind

3524900
tabcontrol	tabitem
i d like said tabitem to size proportionally to the tabcontrol full width much like what is described here

3524975
post	get
i have a page that does a json result get and post method in the controller with two submit buttons

3524975
post	get
my variables that usually get picked up on a get post function is gone

3524984
put	get	post	put	post	get
utilize rest http verbs get put post delete

3524992
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the ads show on all other browsers i tried ie firefox opera but google-chrome

3524995
actualheight	actualwidth
unless i am mistaken the actualheight and actualwidth properties as they normally mean in wpf are not dp s and you cannot bind to them

3525054
stdout	stderr
the only take the output on stdout not on stderr

3525066
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can use onkeypress onkeyup and onkeydown events for this

3525106
folder	directory
since themes and plugins in the deployed hierarchy contain files and folder in addition to my custom code i added this other stuff to the ignore property of these two directory

3525193
union	distinct
when a union distinct which is the same as union is performed the temporary table is created with an index so that duplicates can be removed

3525201
margin	height
the top margin can be the height of the entire box

3525206
width	height
it may be because i need to have the width and height properties specified in my css first

3525228
infobox	infowindow
then in turn on clicking them i open up an infobox as a infowindow replacement

3525229
getter	setter
it might be the case that you need to use thread.memorybarrier at the start of the getter and at the end of the setter to ensure that readers only see completely initialized arrays

3525231
switching	screens
for example i have ctrl + mapped to switching screens so i d send that and then windows key + up to do it

3525244
children	parent
not only you don t have to tell your user s browser to make another request you also don t need to keep track of everywhere in the code where you delete children so you don t end up with hanging parent

3525247
gridview	detailsview
i figured out how to do this using gridview and then render a detailsview depending on what you click in the grid but it s so ugly

3525289
openrowset	openquery
also i want to avoid adding . as linked server just to make openquery and openrowset work anyhow

3525292
multiplying	add
on the next iteration multiplying by ten and add the next number in the series

3525297
hide	show
i use this quick snippet with an image to close a show hide div

3525320
post	get

3525365
profiling	debugging
profiling in debugging mode is often of very limited relevance to real-world performance

3525382
mvp	presenter
we are using a simple mvp architecture for our site with a view layer asp.net website presenter layer c# class library logic layer c# class library data layer c# class library

3525390
maven	pom.xml
maven s super pom.xml has snapshot s

3525401
google-chrome	firefox
on this site the rotating flash banner at the top works fine in ie and google-chrome but when opened in firefox it doesn t load the picture or advance automatically

3525405
public	protected
do you have a good rule of thumb as to when a field absolutely must be private and when is it maybe okay to mark it protected or public

3525415
int	chars
as an alternative to using int to contain the result you might want to use a chars buffer appending the loop index

3525420
springsource	grails
i installed the jquery and jquery-ui plugins for grails into springsource tool suite sts-eclipse following the documentation located at and using the grails command-line tool included with sts-eclipse as follows

3525444
union	distinct
and if you re searching for distinct rows doing a union instead of a union all will accomplish that thanks to jeffrey l whitledge for pointing this out

3525464
pop-up	dialog
when i press ctrl+shift+t dialog for file search pop-up i find file i m interested in and when i press enter - if file is .resx or .dbml - it s opens in text editor

3525470
put	get
so i want to create a class cachablerepository that will accept parameters check if object for them is cached already if not - get data from db and put to cache

3525498
width	height
at the same time i want to let the user have arbitrary big size and let the components have equal share of the width and height

3525515
apache	nginx
i tried your tests using apache yaws and nginx as the webservers and found very little variation run with and without the proxy with any of them

3525598
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover mouseout are there to prevent the onblur to fire when the user click an item in the menu

3525629
public	protected
when you make a field public or even protected you are effectively declaring it as part of the interface

3525629
getter	setter
and in the cases where you find you need any of that validation later you can t just convert a field to a getter setter without breaking binary compatibility meaning anyone who used your code will have to recompile everything that used that field in order for it to work again

3525629
getter	setter
getter and setter separate the implementation from the interface

3525629
getter	setter
so if you write code that will ever be used after you write it non-trivial getter and setter that validate the value maybe synchronize etc -- ie do more than just blindly get and set a variable are a good idea

3525675
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
internet explorer 5 and up firefox safari opera and more

3525697
mef	prism
although there is a learning curve i would look at silverlight mef or prism both are together at last in the latest prism 4 beta

3525716
mouseup	mousedown
in one of my tstringgrid-based controls i am using mousedown mouseup event to handle that pop-up menu because i have two different contextual menus depending on which area of tstringgrid you ve clicked

3525733
puts	gets
the ajax requests are a mix of puts and gets using syntax like

3525765
getter	setter
i am being told that all the data should be private and protected getter setter used only

3525765
public	protected
i have looked at java protected fields vs public getters java protected fields vs public getters but i still am dubious that

3525765
children	parent
i am just not seeing the down side when the abstract class is there precisely to provide parent common facility to the children classes and the protected scope is meant to provide access to children while protecting the data from casual users

3525765
children	parent
i am trying to focus my question specifically on data existing in an abstract parent intended for use by the children

3525795
getter	setter
if the field is private and access is through getter and setter you will be able to reimplement getter and setter for instance dropping the field and updating reading the value from an external source and thus change how the field works without touching any child classes

3525804
public	protected
think of protected methods as an interface for subclasses in the same way that public methods are an interface for everyone else

3525804
subclass	accessor
providing accessor enables the base class to maintain its state there s no way a subclass would corrupt it without an intentional trick

3525822
switching	screens
i like to switching between the new full screens and old delphi-7-like ide

3525831
getter	setter
if someone subclasses your class and puts the subclass in the same package as your current class they may want to override your getter and setter

3525831
getter	setter
the convention is that there are getter and setter for everything though

3525838
unsigned	short
i use typedef const unsigned short lpcwstr

3525864
versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade our php and apache versioning on our server

3526021
post	get
i ve had to stray off the path of the tutorial several times to get things to work under mono including using a patched version of mvc 2 that i would link to but i am unable to as new users can only post one hyperlink but there s one problem that i haven t been able to fix form validation

3526048
post	get
i would like to get similiar behaviour as spring message tag post message code and get string representation on localized message

3526061
getter	setter
the void createfieldfortype typebuilder typebuilder type fieldtype string fieldname method basically creates a private field and then a public property annotated with datamemberattribute with a public getter and setter

3526103
try-catch	exception-handling
if-else is faster because a try-catch block raises an exception-handling stack trace

3526103
try-catch	exception-handling
you can take it as the if-else block is executing one instruction to do the evaluation but the try-catch will run thousands of instructions to raise the exception-handling when it happens

3526126
formview	entitydatasource
this button updates an entitydatasource that is bound to the formview

3526126

in conjunction with ecb i used cscope for emacs since you mentioned in for vim you ll probably want to use it in emacs as well

3526276
vb6	vba
i m developing a vb6 standalone application that i d like to be able to call from vba modules running in excel outlook etc

3526276
vb6	vba
ideally i d like the vba module to check whether the vb6 application is already running if not open it then populate certain controls textbox listbox etc in the vb6 application with information from the vba module

3526284
calloc	malloc
one may not safely assume anything about the relative addresses of things in the stack relative to those on the heap nor for that matter the relative addresses of any pointers that are not all derived from the same array or allocated via malloc calloc etc. block

3526299
subtract	add
for example say i had a vector class template with methods for vector operations add subtract dot etc.

3526338
for-loop	loops
in your inner for-loop you are using values of buffer which have not yet been set by your outer loops

3526379
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller

lisp	scheme
i am an intermediate programmer and have decided to learn either common lisp or scheme

3526528
lisp	scheme
common lisp is a lot more useful but scheme is a lot cleaner

3526534
google-chrome	firefox
when i open the page in firefox or google-chrome the data displays just fine

3526596
lisp	scheme
my impression common lisp is more for getting stuff done scheme is more for education and fun

3526619
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it is correct on firefox google-chrome opera safari and ie8

3526645
lisp	scheme
if you just want to learn and play around with a lisp or even build moderately complex programs i d say scheme is probably a better bet

3526645
lisp	scheme
if you just want to dip your toes in the pool of lisp i d say scheme is your best bet

3526659
mamp	wamp
nowadays when running wamp or mamp or the default web server on a mac whenever there is error from the cgi file such as ruby or php the error message is not shown and no line number either

3526659
mamp	wamp
maybe it is a little different in other mamp or wamp platforms

3526664
addition	multiplication
however any given step of an operation can overflow so you really need to check every addition and multiplication before it happens at the machine level rather than the algorithm level

3526695
unsigned	short
the problem was with the delete call in tcpserver shutdown unsigned short which was causing a memory access violation in a completely different part of the code.

3526783
scheme	racket
if you want to look at scheme i recommend plt racket

3526811
width	height
i don t think you can specify minimal height width of controls in layoutcontrol

3526811
versioning	upgrade
and speaking of versioning i would recommend you upgrade to latest build and try the layoutcontrol v2 which has some additional features compared to v1 such as support for splitters and tabs

3526819
arp	udp	arp	tcp	igmp	arp	igmp	udp	igmp	tcp	udp	tcp
they re not tcp or udp or ip or igmp or arp or whatever - they re a home-brewed format given unto me by the hardware guys

if this works on landscape left or you get a variation that works on landscape left please post it

3526834
getter	setter
method calls are expensive but i still have no idea how to restructure my current code without getter and setter

3526840
borderless	panel
don t know about devices for the home use market. sometimes you have to enable that borderless mode with a separate switch in the driver settings sometimes also on the device itself front panel or web interface

3526849
getter	setter
in other words avoid using getter setter in the same class as where they re definied

3526856
getter	setter
just don t use the getter or setter for x and y

3526876

3527431
keydown	keyup
try using keyup or keydown like this

3527431

lapply	tapply	tapply	rollapply
i ve read that maybe tapply lapply plyr cut or rollapply could do it but i couldn t get them to work

3527510
x86	64bit
it will probably run but it won t take advantage of any of the features the 64bit extensions to x86 asm provide x86-64 which is what all 64bit versions of windows are or be able to tightly interop with x64 libraries

3527511
x86	64bit
however if you have to port the code to 64bit x86 chances are that the assembly code won t run and might not even compile out of the box

3527556
cfstring	nsstring
when it does you might decide to use cfstring instead of nsstring and ivar access instead of property access and function calls instead of class methods

3527557
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
just so you know it works fine in firefox but not google-chrome or most importantly mobile safari

3527572

3527793
mouseleave	mousedown	mouseleave	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mousedown	mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mouseenter
the most commmon events would be click mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseenter mouseleave but it just depends what you want to do

3527798
filtering	grouping
the other option would be to put the grouping filtering on each page

3527798
filtering	grouping
so for example on team index view you would have a grouping drop down to filtering the data

google-chrome	firefox
a site works fine with google-chrome firefox ie8 but does not work with ie7 i do not care about ie6

3528194
stdout	stderr

3528427
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in ie7 firefox and google-chrome but certainly not in ie6

3528429
post	get
and look at the one with url post postdata and cookiesfiles which is for .jar which you get then retrieve and that you can use file_get_contents to send the data using get

3528493
width	height
this is like using an image or grid but since a canvas has no fixed size you need to specify the height and width unless these are already set by the svg converter

3528515

innodb	myisam
with anything from 100 s to 1000 s of concurrent read write requests think typical oltp usage innodb will out perform myisam hands down

3533390
innodb	myisam
it s not about other people s observations it s not about transactional acid support it s about the architecture of innodb which is far superior to that of the legacy myisam engine

3533390
innodb	myisam
additionally innodb has row level locking which is far more performant under concurrent load than myisam table level locking

3533408

3534343
cassini	iis
the best bet seems to be to move to iis express if you can since that can use the same url rewriting module as real iis and should also have fewer other bug-causing differences than cassini has

3534343
cassini	iis
that s a .net httpmodule so it ll work on either cassini or iis

textblock	itemscontrol
my problem is that in code i need to be able to determine the width of the textblock or whatever the element is if i change it later in the itemscontrol

3534527

3535349
stdout	stderr
the special aspect of file descriptor 3 is that it will usually be the first file descriptor returned from a system call that allocates a new file descriptor given that 0 1 and 2 are usually set up for stdin stdout and stderr

3535373
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the way we have implemented the processing graphic and ajax calls has worked fine in firefox opera and ie the problem is with safari and chrome.

3535527
put	get
you probably don t need but i put it in because you might have put your alloc-init stuff in because you sometimes get a nil value here

3535546
spaces	delimiter
it s difficult to read text strings that contain spaces because fscanf sees spaces characters as field delimiter

3535626
min	max
note that the values are floats and must be constrained to min and max values supplied in the function argument

3535670
apache	nginx
and later a couple of years ago around 2010 installing redhat and ubuntu 64 bits on several production servers to run apache nginx mysql php was still a bit worrying

3535696
ubuntu	linux
kompozer also available in the ubuntu repository is one of the few wysiwyg html editors for linux i know of

3535753

in the above example error.apply also error.call doesn t do anything for me firefox 3.6 google-chrome 5

3535788
firefox	safari
anywho i thought all was working because they work fine in safari firefox and ie8

3535789
translation	localization
as example it could be a possible security risk if the string is pulled from a localization database or could contain user input and it mixes program logic and translation as you will have to take care of the strings used in the program

3535818
put	get	post	put	post	get
get and post work fine against this url but put and delete result in http 501 not implemented

3535855
int	double
i will only be using types that allow comparisons int double decimals etc

3535868
icomparable	compareto
all of your types implement icomparable of t so you ll need to add this constraint to your generic type definition and replace comparison operators with compareto calls

3535873
postgresql	mysql
granted i have a mysql background and am not that familiar with postgresql

3535894
width	height
the harder stuff was to get the zoomed picture show the exact location the mouse is pointing to.the formula is - amount of px from left top to the zoom div + mouse coordinates 2 + half of the zoom div width height

3535900
puts	gets
again i m going off memory and we only implemented gets and posts so i didn t deal with puts and deletes so i hope i m getting this right

3535902
google-chrome	firefox
i have created a drop down menu with css which works great in firefox google-chrome and ie8 but fails when when in ie8 compatibility mode

3535913
hash	md5
i have a table that contains a few columns and one of them is an md5 hash which is a unique key in the table

hash	md5
well md5 hash have 128bit binary

3536007
innodb	myisam
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

3536007
hash	md5
if you now check for an md5 hash in the database you exactly know which server to look on and vice versa where to store it

3536043
width	height
you can also at this time query the status bar navigation bar and toolbar for their sizes and get the correct post-rotation values although the status bar width and height may be swapped--i just take the smaller value as the height works great

3536054
put	get
perhaps put in a date also and delete after 10 days in case any rows get left behind

3536133
google-chrome	firefox
if you re not particularly attached to google-chrome check out firebug the firefox extension

viewdidload	viewwillappear
well viewdidload and i think viewwillappear are called before the view is added to the view hierarchy

3536924
int	chars
i have some code here to call minizip a boilerplate dirty renamed main of the minizip program but when i compile i get undefined reference to minizip int chars

3536946
min	max
ok hang on if you want to have some control say a tmyedit with say a somefactor integer property for which the entry in the object inspector would not only show the value of somefactor but also the min and max values allowed for somefactor you ll need a to code property editor that shows its own form

3536969
rtp	rtsp	udp	tcp	udp	rtp
server should be made generic it should support rtp over udp rtp over tcp rtp over rtsp and rtp over rtsp over http s

3536969
rtp	rtsp
3 rtp over rtsp and rtp over rtsp over http s

3537004

then your customers fontfamily font-size margins etc

3537111
inherited	properties
to get every css properties you need you could inspect your webapp in your enviroment not the clients with chrome and see the computed style with show inherited on

3537112
groovy	gsp
and being able to write groovy code rather than el in the views gsp grails variant of jsp is really powerful

3537121
width	height
for example you could make a resizable control for a square and make the width and height resizable proportionally

3537161
button	checkbox
you can find these checkbox by going to publish settings - the flash tab - clicking on the button that says settings to the right of the script dropdown

3537347
client-side	server-side
you are mixing server-side scripting php with client-side scripting js

3537362
pthreads	fork
in a perfect world i d choose debian-interix or pkgsrc-interix perl not the ancient perl that ships with interix sfu sua since it provides the most pthreads unix -like system including real copy-on-write fork not windows fork emulation from cygwin

3537465
int	chars
if you absolutely want to use filter_var because you want to remove all other chars use filter_sanitize_number_float and then cast to int

3537467
integer	fractions
an integer does not have decimal fractions so the validation must fail although i find the sanitation result of 100.50 turning into 10050 pretty bizarre on php s end

3537515
width	height
i use jquery to access the height or width i either use

3537515
hide	show
my script plays with images and is made to integrate in any page so the user is the one who do hide show change the values

3537528
width	height
i usually do this when you cache the width and height before the hiding you can still use them

3537528
width	height
or when you can t do this because the hiding and the need for the value are spread out you could save the height and width in the data object

3537557
calloc	malloc
maybe the electric fence malloc allocates zeroed memory like calloc but standard malloc of course doesn t

3537558

3537722
multiplication	modulo	division	modulo	division	multiplication
on the plus side 1009 is prime so arithmetic modulo 1009 takes place in a field which means that after casting out multiples of 1009 from both top and bottom you can do the rest of the multiplication and division mod 1009 in any order

3537730
typedef	struct
for example in the nginx source i noticed that most ngnx_flag_t s occur in struct with other u intptr_t typedef types

for-loop	loops
answer the for-loop now works as expected if i loops through self.fields instead of self.cleaned_data

3537906
hide	show
then you would need server-side logic to show hide the fields

3537926
width	height
it could very possibly be that your embed script s width and height attributes are smaller than the movie

3537930
affinity	processors
direct access to system level constructs such as processors affinity and inline assembly can certainly have an impact on performance

3538002
mouse	keyboard
a system hook on the keyboard and mouse would definitely show up as a flag

3538048
rss	feed
use that file as the rss feed then use cron web hooks queue whatever to generate the static file

3538054
integer	unsigned
often -1 0 when converted to an integer but also possible 0 1 depending on whether the bit is considered signed two s compliment or unsigned one s compliment

3538096
fadein	fadeout
note that the fadein and fadeout return immediately before the animation is completed so the second text call executes right after that

3538118
sorting	grouping
so summarizing the result of our next ... is exactly the pair k g where k is the minimum first after sorting value for the first sub-item and g is an iterator for the grouping s items

3538125
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
you should consider using datasources like objectdatasource or linqdatasource to databind your controls

3538156
lisp	prolog
if you know how to do it in prolog haskell fortran lisp or basic then please go right ahead

3538177
getter	setter
after a while though you start to notice the conventions used in how an option key marries up to a getter setter method

3538215
width	height
remember you re using a grid so you won t reach the edges unless you calculate the width and height of your box to match that grid

3538238
gson	jackson	gson	flexjson	flexjson	jackson
many packages have additional or alternative ways to map things json-lib flexjson and jackson at least have additions compared to gson

3538251
awt	swing
i m more familiar with swing but the article painting in awt and swing distinguishes between system- and application-triggered painting

3538254
width	height
the problem is in the dimensions of the map div even though #map_canvas had a height and width applied via css in the top of the document it would seem the google maps api initializing before the style was being applied this theory could be tested with dynatrace

3538254
width	height
1 inline styles for width and height

3538260
width	height
the div has width 100 and height 100 and the code to create the chart uses and to get the size of the div at render time and fill the page with the chart

3538260
firefox	safari
i would have hoped that when the browser is rendering the page for the printer it issues a resize but it doesn t at least safari and firefox don t

3538260
width	height
chrome does something strange in which it resizes only the height but not the width

3538267
ready	each
without this it means making each page live before the whole section is ready - and that s not a suitable solution

3538294
rss	feed
if new articles are added every 10-20 minutes then after an hour you ll have 3-6 after a day you ll have 72-144 after a week you ll have around 500-1000 and after a month you ll have several thousand entries in your rss feed

3538294
rss	feed
i think most desktop rss readers can be configured for how often they should check for updates and for a feed with this kind of traffic most users would probably set their reader to check once an hour or maybe even every 15 minutes

3538383
cs-cart	magento
my vps serves drupal 6.16 magento 1.4.1 and cs-cart 2.0.15 with apache2 prefork-mpm

3538490
erlang	lisp
consider some lisp dialect erlang which is cool at the moment haskell etc

3538491
ant	maven
one way you can use hibernate and liquibase is to use the liquibase diff tool under ant or maven during development to append to your changelog file based on differences between your database and your hibernate model

3538491
ant	maven
the only issue may be that the hibernate diff tool may not be supported in maven like it is in ant and the command line especially in 1.9

3538506
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i get the same behavior in google-chrome safari and firefox firefox doesn t have the valid and invalid pseudo-classes but i tried it without those.

3538539
google-chrome	safari
linux safari on mac google-chrome on

3538547
nfa	dfa
if i use large character sets like the any operator . or the unicode property l the nfa and also the dfa contains a lot of states 10000

3538547
nfa	dfa
so the convertation for nfa to dfa and create the minimal dfa takes a long time even if the output minimal dfa contains only a few states

3538547
int	chars
a helper function to convert a chars int to a utf8 encoding byte is defined as

3538568
maven	m2e
but unlike with the command-line version of maven which built everything perfectly m2e leaves a large number of build errors in the source code

3538568
maven	m2e
one difference is that m2e uses by default a embedded version of maven 3 which is probably not the same version that you use on the command line

3538625
profiling	debugging
never profiling an application with debugging flags on

3538639
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

3538645
post	get
i m trying to get the pictures in the thin middle column of the page above to when clicked on pop up in fancybox with attached post data

3538684
filtering	grouping
this means that the selection will not take place on the database server and the entire dataset will have to get sent back to crystal and then the local machine has to chug through it to filtering out the rows grouping that don t meet the selection criteria

3538697
maven	m2e
when i run the project as maven build right-click- run- maven package it sucessfully creates the war with m2e

3538697
maven	m2e
so my guess is that the problem is with the m2e maven builder

3538706

a couple to look at would be the boost pool allocator and the loki small object allocator

3538806
ostream	istream
in c++ there is the ios istream ostream input_iterator output_iterator concepts which i thought might be useful

3538806
int	chars
but it seems to me that all of these are for primitive chars types chars int etc.

3538865
spoofing	traffic
otherwise your application could be open to spoofing someone pretending to be the card reader or sniffing monitoring of traffic between the reader and your web server

3539021
haskell	sml	haskell	scheme	sml	scheme
learn sml or scheme or haskell

3539021
erlang	sml
learn a functional language like sml or a dynamically typed one like python or one that radically changes how you deal with concurrency like erlang

3539059
lisp	scheme
take this with a grain of salt because i mainly deal with scheme not common lisp

3539063
int	chars
alternatively you could print the chars as int as well as chars

3539127
filesystems	ntfs
backslash is a valid filename character in posix filesystems but is the directory separator in ntfs

3539192
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox do not show any js errors and work as intended

3539194
m2e	pom.xml
the m2e plugin doesn t use eclipse defaults the m2e plugin derives the settings from the pom.xml

3539197
apache	lighttpd
i don t know whether it is applicable to you since you are not allowed to change your apache s settings but i d suggest to use lighttpd + mod_secdownload for performance reasons

3539239
x86	64bit
in visual studio you do this by setting your target cpu type in the project settings to x86 instead of any or 64bit

3539297
gdi	directdraw	direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	gdi
i found good old directdraw worked remarkably well and would reliably grab bits of hardware-accelerated video screen content which other methods direct3d gdi opengl seemed to leave blank or scrambled

3539313
xml-rpc	json-rpc
i thought that using a rpc protocol such as json-rpc over a standard unix or tcp socket would be the way to go but every implementation of json-rpc xml-rpc soap etc

3539374
apache	nginx
since none of that static content comes from django most of your web application s time-line is apache or nginx or some other server software outside django

3539437
ubuntu	linux
thought i could just copy my vimrc from my windows to my linux box but running into a few problems with the letter spacing on ubuntu

however it s very common to use time to obtain the seed for the prng so that you get different random numbers each time your program is run

3539450
yacc	bison
after seeing the yacc bison grammar and lex flex analyzer some of the problems became obvious and others took a little more sorting out

3539450
free	strdup
the prototype solution returned had a major memory leak because it used strdup liberally and didn t use free at all

3539532
maven	pom.xml
i am working in a maven project with a pom.xml file that declares the use of the maven-gae-plugin

3539572

if the websites you are trying to grab the news from supports rss feed then you can use jquery plugins like jfeed to retrieve the rss and you can then just display it on your own website

3539589
isnull	nvl	coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl
and ansi syntax doesn t necessarily mean it performs as well as native syntax ie coalesce vs native isnull ifnull nvl etc

3539594
vim	emacs	vim	sublimetext	emacs	sublimetext
for example where a command might open a file for editing like git commit instead of opening that file in vim or emacs it would open in textedit or perhaps another text editing application of your choosing such as coda or sublimetext

3539633
width	height
one possibility if you re using a dynamic array is to create it in the constructors thus after setting up width and height members

3539661
hide	show
you create property triggers on the isenabled and ispressed properties and show or hide the images as needed

3539665
width	height
client space goes from 0 0 in the top left corner to width height in the bottom right

3539699
hash	whirlpool
the whirlpool hash function which is based on aes returns a 512-bit digest but that s not the same thing as a 512-bit aes cipher

3539717
portrait	landscape
it works fine when the ipad is oriented portrait but when it s in landscape the bottom of the image is cut off as the height of the visible area is only 748 not 1004

3539739
multiplying	add
in english then the idea is this to get the next random number multiplying the last random number by something add a number to it and then take the last few digits

3539739
multiplying	modulo
you also want a value of a that is really big so that every time you multiplying it by x n you trigger a the modulo and chop off a lot of digits or else many numbers in a row will just be multiples of each other

3539777
folder	directory
put the blog folder in webroot under your cake directory and it should work just fine

3539794
inline	inlining
avoid inlining functions until profiling indicates which functions could benefit from inline

3539794
inline	inlining
in other words inlining large functions or functions that call other possibly inline functions is not a good idea

3539804
implements	extends
this completely removes multithreading concern and allows to extends implements interface without caring about concurrency

calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
every byte you allocate dynamically via malloc or calloc you are on the hook for deallocating via free

3539872
range	minimum
for example the language standard only mandates minimum range for types like short int and long but they may be wider than the minimum requirements

3539881
hide	show
i m iterating through an array of strings ids and passing each element of the array to a function which either hide that element by id or show it

3539908

3540029
maven	m2e
there is also a way to map a multi-module maven project into a single eclipse project that entails enabling m2e s nested module support

3540039
bids	ssas	bids	ssis
keep in mind that visual studio 2010 does not have bi development support currently so you have to install bids from the sql installation media and use the visual studio 2008 bi development studio that installs under the sql server 2008 folder in program files if you need to do any ssis ssrs or ssas development from the workstation

3540054
google-chrome	firefox
it does not happen with google-chrome but firefox reloads the page after query adding this nightmare hash

3540121
interpolation	splines
in this mathematica example i do a simple 2d rotation and use a degree-1 splines function to interpolation

3540145
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
since asking this question the main languages that have been recommended are haskell lisp and scheme

3540186
inline	inlining
one of the reason the compiler does a better job inlining than the programmer is because the cost benefit tradeoff is actually decided at the lowest level of machine abstraction how many assembly instructions make up the function that you want to inline

3540401
apache	nginx
apache nginx this is what most forums say or something else would be better

3540407
ant	maven
ant and maven are too great build tools

3540407
ant	maven
the problem with ant is that it is more difficult to make into a sharable module that you can share and configure like you can with a maven plugin

3540420
ant	maven
should you have the rare situation in which you truly need to do something that can t be done in a standardized way you can still hook scripts ant tasks etc into maven and even write custom plugins

3540423
mp3	ogg
i now want to search for both mp3 and ogg files

3540425

i have put in the quotes now but i get this now

3540530
dictionary	map
use dictionary to map between relative and absolute paths so that you could remove them

3540557
pull	push
the other alternative is that if you can get these files on an internet facing server you can switch to using akamai http content delivery and get akamai to pull the images rather than you having to continuously push them

3540581
google-chrome	firefox
it the alert hello seems never executed in firefox and google-chrome

3540629
hide	show
i have a select menu that show hide the livetransopts div when an option is clicked

3540640
inherited	subclassing
i know for classes outside the package the subclassing can see the protected member only through inherited

3540649
superclass	subclassing
edit the reasoning behind this is that protected access is designed to help subclassing implement the functionality they need giving more access to the internals of the superclass than would normally be available

3540649
public	protected
the public api shouldn t expose those details but the protected api can just for the purposes of giving subclasses more opportunities

3540688
mp3	ogg
so to allow both mp3 and ogg extension we can modify the mp3 in the pattern to mp3|ogg

3540705
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if you give a null string as a filename then nullpointerexception or perhaps an illegalargumentexception -- another contentious debate should be thrown

3540705
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
an unchecked-exception is defined as runtimeexception and its subclasses and error and its subclasses

3540730
serializable	deserialization
is it just the serializable deserialization

3540730
serializable	deserialization
if you have actual profiling measurements to back up your 10 to 15 clock time doing serializable + deserialization + i o then logic tells you that the maximum performance improvement you can get will be less than that

3540730
serializable	deserialization
if you can separate the i o from the serializable deserialization you can refine that upper bound

3540730
serializable	deserialization
however serializable deserialization is only a small part of the total i o overheads and these are only a small part of your application

3540749
nsstring	nsxmlparser
- void parser nsxmlparser parser didstartelement nsstring elementname

3540768

3541261
rss	feed
back to your question about an rss feed sitemap - don t worry about duplicate content as this is not an issue when it comes to sitemaps

3541261
rss	feed
duplicate content is only a problem if you published the same article several times on the site - sitemaps and rss feed are only links to the content not the content itself so if a rss feed is the easiest way of reporting your fresh content to google go for it

3541276
rss	feed
basically my app loads two rss feed - a blog feed and a twitter stream

3541283
int	chars
if you re passing some non-basic type int chars etc but rather an instance of some class you can modify that class s copy-constructor to print something when it s being copied

a chars is commonly smaller than an int

3541544
int	chars
usually a chars is 8 bits while an int is 32 or 64 bits

stdout	stderr
next we use a little extra helper to handle the merging of the stdout and stderr streams splitting the command over several lines for clarity only so that we can see where the catch wrapper is and where the wrapped exec is

3547385
stdout	stderr
if you re using tcl 8.6 in beta you can use chan pipe to produce a channel that you can redirect stdout and stderr into with the form but that s not so useful to you

3548431
ant	maven
ant tasks maven plugins for javascript

3548478
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to

3548771
inherited	properties
by the way if you want to use inherited just to extend some properties and methods you can do this by using composition instead of inherited

3548829
put	get
of course you will need to put the functionality which takes time to a new php file or call the old one with a get parameter which will activate that functionality only

3548832
getter	setter
yes you should unit test even the simplest logic in your getter and setter

3548832
getter	setter
the only time i don t test getter and setter is if they are doing only simple assignment or returning a value

3548861

3548867
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
for integers using binary octal and hexadecimal seems fairly straight forward since each digit in the string represents a set group of bits eg for the 2 hex digits i know its xxxxyyyy so i could do it with bit shifts and taking one digit at a time eg for the hex string 0xfa20 the value is 15 12 | 10 8 | 2 4 | 0 0

post	get
apparently we have to post this question to get the answer d

3551163
inherited	properties
the following class provides a generic base class for outerspace with constraints on its parameters that enforce inherited rules on the properties types

3551163
inherited	properties
the appeal of this approach is that it permits you to return strongly typed properties and enforce a basic inherited constraint on the types of those properties

3551172
width	height
additionally you can limit width and height setting android maxwidth and android maxheight attributes to prevent minature to be too large

3551188
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
rather you should use a series of waithandles specifically an autoresetevent or manualresetevent which your threads will signal when they are done with their work

3551199
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems

3551226
sorting	filtering
i saw icollectionview being introduced with wpf to handle situations when you need sorting and filtering enabled

3551240
width	height
or if the new buttons don t have the same dimensions you will need to edit the menu attributes height width etc. in your template s stylesheet so that the new buttons display properly without throwing off the whole template

3551293
punctuation	words
it s only necessary if the column name contains spaces or punctuation or conflicts with a reserved words but many wizards will just add the brackets for all field names to avoid the logic for deciding whether they are necessary

3551342
cout	cin
before you try to figure out if cin cout or scanf printf will be faster make sure you have measured and proved this is indeed the biggest performance issue with your application

3551388
children	parent
or more to the point each parent has a variable number of children where the number is always greater than zero but can and will vary from instance to instance

3551388
children	parent
if this is not the case if a parent tournament or match will always have the same number of children then there might be some minor advantage in denormalizing the data like a table with seven columns for the weekdays but that may prove awkward in the long run

3551406
serializable	deserialization
if the entire purpose of the serializable deserialization is to be able to transfer data via http odata already solves this for you

3551451
post	get
i can access the service fine through my browser post to but if i try to post the same information via curl i get a 404 error

3551461
rar	zip
what lib is better to use to unrar rar files and unzip zip files in java 1.4

3551470
illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception
the exception classes that are recommended here include illegalstateexception illegalargumentexception unsupportedoperationexception etc

3551485
ssl	https
it looks like you re serving your site over ssl https but serving some of the content almost certainly something in the menu - such as an image over http hence you re receiving the mixed mode warning

3551567
post	get
anyway i can post with curl to this page and get a response

3551585
awt	swing
every update to the ui must happen from the so-called edt â the event-dispather thread which is the main gui thread swing and i think awt uses

3551588
post	get
ok i m pretty new at programming and have been using curl to execute scripts in other folders of my site and passing get and post variable that way

3551614
spaces	delimiter
not having a spaces delimiter between attribute name and its value actually improves the readability as it visually shows the coupling between these

3551614
spaces	delimiter
no spaces delimiter

3551614
spaces	delimiter
spaces delimiter

3551657
raphael	excanvas
conversely if you want something that will work with old versions of internet excanvas may not work not sure if excanvas supports ie6 but svg does to some extent raphael supports ie6

3551661
post	get
i know thats where any cookies i get back are stored when i do any post

3551662
post	get
i think this is the only way to do this if the script is expecting get or post variables

3551676
folder	directory
also see if there is any path in the linker - additional include directory refers to my documents ... projects folder

3551692
spaces	delimiter
the equal sign the quotes and the fact that the attribute is always on the left and the value on the right is a clear enough visual delimiter adding spaces breaks this effect and adds unnecessary bytes to the file

3551740
children	parent
when a click occurs the tree is walked from top-down which means children before parent and siblings in order

3551752
r-tree	quadtree
i guess an r-tree or quadtree would be a perfect data structure for this but i haven t been able to find a working ruby implementation

3551760
gridview	repeater
now if your linkbutton is used in a gridview repeater or some type of control that requires binding to fill it in then you will probably need to implement a rowcommand event handler to figure out which linkbutton is pressed

3551760
post	get
since you are using a linkbutton you can use the following to get what control caused the post back

3551794
dns	spf
i have spf set up on my dns and i m sending from the spf verified server if that s of any help

3551813
submit	submission
search engine submission - allows you to submit the website to a variety of search engines from an admin interface

3551823
equals	gethashcode
in your last edit you mention that the reason that you don t implement equals and gethashcode is because the code for your classes is auto-generated and you don t want to have to re-implement that code each time you regenerate the code

3551946
post	get
get and post information would be vital too

3551958
post	get
on the torrent for your software post a comment saying you re the developer of this software and while you re glad to see that people like it the money from software sales goes directly to you and your dog and no one else and you can t afford to keep making software if you don t get paid

3551961
cpu	processors
for example on the zilog z80 processors the machine code 00000101 which causes the cpu to decrement the b processors register would be represented in assembly language as dec b

sqldatasource	detailsview
i have the following detailsview with several boundfields and sqldatasource that populates the fields

3551999
int	double
there is an example on cdecl that goes double int foofoo means cast foofoo into block int returning double

3552108
cgpoint	cgrect
i have the cgpoint and frame cgrect of the objects within each quartile

3552128
google-chrome	safari
there is the use of a custom protocol for sure but some browsers like google-chrome safari sometimes have issues with custom protocol handling so it is not reliable enough .

3552153
cout	cin
cout and cin have applications that fprintf and fscanf are very difficult to use

3552153
cout	cin
when tuning a program s performance based on cout cin vs

3552177
kerberos	ntlm
the only difference between the between the 2 environments is we are using kerberos instead of ntlm in our production environment

3552240
switching	screens
if you switching off the optimize code option in the project properties - build screens then both release and debug build produces the same result which shows badguy at the top of the stack trace

3552242
int	chars
add up all the chars casted as int

3552242
int	chars
add up squares of chars again casted as int

3552244
inline	inlining
inlining that makes an inline

3552253
mongoid	mongomapper
mongodb has two popular orms for rails mongoid and mongomapper

3552262
apache	nginx
i think there are also plugins for apache and i am sure for nginx

3552266
kerberos	ntlm
the difference between ntlm and kerberos is huge

3552266
kerberos	ntlm
with ntlm you can use pass-through authentication with kerberos you cannot

3552266
kerberos	ntlm
understanding kerberos and ntlm authentication in sql server connections

3552295
enlive	hiccup
there is a number of clojure-specific solutions including enlive and hiccup enlive is a very powerful html scraping templating transforming engine

3552346
typedef	struct
now symtable is the typedef for a struct

3552346
typedef	struct
the struct and typedef are in an included file

3552346
typedef	struct
quad is the typedef for a struct typedef struct quad quad

3552346
typedef	struct
the struct and typedef are in an included file

3552346
typedef	struct
i have included the header file for my quad typedef and struct quad in my scanner

if facebook or the other website is not available i d be happy not displaying anything or displaying a graphic of the same size height width or a host of other alternatives except displaying an error on my homepage

3552357
textview	imageview
my app has widgets that have an imageview and a textview

3552430
distance	polygons
once you know the lat lon at the other end of each bearing distance line then connecting the dots to form a polygons is trivial

3552432
post	put
verbs are post delete and put

3552444
wordpress	joomla
i would start with a cms such as joomla or perhaps even wordpress

3552464
hash	md5
recently i discovered that it stores passwords as plain md5 hash which is quite bothersome to me

3552483
textarea	textbox
i don t see any dom methods for a textbox or textarea that allow control of scroll position

3552521
960.gs	fluid
you can try fluid24 it is a fluid 24 columns grid system based on 960.gs

3552536
hash	salt
i believe it hash passwords and security answers using salt sha1

3552541
put	get
you could put that into a for-loop to get them all

3552544
hash	salt
passwords should be hash and salt never encrypted much less encoded

3552544
hash	md5
also all hash functions will generate an output that has a fixed size 32 characters in case of md5 40 in sha1 etc. so you don t need all that extra space

3552631
spaces	delimiter
they are tab delimiter and some are spaces delimiter

3552634
subtract	add
you can edit the link later on to add or subtract typeids

3552667
rss	feed
just grab the rss feed from your blog and parse it

3552675
double-pointer	pointers
problem 2 you need to know the size of the string for each pointers in the double-pointer

3552697
put	get
at least try to get some funding for a full size test system and put the procedures in place to make moving production data to it automatic so you can fully test this thing

3552711
twitter	bit.ly
i ve tried using localhost 300 twitter auth and a bit.ly for each of the former 2

3552789
jboss	weblogic
also jboss is a good server but under heavy loads my experience shows it s not fully reliable compared to weblogic and websphere

3552801
lisp	scheme
swank servers exist for many common lisp implementations and lisp dialects such as clojure and gambit scheme

3552828
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome ect

3552886
implements	extends
you could implements extends your own priorityqueue that simply checks every new intent added to the queue

3552889
width	height
taking either the width of your object or the height of your object you can come up with a relationship between constant width in your object and the width of your object in the scene as it changes in distance

3552914
subtract	add
both allows you to perform simple atomic operations on data such as simple add subtract on values though

3552920
post	get
resolved 405 was because i was sending a post instead of a get

3552938
hide	show
if you show and hide scope buttons on some event you need to adjust the frame size each time

3552958
prepare	execute
the benefits of prepare statements can be read here but in general the same statement will only need to be compiled once but can be execute as many times as you want with different parameters which can make your script more efficient

3552999
children	parent
the entire purpose of inheritance is that multiple children can inherit common functionality from a parent

3553037
getter	setter
for example i d create customer with it s property getter and setter and then customermanager with all the methods related to customer class for example getcustomer getorders etc...

3553039
dreamweaver	aptana	textmate	aptana
the coding environment they use reflects this variety and whilst some coders are comfortable writing an entire application using only textmate some others prefer to work with aptana the flash ide or dreamweaver no quality comparison here

3553047
int	double
i am dividing two int values and im expecting to get a double one

3553059
int	double
cast at least one of the int to double before dividing

3553071
int	double
the result of the division is cast to a double after int division with rounding down is performed

3553071
int	double
cast one of the int to a double before dividing so that double division occurs

3553075
int	double
in order to get a double answer you must cast one of the int to a double

3553085
firefox	safari
i didnt have prblems with safari nor firefox

3553085
width	height
the sizes width and height values are different

3553118
g++	gcc
watch the name field in gcc it compile without warning but in g++ it will i don t know why

3553125
submit	submission
search engine submission - allows you to submit the website to a variety

3553147
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine in firefox and opera but ie safari and google-chrome do not work

3553156
put	get
i would like to get all of the values and put it into a array

3553157
prepare	execute
prepare execution is commonly used by applications to execute the same parameterized sql statement repeatedly

3553157
prepare	execute
prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

3553157
prepare	execute
prepare execution can also provide a reduction in network traffic because the driver can send an execution plan identifier and the parameter values rather than an entire sql statement to the data source each time the statement is execute

3553203
zoo	xts
xts requires an explicit time index but it s based on zoo which has no such requirement

3553203
xts	quantmod
the downside is that you won t be able to use those objects with quantmod chartseries because it requires an xts object

3553214
nextuntil	each
you could loop through each question and looking through it s answers using nextuntil with .filter to see if there any checked ones like this

3553235
installation	upgrade
if they are not provided the installation may silently fail to upgrade your app or at least that s what i ve found though i m still a little unsure whether the same behaviour applies under system.diagnostics.process.start

3553255
hide	show
to get around this you could add an onchange handler to your and then check in that function if you should show or hide the address

3553328
width	height
it can resize images by specifying height and width attributes but they won t look good

3553376
ssl	https
then the info therein should be safe to use one-time as basically a temporary password sent again over ssl because the gateway is also https

3553387
public	protected	inherited	subclassing
of course when you extend a class the subclassing inherited all of the public and protected methods from the parent class

3553407
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade my laptop s ram 3 days ago and switched to 64-bit versioning of win7

3553408
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox does not support mp3 files in html5 only google-chrome and safari so far may be ie9 will later

3553428
qmainwindow	qwidget
the app has a qwidget as its main window not qmainwindow qlistview is contained in the qwidget object and created by passing a point to the main window

3553454
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
like many other developers out there i ve created iphone projects that use a uitabbarcontroller as the root controller with the tab views using uinavigationcontroller s to drill down from lists to detail views

3553492
put	get
the filename needs to get placed inside the image column in the database table and the file needs to be put in the directory as well

3553516
put	get
also a bit of multitasking advice if you get bored doing any one thing for too long put it down and come back and finish it later

3553519
for-loop	loops
and so on - and we break off that loops after 100 000 lines next time the for-loop will continue reading exactly where this one left off

3553519
for-loop	loops
the for-loop s else clause executes if and only if the break within that loops didn t therefore if we ve read less than 100 000 lines -- when the input file is finished

3553544
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works on firefox google-chrome safari and opera .

3553550
folder	directory
it takes a folder name in a specified directory on the server and calls a php page using urlrequest to get the workable contents of the folder

3553589
onclick	onscroll
when i swipe on a page that scrolls i get something full of in onclick in onscroll in onfling etc

3553600
accessor	properties
this happens because browsers provide shortcut accessor to form elements properties that refer to the elements are bound to the form element using the name attribute as the properties name

3553618
integer	unsigned
as to why you can t get a full 2 32 perhaps something is using a signed rather than unsigned integer to store addresses and one bit is unavailable

3553625
minimum	max	min	max
if you re looking for the minimum and maximum from a list just set min and max initially to the first value in the list then run through the list comparing each value with min and max and adjusting them accordingly

3553634
powerpc	i386
so to be able to build a python interpreter that will work on 10.4 through 10.6 you would use gcc-4.0 set macosx_deployment_target to 10.4 the minimum os x level needed to run use the corresponding sdk for 10.4 it s somewhat confusingly called 10.4u as in universal and is an optional install for the 10.6 versions of the xcode developer tools and set the universal architectures to i386 and powerpc the only two that are fully supported at run time on all of those systems

3553634
powerpc	i386
this can result in the problem that 3rd-party non-python libraries you install can t be statically or dynamically linked with the python extension module because there is no compatible common architecture since the python.org python includes only the 32-bit i386 and powerpc archs

3553634
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
for many popular python packages with 3rd-party library dependencies pil and mysqldb come to mind there is another approach to minimizing compatibility problems and that it is to use a complete solution python python packages and 3rd-party libraries from one of the third-party open source package distributors for os x such as macports homebrew or fink

3553680
int	double
passing double int strings arrays

3553693
vaadin	wicket
am torn between wicket and vaadin

3553693
vaadin	wicket
i have narrowed down my choices to wicket and vaadin

3553715
post	put
i m getting an argument error whenever i run an rspec test on any controller action that uses a post or put action

3553739
mongoid	activemodel
it s even easier if you use rails 3 because mongoid and activerecords uses activemodel as the interface

3553755
free	malloc
gdb-arm-apple-darwin 3441 malloc error for object 0x4601e0 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

3553755
free	malloc
gdb-arm-apple-darwin 3441 malloc error for object 0x42a7d0 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

3553755
free	malloc
gdb-arm-apple-darwin 4195 malloc error for object 0x45e710 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being free

3553776
children	parent
i want to match parent s height with the total height of its children so the content does not flow out from parent s border

3553785
width	height
make sure you change the width height parameters i set if you use mine

3553792
graphviz	gephi
i suggest you give gephi a try as i have found it easier to use than graphviz

3553794
typedef	struct
so the first thing i would recommend is giving the struct proper a name and since this is c++ a typedef does not add any benefit so just drop the typedef

3553818
pop-up	dialog
in the pop-up dialog navigate to jvm tab and check which jre is used to run your script

3553824
gmail	hotmail
in my asp.net application i need to show the email preview of created email like with gmail the email will display some different formatting with hotmail it will some different formatting... p

3553824
gmail	hotmail
so how to provide email preview for the different email providers like gmail hotmail rediffmail etc.

3553937
hide	show
what i want to do is to show and hide some items above the uiswitch control according to the state of the switch

3553937
hide	show
and the elements should hide and show using the common tableview animations just like the user has added or removed an item

3553940
postgresql	mysql
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

3553973
hide	show
sometimes depends of the input data only one of uitextfields must be show so when second uitextfield is not needed i hide it and recalculate the height of my item renderer

3553979
ubuntu	centos
this used to work on an old centos server with pylons 0.9.7 but now i m trying to set it up on a new one running ubuntu 10.04 and pylons 1.0

3553987
fadein	fadeout
however the built in fadein fadeout methods throw this centering awry and i m not completely sure what is going on

3553991
google-chrome	firefox
in case of google-chrome firefox safari..

3554078
width	height
i need to show the below data in a jtable cell.as of now everything comes in a single line even-though i m overriding the object s tostring method with newline characters.how can i set the jtable to adjust the cell height and width depending on the data

3554079
ienumerable	icollection
well dosomethingwithcollection should accept two parameters - 1 icollection ienumerable that will allow you to enumerate through all values 2 delegate that will take the object and give you key and value back

3554080
getter	setter
for really small functions property getter and setter this cost can be high relative to the actual work done in the function

3554117
ienumerable	icollection
as far as both collections namevaluecollection and keyvalueconfigurationcollection implements both icollection and ienumerable you can do next

3554156
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	queue
the most simple would be an array but a double-ended queue or an indexed skip-lists b tree could be better depending on the data size we are talking about

3554156
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	linked-list
conceptually it doesn t change much yet however you get the ability to move to a given index in o 1 array deque o log n skip-lists b tree operations rather than o n with a simple linked-list

3554184
hide	show
while doing so i will show a small div and hide it when we re done hiding it doesnâ t matter the page will already be gone

3554197
put	get
when you drag and drop the source application supplies the data object and that gets put into the system clipboard so that target app where drop would occur could get the data

3554296
hash	md5
i m storing unique user-agents in a mysql myisam table so when i have to look if it exists in the table i check the md5 hash that is stored next to the text field

3554298
activemq	rabbitmq
i have not used activemq or rabbitmq but have used zeromq

3554329
google-chrome	safari
the acceptable web page footprint will be completely different between a user base with 80 ie6 users than that of a page where all users use safari and google-chrome

3554336
coalesce	isnull
i know your schema is contrived but as it stands an isnull or coalesce statement as suggested by mike wonâ t work because the workinglocationid is not nullable and therefore the employee will have to have a location

3554348
hash	md5
you can t store an md5 hash in a 32-bit int it simply won t fit

3554348
hash	md5
in your case binary 16 or varbinary 16 but since md5 hash are always 16 bytes the latter seems a bit pointless

3554350
hash	md5
you can store md5 hash in char 32 which is a bit faster than varchar 32

3554350
hash	md5
it s also possible to make two bigint fields and keep first half of md5 hash in first field and second part in second field

3554386
min	max
above the space where the patches appear is a button labeled settings... click that and then adjust the min max pxcor pycor to create an environment that is the size you wish

3554398
super	self
i would use super b self to get instances of b to call the methods of a

3554403
hash	md5
if your field hash is always an md5 value generated by php then you can safely set it to char 32

3554426
folder	directory
what i end up with in my build folder if i run this is for whatever reason assemblies that aren t fully rewritten by ccrewrite alongside .pdb.original .rewritten and .csproj.filelistabsolute.txt files that litter the output directory

3554547
typhoeus	eventmachine
i believe that libraries such as eventmachine and typhoeus can remedy that but i am also strongly considering node.js because i know javascript quite well and seems to be built for this kind of thing

3554547
websocket	pusher
i am considering plain ajax but that would require polling the server websocket but that would require fallback for older browsers and specific solutions for persistent client server communication such as cramp juggernaut and pusher

3554610
user-controls	tabcontrol
edit by trial and error i ve narrowed it down to a single system windows forms user-controls derived control and the crash only occurs when that control is nested within a system windows forms tabcontrol

3554615
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what you can do is quite involved and a bit of a hack that will work in firefox 2+ ie 5.5+ and recent webkit browsers such as safari 4 or google-chrome untested on older versions

3554624
g++	gcc
i was able to compile your code with g++ with just -pthread and flags alone or with gcc using the previous flags plus -lstdc++

3554673
prepare	execute
i solved it instead of using the prepare statement i used execute statement instead

3554685
fadein	fadeout
what i try is beforchange fadeout and onchange or after fadein

you re probably getting a benign form of undefined behaviour because the x modifier expects an unsigned int parameter and a chars will usually be promoted to an int when passed to a varargs function

3555936
int	chars
you should explicitly cast the chars to an unsigned int to get predictable results

3555936
int	chars
if chars on your platform is signed then this conversion will convert negative chars values to large unsigned int values fffffff5

3555936
int	chars
if you want to treat byte values as unsigned values and just zero extend when converting to unsigned int you should use unsigned chars for pixel_data or cast via unsigned chars or use a masking operation after promotion

in general though you can prevent the override case by not making a property virtual in the first place or preventing further overrides by specifying the sealed modifiers on the property

3558256

3558357
salt	md5
as said already in the other responses doing a sha1 or an md5 of the userid combined with microtime and some salt string is usually a safe bet

3558369

for this exercise you have to use the having clause - the where clause doesn t allow you to use aggregate functions min max count... without them being in a subquery but the having clause doesn t have that restriction

3558466
put	get
also the placement of the criteria makes a big difference in results when using an outer join so it is a good habit to get into to put the join criteria in the on in all cases

3558493

this can be thwarted by a challenge response where the server sends with the page a salt a big random number which is jumbled up with the password and then hash so the response is always different

3558823
hash	salt
so you might have to end up with a sending a salt hashing your password jumbling the hash with the salt by hashing it again and sending that to the server

3558823
hash	salt
the server hash the stored hash of the password from the user db with the salt and compares both

3558826

actionscript	mxml
i do not believe that actionscript can reference the namespace you define in mxml

3560842
int	chars
supplying a chars to a d format specifier that expects an int is probably unwise

3560842
int	chars
in this case not only is it apparently signed but also the chars argument has been pushed on to the stack an an int sized object and sign extended so that the higher order bits are all set to the same value as the high order bit of the original chars

3560842
int	chars
i am not sure whether this is defined behaviour or not without looking it up but personally i d have cast the chars to an int when formatting it with d

3560922
shapefile	gpx
for example indiemapper takes shapefile kml and gpx as input

the file test.php is in htdocs drupal folder is also in the same directory where the include files is

3561468
int	chars
a work around solution would be to create a struct or class that contains both an int and a chars variable and assign them accordingly

3561471
int	chars
i am not a pro at c++ but i guess you can declare 2 variables one chars and one int

3561471
int	chars
first you can assign the users input to chars than test it if it can be assigned as int and if it can be than your program will start using that

3561497
free	malloc
memory allocation is very slow in my opinion so whatever you can do to get away from malloc free and new in java the better off you ll be

3561503
int	chars
for your immediate problem using any kind of union is overkill since an int can hold any chars value

3561505

nasm	fasm
the org statement works the same in fasm as it does in nasm but differently in masm

3561945
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in safari google-chrome and firefox 4 beta i don t start seeing output until i ve sent somewhere around 1000 characters i would guess 1024 including the headers or something like that but i haven t narrowed it down to the exact behavior

3562121
post	get
but when i post the data to the controller i can t figure out how to get the data in the expected format

3562251
free	malloc
that said if you are using c++ you shouldn t be using malloc or free at all nor should you be using fread ..

from my latest experience it s almost always possible to maintain only two versions of these diff files - one for firefox safari google-chrome and another for ie family

3562388
width	height
i personally prefer to concentrate all things like width and height within css classes and avoid to use both attributes like width and inline styles like style width 100px just because it results in nice logical separation - html markup tells what should be displayed and css rules - how exactly it will look

3562394

3562794
boost	stl
you can and should rely on stl and boost

3562837
profiling	instrumentation
i don t know about profiling windows code but your program is so small and simple in absolute terms - it s a lot to read on stackoverflow that you could easily instrumentation it manually

3562844
for-loop	loops
also in all the for loops you can make one call to the size function of your vector store it in a temporary variable and use that variable in the for-loop for the condition as long as the size of the vectors doesn t change in the for loops

3562870
profiler	aqtime
a good profiler will do wonders - i ve had good luck on windows with aqtime although it s not free which may not suit you

put	get
if you re working with global interface references in a unit it will put in hidden finalization code to clean them up and if that references something that s part of another package you can get the same problems

3562973
jobs	cron
i m really after some other input as i d prefer it to be a background service always running - having a cron execute jobs was painful since some jobs run for 20+ hours so adding new ones was a pain with new php no threading java calls having to check if a service was running with outstanding jobs to add to instead of starting a new service but also have a very simple web interface without too much resource wastage

3562974
mongoid	mongomapper
the last time i used mongoid and mongomapper does not support mapping to gridfs so you would use the driver api for this

3562974
mongoid	mongomapper
and the last time i used mongoid and mongomapper does not support map-reduce again you have to use the driver api for this situation

3562974
mongoid	mongomapper
mongomapper and mongoid is used to map your domain object to mongo document at some stage where the odm is lack of you have to have the fallback plan which is to use the mongo driver api

3562985

wordpress	joomla
as far as i know the sandbox theme is available across wordpress drupal and joomla

3563082
wordpress	joomla

maybe you can extends the uitabbar and implements a scrolling swiping mechanism but i suggest you not to do that

3563733
width	height
the actual problem is not with the initial file size but with the dimensions of the image itself height width colordepth since you don t have access to this information before the file has been uploaded for security reasons you should probably use an uploader written in flash java or silverlight since they do have access to this information beforehand

3563733
width	height
after the upload you can check if the image will exceed your memory limit by calculating the dimensions of the uncompressed image by using getimagesize and using the returned width height and bit depth

like the title says i am trying to create a drop down menu using jquery json and ajax although i am familiar with the theory i have yet to put it into practice any advice demo code snippets or tutorials would be appreciated since i would like to get off to the best possible start

3564353
freetype	cairo
since cairo will be using quartz for font and text handling you will not have to compile pango which has glib as dependency and freetype

3564380
margin	height
it seems that that top margin gets added to the 100 height making it higher and causing the scrollbar

3564426

octal	hex
i try to output the german setence containing the letter ã¼ in escaped form ascii 252 octal 374 hex 0xfc using the following code

3564527
jobs	cron
also depending on your environment check if the php cli build is using the same php.ini file as the default php build - if the cli build is using another config file and you have cron jobs using the cli build the cron job scripts could be invoking the session cleanup procedure

3564554
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works in firefox opera safari google-chrome but not in ie6 haven t tested any other ie version yet

3564554
width	height
no width or height specified.

3564602
width	height
put simply having layout means that an object has a defined height and width

3564602
width	height
all other filterable objects gain layout by setting the height or width property setting the position property to absolute setting the writingmode property to tb-rl or setting the contenteditable property to true

3564664
width	height
width 178 height 115 style float left

3564689
width	height
i have just noticed that i have a height attribute on the image but don t have a width attribute

from the mysql manual can i see that foreign keys only work on innodb but my database is myisam

3565051
post	put
saying all that wait for someone else to post a really simple attribute you can put on your property that makes it just work

3565062
ocx	msflexgrid
and i want to invoke the methods and access the properties of an ocx control specifically the msflexgrid control as i could not find any other way of finding out the number of rows and columns as well as the data values in each cell in the msflexgrid control used

3565066

i have a task to parse thumbnail images and to set it on grid view where url image content to be in different height and width some images to be 60 60 or 110 80 how can i set images in grid have uniform height and width

3565073
next	except
if everything remains the same on the next page except for one article it will seem to the eye as if only this article is refreshed

3565078
hide	show
i use the following code to hide and show a box on a bunch of search results

3565078
hide	show
each result has its own toggle and box to show and hide

3565078
hide	show
the problem i have is that clicking any one of the toggles will show and hide all of the boxes on the page and not just the box for the one result

3565091
button	checkbox
button listview combobox checkbox and other therefore library must be small

3565100
ssl	https
this will switch between http and https as needed it ll be whatever the page is just make sure that other domain is setup to service with an ssl cert as well

3565133
switching	screens
however when i switching to higher dpi s through right-clicking on the desktop choosing screens resolution and clicking make or other items larger or smaller the icon does not scale

3565195
ienumerable	iqueryable
your find method returns ienumerable which could be the iqueryable returned from your when clause

3565199
button	checkbox
i have to admit for me it sounds a bit unusual and i would probably prefer not to install dynamic button acting on pre-coded sub s instead i would do an initial dialog before the query giving options via checkbox like truncate after x rows y n and the like - but you will have good reasons for doing it your way

3565204
submit	submission
submit your forms using ajax and after last form submission is complete go to next page if needed

3565205
jobs	cron
the user as which cron jobs run isn t allowed to execute one of the commands you are letting execute

3565225
post	get
at my treeview i try make post to get file like this

3565228
int	double
because d specifies that you want to print an int but i is a double

3565233
int	double
because i is a double and you tell printf to use it as if it were an int d

3565296
sorting	grouping
i think you are going to have to sort it in the view because if you want each grouping to have a different sorting you have to do that manually

3565314
free	malloc
some tools use #define to redefine new delete malloc and free but this relies on the correct order of the include files and may give problems if a class contains a method called free as is the case in qt

3565350
integer	fractions
in your example the sign bit is 0 because the number is positive the fractions part is 0 because the number is initialised as an integer and the exponent part contains the value 1025 2 with an offset of 1023

3565350
floating-point	integer
since the first rightmost 32 bits of the 64-bit floating-point number you supply are all 0 it stands to reason that printf produces 0 as its integer output

3565382
int	double
the simple answer to your question is as others have said that you re telling printf to print a int number for example a variable of the type int whilst passing it a double-precision number as your variable is of the type double which is wrong

3565382
int	double
the other thing you can do is to cast your double to an int like this

3565437
innodb	myisam
first of all mysql allows you to use different table engines in a single table so for example one table could be a myisam table and the other table could be an innodb table it all depends on your need

3565488
inherited	properties
the way to access a properties of a class from which i inherited is to use super

3565503
children	parent
my application constructs a parent object in a static factory along with it s predetermined children and then starts up tasks to run some computation on the children like so

3565561
disk	ram
this cache can reside in ram or on disk as file

3565644
x86	64bit
you ll need to build your .net project as 32bit x86 target if you want it to correctly load a 32-bit dll on a 64bit machine

3565754
stdout	stderr
think of the console window as nothing more than a ui element that allows the user to view the stdout stderr of your program and to provide stdin

3565769
onfocus	onblur
you should use the onfocus and onblur events rather than relying on click events

3565770
disk	ram
i write a bunch of same-size files on a partition tried both ram disk and virtual disk created via diskmgmt.msc

3565770
disk	ram
it doesn t depend on whether i use a ram disk or a virtual disk hence it is not a problem of a particular implementation

3565770
disk	ram
no bad clusters this is a virtual or a ram disk

3565803
google-chrome	firefox
i want to make a browser toolbar for windows that should work for existing browsers like firefox 2.x 3.x and google-chrome as well in c#.net

3565808
int	chars
the way i ve solved this problem is by using a template class called pod stands for plain old data like chars and int which usually transfer fine between dlls

3565808
free	malloc
note the memory allocation functions used are pod_malloc and pod_free - these are simply malloc and free but using the same function between all dlls

3565808
free	malloc
in my case all dlls use the malloc and free from the host exe so they are all using the same heap which solves the heap memory issue

3565835
opera	firefox
when i press alt ley the keyboardevent.key_down event is not fired and focus moves to browser s main menu ie opera firefox

3565838

3565914
fast-forward	merge
so if you actually made commit b on some other branch then merge it fast-forward into jack b would still be listed

3565939
innodb	myisam
james day a mysql support engineer and wikipedia engineer recommends that people use innodb all the time unless for some reason if becomes apparent that you need myisam

3565939
innodb	myisam
for reliability and performance we use innodb for almost everything at wikipedia - we just can t afford the downtime implied by myisam use and check table for 400gb of data when we get a crash.

3565975
udp	tcp
i remember from the networking class in college that udp isn t guaranteed delivery like tcp ip

3565975
udp	tcp
and wikipedia says that snmp can be run over tcp ip but udp is more common

3565975
udp	tcp
i get that some of the advantages of udp over tcp ip are speed broadcasting and multicasting

3565975
udp	tcp
that is yet another reason to prefer tcp ip over udp for network monitoring imo

3566014
udp	tcp
try implementing tcp on your basic agent - it s considerably more complex than a simple agent coded using udp

3566043
google-chrome	firefox
i had a mouseover submenu working very nicely on my site so nicely in fact that it was working exactly right in google-chrome ie 7 8 and firefox but now it s broken somehow and i can t see the problem

3566057
calloc	malloc
rest of virtual address space goes to native usage of jvm to accomodate the malloc calloc done by jvm native threads stack thread respective the java threads and addition jvm native threads for gc etc.

3566125
google-chrome	firefox	rss	feed
i am working with dates in an rss feed but am finding differing results when using the code below in ie google-chrome and firefox

3566125
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is happy with that but google-chrome and ie return invalid date

3566125
google-chrome	firefox
this time google-chrome is happy with that but firefox and ie return invalid date

basically all classes extends anyref implements the following method

3566294
pop-up	dialog
i have all of that done fine but now i d like to embed an image and even audio within the alert dialog that pop-up

3566308
hide	show
starting from this the element s called on find the nearest parent tr then look for the next tr meaning a brother of this parent and find an img with the class of cc and toggle its display value meaning if its visible then hide it and if its hidden show it

3566325
hide	show
.toggle - toggle it show if hidden hide if show

3566375
hash	salt
the password and salt clear values are concatenated and the resulting string is hash

3566375
hash	salt
the salt is then stored in original clear format along with the hash result

3566375
hash	salt
combine the salt from the record with the password the user provided hash the result compare the hash

3566375
hash	salt
in your database now you would store the hash and salt used

3566375
hash	salt
in either case you have to load the salt and password hash out of your database and redo the hash for comparison

3566398
width	height
if i set a fixed width they work as well but i can t set the width as fixed they need to be fluid in case the content of the tab exceeds the basic height

3566463
hash	salt
according to practical cryptography neils ferguson and bruce schneier you should use salt stretched hash for maximum security

3566478
versioning	upgrade
the third is to upgrade to a new versioning of delphi and hope that it solves your problems without creating new ones

3566497
addclass	removeclass
and addclass when dragging start with styles that couse image will be bigger and removeclass when drag stops

3566504
hash	salt
we will assume we are a corrupt webhost that has access to a database of sha1 hash and salt along with your algorithm to blend them

3566508
post	get
post full code pinvoke definitions and call to setscrollinfo to get more information

3566519
post	get
you are using the post method to send the data but then are trying to get it with the get method

3566551
hash	salt
an additional benefit of using salt is that an attacker cannot pre-compute the password hash from his dictionary

3566551
hash	salt
corollary of the article use salt hash created with bcrypt based on blowfish or eksblowfish that allows you to use a configurable setup time to make hashing slow

3566555
hash	salt
adding a salt make attacker perform hash calculation of all possible passwords even for dictionary attach this significantly increases time of attack

3566580
pbkdf2	hash
many people use pbkdf2 a key derivation function that feeds back results to the hash function thousands of times

3566580
pbkdf2	hash
key-strengthening is part of the standard key derivation algorithms pbkdf1 and pbkdf2 from pkcs #5 which make great password obfuscation algorithms the derived key is the hash

3566580
hash	salt
of course you assume the attacker has everything salt hash user name

3566582
crypt	hash
this is how the unix crypt library works and modern unix-like oses have extended this library with new hash algorithms

3566625
hash	salt
salt makes rainbow table attacks much more difficult since it makes a single password hash much harder to crack

3566625
hash	salt
now your lousy password of 1 is stored in the db as a hash of 1 plus a bunch of random characters the salt so in this example the rainbow table needs to have the hash for something like 1

3566658
converter	multibinding
second listview with converter and multibinding

3566679
width	height
basically to get the desired effect you need your 2 side parts to resize their width if their height changes in order to keep a fixed aspect ratio

3566725
listview	gridview
someone suggested using listview with a gridview grouping my items of same bar in another object this would relieve me of creating the rows dynamicly but creating the columns dynamicly seems quite complicated

3566744
hide	show
with either of these two options you would hide or show your thumbnails at the theme layer

3567222
opera	firefox
internet explorer and firefox don t have such problems while opera prevents from typing anything in

3567250
versioning	upgrade
a database obviously can have only one versioning 10.2.0.5 for example which means that upgrade and patches will affect all schemas -- this may be a bad thing in case of multiple vendor app requirement mismatch

3567297
hash	salt
with salting if the number of possible salt values substantially exceeds the number of users in the known universe each candidate password must be hash separately for each user against whom it will be tested

3567313
public	protected
but your functions and variables in the user class have to be protected or public to be accessible for the user_add class

so since you apparently start with a struct_time in utc use calendar.timegm to get the timestamp aka seconds since the epoch subtract since the units of measure are seconds and put the resulting seconds since the epoch back into a struct_time in utc with time.gmtime

3567567
post	get
this will cause the handler to respond to get requests as well as the original post xml-rpc requests

3567591
subtract	add
specifically i want to know how to code the php and mysql necessary to add and subtract votes to and from the votes table without refreshing the page

3568261
getter	setter
you can get the same effect by making your variable a private member of a class which is initialized in the constructor and for which you provide a getter but no setter

3568268
hash	md5
when you hash a string using a hash algo such as sha md5 etc. the results won t obey human language like semantics

3568296
google-chrome	firefox
the branching for google-chrome and firefox is unnecessary

3568313
width	margin
you float the left column and set margin to minimum of the width of the left column

this works by setting up a for-loop that executes the following statement or block only once with the constified variable local to loops body

3568367
oncreate	recreate
if you save in onsaveinstancestate you should recreate in oncreate

3568393
keydown	keyup
consequently any page you create with jquery keyup keydown handlers will spit endless warnings

3568407
jsf	seam
seam uses jsf so there isn t a lot of difference in protecting a jsf application and seam application from xss and csrf

3568435
translation	localization
you can also use the attribute value as a key into a localization table to make future translation to other languages easier as well or use other attributes to do things like tell your view not so show a particular field in certain circumstances

3568598
mouseout	mouseleave
.hover takes 2 arguments as well separate handlers for the mouseleave and mouseout events like this

3568599
width	height
i had a website where i simply called the command-line tools command was convert and passed the desired pixel width x height parameter to generate thumbnails for a directory of images

3568629
vmware	virtualbox
i ve successfully used both virtualbox and vmware fusion for this

3568646
jar	war
you re best off using the class or classloader .getresourceasstream filefolder myfile.txt which can read files from jar war files and returns an inputstream

3568649
tiff	png
you should select active frame page in a loop and convert each tiff page to a png

3568654
ubuntu	debian
you should check if your distribution is using the vanilla glibc or the eglibc fork debian and ubuntu have switched to eglibc

also remove width 960px and margin auto from body as you don t need them anymore

3568735
mdpi	hdpi
if the dpi is 160 then please put your images into mdpi hdpi for phones with dpi more than 240

3568743
integer	unsigned
when converting to an integer a 32-bit unsigned quantity is used to simplify internal calculations in the processor

3568744
versioning	upgrade
i can see two reason based on the info provided either its a object corruption issue due to access garbage collection or compaction in a java heap possibly perm region--just a guess based on the occupancy shown in the heap stats or may be a object corruption due to jit compiled code.first is kinda difficult to figure out because it needs the system dump analysis but looks like second one is easy to check by disabling jit using -xint option.you can try this and if it resolves the issue than possibly jit is doing something bad.you can check in the latest release if something is fixed in jit in recent time and can upgrade to latest versioning

3568824
openssl	m2crypto
you can use the m2crypto python wrapper for openssl

3568834
post	get
in a previous post i asked how to get read-only objects

3568847
equals	gethashcode
if you want them to be the same you need to override gethashcode so it is based on your field and then you should remember to override equals also

3568873
union	distinct
the union query returns distinct values

3568895
ubuntu	debian
under debian and ubuntu s default configuration sites are loaded in alphabetical order using apache s include directive so you can change the order in which your sites load by changing their names

3568958
postgresql	mysql
ideally use the native unique integer generator sqlite mysql auto_increment oracle postgresql sequences sql server identity for the primary key

3568967
subtract	add
i would think that the extra variable retrieval would add time not subtract it

3568974
ubuntu	linux
i am running this java application on ubuntu linux

3568974
profiler	yourkit
i am using yourkit profiler

3569041
int	double
i have already converted a string and int into their respective hex values but a double seems to be much more tricky

3569092
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

3569092
keydown	keyup
for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

3569120
min	max
you need to use an aggregate function such as min or max to pick a value that represents the collection and use that value for the ordering

3569148
accessor	properties
your properties could also have accessor only

3569148
getter	setter
the problem with this however is properties that have different getter setter name

3569217
folder	directory
i was making a bash script for my server which pack some directory with rar and upload it to other ftp server so some folder are big and i have to rar them in parts and have to wait for all parts to be rared before uploading them which consumes lots of time and space

3569224
folder	directory
simply create a java directory under main src main java and right-click - build path - use a source folder

3569226
base	fractions
you can convert base 10 to base 16 by continually multiplying the fractions by 16 stripping out the whole number and repeating with the remainder

3569272
public	protected
in order to access these from within c methods they would have to have been originally declared as public or protected rather than private but that is not good design

3569290
single-quotes	double-quotes
it appears to be mixing the double-quotes and single-quotes

3569336
post	put
we were thinking maybe we should put a post build copy to copy the app.config out to the ui directory when the application is built - is that the right way to do this or is there a better way

inherited	properties
multiple inherited basically produces an object with more than one set of properties

3569430
nstextview	nsscrollview
it s as if the nsscrollview and the nstextview aren t aware of each other

3569443
super	self
if self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

3569444
children	parent
i don t know why you re keen to use the bin lib folder -- it makes more sense to have them point at things explicity rather than having parent projects export into children .

3569465
hash	salt
also - one more imporatant point - using a user-specific salt prevents the detection of two users with the same password - their hash would match

3569465
hash	salt
that s why many times the hash is hash salt + username + password

3569513
width	height
let s say you want to give it a width of 500px and you want the height to be static at 300px

3569513
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
without the margin the element s top left corner will be 50 from the top and 50 from the left so we need to use margin to move it back half of it s width and half it s height

3569529
inherited	properties
there are inherited read-only properties which you can t apply for new instance manually

3569575
webclient	httpwebrequest

from the c++ 1998 standard 3.9.1 4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer. note that integer here refers to any integer type rather than just int

3569585
try-catch	exception-handling
but if there s an exception-handling in your first catch client may not be instantiated and your second try-catch will result in an npe

3569597
onfocus	onblur
i could come up with a javascript and use onblur and onfocus but that would be troublesome and i hope unnecessary

3569677
post	get
i quickly realized that parameters passed via get post could change the result provided making the result-set irrelevant

3569694
onfocus	onblur
you can find all of your input and textarea elements using document.getelementsbytagname and add the onfocus and onblur handlers to each of those using dom events

3569722
put	get
so the contents will get put into the form scope if i m understanding all of the scattered docs correctly

3569751
width	height
i generally want my text to fill a certain rectangle of the screen as well as possible i want the text to get as close to the full height of the rectangle without the width of the text going outside the rectangle but i m not sure how i would do this

3569815
put	get
you can get around this by moving your code to after the element is created in your html or put it within a dom loaded event listener

3569831
ftp	telnet
example using command line telnet and ftp commands

3569878
width	height

3569881
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome everything is just fine

3569882
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

3569903
inherited	properties
this included changing it to inherited from nsmanagedobject changing my properties to dynamic removing release calls etc

3569934
mp3	wav
the 2 main audio file formats i ll be using are wav and mp3

3570160
range	max
specified date range max upto 1

3570261

3570287
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar java.util.date

3570288

my .vimrc had called helptags i thought it would be a great idea to put it there anyway once i removed that helptags call the error went away and i still could get help on dbext from vim

3570451
width	height
the better way to handle that is to have the hover pseudo selector applied to only the a element and make set display block on it with height and width set to 100

3570471
integer	fractions
i understand that gl_repeat parameter will ignore the integer portion of the texture coordinate only the fractions part is used when doing texture mapping

3570473
int	boolean
you may first use r to convert keys to a coherent interval of int as.numeric factor ... and then use boolean array in c to obtain unique key number easily and very fast

3570489
mef	prism
both prism and mef were originated by microsoft

3570500
hide	show
you should instead use a popup control that you show and hide when appropriate

3570520

hexadecimal is very convenient for computers because 16 is a power of 2 and an 8-bit byte thus takes exactly two hex digits to encode and each hex digit encodes exactly four binary digits

3570548
subtract	add
in order to add or subtract 32 you first must know whether the character is greater or less than a

udp	tcp
both tcp and udp are used to communicate between the client api and the server

3570685
udp	tcp
question i would like to be able to pin my tcp and udp connections to specific local network interfaces

3570688
ienumerable	ienumerator
hence the class can implicitly implement only one and must hide the other or both since one can always cast the result an to the result-type of the other an ienumerator then the most sensible behaviour is generally to implicitly implement the version and explicitly implement the ienumerable one normally by returning the result of the other

3570718
uiview	subviews
in my iphone app i have a uiviewcontroller with two subviews a main uiview let s call it mainview and a secondary uiview let s call it secondview which is usually hidden but is sometimes shown user settings

3570718
uiview	subviews
when the user switches to the subviews i call and when the user switches back to the main uiview i call

3570724
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
a sortedlist or sorteddictionary would have the items sorted so you can try to get the key at the bottom of your range then traverse the elements to the top of your range

3570733
textarea	pre
the advantage is that said filter does a nice job of saving and then restoring the code blocks where you might want to leave whitespace alone - inside script pre and textarea elements i dd add the code element to the list too

3570762
terminate	timeout
i wanted to know if there was a way to set a read timeout or terminate the connection after a certain amount of time of nothing in the socket

3570892
pull	push
by binary parsing composing i mean creating a new tree of parsers composers that holds and reads data for these objects and passing this around to have my objects push pull their data

3570924
getter	setter
one case i found hiding base member useful is when you have a base interface which exposes a getter on a property but the derived interface wants to expose a setter

3570937
inherited	properties
side all the properties inherited from event eventid copyeventid

3570951
folder	directory

3571292
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
for #1 you ll have to configure the maven-jar-plugin in the pom.xml of my-logic

3571362
free	malloc
if the buffer needs a different lifetime to have a size known only at run time or to live and die in response to external events at run time then it should be allocated on the heap with malloc and friends and released eventually with free or possibly the termination of the process

3571364
sorting	grouping
text and blob are essentially identical except that text fields are subject to character set limitations and character set is taken into account while sorting grouping the fields while blobs are stored verbatim as a sequence of bytes and will not be transformed

3571402
innodb	myisam
myisam versus innodb

3571408
innodb	myisam
the main difference is that innodb supports transactions but myisam does not

3571419
awt	swing
from what i know and have been reading converting from awt to swing seems to be quite mechanical

3571419
awt	swing
with the exception of the different threading model most of swing components generally map well with the awt ones

3571442
awt	swing
why a script changing awt to swing component names will not be sufficient

3571442
awt	swing
scrolling is different between an awt textarea built-in swing jtextarea wrapped in a jscrollpane

3571442
awt	swing
override paint graphics in awt paintcomponent graphics in swing

3571528
opera	safari
your safari opera window is closed

3571539
getter	setter
it seems that setting the right getter setter for your member variable with property is the right way to go more than just declaring it private in the interface

3571547
hash	salt
but note that in that case you should hash the password again with a different salt before comparing it with the database value

3571586

3571653
catransition	subviews
i want add subviews with animation like catransition but with this class we have only several different animation type

3571687
children	parent
the above logic avoids the need for the parent thread to join the child thread yet allows the parent thread to block until all the children are done

3571721
mouseover	mouseout
instead of mouseout and mouseover which fire even when entering a child you can use .hover like this

3571721
mouseleave	mouseenter
.hover maps to the mouseenter and mouseleave events which don t fire when entering leaving children which is what s causing the double animation in your current code

3571729
put	get
you ll get an error about trying to put attributes under the document element.

3572374
memcpy	memmove
memmove can be turned into a memcpy if the two memory regions don t overlap

3572374
memcpy	memmove
memmove doesn t depend on the way the stack grows at all - it merely copies one region of memory to another location - exactly like memcpy except that it handles overlapping regions and memcpy doesn t

3572379
x86	64bit
i believe the reason for the warning is that in x86 builds the __declspec dllexport is exporting the decorated name with a leading underscore but the 64bit compiler does not decorate names with a leading underscore leading to the duplicate

3572383
int	chars
no you re taking an int and are casting it to a chars which is a high-level concept and will internally most likely be done in registers

3572393

-p cleaner way to get distinct interpretations of the same memory is to use a union

3572512
put	get
oh and if you are using django s test server i don t know how to get it to recognize these or if it even can but all you need is to run an apache server on your local machine and then put the files in the localhost directory and you can include them through localhost by including their full path in the template also something i do is use amazon s3 to host files since you then get a url for them on there not that you asked about this but its a quick way to host files if you don t have apache running locally

3572518

width and height always have plausible values and allocating 5-10 blocks of 30 to 120 kib should not be an issue on a machine with 3 gb of ram

3572533
width	height
width 211 height 484 size 306372

3572533
width	height

width	height
width 14 height 346 size 14532

3572568
for-loop	loops
i assume you are talking about the practice of using inside of a for-loop in order to preserve the current value of loops when that inner function later executes.

3572574
int	double
i mean if i want to specify each function and each variable in my code what should it take and what its type int double ...etc .

3572620
children	parent
using startactivityforresult you can create a hierarchy in your program so that resources used by parent are not deleted until all children are destroyed

3572652
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
in other words unichar is an alias to the primitive integer type unsigned short

3572709

3572762
serializable	deserialization
you might want to consider using thrift which includes socket communication libraries and server libraries with the serializable deserialization

3572799
int	chars
if the file is in text format you may be able to fit it in memory just by converting things to int as you read them in since an int stored as chars may take more space than an int stored as an int depending on the size of the int and the type of text file

3572807
min	max
take midpoint of min and max and get count min and max for values either side of the midpoint - by again reading through the file

3572807
min	max
repeat for the partition taking into account size of partitions to the left easy to maintain and also watching for min max

3572814
g++	gcc
i++ ++ shouldn t work with either gcc or g++ whether or not they are parsing the file as c or c++ in both languages postfix increment requires an lvalue as an operand and the result is an rvalue

3572829
jqplot	flot
i am sure flot is a very good library but plugins add-ons are not available easily and the examples given on the website are very basic so i decided to use jqplot instead

3572949
children	parent
personally i probably do this by creating a custom control with an item property and some sort of either parent or children property

3572949
children	parent
the control would display details on item and then use a repeater to show each element in parent children where for each item the repeater recursively uses the same control to render the item

3572967
metaphone	soundex
check out double metaphone an improved soundex from 1990

3573019
maven	buildr
you could use the maven scala plugin or the buildr tool

3573211
src	attr
my brainiac thought was to add that snippet of code this attr src

3573236
accessor	properties
with automatic kvo support people could simply declare properties for the operation lifecycle flags isexecuting etc. and trigger the kvo events through the accessor ie

3573247
memcpy	strncpy
also note that i ve used memcpy instead of strncpy to move data to the buffer

3573323
hide	show
this will hide all the images then show it when it loads completely

3573445
inherited	properties
i have a set of nested ant build files and i need to control which properties are inherited by each sub task

3573445
inherited	properties
i m trying to define these as propertysets to keep the code manageable but these are not inherited by subtasks unlike properties

3573445
inherited	properties
if i define each properties to be inherited explicitly like they get inherited by the bottom project too

3573527
cos	sin
but if you link against it and use cos you don t end up with a copy of the code for sin or tan unless you also called those functions

3573550
memcached	apc
what i did is implement a fast ring-buffer for messages and status information in shared memory sysv back in the day - today i would probably use apc or memcached

3573550
fflush	gets
all operations write and read in the buffer and the buffer itself gets periodicaly fflush into the database to persist it but alot less often than once per second per user

3573583
post	get
ajax doesnâ t actually post forms to the server it sends selected data to in the form of a post or get request

3573612

my calculation for width and height were of by one so i needed to change my reallocmem-line to

3573632
pascal	delphi
online code beautifier and formatter for delphi or pascal

3573637
postgresql	mysql
now i have to do this query in mysql but it seems that the query from postgresql has not the same syntax

3573640
getter	setter
you can add logic to the setter to the getter and more

3573668
width	height
i tried with a tablelayout and 3 tablerows but i can t change width height at runtime

3573705
accessor	properties
beside the advantages of encapsulation we prefer using properties with get and set accessor among many other ways because they provide a clear and practical syntax

3573718
junit	testng
junit is famous and best unit test tools i think you and me both know junit is so important so that java developer changes their coding pattern as junit contribution you can learn some junit as basic unit test technology as well as learn testng as second unit test technology

3573731
division	multiplication
a pure regular expression solution is a bit inelegant because it has to repeat captures multiple times to accomodate multiplication and division

3573740
width	height
after all rotations find a block that have highest height width ratio and rotate initial letter to that position

3573753
sdl	clutter	clutter	cairo
i ve explored various libraries for 2d graphics cairo sdl openframeworks clutter but clutter seemed to be the most optimised for accelerated graphics and vector drawing

3573789
portrait	landscape
when uploaded using bestfit there is a lot of whitespace on the sides of the image depending on portrait or landscape

3573789
width	height
what i d rather it did was resize to fill the entire area no whitespace and crop the longer length height or width ie i d rather lose some image than have whitespace

3573855
submit	submission
turns out the problem was because i d previously had my input fields inside a set of tags and jquery was dutifully submission my content - which doesn t need the projectid explicitly passed since that is part of the query string and is handled by mvc - and then upon seeing the form was actioning a submit call which redirected back to the same page

3573913
getter	setter
i would just say that using getter and setter on private fields give you more control over those fields

3573913
getter	setter
you may want to allow only to read values and not update them then you can have only getter and no setter

3573928
x86	64bit
that is because 64bit windows can run 32 bit x86 by emulating a 32 bit os

3573931
filesystems	ntfs
most likely the filesystems is ntfs or fat32

3573934
folder	directory
it looks like you haven t used the iis management tool to make the folder into an application virtual directory

3573934
folder	directory
does seem to indicate that the folder isn t setup as a virtual directory application as the section should be changeable

3573940

3574216
google-chrome	firefox
and also it left the link markup there as well meaning together w the jquerified tab and doesn t work at all in ie8 and inconsistent with firefox and google-chrome

3574222
passenger	thin
the primary thing is you cannot chain your rails application directly with web-server so the hoster should support one of these servers passenger thin mongrel and so on

3574357

3574476
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql derby firebird etc and matching jdbc drivers

the best you could do is write a custom action that walks your featuretree and disables parent when children and not set to install

3574522
ant	maven
use ant or maven to build the war file and deploy it by hand

3574530
folder	directory

3574598
mouseup	mousedown
i am looking for an nsbutton raising the click event on mouseup even if the mousedown has been made outside the button

3574611

if you need an advance analysis -- beyond grouping joining filtering -- just go for free mining tools such as wekka rapid miner based on wekka but nicer gui or knime

3574618
uilabel	uitextview
where datedisplay projectnamedisplay taskdisplay durationdisplay are all uilabel and commenttext is a uitextview

3575016
children	parent
i found that the other selectors were parent of my #connectionscount element so i needed to check the children

3575132
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
generally speaking when you add a uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller that viewcontroller is retained and you should release it

3575137
sysv	systemd
assuming you re on a systemd that allows sysv ipc calls you can use ipc sharelite to share a chunk of memory between the two processes

3575152

maybe loc.lenght is returning 0 in ie 8 and google-chrome but null in firefox which would break the whole calculation

3575296
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have a tabcontrol on a user-controls backed by a viewmodel and the visibility of one of the tab items is bound to a property on the viewmodel

3575312
int	chars
for example it is possible reinterpreting a chars array as an int array could cause the target architecture to throw an interrupt because different types may have different alignment rules

3575349
hide	show
some parts of my dropdown menu overlap the div and causes the menu to blink hide under the pdf then show on top as you scroll over it

3575373
udp	mtu
using udp with localhost is at least an order of magnitude faster than over a network connection maybe two orders of magnitude and i believe with localhost there is no mtu ceiling of 1500 as normally exists for network ports

3575373
udp	mtu
with udp i have to hand it a packet at a time limited by the mtu size resulting in a much larger number of os calls

3575455
put	get
any dba worth his salt however will cluster differently but folks who don t pay attention to that clustering and who also use uuids guids in the microsoft world tend to get some nasty slowdowns on insert-heavy databases because the clustered index has to be recomputed every insert and if it s clustered against a uuid which could put the new key in the middle of the clustered sequence a lot of data could potentially need to be rearranged to maintain the clustered index

3575515
lxml	beautifulsoup
but i looked at beautifulsoup and lxml and didn t find something that will help to parse it

3575534
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade to a new versioning of java or some other library sometimes a method or a class you were using becomes deprecated

3575552

since post request is separate i have to do all the stuff i already did in a get request again

3575711
opera	firefox
i m opera user for browsing and firefox user for developing

3575726
groupbox	panel
you will need to write a recursive function to find all of the buttons probably though since a panel or groupbox etc contains a controls property for all of its controls

3575745
jlabel	jeditorpane
it contains one north readonly jeditorpane one center jpanel with a flowlayout whereby jbuttons are added dynamically and one south jlabel all added in that order

3575764
google-chrome	firefox
if you use google-chrome you can use the developer-view or you can install firebug for firefox

3575800
post	get
will post here a link as soon as i get the changes

3575801
versioning	upgrade
it prevents downgrades giving a localised error message and also prevents upgrading an already existing identical versioning only lower versioning are upgrade

3575896
sudo	passwd
if you have administrator privileges you can execute a sudo chmod on the file and set it to read only if you want but you shouldn t make your app ask the user for their passwd

3575945
prepare	execute
when i set out yesterday to change my old mysql code to mysqli the docs steered me down the road of prepare bind_params and execute

3575960
exponent	modulo
you need first to extract the modulo and public exponent from the xml

3575960
exponent	modulo
the php pear crypt_rsa module can construct rsa public keys from modulo and exponent but its tostring method uses a custom format just the base64-encoding of the result of php serialize on the array structure which has nothing to do with the asn.1 der encoding

3575968
width	height
i also do have an rectangle with known width and height

3575978
pop-up	dialog
this will pop-up a dialog allowing you to add a project from elsewhere in source control

not surprisingly it works great in firefox and google-chrome but ie mangles the result where a profile pic appears to be set to float over the other fields and i ve got three other divs status-content status-txt msgft containing content from a database that i m not even sure where they are going

3576027
google-chrome	firefox
here is what it a pic of the render issue with ie8 on top and google-chrome firefox on the bottom

3576054

properties supplied to the ant task inherited all the way down as you say so you only need to change top.xml

3576072
google-chrome	firefox
but this event is fired to early google-chrome firefox and ie

3576132
uiview	subviews
i simply add the scroll view as a subviews of the uiview and it appears just fine however when i scroll it it moves outside of the bounds of that uiview effectively covering up any ui elements that are placed above it

3576137
stdout	stderr
since stdout file descriptor 1 and stderr file descriptor 2 are valid for the whole process and you can t make one part of the program have it point to a different file there s only one way to do it use dup 2 to duplicate them and use those file descriptors in your own code

3576147
google-chrome	firefox
also firefox and google-chrome allow to loop through .style property the same way as looping through an array

3576157

3576361
width	height
after looking over the interwebs it looks like for some reason wpf doesnt support this kind of usage with 2d controls like silverlight does however after scouring i managed to find thriple which looked like it was what i wanted however i find trying to create my ui in the xaml editor a nightmare with it as it seems to stretch and skew everything and ignores the width height as if it is automatically scaling everything

3576368
put	get
sadly the process wordpad in fact get s injected with this dll but dies of a terminal death - heh a lethal injection to put it another way.

3576372
innodb	myisam
this being mysql you can t use transactions with myisam tables you ll need the tables to use some engine that supports this probably innodb

3576374
serializable	deserialization
it is a bad idea to try to serializable these objects but if you change the inner class so that it is static deserialization may work

3576380
unix	solaris
i use the following sed command in unix solaris

3576842
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade php to 5.3 versioning at debian lenny from squeeze packages

3576853
sorting	filtering
by putting the datatable that the grid is bound to in the viewstate and then reading sorting filtering it as necessary - and rebinding to the grid

3576880
keydown	keyup
you can create a generic keydown and keyup handler that you attach to each form

3576880
keydown	keyup
for every keyup event make sure you are removing from the list you only need to check for the shortcut on keydown additions

3576901
inherited	properties
i thought one could create a class and let it inherited the properties of another using such syntax which is evidently not the case

3576977
sorting	filtering
the user can manipulate the query by filtering or sorting

3577012
int	double
if you are only using int then use varchar not nvarchar nvarchar uses double the storage of varchar...of course if you properly normlized the db you would not have these problems

3577052
int	boolean
each day contains an int for the day of week a collection of timespans which define good calling hours for that day an a collection of boolean flags which define which shortcut groups of times were selected morning afternoon evening etc

implements	extends
as far as i understand a clase implements or extends abstract or interface class has to use the default methods

3577096
implements	extends
i know we can use implements keyword to use multiple interfaces but we only can extends 1 abstract

3577120
inherited	properties
this allowed for inherited of default monster properties

3577140
16-bit	64bit
various types of pointers were common on 16-bit systems though near fear distinctions could reappear in 64bit systems depending upon how they re implemented i wouldn t be surprised if many development systems go to 64bit pointers for everything despite the fact that in many cases that will be very wasteful

3577141
subclass	abstract-class
a completely different abstract-class unrelated to the interface with a subclass which implements our interface

3577151
implements	extends
it all boils down to the fact that extends is a is-a relationship while implements is a has-a relationship

3577178
stdout	stderr
when you start java redirect both outputs stdout and stderr to a file

3577226
inherited	properties
you want the class .c to inherited all the properties and values of .a and .b

inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
if you look at the setter for the said items property you ll see that it has special logic that checks if the given ilist is of type inotifycollectionchanged it will attach an event listener

3577291
hide	show
setting it to hidden will simply hide anything outside the bounds but you can also set it to other values to automatically show scrollbars etc

so i wanted a centered constant width three-column layout that was compatible with ie and whose columns would stretch to all be of equal height equal to the height of whichever column had the tallest content

3577515
width	text-align	width	margin	margin	text-align
after combining the techniques i found here on stack overflow with a nifty css hack for fixing width issues and the text-align trick for centering as well as experimenting with different margin padding values i have a nearly perfect layout

nsentitydescription	nsmanagedobjectmodel
namely the first problem and i stopped there is that you re trying to create an nsmanagedobjectmodel instance from an nsentitydescription

3578425
matplotlib	mplot3d
first off i think mplot3d worked a bit differently in matplotlib version 0.99 than it does in the current version of matplotlib

3578433
lisp	scheme
if you want a path of lower resistance and you re doing this to understand concepts rather than something you need for a class or work projects look at an alternative to c such as lisp or scheme that will make it easier to build on small experiments

3578437
installation	upgrade
schema upgrade is potentially part of the installation anyway

3578496
typedef	typename
typename is the answer to at least 50 of all c++-template-related questions - it tells the compiler that what follows is always a type regardless of the template parameters valueit could for example be a int instead of a typedef for an iterator

3578574
integer	fractions
the fractions module seems to only convert to fractions not from and requires a string or integer

jobs	cron
until now we haven t really needed to implement a queue system in our infrastructure but now we need some features that cannot be done thru cron jobs too slow

3578727
httphandler	httpmodule
the usual place to implement this is either using a httpmodule httphandler or overriding page.initializeculture

3578771
jar	war
it is packaged as a war file but every example included with the seam download seem to be packaged in an ear with the seam jar and application code both deployed as ejbs

3578777
post	get
in the second i can t seem to get the login page to post to the login post action let alone make it beyond that

3578944
equals	gethashcode
also equals and gethashcode yes they are overridden

3578958
background-repeat	background-position
also it s probably useful to know that ie6 this png fix won t work with background-position or background-repeat

3578994
int	boolean
you could change the boolean foundit to int count and increment where you set foundit to true

3579000
put	get
if it s in prerender then that s before viewstate is initialized so you re not reloading the data on a postback and you re also not able to get from viewstate because it s not put in there

3579000
post	get
the biggest reason this is a way better solution in general aside from fixing your issue is that your viewstate doesn t get bloated unnecessarily with all your items base64-encoded to boot while still being able to track the selected item in the dropdown turning off viewstate for dropdowns makes it so you can t track your selected item without having to resort to viewing the form post value directly

3579010
rss	feed
i need to complete an rss reader for iphones application a relatively simple one which parses the rss feed displays it in a navigation-table view and when you click on an article you are taken to a main page

3579217
ant	maven
we currently have an ant based project and are contemplating moving to maven

3579219
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a javascript keyboard that seeks to enable users to type in various african languages.currently this works fine in ie8 and firefox but not google-chrome and i m actually stuck on this one.what i want to accomplish is for example to type on my physical keyboard q keycode 113 and get é keycode 603 as the output but currently my code does nothing in google-chrome

3579224
int	chars
if you mean that you have an array of int and that you want to print the chars representation of these int assuming it is possible you could try something like

3579224
int	chars
by the way it is not a conversion between and but between int and chars

3579238
getter	setter
edit i should mention that adding the getter does make it work but the getter is getting hit whenever the setter does

3579243
int	double
also there seem to be places in the code where there are floats double being compared with may be int

3579253
nsstring	nsxmlparser
edit to parse the xml within an nsstring you can use the nsxmlparser class

3579286
equals	gethashcode
to elaborate the tuple class provides a proper implementation of gethashcode and equals that respects the values you pass in

3579299

the best thing i ve come up with at the moment is which pipes both stdout and stderr to dev null

3579366
put	get
so i get the same thing and when i put django admin in the installed_apps it doesn t fail anymore because the admin module comes with the missing templates and handlers that the tests were complaining about

3579375
post	get
using a http post the values could be passed as key value pairs instead of in the url but in most cases where the operation is idempotent you d most likely want to use get in which case there is no other way

3579382
stdout	stderr
if you don t care about the error itself it is just a warning message by all means re-direct the stdout stderr of the command

3579394
int	double
it s easy to insert standard app settings int double string etc

3579394

draggable	droppable
using jquery ui give each row in the table an indication of what row it is and use the accept option of droppable to limit where a specific draggable can be dropped

3579602
draggable	droppable
the accept function checks if the droppable td element s row number is the same as the row number the draggable comes from

3579628
uiview	subviews
i think you could iterate through the subviews property in any uiview then to check if it s specifically a uibutton you can use - bool iskindofclass class aclass

3579663
udp	tcp
http servers use the tcp protocol and broadcast packets can only be sent through the stateless udp protocol

3579690
folder	directory
the view for the error page is in the shared directory of the views folder

3579692
margin	height
i think that it s really important to know how the box-model works and how to make it work for you in all browsers - there are a few really simple fundamental rules which when obeyed help you to ensure that your x-broswer testing is pain-free - knowing how to add padding or margin to something without breaking your layout allows you to be exact with your designs - i used to leave 20 pixels extra horizontal space in my containers as a way of making my columns never dropped off the edge of a page but now that i know how the box-model works i can use the exact widths height padding and margin that are detailed in the mock-ups that i m given

3579705
uiview	calayer
during initialization use cgbitmapcontextcreate to create at least 2 bitmap contexts from pointers to off-screen memory buffers and add a calayer as a sublayer of your uiview

3579736
pop-up	dialog
the client requested that if the user attempted to close the dialog before all the documents are requested then the user is prompted with a confirm option of ok and cancel.i implemented this fine with an actual close button on the form which shows a conform pop-up and if the user clicks ok then the window is closed with a javascript hack

3580086
pop-up	dialog
i mean well the following process i click on the menu file on the main window as most gui application looks then open then a file directory dialog pop-up then i select a file then i click okay on that dialog then i want that this file s name would appear on the listctrl on this main window displaying which file i had select

user upgrade to full versioning but you don t copy over the data per your quoted passage above

3580403
division	modulo
if so it s not too bad - play around with division modulo and adding ascii 0

3580429
addition	multiplication
another instance of the same intermediate precision problem is when the compiler uses the fmadd instruction for what is a multiplication followed by an addition in the source code if the target architecture has itâ for instance powerpc

3580430
uiview	calayer
you best bet may be to pre-render the new pdf images at the new scale factor into another offscreen calayer before the uiview setneedsdisplay give it time to upload to the gpu you may have to profile tune for the bus bandwidth of the worse case device you support and then finish your view animation while quickly flipping between old and new calayers

3580471
radiobuttonlist	onclientclick
i found i could just add a onclientclick attribute to the radiobuttonlist and it would fire the javascript client side as expected

3580589
uitableview	nsindexpath
i think i can reproduce this behaviour by storing the nsindexpath of the last-tapped item and use uitableview s scrolltorowatindexpath atscrollposition animated to jump it to the correct place before after device rotation but i am hoping that this is already done automatically on the apple side of things if i flip the right switch

3580590
folder	directory
it will print all the directory and files in the given folder

3580593

implements	extends
i ve started extends this behaviour to turn css 3 selectors multi browser compatible using a lot of recipes that the compass framework implements

i think its elegant and logical if you have checkbox for the meals and then radio button or lists for the size.

3587429
stateless	stateful
ejb3 stateless and stateful bean are actually pojo with some annotations and they don t have any big difference with normal classes

3587429
stateless	stateful
stateless or stateful

3587435
width	height
note it probably makes sense to implement grid.shallowcopy by just having solver have arguments for the width and the height of the grid

3587463
post	get
i post this as an answer though i realize now the question was not formulated properly as i got thrown in a loop because the .net example i had was actually performing a hack to get around the problem

3587480

vb6	vba
here s what appears to be a bubblesort algorithm implementation for vba vb6

3587725
stateless	stateful
i m not an expert on java and java app servers but what you get there in the context of an application server is kind of combination of servlets jsp talking to objects javabeans - here object pooling caching comes into place as well as stateful stateless beans etc.

3587773
put	get
so i guess i need to put one of those #if lines in so i can get it to do different things based on the os version.

3587792
put	get
to get around this i use a method like the following in my application i put it into applicationcontroller so it s accessible in all my controllers

3587793

instead of copying php.ini files over from old php versioning whenever i upgrade php i would like to be able to download the newest php-recommended.ini file from somewhere by itself

3588050
children	parent
when you say built up from the leaves i guess you re including the fact that the constructor takes children but never takes a parent

3588090
retaincount	dealloc
now i first noticed a problem whenever the normalgameclass dealloc function was not being called so i did some retaincount calls and for some reason once it makes its way back to the release function in mainmenu its retain count is 6

fink	homebrew
besides fink yet another distributor of open source packages for os x has arisen in the mean time homebrew

3588593
macports	homebrew
in my opinion macports is probably the most actively maintained these days and has at least unofficial support from apple but homebrew has been gaining in popularity for its minimalist approach

3588722

3588779
pop-up	dialog
i am now able to make the authentication dialog pop-up and obtain privileges like so

3588827
width	height
if the width and height are supposed to be constants you can move them out of smoke and just declare them as constants if they need to be members of smoke but are still constants then just declare them as then #include smoke.h in your particle.cpp and reference it as smoke width

3588827
width	height
if each smoke object needs its own width then you need to tell the particle object which smoke it needs or pass in the width and height to the particle constructor

3588899
google-chrome	safari
the following script works on google-chrome and safari but not ipad safari

3588907
for-loop	arrays
the three arrays variables row pic_title row pic_brief row pic_detail does not parse as the value in the function in first for-loop instead it just print the string and hence is not able to fetch the value stored in the database

3588963
post	get
i can not seem to understand how you connect any post to the user and display them a post is successfully created with the user id and then the users id is queried to get his or her name.

3589015
implements	extends
the view class does not implements a gettext method while textview extends view and implements the gettext method

3589099
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in both firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 6.0

3589099
google-chrome	firefox
i haven t verified it with other browsers yet but the fact that two browsers using completely different engines exhibit the same behavior indicates i am doing something bad not just a bug with firefox or google-chrome

3589099
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t do this though only firefox

3589155
children	parent
the logic in my javascript tries to figure out if children are overlapping each other since they get dynamic content that i can t predict in an absolute layout container and then adjusts the parent s css dimensions and sibbling s css that need to shift down

3589156
getter	setter
i use the following notation to group getter and setter of properties along with declaration of the property although the same notation could be extended for your use

3589158
ati	nvidia
i hear nvidia graphics cards will actually allow this method but ati will not

3589159
int	chars
it s not valid to input a chars into an int directly like that

3589340
versioning	upgrade
i was having similar problems with ctypes when i was trying to use h5py i had to recompile the .deb to get with the latest versioning of numpy and also there was major issues with weave that the latest upgrade fixed

3589380
codeigniter	cakephp
i have tried for some time codeigniter was pretty good have looked at cakephp and used symfony which is pretty neat

3589380
put	get
personally i think it was a real pity this didn t get put in much to a lot of debate

3589418
addition	multiplication
it s not obvious as rounding after multiplication which we avoid tends to be less problematic than rounding after addition which we don t

3589438
multiplying	add
rather than take 1 cycle for the multiplying and then 1 cycle for the add the fpu can issue both operations in the same cycle

3589466
width	height
get any uicomponent width and height by using

3589469
ssl	https
use ssl which is what an https request would involve

3589490
width	height
an instance of the smoke class will be needed if you would like to access width and height as they are currently defined because they are part of the smoke class

3589496
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

though i can run the same application on 64bit by changing the plaform to x86 but if i change the platform to any cpu its not working

3589542
boost	stl
if 80 of clients would be better of using boost stl c++ compliant then please do so

3589557
width	height
it took basically 100 seconds to get width and height of remote images

3589562
maven	m2e
i use maven 2 with plain eclipse java ee no m2e and tomcat

3589568
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have a tabcontrol that creates tab pages from a user-controls i created a separate form in vb.net using this code maintab is the separate user-controls i created which has text boxes etc in it

3589597
maven	m2e
the other point is that if you use an ide with incremental compilation and maven support like eclipse + m2e then you should be able to set up edit compile hot deploy and test

3589688
super	implements	inherited	subclassing
if you call from your subclassing the runtime will climb the inherited hierarchy looking for a class that implements that method starting with super

3589688
super	implements
if super doesn t implements initwithframe the runtime will keep climbing until it eventually finds and invokes the default implementation in uiview

3589690
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer types have two important properties that differentiate them from signed integer types shifted range no negative subrange but positive subrange twice as wide and modulo arithmetic

3589690
integer	unsigned
for integer types these properties are important enough to justify the existence of unsigned types

3589690
integer	unsigned	floating-point	integer
it should also be noted that the above reasoning should probably be used as rationale behind introducing unsigned integer types and not introducing unsigned floating-point types in popular hardware and corresponding hardware-derived standards

3589692
post	get
i am not asking for complete code which obviously i wont get but if you do have any coding to support the approach please be kind enough to post it

3589707
iboutlet	ibaction
i ve been doing some research and i added an ibaction in the uiviewcontroller for uitextfield touchdown event and the iboutlet for the uitexfield

3589767
ubuntu	linux
i would suggest using ubuntu as the linux platform

3589784
queue	fifo
a circular linked list can be effectively used to create a queue fifo or a deque efficient insert and remove from front and back

3589820
ws-addressing	soap
another soap idea is using ws-addressing but it is not really meant for load balancing

3589863
width	height
when i give multiple effects like height 140 and width 200 then the next effects start only after the previous effects finish

3589870
google-chrome	safari
built in developer tools in google-chrome and safari

3589870
profiling	debugging
these are all free tools available to you and work great when profiling debugging javascript

3589874
grizzly	netty
as far as java network frameworks go people seem to have pretty good experiences with netty mina or grizzly but going that low-level will probably cause you grief

3589921
client-side	server-side
i m wanting to deliver some data from the server-side to some client-side javascript which can use said data to construct a database table and then query it using some user-input sql

3589930
ant	maven
maven can be considered as complete project development tool not just build tool like ant

3589961
prepare	execute
i am writing a software that requires me to prepare statements and set the values execute the query and get results within a loop

3589973
versioning	upgrade
the only explanation i can think of is that your firefox versioning is outdated and you need to upgrade

3589974
ant	maven
and to my experience modular maven builds using binary dependencies gives me faster build time than typical monolithic ant builds

3589976
division	modulo
i know what modulo division is

3590007
division	modulo
if you are looking at it as a mathematical operation then it s just a modulo division

3590076
google-chrome	safari
the safari and google-chrome developer tools are excellent

3590095
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
this works fine in safari opera and google-chrome

3590096
width	height
it s a better idea to use some kind of script which will get a few thousand bytes from the given file and get the width height from the jpeg gif etc

3590150
devise	cancan
cancan is an authorization solution that can be used in tandem with devise - check out the railscast this plugin again works great with rails 3

3590207
visualvm	jprofiler
jprofiler visualvm etc

3590210
hash	md5
suppose the password is mypassword then don t just store it hash it first using an algorithm like md5 then store the hash which is deb1536f480475f7d593219aa1afd74c in your database

3590212
hash	md5
normally you would store a hash of the passwords in the database see md5 however this doesn t make it secure between the webpage and server - for this you need to use https

3590228
hbase	hypertable
and unless you already have a tremendous amount of data and hit a wall in regards to processing speeds and resource usage i wouldn t go for a column based db hbase hypertable

3590240
ubuntu	linux
if you want to set your timezone on a server-wide basis you ll probably find plenty of answers on serverfault.com such as setting time zone on linux ubuntu

3590250
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie6 is already done and also firefox google-chrome safari opera etc.

3590312
floating-point	integer
i am assuming that by decimal value you really mean floating-point value in which case you can not use the integer arithmetic facilities as you ve done

3590314
int	double
x will be copied to double - make sure it s not bigger than max_value a will be int maximum 2147483647 but the bigdecimal.pow doesn t support int more than a billion anyway and b will be double always less than 1

3590344
apache	nginx
how you do this is rather specific to your current load balancing setup apache squid nginx etc

3590381
post	get
jqgrid has three important parameter mtype which are typically get or post datatype withe the values like xml or json and url parameter

3590381
post	get
so you can implement a servlet in java see how to learn ajax using jquery in a java web app for example which could be the only active component in your solution which bound to the url defined by url and editurl and support http get or post depend of your mtype choice

3590422
post	get
and realised that it is not possible to hide any information through a get post method

3590436
division	modulo
you could use division to make the equivalent of modulo

3590464
integer	unsigned
it is worth noting that 1 000 000 000 can be represented using a java int which will be the same size as a c signed or unsigned 32 bit integer

3590473
tolower	toupper
then add tolower or toupper if you want and use match for joining your data frames

3590479
disk	ram
one reason to want to do this or other techniques such as compressing the document on disk is that the space savings also make for smaller memory usage of cached objects and indexes meaning that you could get better cache hit rates for the same amount of ram

3590550
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i m very interested in using sun studio to detect memory leaks in c++ applications with dbx debugger but i think this debugger only shows memory leaks produced by malloc realloc and free

3590622
put	get	post	put	post	get
for update actions you want to use put create post destroying uses delete and anything else is probably a get

3590631
gina	winlogon
on xp server2003 you d probably have done this by writing some gina extension replacement for the winlogon system

3590636
stdout	stderr
the open3 library gives you full access to the standard io streams stdin stdout and stderr

3590660
screens	tablet
you will be creating anew avd config to specify the tablet screens size memory constraints sdcard size etc

3590684
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can add uinavigationcontroller in place of uiviewcontroller in uitabbarcontroller and put your uiviewcontroller who haveing uisegmentcontrol in uinavigationcontroller who add in uitabbarcontroller

3590710
doc	rtf
you can load word or open office templates merge textual data and save the final document to a number of formats such as doc docx rtf and pdf

3590711
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox and google-chrome

3590719
rpm	yum
without you needing to copy them so it doesn t matter where they are stored by yum rpm

3590726
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if i change my code to test for then firefox is happy but then safari opera and google-chrome fail at the test

3590776
pecl	pear
if you can connect via ssh to that server and if you can install new pecl and pear modules then you might consider using php ssh2

3590795
width	height
once you have the row col count and assuming all the videos are to be the same size you simply divide screen width by cols and height by rows and you have your video dimensions

3590800
google-chrome	firefox
of course that would mean that it s not actually working in firefox or google-chrome or any other browser but it could be that they re just less strident about error reporting so you re not noticing

3590817
trie	tree
given a string s its suffix tree is essentially the patricia trie of all of its suffixes

3590832
integer	fractions
the initial height would be an integer fractions of the total screen height

3590855
tolower	toupper
the question answered here seems to indicate that tolower and toupper are unicode-aware stack overflow

3590880
windows	wow64
is there any way to build a vc++ project so that the dll exe created by it will work as a 32 bit application on a 32 bit windows os and as a 64 bit application on a 64 bit windows os not in wow64

3590891

lan	localhost
i ve tried countless ways of binding it to localhost 0.0.0.0 the wifi lan ip address of the device with socketinetaddress and inetaddress.getbyname

3591020
client-side	server-side
the client-side javascript sends the session-id from the cookie to the server when the user submits a request and the server-side currently uses a pair of lists storing instances of a controller class in one and the corresponding session-id s in another creating a new interpreter proxy and sending the input if a non-existant session-id is submitted

3591032
keydown	mousedown
in my delphi application i wrote handlers for the keydown mousedown and mousewheel events but non of them are triggered by this mysterious button

3591071
wan	lan
the network environment you are playing in will dictate which options are actually viable a local lan will have different considerations from something which runs over a wan or the internet

3591071
tunnel	vpn
factors like firewall tunnel vpn traversal etc

3591151
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie all have developer extensions

3591151
google-chrome	firefox
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

3591221
rss	feed
i have two separate rss feed and i running each one through simplepie then displaying them in the side bar

3591230

3591253
put	get
i put up a tutorial on how to get 3.1.3 working with xcode 3.2

3591283
throttling	throttle
also the throttling in biztalk seems to be implemented in a way that it first bombs a service then notices that it was bombing then waits a while doing nothing and then lifts the throttle and start bombing again

3591299
simplecursoradapter	autocompletetextview
i have successfully implemented a custom simplecursoradapter for an autocompletetextview which suggests entries from the database according to what has been entered into the box

3591329
subtraction	addition
addition and obviously subtraction error is easy to compute

3591356
fflush	gets
you re probably on the right track though - although i d use a fixed-size array instead of a list and fflush all entries from the array when it gets full

3591373
ssl	https
the way https ssl gets around this is through the use of trusted certificate authorities

3591398
postgresql	mysql
this is equivalent to mysql postgresql in your list

3591410
mvp	presenter
i have a problem with my mvp structure that is built upon generic presenter views etc

3591442
codeigniter	cakephp
if what you really want is clean urls and simple url mapping then you could probably use codeigniter or cakephp

3591447
udp	tcp
tcp udp ip toolbox 2.0.6 from matlab exchange offers a tcp ip implementation

3591450
min	max
this is often due to unavailability of sufficient contiguous free memory in ram or incorrect min and max heap sizes

3591450
min	max
from the screenshot it appears that the problem might not be with the min and max heap sizes so you might want to take a look at the amount of free memory available when starting eclipse although that is no indicator of whether all free memory is contiguous

3591463
ggplot2	lattice
even better is to combine the data sets together then use xyplot from the lattice package or the ggplot2 package to do the multiple plots in one step

3591477
google-chrome	firefox
and now testing it and this simple example seems to work with firefox and with google-chrome

3591489
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
however this only works in firefox and does not work in safari google-chrome or opera

i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw

3591501
post	get
clicking a vote link is a get not a post

3591514
automake	autotools
autotools automake autoconf and the likes amd cmake are quite helpful to make sure that you don t have to deal with these problems

3591543
verilog	vhdl
when thinking about simulating things in vhdl or verilog you need to think like if you had the hardware which you want to simulate physically in your hands

3591543
verilog	vhdl
you make the pcb and other things in vhdl or verilog

3591565
google-chrome	firefox
since i didn t managed to sign in on a web site i want to scrape i thought i will use the browser cookie google-chrome or firefox for that specific website with the cookie command www mechanize shell has

hence you cannot have both jboss and weblogic on port 8080

3591659
hashchange	popstate
update there is now the html5 history api pushstate popstate which deprecates the html4 hashchange functionality

3591714
lisp	scheme
scheme is of equal or greater power of common lisp but it doesn t have as much support or bindings

3591735
ubuntu	linux
i am using boost serialization on windows and i wanted to test my code on linux ubuntu and unfortunately it does not compile

3591747
ubuntu	linux
we have the following code that runs in linux ubuntu but not on windows xp or windows 7

3591784
width	height
i am trying to get the width and height of a button so that i can rotate that button around

3591808
hash	md5
i was thinking of making an md5 hash out of the user s data but i m not sure how unique the md5 would be

3591808
hash	md5
i did a little experiment a while back and found that even 32-bit fragment of an md5 or sha-1 hash will probably still be unique enough for a few thousand records

3591816
actioncontroller	activeresource
loading a default rails stack will give you actioncontroller actionmailer activerecord and activeresource all together

3591824
hash	md5
md5 is a 128-bit hash so it allows 2 128 340.282.366.920.938.463.463.374.607.431.768.211.456 unique identifiers so if every human beeing on this world about 6.900.000.000 should get a md5 unique identifier built out of this data the chances of a collision are smaller than 1 4 10 28

3591846
int	double
your arguments are of type int and double and so the compiler can t deduce what type it should actually use for a

3591846
int	double
when you pass a double as an argument to this function the standard conversion is performed on the argument and the function is called with the resulting int

3591864
outputstream	inputstream
it just move the closing of the outputstream to the end where you are closing the inputstream of the socket

3591864
outputstream	inputstream
closing this socket will also close the socket s inputstream and outputstream

3591868
qpushbutton	qvboxlayout
i have some qpushbutton and qlabels in a qvboxlayout

3591912
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
you can t add a uibutton to a uisegmentedcontrol

3591912
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
uibutton isn t a subclass of uiview you can add it to the uisegmentedcontrol

3591912
uicontrol	uibutton
you would have to subclass uicontrol or uibutton if you have need of additional functionalities and draw the whole button manually or in this case just the + sign

3591925
vim	emacs
although i know this to be the case for the emacs and the oldish debugger front end ddd i imagine you have the same thing going on if you are debugging from vim

3591965
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide show a div

3591979
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover handler will fire once for mouseenter and once for mouseleave

3592001
mouseleave	mouseenter
u can use mouseenter mouseleave to stop bubbling re-calling hover while mouse moving

3592002
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me on google-chrome firefox and safari osx

3592003
width	height
while you wont need to explicitly set the img height width in your html you still need to know what they are because div height width is calculated like so div h img h + img borderx2

3592016
firefox	safari
i love how the following animates in safari but hate how it does in firefox click an event name then click previous post or next post at the bottom of the page

3592019
strlen	substr
substr string 1 strlen string

3592174
whirlpool	md5
for creating a unique id u can go with any algorithm be it md5 or sha or whirlpool

3592197
subtract	add
you would just need to add or subtract some constant from each x or y corner coordinate to get all 8 points

3592213
daemons	launchd
see launchd.plist 5 or the overview documentation for launchd unfortunately this overview documentation is primarily concerned with daemons but the principle is the same

3592215
post	get
hi i am trying to create 2 functions for a wordpress site one to extract the src from an image in a post and one to get the post slug

3592224
min	max
there are some concerns about finding max and min value from hash

3592228
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
but then it only works for division not addition subtraction or multiplication

3592254
hash	md5
the first time through comparing a drive s contents utilize a hash such as sha-1 or md5

3592258
content-disposition	content-type
then you need to set at least the http content-type header to application pdf and the http content-disposition header to attachment when you want to pop a save as dialogue or to inline when you want to let the webbrowser handle the display itself

3592258
outputstream	inputstream
you then just write it in the well-known inputstream - outputstream loop the usual java io way

3592319
drawimage	todataurl
for example if you ever call drawimage with an image from a different domain you can no longer use the todataurl or getimagedata functions

3592378
boost	stl
i m programming c++ using the underscore naming style as opposed to camel case which is also used by the stl and boost

3592378
boost	stl
that d be consistent with stl and boost so i might use that

3592435
getter	setter	inherited	properties
note this needs refinement to exclude properties getter setter and inherited methods but it s a decent starting place

3592441
nsstring	nsobject
using to compare nsobject instances in this case nsstring instances is a pointer comparison since objective-c instances cannot be created on the stack

3592469
redhat	fedora
on redhat centos or fedora i would suggest using the ius repository

3592570
mouse	keyboard
configuration as in the options you see in the keyboard mouse settings under windows

3592580
width	height
then square s implementation to set the width would also naturally set the height so that the object remains square

3592580
width	height
yet there may well exist code elsewhere in the system that works polymorphically with rectangle objects and would not expect that changing the width would also change the height

3592595
treemap	linkedhashmap	dictionary	map
serious matlab implementations requiring key-value maps dictionary should still use javaâ s map classes java.util.enummap hashmap treemap linkedhashmap or hashtable to gain access to their larger functionality if not performance

3592649
pydev	virtualenv
when configure the interpreter to point to virtualenv s python interpreter pydev doesn t automatically inherit the system python s path therefore it s the user s duty to select appropriate pythonpath

3592655
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i used cgaffinetransformrotate in response to touchesbegan and touchesmoved events within the polygonview class and this basically works too

3592677
postgresql	mysql
note that postgresql is worth considering too - while this has more in common with oracle dbms than the sybase system at the heart of mssql like mysql it is not strongly tied into a vertical integration platform

3592680
mouse	keyboard
if you want to change other keyboard settings than the layout or if you want to change mouse settings you could try googling for the name of the setting + registry key or something similar to find where it s stored or maybe ask on the superuser site

3592706
int	double
i have a string such as int double datetime etc

3592708
antialiasing	transparent
antialiasing essence is that the more pixel is closer to the edge boundary of something the more pixel color is blended with background color or we can say that it is more transparent

3592714
email	dkim
dkim uses digital signatures to allow a sending mail server to show that an email came from the domain it says it came from

3592714
email	dkim
both these systems require proper spf dkim records to be set up and also require that the mail server that handles the email for its recipient actually performs the validation

3592724
accessor	properties
that method is always going to return the same instance of the set aside from accessor that get a properties

3592769
stdout	stderr
p.communicate returns a 2-tuple composed of the output from stdout and stderr

3592835
apache	nginx
- proxying through apache or nginx to paste

3592839
pull	push
you can take a look here for a good example of how ui can be organized to work with async on backend see richfaces livedemo ajax support push pull examples

3592868
width	height
you can slice 1px height or 1px width gradient image and repeat it in the background horizontally or vertically.

3592872
pyquery	lxml
in pyquery or even python2.6 s libraries like lxml it is very easy but i don t know how to do that with python 2.5

3592912
setinterval	settimeout
you could use settimeout instead of setinterval and make dynamic adjustments each time your function is called

3592917
instances	transient
my co-worker thinks that since all of our domain services are marked transient each page request will get a new instances

3592953
client-side	server-side
supertech i get the impression that you are confusing server-side code php in this case with client-side code

3592956
children	parent
here s one option create a sprite or movieclip object and add all your menu objects as its children and not as children of the parent class

3592966
free	malloc
that s where the memory was allocated with malloc and only you can say where it should have been free

3592988
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to sort of pause the dom in either firefox or google-chrome

3592989
put	get
if i put the symbol before plasmalaunch1 in the addobject argument i get an

3593054
unix	solaris
it seems that all the major investment banks use c++ in unix linux solaris for their low latency high frequency server applications

3593075
unix	aix
banks run on aix the stock market itself runs on unix and therefore it is simply easier to find programmers in the financial world that are used to a unix environment rather than a windows one

3593078
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	unix	solaris
further linux unix has a reputation for crashing less though windows is pretty reliable these days and linux has a much more volatile code base than solaris or freebsd

3593084
subtract	add
you can dynamically add and subtract event handlers with the bind and unbind functions

3593106
migrate	upgrade
because the upgrade was fairly significant i designed an ssis package to migrate data from the old schema to the new

3593162
stateless	stateful
stateless and stateful enterprise java beans

3593233
post	get
when you have register_globals on anything passed via get or post or cookie automatically appears to be global variable in code this might have security consequences

3593261
post	get
as i understand it if you have register globals turned on then anything passed in a get or post gets automatically translated into a variable in php

3593261
post	get
with registered globals off data passed in via get or post is not automatically translated into a variable rather you need to request it using the superglobals _get _post and _request etc

3593266
post	get
i have a wp blog i just published my first post and when i try to use the comments i get the following

3593271
uiview	subviews
another way is to use a uiscrollview and add subviews uiview or uitextview smaller ones for dividers and larger ones for text items

3593273
post	get
if you submit a value in a form via post or get the value of that input will automatically be accessible via variable in the php script named after the name of the input field

3593285
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox google-chrome on fedora 13 demo

3593293
post	get
you can access form attribute without global arrays get post request

3593320
getter	setter
and has getter and setter

3593326
post	get
the second question is how would i get the top 5 related post from by comparing tags and categories from each post

3593364
client-side	server-side
if you want to pass any information from the client-side javascript to the server-side sinatra you need to use ajax or something like comet

3593460
cvs	svn
for the future i highly recommend learning a version control system like cvs svn and git etc

3593484
uiview	calayer
every uiview contains a coreanimation object calayer which is used for explicit animations

3593505
width	height
i am trying to get width and height of image returned by simplehtmldom

3593525
width	height
you should know that the height and width attributes won t necessarily be in the html therefore simplehtmldom won t be useful to you

3593526
width	height
check the height width attributes of the tag and only grab images where either s larger than 50

3593526
width	height
for gif jpeg images the height width will be very near the beginning on the file so you d save on file transfer overhead

3593526
width	height
well if there s no height width then you can jump straight to fetching the image or first bit of the image and extracting height width directly

3593526
width	height
checking the height width in the tag is just to save you the trouble of having to fetch the image in the first place

3593526
width	height
as for extracting the height width from the html it s just a matter of using and calls once you ve found an tag with the simplehtmldom

3593533
onresume	onpause
also i had to add code to my activity s onresume and onpause

3593540
addition	multiplication
in this case you have 2 adds and 1 comparision inside the loop mutiplied by 10 gives you 20 or 30 flops plus 1 multiplication and 1 addition outside the loop

3593574
gtk	gio
you could have a look at the gio library â it s part of gtk but can be used separately

3593574
pygtk	gio
the documentation is pretty thorough and if you need to do some quick prototyping you can use the pygtk gio bindings to mess around before going back and writing it in c

3593577
client-side	server-side
php runs server-side not client-side

3593708
button	checkbox
i need for a user to be able to click a done button and for the application to go through the list of checkbox s and update a database for each checked item

3593708
button	checkbox
the database and the done button were a piece of cake but obtaining a reference to or making a copy how ever you choose to look at it of the checkbox thus far has stumped me for days

3593770
post	get
i am trying to get wordpress post 3 at a time this is the code i m using

3593776
stringbuilder	stringwriter
note that you could also eliminate the stringbuilder use new stringwriter

3593776
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter uses a stringbuilder as its underlying data structure anyway

3593779
int	chars
no implicit casting from chars to an int is available

3593779
int	chars
on x86 machines both int and chars are 32 bits long so it s safe to explicitly cast

3593786
width	height
the short explanation is that inline-block allow you to style the list-items as if they were block level elements ie give them width height etc while still laying them out inline

3593787
int	chars
several functions return int in c but chars in c++

3593787
int	chars
returning an int when a chars would make more sense is simply an old c cultural decision

3593792
int	chars
conversion between chars and int exists just like it exists between int and long or int and short

3593792
int	chars
a literal of the form h in c++ has type chars but as any other integral type it is comparable to int

3593795
int	chars
and yes there is an implicit cast from chars to int

3593795
int	chars
a chars is just a one-byte int value

3593795
int	chars
so in this case the cast is not happening when assigning to next_option but in the case statement where you have a chars constant being compared to an int

3593795
int	chars
in c++ a chars constant is of type chars but in c it s of type int so if you compile this code as c then there s no type conversion at all

3593807
width	height
ns1 fusionwidgets id myguage width guagewidth height guageheight fccharttype guagetype fcdataxml guagexml y 0 x 0

3593833
int	chars
think of a chars as a 8bit int

3593833
int	chars
you can perform int operations on chars and you can even declare them as unsigned

3593842
rss	feed
since it seems that you are trying to parse an atom feed try using something designed for that like magpie rss

3593851
ant	maven
maven advantages over ant are quite a few

3593904
children	parent
not only that but each child calls tostring on its parent which in turn calls tostring on its children which each calling tostring on the parent which in turn calls tostring on its children which.

3593942
children	parent
one for the parent and one for the children

3593943
children	parent
one way to fix it is to print only the name of the parent category skipping it s parent and children

3593957
width	height
pdf is page oriented fixed width and height of the pages

3593958
google-chrome	firefox
when i tried to run an gwt sample application i got a missing-plugins on firefox or google-chrome it seems that i m missingg something just dont know what to do in order to make it works.

3593969
google-chrome	safari
internet explorer google-chrome or safari

3593974
apache	nginx
nginx or apache for reverse proxying http load balancers etc.

3594014
children	parent
this will ensure that the styling you apply to the parent div will only affect the text content outside the children

3594057
ironruby	ironpython
silverlight is .net meaning that you could use any language capable of compiling into msil c# vb.net ironruby ironpython ... which will run inside the client browser using a plugin that needs to be installed

3594063
post	get
but then when you login its post and not get

3594088
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox 3.6 4b google-chrome 5 6 and safari but does not work as expected in opera tested with most recent version 10.61 no matter how many widgets divs with are present opera only acts on the first one because apparently the nodelist only contains 1 entry length is 1 instead of 2 or 3 or ...

3594091
inherited	properties
now only way i see it is remove inherited and implement implicit operator for anothertype to sometype conversion but the evil in that case i need to duplicate all properties of type sometype within type anothertype and i need to change type anothertype manually every time when sometype getting changed

3594108
versioning	upgrade
i want upgrade feature in my iphone app how to say if user tap a upgrade button then the app will access online upgrade versioning server and download newest modules file after that the app can use the newest modules.

3594121
google-chrome	firefox
because firefox and google-chrome handle server push differently firefox get onload events google-chrome uses onprogress broken

3594132
mouseover	mouseleave
the problem is that hover maps to mouseover and mouseleave not the events you re using

3594141
mouseleave	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter
.hover will never return mousemove it will only return mouseenter mouseleave

3594146
kde	gnome
you need to balance a requirement for absolute portability against the expectations of platform users - there are different basic hci hig guidelines for windows os x kde and gnome and none of the portable gui toolkits will automatically produce the right results in each some allow you to apply different layouts which is a start

3594200
int	chars
int is an array of int and chars output is a buffer that should be long enough to hold the string representation of the int that the function receives

3594230
rss	feed
rss feed being generated on demand

3594232
folder	directory
get the special my documents folder path first then append your additional directory with path.combine

3594278
dictionary	map
although it may be better that your module defines a dictionary or factory to map each value into a renderer

3594285
hudson	bamboo
together with the ci bamboo hudson we get also a nice history of our source quality and what directing we go

3594294
implements	extends
first i extends intset by arraylist and i start implements method

3594321
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you can see this by printing out nslog the integer value of self ld long int self in the viewdidload and viewdidappear methods

3594351
equals	tostring
note that you don t need equals because we can rely on object identity now and tostring because this is already implemented for case objects and classes

3594362
superclass	subclassing
if you write a superclass you just create a virtual method and have it implemented in your subclassing the page

3594373
yacc	bison
additionally look for yacc and bison if you want parser generators too

3594403
width	height
make sure that you set your width and height of the div container for your object or image

3594405
client-side	server-side
the application is typical consists of the client-side interface and server-side that performs all the calculations

3594406
post	put
pages got buffered with a stale authenticity token and all actions using the methods post put delete where recognized as forgery attempts

3594406
post	put
as toobulkeh commented this is not a vulnerability on index show actions but beware using this on put post actions

3594486
int	chars
you cannot in general convert an int into one chars because only ten of all int 0 .

3594524
implements	extends
public class mytestdriver extends configured implements tool

3594561
bindparam	bindvalue
i tried both bindvalue and bindparam but i got the same results

3594617
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
on some elements the width acts like 100 a auto acts very similar to 100 depending on margin padding ....but not height so no it s not the same as omitting them everywhere

3594617
width	height
here s a demonstration with width height not set vs 100

3594620
width	height
the second however yields the correct croparea based on the image width and height

3594621
width	height
see the css specs for example from here onwards for more information on how width and height are calculated when unspecified

3594655
inherited	properties
in your case it is little bit specific because inherited entities don t have any additional properties to store

3594678
sorting	filtering
define your sorting order as a combination of # of views or last seen date or a weighted filtering combination of the two factors

post	get
scaffold controller s edit action and defult routing support edit as get rather than post request

3594696

width	height
so i tried using php getimagesize to get image width height its very slow

3595113
width	height
so i am thinking of using jquery solution to get remote image width height so that i can filter image width less then 100px

3595135
width	height
if you re trying to get the width and height of the image in the client side you can use jquery s .width and height methods

3595135
width	height
doing will ensure that the images are loaded before getting the height width

try to make bigger picture with greater width and height in theory to make a plot of a same virtual size it should be

3595753
backgrounding	multitasking
under ios 4.0 there are several ways to register your app with the os for multitasking services so that your app can get some running time in the backgrounding

3595754
superclass	subclassing
one option is to have another abstract subclassing to use as the superclass for all implementations which do want to use the default implementation

3595766
width	height
it seems the scrollview frame width height don t change just the orientation of itself

3595782
put	get
essentially get every pixel and its position in the letter and put that pixel into the image at the position you re currently at plus the position of the pixel in the letter

3595799
for-loop	arrays
the new for-loop added since java 5 to make iteration over the collections and arrays easier

3595801
super	abstract
if you are leaving the super class method abstract you may want to look into utilizing an interface not to be confused with an interface

3595815
punctuation	words
this is a pretty naive definition of words however since it only splits on whitespace so any punctuation will be included as part of the words

3595845
width	height
i would then change the width and height of the loader to make the loaded animations fit well

3595865
hash	salt
the best way of storing passwords is to store them hash with some complex hash like sha1 sha1 password +salt with salt

3595934

or you could do this if you don t wish to define getter setter

3595967
django	turbogears
just ported a webapp from turbogears to django and going through the process of getting a proper server running not runserver

3596009
google-chrome	safari
however the javascript engines of google-chrome and safari are completely different vector graphics are rendered by different engines html5 video tag stuff is implemented completely different etc

3596036
daemons	systemd
think of a daemons under linux unix variants - they do not have a graphical display nor interact with the user as such and hence would be headless for want a word for it as there s no interaction whatsoever and furthermore a service would be running under a systemd service account..

3596063
folder	directory
look at the programs in the examples folder in your core plot directory

3596090
ubuntu	linux
most likely firefox js engine retrieves these values from os hence i need to know which file in linux ubuntu stores these values and temporary change it when i need

3596119
superclass	subclassing
i have event observers which all observe the same event so i have an abstract superclass which observes that event and then the subclassing overrides implements the specific functionality

3596121
hide	show
show hide cursor on your choice..

3596127
post	get
say i have a latest_posts method in a blog model which i can pass an integer to to get the latest n post

3596156
multiplying	transpose
yes in your case you are taking transpose of varw1 dividing it with the norm v1true then multiplying it with v1true

3596169
superclass	subclassing
either declare the relevant method in the superclass to be abstract or have it call an abstract detail method that each subclassing implements

3596222
terminate	timeout
what happens in this case at least with ie is that it will orphan your connection object and not terminate it correctly until the connection timeout is hit

3596248
glut	sdl
if i just run the hello world it works but otherwise those errors happen every time i try to include glut gl or sdl commands

if you look in the program files directory you will note that most companies do not include the version number in their folder name

3596295
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested with google-chrome firefox 3.6 and opera not ie

3596300
children	parent
one aproach i would take at this is to take the first and the text it s a textnode for hap save the other children and remove the children inserting them while formating them after the parent node

3596321
portrait	landscape
load a landscape oriented xib when the device is turned into landscape orientation and vice-versa with portrait

3596372
listview	gridview
you should ditch the tablelayout for a listview or gridview

3596395
onresume	onpause
now in the activity that runs the surfaceview you will also need to call the resume and pause methods in the surfaceview from the activity s or fragment s onresume and onpause

3596405
portrait	landscape
after if i change orientation to landscape then back to portrait again the button appears

3596443
polymorphism	specialization
self-typing allows restriction and specialization of oo polymorphism

3596462
postgresql	mysql
i ve personally used it on mysql and postgresql but i would be shocked if it wasn t available in mssql and oracle

3596467
firefox	safari
i works nicely in safari but is slightly offset in firefox in the hover state

3596492
int	chars
i have packed an array of 4 byte sized int in a chars buffer

3596503
width	height
this happens because the a tag has a width and height lower than img size

3596512
folder	directory
relative disk file system paths are relative to the current working directory which is dependent on how you started the application in eclipse it would be the project folder in command console it would be the currently opened folder in tomcat manager service it would be the tomacat bin folder etc

3596578
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox result is always undefined and google-chrome throws a error code

3596583
post	get
is there some way to detect an ajax get post request was made regardless of whether it was done with a generic object or from xyz framework

3596593
firefox	safari
this still causes safari and firefox to play the audio just in a new window

3596624
width	height
this way the arrows are effectively on another layer and will not affect other elements with their attributes width height

3596626
portrait	landscape
when testing on an ipad the player opens in portrait orientation slightly truncating some of the ui controls though the status bar does flip over to the landscape position

3596676
stdout	stderr
i simply want to disable restlet s logging to stdout stderr in my project and forward all restlet logging through the slf4j facade provided by org.restlet.ext.slf4j

3596682
queue	fifo
i m digging around on google atm and unfortunately have no reason to believe that it can maintain a stack instead of a queue but there are several open source implementations and aside from the fifo vs

3596691
put	get
sure just configure mod_dav so you get put support on the apache side

3596691
put	get
then use a get to pull down the file edit it locally and use put to send it back

3596709
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
the problem is i can t ask every user to change their password and the passwords are already hash with md5 without a salt

3596741
trie	tree
a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements

3596753
portrait	landscape
the issue after navigating to the secondviewcontroller from the rootviewcontroller while in landscape the secondviewcontroller doesn t switch its ui back to portrait

3596780
bufferedreader	stringtokenizer
first you should read a line from the file use inputstream bufferedreader etc. then use stringtokenizer to split at the commas and you can look for the first part whether you should select it

3596784
bottle	flask
of course it is hard to beat the nice idioms of flask and bottle or the thoroughness and quality of werkzeug beyond map and rule

3596822
google-chrome	safari
this is a google-chrome and safari bug

3596838
trie	tree
test at runtime whether it s actually faster for these strings than your best known data-agnostic structure which might be a trie a hashtable a judy array or a splay tree depending on implementation details and your typical access patterns and if not fall back to that

3596849
hash	salt
add a new field to the user table for storing the new securely hash passwords - for this please do something safe involving per-user salt and multiple rounds

3596855
versioning	upgrade	hash	salt
this will work as you expect but if a person never logs back in or changes their password they will never upgrade to the salt versioning of the hash

3596859
post	get
this triggers the same logic as passing the data as an object since you are specifically an array and will cause a post instead of a get like you want

3596895
nfa	dfa
i don t know if you ve covered this part yet but if you convert that regex to an nfa or a dfa non-determinism isn t required for this one you d basically get this slightly simplified if i remember my conversion algorithm correctly but it s a pretty trivial change from the algorithm to this

3596934
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you use .hover it ll affect the parent as well since that s how the mouseenter and mouseleave events work for example

3596934
mouseover	mouseout	children	parent
you can give it a try here unlike mouseover and mouseout the events don t fire when entering leaving children so the action taken on the parent isn t undone until you actually leave the parent as well which seems to be what you re after

3596952
mouseover	mouseout
you can reach the parent node by using parent method and toggle its class binding the mouseover and mouseout events

3596975
width	height
this will always give the first row 2 3 of the height and the second row 1 3 of the height and the first column 2 3 of the width and the second column 1 3 of the width

3597070
width	height
i see other extensions with width and height set to just fine and i only enter some little text and i get linebreak

3597085
viewdidload	viewwillappear
7 in the .m file of where you are implementing the check you can place this in one of the first methods called init or viewwillappear or viewdidload etc

3597105
domxpath	domdocument
i think i should have said this earlier i am using domdocument loadhtml and domxpath

3597149
versioning	upgrade
also the way they lock to word versioning is a total pita and has forced me to avoid ms office upgrade several times

3597157
django	turbogears	turbogears	cherrypy
django turbogears and cherrypy are a few to check out

3597208
hide	show
another way is to always have 5 sets of fields and just show hide the sets of fields you need

3597222
vim	emacs
although the classic editors which the guru s will recommend vim and emacs have auto-complete as well

3597305
width	height
the 2 other changes that i made were to remove the width 100 rules since the div s are block elements and will default to that and change your height 100 to min-height 100 since this will allow your #content to grow with its content

3597338
set	bag
list vs set vs bag in nhibernate

3597347
public	protected
i m pretty strict about coding standards so my ide warns me about any undocumented public protected methods

3597361
getter	setter
if it s obvious what the getter setter is getting setting i d use some copy-paste documentation that makes it clear that nothing fancy is going on

3597361
getter	setter
i personally consider too many getter and setter to be a code smell as it s a possible sign that you re not providing operations at the correct level of abstraction this is obviously not always true but a rule of thumb

3597400
webclient	webrequest
simply use the webrequest or webclient classes

3597404
gentoo	linux
i m running gentoo linux

3597420
put	get
if i create a library with most functions meant for overwriting meaning that you will need to put your logic into some of initial library functions to get what you want from library

3597558
filesystems	ntfs
it is possible to append data to arbitrary files with ntfs the default windows filesystems which i m assuming you re using

3597559
vsto	add-in
it is a com add-in and not a vsto add-in

3597576

get the post from db by the given

3597633
cakephp	kohana	symfony	kohana
please note that zf and other php frameworks are not mvc frameworks - at least those popular like zf symfony kohana cakephp etc

3597640
post	get
whenever an ajax get or post request is made s_ajaxlistener.callback is called and the following properties are available

3597640
post	get
this should be either get or post

3597640
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in as of this posted date current safari current google-chrome current firefox ie8 ie8 ie7 compatible

3597689
post	get
there are system apis in languages like c++ and python that will return the installed fonts and you can certainly write a backend in a higher level language that communicates with a javascript front end using get post requests and optionally ajax but you re not going to get the installed fonts with only javascript

3597705
scriptaculous	jrails
but you can always jrails if you want something like prototype and scriptaculous helper

3597746
vim	emacs
i would like to know emacs equivalent of vim s n which opens

3597754
integer	fractions
these formats specify a data type called s15fixed16number which has a sign bit 15 integer bits and 16 fractions bits

3597759
google-chrome	firefox
i had originally done what syockit suggested but i found it was doing weird things with the caret size in google-chrome which this method seems to avoid although firefox is still a bit off...

3597759
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
edit after playing around with it the following function seems to work reliably in ie8 firefox google-chrome safari opera for your more advanced test case

3597821
vsto	add-in
i created a simple vsto add-in with a copy and a paste button with the exact code above

3597834
post	put
use asyntask put your database loading processing in background function and in post execution display result

3597873
puts	gets
because when your object is put into a hash based container hashset hashmap... the container puts gets the element s hashcode

3597918
flask	cherrypy	bottle	cherrypy	bottle	flask
bottle flask cherrypy are very easy to work with out of the box

3597918
django	turbogears
django turbogears others are are more complex but provide more features

3597939
hex	binary
up in binary mode using you ll get the following shown in ispf editor with hex on

3597948
wtl	atl
for starters it requires some intimate knowledge of component object model com some atl and probably a bit of wtl as well

3597948
wtl	atl
and com atl and wtl are not mainstream topics anymore

3597963
disk	ram
after some time squid will also notice that these objects are unused and it decides to move them to disk so the ram can be used for more busy data

3597963
disk	ram
space on the disk the swap area when that write completes it will read from another place in the paging pool the data it paged out into the now unused ram page fix up the paging tables and retry the instruction which failed

3597963
disk	ram
so now squid has the object in a page in ram and written to the disk two places one copy in the operating system s paging space and one copy in the filesystem

3597965
width	height
i need to get the monitors width and height in pixels

3597990
apache	nginx
i d suggest to do compression decompression at http frontend nginx apache etc

3598076
put	get
i would get the part before and after what you want to replace and put them either side

3598079
uiview	uiwindow
i don t why you don t want to use the normal method of subclassing a uiview to capture touch events but if you really need to do something weird or sneaky you can capture all events including touch events before they get sent down the view hierarchy by trapping handling the sendevent method at the uiwindow level

3598091
range	max
all my code for getting these date range works except for the method to get the date range covering all time which would be a start value of the earliest possible data java handles to the end value of the max possible date

3598096
csla	.net
one of the most popular business objects frameworks for .net is csla

3598096
inherited	properties
basically those frameworks give you an already made base class that handles all the common work the isdirty properties an identity field etc and you inherited all your business objects from it

3598143
google-chrome	safari
webkit s web inspector used by safari and google-chrome

3598244
config	ini

3598292
devil	glew
i tried to set up glew and then devil openil in visual studio but still have runtime and link error

if you want to be really sure each process will go to a different processors set its cpu affinity accordingly

3598327
int	chars
if you look at the output produced the int value for the spl chars is 65533 which shouldn t be the case

3598351
int	chars
i m not sure if capture getchar into a int and then cast it into a chars is the correct way to hadle eof pitfall

3598370
minimum	max
you can set minimum and max dates on chart like

3598384
folder	directory
i want to access all files and folder in a specific directory on server for eg

3598384
folder	directory
also i want to create a kind of file manager that manages all the files and folder in a specific directory on server for eg

3598417
integer	unsigned
it s an unsigned integer big enough to hold a pointer

3598429
realloc	malloc
if you want to handle out-of-memory conditions you would have to check if malloc or realloc returned null

3598436
uilabel	uibutton
you can follow this workaround by using a uilabel instead of a uibutton

3598447
int	chars
the return value from getchar is an int not a chars

3598447
int	chars
chars converted to an int and advances the associated file position indicator for the

3598447
getchar	fgetc
emphasis added. it defines getchar in terms of getc and it defines getc in terms of fgetc

3598449
submit	submission
i do not see how it can be done the right way with plain a nchors and form submit as in both cases the user actually leaves the page by following the link or submission a form and there is no way to analyse the response on the client side

3598478
folder	dir
it ll output all the files folder not the subfolder files in the current provided dir

3598527
move	drag
for drag and drop you have to do something similar by changing the coordinates of the object according to the mouse move

3598545
websphere	ibm
i am migrating a web application from tomcat to an ibm websphere 6.1

3598546
implements	extends
but i think you will need a compound-renderer which means you have to create your own cellrenderer implements tablecellrenderer or extends the existing defaulttablecellrenderer

3598569
integer	unsigned
the resulting unsigned integer type is

3598569
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type

3598587
for-loop	loops
as soon as this number may vary there needs to be some sort of facility to provide next and stopiteration for the for-loop to work.remember python s for-loop is if anything comparable to a for-each loops in java

3598603
width	height
if i set the height and width of the scrollview to some specified length it works fine but again when it changes the orientation it doesn t

3598640
int	chars
pls dont typecast the return of malloc you have not included and as someone pointed out above lack of prototype will result in int being casted to chars

3599061
opera	google-chrome
i tried opera google-chrome and ie8

3599070
addition	modulo
since your encryption output is text i might suggest the use of addition modulo rather than xor

3599070
addition	modulo
undoing the addition modulo is a slightly different procedure

3599070
int	chars
you can set the modulus as high as you want to include as many chars as you want into your character-set and with some fancy math you can map chars to the int values in any way

3599118
entity-relationship	diagram
this is called an entity-relationship diagram

3601258
integer	unsigned
i have a table that i select data from with a column called parent that s of unsigned integer type

3601259
stdout	stderr
it depends on what you want to have happen with stderr and stdout

3601259
stdout	stderr
however there are times though when stdout is used to communicate status to the user so he or she can tail -f or paginate it and at those times writing to stderr causes them pain they have to redirect stderr back into stdout with and not everyone knows how to do that

3601313
rss	feed
i used the following two articles to get my tt_news with realurl up and running and to later add a rss feed for my tt_news articles

3601481
getter	setter
1 private member variables with getter setter start with an underscore as in _credentials

3601518

since this is homework i assume you must use an arraylist and implement the logic manually rather than using treeset as the obvious solution

3601536
folder	directory
and volia you see all the pages and folder in that directory

3601539
post	get
there is described how to implement get and post method

3601583
arraylist	treeset
you want to use a set or list implementation hashset treeset etc or arraylist linkedlist etc.. since java does not have dynamically sized arrays

3601655
botan	gnutls
i d reach for gnutls for c programs or botan if c++ is okay myself

3601775
width	height
in both cases i would like the image to fill the screen width with scrollbars if necessary for height

3601781
abc	subclassing
if you nevertheless must do it i would recommend taking full control by subclassing the abstract base class collections.mutablemapping and implement the needed methods __len__ __iter__ __getitem__ __setitem__ __delitem__ and for better performance also override others such as __contains__ which the abc does implement on the base of the others but slowly in terms of a contained dict

apache	nginx
i will ask this with an example - i have a setup nginx django apache nginx forwards ssl requests to apache

3601818
int	chars

i already tried using httpwebrequest object webclient object with lots os combinations of post credentials streams and even a special user-agent to try and login without success i can only download the login page

3602070
rss	feed
on a side note this seems to be to be the wrong approach for an xml document in general and an rss feed specifically

3602081
post	get
apparently if you are using iframe you can get the auth tken however using fbml facebook sends it overs as a post parameter so you have to use post as your index not get

3602099
post	get
you can t use jsonp to do a post - all it does is inserting a tag and the browser fires off a get request

3602099
firefox	safari
maybe what you re looking for is cors but that s only supported by firefox 3.5 ie 8 and safari 4 and newer

3602156
ssl	https
in this case a form s action is set to use https and the ssl handshake

3602328
versioning	upgrade
from the contents of the database upgrade script it doesn t look like there is a versioning number stored in the database

3602397

the format of message will be like for example get a.txt or put a.txt

3602412

i have following code which converts the qstring to qbytearray

3602548
qtextstream	qdatastream
i have even tried the qtextstream qdatastream etc for encoding

3602552

by setting them as view.gone android doesn t include them in any kind of measurement width or height and it looks like nothing was supposed to be there

on my local machine the script works fine but when i put it on the server i get

3602690

you can create an cgimageref from a blob of pixel memory using cgbitmapcontextcreate to create a bitmap context and cgbitmapcontextcreateimage to create the image ref from the bitmap context

3602692
client-side	server-side
i can see no situation where you should worry about a server-side session value being obtained through a client-side exploit

3602693
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
they are faster than dom because the main performance problem with dom and jdom dom4j and xom is that tree models are inherently expensive compared to pojos -- they are basically glorified hashmaps with lots of pointers for convenient untyped traversal

3602706
rss	feed
i also saw you could do that by pulling from the rss feed but i think fb shut that down

3602710
move	drag
if you want to drag hold down for a moment until the icon enlarges then you can move it

3602757
avr	microcontroller
if you are on an 8 bit microcontroller like an 8051 or avr then this will work best

3602886

so far it seems to work well for post and get methods

3602887
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works for firefox ie and google-chrome but safari 5.0.1 seems to ignore the directive and fails to reload the page across multiple users so it doesn t seem to be a setup specific problem

3602890
free	malloc
one possible method is to preflight the memory required for successful completion of some operation malloc check and then free the blocks that add up to your requirement

3602920
folder	directory
it is possible and relatively trivial to list the folder in a directory - using a function like this

3602987

getter	setter
one thought i had was passing in functions to get access and that is easy enough to do for the getter but i can t seem to figure out the setter

3603241
for-loop	arrays
you should use either int arrays and memset or for-loop to initialize all elements

3603249
profiler	gprof
the program doesn t use strings and the only #include is iostream only used for outputting the final answer so it can t be slow because of string finds and compares or other similar slow external functions as suggested in this question unable to accumulate time using gprof - the gnu profiler

3603261
google-chrome	safari
i realized there is a problem in ie safari and google-chrome when the handler is used in a remote environment

3603261

3603384
post	get
i wrote a blog post about this issue to help others that get stuck with it

3603395
swt	swing
the reason for this is that the new developer mode is implemented in swing and the old hosted mode was implemented in swt

3603446
subtract	add
now you can add or subtract distancequantity s or areaquantity s etc. but you can t mix them so i think i need to have short add subtract etc. methods in the subclasses but i want to reduce any logic duplication to a minimum

3603446
superclass	subclassing
however i need to return an object of the subclassing and this seems difficult to do from the superclass method

3603482
width	height
width or height any value other than auto

3603485

3603510
google-chrome	safari
there are some native html5 events that works in webkit google-chrome safari .

3603527
int	chars
i m writing a program that reads a stream of data and parses it into some values either int floats chars or a compound value that contains a set of values can be nested

ienumerable	iqueryable
and when i use a list vs ienumerable vs iqueryable

3603577

if what you want is to say that changing the children list is not a change of a parent instance then just make the children list mutable

3613762
children	parent
if children are not part of the state of parent in your system s semantic then it should be fine

3613764
subtraction	multiplication
a nice property of 31 is that the multiplication can be replaced by a shift â 15.19 and subtraction for better performance

ant	maven
i like to use maven to do my builds but i m at the point where i m thinking of going the ant build route because of the complications of using maven

3613835
hide	show
though jquery can do show hide so you may not need both libraries depending on what you re doing for example there are lightbox plugins for jquery and scrollable plugins for prototype so you could go either way with using a single library for everything

3613946
cvs	svn
also download the m2eclipse-extras plugin to add svn functionality and maven or cvs if you prefer

3614085
google-chrome	firefox
i have this function in javascript file which works perfectly fine in firefox google-chrome but for some reason throwing object doesn t support this property or method error on ie 8

3614092
versioning	upgrade
sometimes going through a project file upgrade like when you change vs versioning or simply sharing project files through a source contorl system can cause things to get out of whack

3614097
google-chrome	firefox
now days i normally do more html css in any text exitor and or directly in the browser using firefox firebug or google-chrome to edit the styles and see how they will look exactly in the browser

3614102
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
only thing is this needs to work in ie firefox google-chrome safari and preferably opera

3614131

if it is an int you could convert the string representation into an array of chars and then convert that into an array of bytes 0-9

3614134
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd root

3614200
width	height
but unlike html dom not all elements have an upper left hand corner x y coordinate and a width and height for a box surrounding the content

3614286
google-chrome	safari
in ie8 clicking on a result to view the content forces it to reload in compatibility mode where it works fine in all other browsers ie7 ff3.0+ google-chrome safari

3614319

the connection must be reliable comparable to tcp s reliability so i can t just switch to udp

3614319

sctp over udp is just fancy reliable udp see above

3614339

run in the background as systemd daemons

3614339
stdout	stderr

3614374
swift	objective-c
instead of using file management and the arbitrary requests for the given store type you interact with objective-c and swift objects

3614454
folder	directory
if you or your application is adding and removing directory to the application folder then you will be restarting your application pool every time so be careful with those temporary files

3614455
margin	height
alternatively you can use .css height as it will count only the interior section of an element not padding border margin

3614584
folder	directory
just download the source from their google code repository and copy it into the src folder of your project with the whole com whatever whatever directory structure too

3614586
put	get
i get the following out put in my firefox source code view

3614621
fgetc	fread	fgets	fread	fgets	fgetc
the function fgets is part of the stdio package and as such it must buffer or not the input stream in a way that is consistent with also using fgetc fscanf fread and so forth

3614626
equals	gethashcode
unfortunately it seems that the internals of web.cache don t handle this at all so you would have to call gethashcode on your string to see if it was equals to -2147483648 and if so alter the string slightly

3614664
selecteditem	selectedindex
i tried selectedindex but returns -1 and selecteditem returns null

3614670
bazaar	svn
bazaar is at least as easy to use as svn especially if you already know svn

3614670
bazaar	svn
although i have no experience with it i should also mention that you can use the bazaar tool to access an svn server with bzr-svn and this may give you much of the benefits and merge capabilities of bazaar while still having the advantage of hosting your code on the widely understood svn platform

3614670
bazaar	git
while i just suggested bazaar in the world of open source distributed version control systems dvcss many people appear to be going with git

3614670
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i didn t suggest this though since it forces a much steeper learning curve on users coming from an svn background and i think many teams in the wild would prefer the better windows support and ease of use of bazaar above the scalability and speed benefits of git

3614670
bazaar	git
if you choose to go with a dvcs like bazaar or git you probably don t need to get too hung up on exactly which dvcs you start using

3614688
versioning	upgrade
i have tried to change my module s versioning and created the upgrade script mysql4-upgrade-1.0-1.1.php but still not working but i could run my module

you get a image on the same domain write to canvas then manipulate pixel data from there complicated but possible i m sure and then either use that or output as png gif jpg.

3614733
boost	allocator
others have pointed out auto_ptr with ownership transfer semantics but you can also use boost shared_ptr in case you use custom memory allocator internally a pool shared_ptr s custom deleter feature will help you hide deallocation details from the user of the interface

3614745

3614849
pop-up	dialog
i m writing an application which will have two activities when the user presses the back button on the second activity a dialog should pop-up asking the user to confirm the action

3614891
feedback	review
the review after rejection starts usually quicker than when submitting a new app or new update and so you would have a feedback in 2 or three days that would be the same time they would take to reply you with previous rejection reason if it is possible

3614895
put	get
i think you will simply have to put together a small proof-of-concept app and run it in instruments to get some real numbers

3614902
post	get
if you reference the c++ standard in a post on stack overflow you get more a lot more upvotes

3614913

width	height
but after rotation the width and height of that m_tabviewcontroller view is changed very samll size ..please give solution...center is not working also.

3614957
symfony	kohana
i would use xpath with simplexml or domdocument depending on my needs although kohana might offer something better like zend does with zend_dom_query or symfony does with sfwebbrowser both of which let you use a querys similar to jquery s css selectors

3614979
punctuation	words
when the artifact is a stream of natural language text parsing is used to mean breaking the stream into natural language elements words and punctuation and discovering the structure of the text as phrases or sentences

3615039
public	protected
u s data members would either have to be - implicitly or explicitly - public protected or private

3615039
public	protected
if they re public or protected then they re not encapsulated and we re back in the share the pain scenario mentioned above

3615039
serializable	deserialization
for example a union of int64_t double and char 4 could always be read as an int64_t or char 4 after being set as a double but the other way around might read an invalid double and cause undefined behaviour unless you re re-reading values that came from a double at some earlier time perhaps in a serializable deserialization library

3615042
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
i noticed that whereas the default integer short and long are signed and have their unsigned counterpart as uint ushort and ulong

3615157
jpcap	jnetpcap
if you are looking to writing a java program to spoof the udp packets then i would use jnetpcap or jpcap as suggested by mike

3615162
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that s in firefox google-chrome safari ie8

3615163

for what it s worth msil which all .net languages compile to anyhow is more consistent in that a sbyte is called an int8 and a byte is called an unsigned int8 short is called int16 etc

3615217

i know i can dynamically generate a gridview repeater listview control but what i d like to understand is which option from stated ones or any other beyond these would be an optimal solution

backslash	dollar-sign
you can prevent variable expansions by using backslash to escape the dollar-sign part of the variable reference

3615330
single-quotes	backslash
you can also use single-quotes to prevent variable expansions but if you need to actually print a single-quote then you need to use backslash to escape the single-quote

3615345
dreamweaver	aptana
since you are familiar with aptana already i would say stay with it as it has a lot going for especially over dreamweaver

3615355
folder	directory
otherwise i can t see any such folder directory there named twill-0.9-py2.6.egg - there is only a file with this name the one that i think was downloaded during the installation of mechanize. please tell me if my assumption is wrong - i may well be not seeing something very obvious here as i am just a newbie

salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
if the password is hash with md5 or additional like salt and sha1 then how to retrieve back the password

3615428
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview	sorting	filtering
i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

3615444
maven	m2e
in this case i d say yes unless you re using maven which has m2e and the eclipse plugin to generate them for you

google-chrome	firefox
the error i m getting is not making much sense as it does not occur on firefox or google-chrome

3615591
clearance	devise
if you opt to use a ready-made system devise clearance â you may find it s more useful to write integration tests to check the way you ve wired the system into your project works correctly rather than testing the specifics of the authentication system which the authors should have done already otherwise find a different authentication system

3616069
facade	command-pattern
i d suggest that command-pattern is preferable to a facade

3616132

rcurl	libcurl
i followed various suggestions like using the curlescape url encoding function or by setting the curlopt_followlocation and ccurlopt_ssl_verifyhost parameters via the curlsetopt function as listed in the php ssl libcurl object moved error link but the later 2 were not recognized as valid rcurl options

3616409

the problem was that the jar had a manifest.mf file inside it which defined the classpath

3616437

so if you add just the mouse listener you will not get the press event if using keyboard

3616871
rss	feed
as an example considering this rss feed item from the magnificient brother bricks site

3616871

.htaccess	httpd.conf
however as it required the use of virtualhosts it must be set in the server s httpd.conf file instead of a local .htaccess

3617452
profiler	visualvm
i find it impossible to have visualvm s profiler notice any functions defined in single-segment namespaces.

3617455
google-chrome	firefox
the code is properly working on google-chrome and firefox as expected

3617458
aggregate-functions	sum
you seem to have cmfilm.titel in your group by clause but you have no aggregate-functions sum count etc. so as it is now you probably should drop that group by or tell us more about what you actually want to query

3617461
.htaccess	httpd.conf
however as it required the use of virtualhosts it must be set in the server s httpd.conf file instead of a local .htaccess

3617542
isometric	draw
i m attempting to make an algorithm that can draw the entities of my isometric game in the correct order

3617542
for-loop	loops
in the drawing function i first create a new vector of the same pointers and then start with a for-loop that loops the amount of entities that i want to have drawn

3617549
hide	show
use css and some javascript to show and hide the details of each cd

3617563
superclass	subclassing
to address the sub-question about how smalltalk from which mvc originates handles this originally this is smalltalk-80 where trygve reenskaug implemented mvc it was indeed necessary to subclassing the view superclass for your specific view to register it as a subscriber to change events from a concrete model subclassing

3617563
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse to the model

3617569
width	height

it works fine in windows 7 and in ubuntu linux without the join so i m a bit stumped as to why it falls over on xp

3617656
ubuntu	centos
similar to centos and ubuntu

3617663
ws-trust	ws-federation
yes adfs v2 supports ws-trust and ws-federation and saml2 passive and wif only supports ws-trust and ws-federation and not saml2 neither passive nor active

3617663
ws-trust	ws-federation
ws-federation uses ws-trust to perform browser based passive federation and is in many ways similar to saml2 passive - and in many ways not

3617729
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the grdiview is based off of a data source so originally i tried basing the enabled value of the dropdownlistfor off of the data eval of the checkbox datavalue

3617729
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i think the way it would have to work is and event on the checkbox would have to actually enable the dropdownlistfor i don t think the dropdownlistfor can listen for the checkbox to be checked

3617729
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
but when i click the checkbox the dropdownlistfor does not become enabled

3617738
openssl	gnutls	openssl	crypto++
once you read it you may better understand why everyone relies on cryptographic libraries such as openssl gnutls crypto++ and so forth.

3617742
submit	submission
submit button b - once the form is filled it will use all that data to do another submission

3617743
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the first is that if the compiler supports return-value-optimization and especially when it also supports nrvo chances are high copy will not take place

3617747
inherited	subclassing
if you create a subclassing of car it inherited the class instance variable defaultcolour as a normal object would do as well

3617747
inherited	subclassing
if the defaultcolour class instance variable has a value the subclassing also inherited this value

3617795
terminate	timeout
the timeout period can be adjusted to reduce the amount of unnecessary reconnecting though it cannot typically be infinite because most server frameworks will terminate the server-side process if it appears to have hung for too long

3617809
hide	show
you should use the view.columns somefieldname .visible property to hide show a column

3617829
inherited	properties
you could also mark the owner properties inherited to have it propagate automatically to the menuitems

3617850
client-side	server-side
cookies is one but you can use a hiddenfield server-side control to store the value in the hidden element in client-side javascript then access that hiddenfield on the server

3617964
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing the paint methods

3618035

i have a sqldatasource control that is calling a database stored procedure and passing quite a large number of paramaters and the stored proc returns records that populates a gridview control

3618073
16-bit	64bit
int is 16-bit on 16-bit systems and 32 bits on both 32- and 64bit systems

3618101
tcplistener	tcpclient
there it s easy tcplistener tcpclient etc

3618118
subtract	add
from that number simply add or subtract 7 to get all other sundays

3618125
tcplistener	tcpclient
you still use the same tcplistener and tcpclient if you want to make it that low level

3618125
wan	lan
the technologies for communicating over a wan are the same for communicating over a lan

3618139
int	chars
like chars each int type comes in three forms â â plainâ â int signed int and unsigned int

3618139
unsigned	short
similarly short is a synonym for short int unsigned for unsigned int and signed for signed int

3618139
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer types are ideal for uses that treat storage as a bit array

3618139
int	chars
unlike plain chars plain int are always signed

3618139
int	chars
1 sizeof chars sizeof short sizeof int sizeof long

3618139
int	chars
where n can be chars short int int

3618139
integer	unsigned
different unsigned integer type

3618139
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type

3618204
button	checkbox
if you want to allow users to select only one of the checkbox then you should radio button instead of checkbox

3618274
boost	stl
put your data in a boost bimap then iterate it both ways copying the results into a standard stl map which will enforce uniqueness

3618278
filesystems	fat
i am considering using a fat filesystems for an embedded data logging application

3618308
stdout	stderr
next send stdout to stderr 2 is duped into 1

3618308
stdout	stderr
send stderr to 3 stdout 3 is duped into 2

3618354
google-chrome	firefox
the iexplore hta mode and firefox google-chrome mode launchers will work just fine

3618370
metaclass	subclassing
as you already have a metaclass you might as well use it to put a add a separate _registry attribute to each subclassing automatically

3618487
std	ostream
you didn t use namespace std using namespace std is habit anyway so the compiler doesn t know what on earth an ostream is.in addition to that you didn t actually define operator only declared it so even if it recognizes it it won t know what to do since you didn t tell it

3618492
std	ostream
prefix ostream with std - std ostream

3618496
std	ostream
ostream is a member of the std namespace so either put a using namespace std

3618496
std	ostream
before your class declaration or explicitly refer to it with std ostream

3618508
std	ostream
using std ostream

3618566
pop-up	dialog
all you need to do to create a new test is right click whatever class you whish to test ask to create a new test and make sure you choose your tests project instead of the current in the dialog that pop-up

3618601
int	chars
since chars is really a small int having signed chars and unsigned chars makes sense

3618609
unsigned	short	int	chars
unsigned chars was never introduced or intended it s just how it is because chars is an integral type identical to int or long or short it s just the size that s different

3618625
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this site heavily uses some html5 features so it s viewable only with firefox google-chrome or safari

3618635
int	chars
signed chars short int int

3618659
awk	ksh
i suggest you show us your code next time since i believe you are quite familiar with ksh sed awk etc already

3618662
int	chars
signed chars short int int

3618674
int	chars
signed chars short int int

3618693
width	height
but cellmap is very convenient because it implements its own optimized serialization and it exposes width and height properties that are more convenient than writing cellmap.getlength 0

3618824
addclass	removeclass
what you should do is use removeclass and addclass

3618890
post	get
this will auto-add slashes to any post get variable

3618938
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
use an nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

3618966

and get method not post

3618967
textview	imageview
as you can see it contains a textview and imageview

3618968
hide	show
show hide the console window of a c# console application

3618970
accessor	properties
the is prefix can give a hint about the fact that the properties only has a get accessor and as thomas and rachel said it s a bool

3618978
cvs	svn
there s also a case here for maintaining a master code repository in svn cvs or maybe git

3618996
button	checkbox
very similar for datagridview oncellclick can be raised when the column contains a button checkbox or link

3619049
jax-ws	jax-rs
jaxb is much easier to use with jax-ws and while jaxb is still easier to use with jax-rs sdo is a possible alternative

3619065
hash	salt
you could just produce k sn h x sn y which is the concatenation of an incrementing serial number with a hash where the hash is a secure hash function of the concatenation of the serial number between unique constants x and y that are secret salt you use to prevent the use of rainbow tables

3619081
hide	show
thus far what i ve done is use a maximized topmost mdi container and hide show the child forms as the user navigates through them

3619085
union	distinct
to get a distinct list of coursecodes and coursenames from both tables you can use the union operator

3619134
jquery	scriptaculous
i tried with some major javascript frameworks scriptaculous jquery etc... but i did not find any good way to achieve a similar effect

3619185
width	height
furthermore if the canvas size is width height then the size of the viewport will be width sx height sy because the size of the viewport scales inversely against the scale of the drawn geometry

3619203
jar	war
i ve only seen where you can setup run configurations for jar projects not war projects

3619211
public	protected
the enum can be represented as a protected string property with a public enum wrapper that converts to and from the string value

3619217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i attempted in safari firefox google-chrome

3619219
post	get
however i can t make a post get xhr with ajax through something like jquery due to same origin policy.

3619305
free	malloc
unfortunately this won t help with memory you malloc and free

3619327
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net are quite different you know

3619452
innodb	myisam
on the slave the view table would be myisam innodb instead of a view

3619475
folder	directory
you can find the .a files to import into the xcode project in the target directory lib folder

3619480
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it is working fine in ie firefox safari google-chrome but not in opera

3619499
width	margin
button grid.row 1 horizontalalignment right margin 0 3 18 3 name button1 width 110

3619523
request-uri	url
request-uri too large the requested url mail .

3619523
post	get
i was wondering if there is a way or one could be added to support post variables in addition to get variables

3619524
ssl	https
see https ssl

3619557
public	protected
typical usage is that dispose is overloaded with a public non-virtual dispose method and a virtual protected dispose bool

3619557
public	protected
the public dispose method calls dispose true and subclasses can use this protected virtual method to free up their own resorces and call base.dispose true for parent classes

3619557
public	protected
if the class owning the public dispose method also implements a finalizer then the finalizer calls dispose false indicating that the protected dispose bool method was called during garbage collection

3619653
folder	directory
directory subdirectory refers to subdirectory folder inside directory folder inside your home folder

3619653
folder	directory
. directory subdirectory refers to subdirectory folder inside directory folder inside current execution folder

3619661

there a new 2.0 beta 2 release available with lots of new features and support for fluent nhibernate one-to-many and many-to-many mapping

3619668
google-chrome	firefox
this works like a charm in firefox google-chrome etc

3619675
gridview	objectdatasource
i have objectdatasource and gridview on one of the pages of my asp.net web project

3619705
many-to-many	one-to-many
there a new 2.0 beta 2 release available with lots of new features and support for fluent nhibernate one-to-many and many-to-many mapping

3619736
many-to-many	one-to-many
there a new 2.0 beta 2 release available with lots of new features and support for fluent nhibernate one-to-many and many-to-many mapping

3619771
width	height
parameters for the width and height are fill_parent in my example with weight 1

3619779
firefox	safari
i have used the following rule to allow our static domain to host fonts but i ve run into a problem font s not being used by the browser firefox safari when the browser cache is enabled

3619820
int	boolean
really though you shouldn t be comparing int to boolean if you can avoid it

3619854
google-chrome	firefox
this code works just fine in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

3619913
ubuntu	debian
this is an example of getting cron source code in debian ubuntu

3619972
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
as of alchemy v0.5a when compiling memcpy memmove memset the llvm frontend will sometimes on mac os x emit intermediate code that the alchemy backend linker can t handle

3619972
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
the workaround is either to compile on a different platform ubuntu windows or to override the implementations of memcpy memmove memset

3619972
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
ultimately i injected the memcpy memset memmove workarounds by overriding string.h using -i and #include_next but this required hacking the achacks gcc script so that the -i flags are processed in the right order

3619996
toolbar	tabs
i started with the icons demo and was able to add a scroll property vertical to have content be scrollable between the top and bottom tabs that s actually what brought me to sencha touch the ability to have fixed toolbar

3620043
post	get
i want to get via nhibernate the tag list for a post with the count of each tag

3620043
post	get
i know how to get list of tags for a post

3620090
getter	setter
the getter and setter of the pubic properties will have to convert to from seconds

3620151
isnull	nullif
since you re using 2008 i d twist the new nullif function with the isnull function and use a subquery

3620189
vbscript	jscript
but it s a heck of a lot better than the batch file language or vbscript jscript

3620248
int	chars
your example of cast convert chars 8 orderdate 112 as int seems fine to me

3620252
portrait	landscape
i want a button to be below the textview in portrait mode but i want them side by side in landscape mode..

3620286
versioning	upgrade
the software upgrade versioning can be specified per client different versioning can be deployed to different clients as required

3620303
width	margin
it should center itself based on the width margin style definition

3620305
queue	fifo
the daemon will manage the tasks with a simple fifo queue

3620316
perforce	svn
while perforce is great svn git are more than ok free and widely supported

3620364
pull	push
with it you can pretty easily pull from a git repo thus converting a git repo into a mercurial repo in the process and if desired you can also push back into the git repo from hg

3620384
g++	gcc
i m using g++ gcc 4.4.2 20090825 prerelease

3620390
put	get
since the question is sort of answered in my comment of frederik gheysels answer i thought i would put it here so it doesn t get buried

3620414
google-chrome	safari
for ie safari and google-chrome you can just set the text-overflow to ellipsis and it ll take care of it for you

3620424
versioning	upgrade
i plan on using a base script for my initial database versioning 1.0.0 but after that i will require change scripts which upgrade the database to newer versioning

3620432
memcached	apc
i have read about memcached and apc

3620441
macports	homebrew
be it from homebrew macports python.org etc

3620457
memcached	apc
memcached is a distributed caching system whereas apc is non-distributed and mainly an opcode cache

3620475
return-value-optimization	nrvo
one common optimization point is the return-value-optimization return-value-optimization and named return-value-optimization nrvo which basically means objects returned by value from functions get constructed directly in the object which is receiving them rather than making a copy

3620479
serializable	deserialization
i would like to control object creation of a type that is not usually serializable during deserialization using a netdatacontractserializer or any serializable i guess

3620515
boost	stl
is there any in-built stl or boost library function i can call that

3620525
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade cakephp to a newer versioning

3620535
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
the protected modifier provides visibility of that method in the subclassing but if the method is non-static invocation of that method is possible only through the instance of a subclassing the concern you were raising if i inherited from the class superclass as follows i do not get any error

3620587
width	height
i want to make my image grow to 1500px in height and hopefully the width would just automatically re-size itself if not i could easily set it too

3620630
vb.net	vb6
versions of visual studio from 2003 - 2010 will attempt to migrate the vb6 to vb.net but this usually introduces significant errors which are difficult to fix

3620695
client-side	server-side
it would be sensible to do this on the server-side because getting an xml parser on the client-side is slightly tricky and you will need to do it on the server side anyway if you re going to be cleaning non-whitelisted elements and attributes

3620703
superclass	subclassing
you can t define id on subclassing and have an superclass that is an entity that has no id

3620752
portrait	landscape
and everytime the screen goes from landscape to portrait mode all my variables get reset to their default value and the countdown timer gets canceld and reset

3620795
16-bit	64bit
the reason you can t use 16-bit assembly is because the 16-bit subsystem has been removed from all 64bit versions of windows

3620805
width	height
a common way of doing this type of effect is by making use of bitmap draw functions that allow offsets into the images for a downward scroll effect simply do two copies from your source starfield bitmap into the screen buffer first from source 0 0 to width height-yoffset to screen 0 yoffset to width height

3620805
width	height
secondly take from source 0 height-yoffset to width height to screen 0 0 to width yoffset

3620811
fadein	fadeout
if you call calling element.fadein 200 .fadeout 0 the fadeout only happens after the fadein has finished

3620827
google-chrome	firefox
this code works for translating an event in firefox ie and google-chrome on pc

3620841
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
it will not break the application the attributes will have their default value - objects and strings will be set to null boolean to false int floats double to 0 chars to 0 etc

3620868
fadein	fadeout
afaik fadein and fadeout run synchronously so no i do not think you can interrupt them while they are running

3620868
fadein	fadeout
the reason the fadeout call in your example isn t called until after fadein is because animations are executed in a queue-like fashion

3620876
punctuation	words
yet when i create a pdf using pdflatex or i can t select but blocks of words separated by punctuation signs

3620939
put	get
with rrdtool you don t get back the exact data you put in due to the averaging over time

3621024
min	max
for example in this list of x y coordinates the max value is 10 and the min value is -10

3621037
int	boolean
i am working with some vb.net code that seems to be casting a boolean value to an int using cint myboolean

3621041
width	height
it s pretty simple functionality in the normal browser world -- i want to popup a window of a given width and height and simply have the ability to close it even with something as lame as a close window anchor

3621069
int	boolean
this is because the boolean data type is stored as a 16-bit signed int

3621099
integer	unsigned
in other words an 8-bit integer is not a sign bit followed by a 7-bit unsigned integer

3621101
public	protected
put class b in package a too and make it only package protected skip the public key word

3621113
public	protected
if you omit the visibility modifier no public protected or private the method is visible for all classses in the same package

3621173
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working in ie wow o but not in safair firefox google-chrome s

3621193
matlab	simulink
you can embed c++ code in matlab as well as simulink

3621243
gdi	directdraw
any alternative gdi + or say directdraw will not use the full graphics hardware for accelerating blending and will have to perform it on the cpu greatly reducing performance

3621243
direct3d	direct2d
as mentioned direct2d is an option also--it is functionally a layer on top of direct3d that supports more 2d specific functionality as well as excellent text support

3621316
hash	md5
md5 like other hash functions does not require two passes

3621318
implements	extends
in this case if you want to do as you describe it probably makes sense to create a class c that implements the common functionality between a and b from which both a and b can extends

3621329
implements	extends
it s ugly but you can use generics and constrain the method parameter to extends the class and implements the interface

3621353
cpython	ironpython
lock.locked is confirmed to be a present method in cpython 2.6.x 3.x ironpython 2.6.1

3621382
post	get
i couldn t find a pure ssrs method to get this so as mentioned in my original post i added a field column to the shared dataset query

3621391
width	height
you must not set the width and height of the groupbox in order to make the inner scrollviewer work

3621415
postgresql	mysql
i have been reading documentation and watching screencasts specific to mongo db over the past few days and i am at a loss for when a solution like this would be better than a typical postgresql or mysql environment

3621436
implements	sealed
it is up to the class to then implements the interface method as it will within the confines of the contract - virtual or non-virtual sealed virtual as it turns out

3621451
firefox	safari
i find this easiest to do by using 2 different types of browsers at the same time like firefox and safari

3621509
width	height
if you imagine your 3d array as a castle wall of height 3 lenght nmax and width nmax and one wall of that castle is weak and prone to being breached then each time you increased nmax you just made all of the walls longer including that one faulty wall so there is more faulty wall in your castle

3621517
chown	sudo
you may need also a sudo in front of the chown

3621522
actionscript	mxml
usually you put separate script code into an actionscript file rather then an mxml file when importing script though

3621528
accessor	properties
gets old is uglier than it needs to be wrap it in an accessor properties at the very least

3621546
width	height
define the map width height and zoom level

3621549
post	get
it accepts both get and post requests and can return data in either json csv or html format based on the http accept header

3621561
vbscript	vba
although vbscript has much common syntax with vba do not tag vbscript questions as vba unless you are specifically asking about both

3621561
vbscript	vba
some differences between vbscript and vba

3621569
post	get
the server receive some parameters which will be appended to the url in case of get requests or send in the http body in case of post requests

3621600
implements	sealed
if base and derived are declared in the same assembly the compiler will make base method virtual and sealed in the cil even though base doesn t implements the interface

3621695
int	double
you are dividing 2 int and casting to a double

3621757
postgresql	mysql
either natively or through third-party libraries it supports most major rdbm products including sql server mysql oracle postgresql and sqlite

3621834
min	max
functions like sort min max all take a key argument

3621904
min	max
for example the min and max functions can take a sequence of any comparable type - integers strings floats classes that have the appropriate comparison methods lists tuples etc

3622034
sip	sdp
in sip the original use case for ice the sdp s carried in a sip invite 200 ack exchange setting up a sip session.

3622066

e to the power of something imaginary can be computed with sin and cos waves

3622087
mp3	m3u
all i got for those radio i a stream url pls asx m3u mp3

3622107
width	height
in hl it used in private function updatedisplaylistvirtual void but there are no such function in layoutbase because layoutbase just a base class as it is but it have another one which called as public function updatedisplaylist width number height number void but its empty

3622127
post	put
be sure to put in your facebook id and the access token you got from the app you created see jens post

3622130
put	get
if i put the commands into methods not a command pattern then i get to reuse all my existing resources config logger database handles etc... but at a cost of all these functions and methods being mixed up in 1 class

3622156
put	get
the areas that get put into list box two are the areas that a person is in

3622173
int	double
for example func double int takes one double as a parameter and returns an int

3622234
post	get
search.aspx and post the selected value of a dropdownmenu and there is no get only post and postback from the server

3622329
cassini	iis
it runs fine from within cassini visual studio systray iis aka pressing f5

3622330

uiview	cashapelayer
i ve got a uiview which has it s layer s contents set to the image with a cashapelayer sub-layer who s path is set to the shape

free	malloc
inorder to track which array locations are in use you could use a simple bitmap and then with a few clever bit operations and pointer subtraction your custom malloc free operations should be pretty easy

3622704
free	malloc
malloc creates pools of free memory blocks of different sizes i would bet that there is a pool for 16 byte memory blocks different implementations may or may not do this but its a pretty common optimization and since all your allocations are the same size fragmentation should not be an issue

3622713
free	malloc
you could try overriding malloc free with an alternative implementation that s suited to lots of small allocations

the technical difference is that if a machine where not twos-complement it would have to fake it to provide the required behaviour in particular the range of int is not that of a 32-bit ones-complement integer

invokerequired	begininvoke
this is the reason invokerequired will always be false within the form s begininvoke s method

3626003
invokerequired	begininvoke
and invokerequired in delegate s begininvoke will always be true

3626007
keydown	keyup
it probably needs a little more than that like ignoring certain events keyup events between keydown events shouldn t reset _currentmatchindex but you get the picture.

3626030
serializable	deserialization
you could also look into using protobuf-net for serializable deserialization

the code for a non atomic retain getter and setter conceptually looks something like

3626366
getter	setter
the code for an atomic getter and setter conceptually looks something like this

3626366
getter	setter
in the non atomic case and in a multithreaded environment you can t guarantee that the getter will give you a valid object because between the getter returning the reference and the caller retaining it or doing anything else another thread could call the setter releasing the object and possibly deallocating it

3626450
outputstream	inputstream
closing either the inputstream or the outputstream of a socket closes the socket crazy but true

3626853
post	get
your post will be successful but the browser won t allow you to get the response back

3626853

hide	show
for disabling the main window use setdisabled instead of hide and setenabled instead of show

3627072
put	get
if we want to do it then we can put a uniqueconstraint on the login column but still our application has to check during user registration whether the user input is valid unique or not without that and only with the db constraint we will simply get an error

if you are in need of a javascript library that magically updates your ui for everything from small screens to tablet to desktops check out sencha touch

3627261
width	height
in android a view is assigned width and height only when its rendering is complete

3627261
width	height
so unless your views are rendered atleast once they won t be assigned any width or height

3627261
width	height
solution to your problem could be that you set some min height and width of view so that you have atleast something to work with initially and once your views are rendered you will have width and height of the view to play with

3627310
children	parent
iam trying expand and collapse the children to show the grand children but my code is trying to collapse parent when i try to expand child node

3627431
int	chars
the data types chars short int long and long long hold possibly different size int that can take values up to a certain limit

3627431
int	chars
good practice is to avoid chars short int long and long long and use int8_t int16_t int32_t uint8_t etc or even better int_fast8_t int_least8_t etc

3627457
int	chars
broadly speaking a chars is meant to be the smallest unit of sensible data storage on a machine but an int is meant to be the best size for normal computation eg

3627457
int	chars
the size of any data type can be expressed as a number of chars s but not necessarily as a number of int s

3627457
int	chars
for example on microchip s pic16 a chars is eight bits an int is 16 bits and a short long is 24 bits

3627483
margin	height
i would give the footer a specific height and use this height as a negativ margin at the bottom for your scrollview

3627492
children	parent
you can write test cases checking that category instances have parent and children that you can retrieve the list of children given a parent that you can create a new category instance and add it to some pre-existing category instance s list of children or various other behaviors important to your application

3627530
qtextedit	qwidget

3627609
puts	putchar
you should use putchar instead of puts

3627620
int	chars
chars cant hold what int can

3627620
int	chars
do some experimenting with sizeof to see if there is a difference between chars and int

3627620
int	chars
if you really wish to use chars instead of int you probably should consider instead and store the ascii base 10 chars representation of the number

3627629
hash	md5
generate md5 hash in java

3627638
puts	putchar
use putc or putchar as puts is specified to take a and you are feeding it a char

i would like to try a simple xmlhttprequest example to post a form to a php-file the php-file reads the elemsnts value then give it back to a div tag it works with a tradional code but not with dojo a get an error firebug thant sent is aborted so this ist the content of test.html

3627773
int	chars
where it says f5 are in fact two values a letter and a number that i need to store separately as a chars and an int

3627825
inherited	properties

3627853
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i mean firefox opera safari google-chrome and basically every browser instead of ie has a single last build version which can be updated-to from the browser itself why does ie need to have ie6 ie7 ie8 coexisting instead of providing an updater so everyone uses the same version ideally ie8 which doesn t have as many problems as for instance ie6

3627859
int	chars
as a chars is nothing but an int you will have several chars keys for one and only one same lastname and this is not what you want

3627883
int	chars
your error is coming from the fact that puts expects an argument of type but you re passing an argument of type chars hence the pointer from int without cast message chars is an integral type

width	height
you also can move the top width and height properties in the level rules to the ul.apl_widget_content li .selected rules

3627970
union	distinct
union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation

3627981
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox this great but with google-chrome it seems that the xhr calls are cached in a different cache than the css and js files

3628000
getter	setter
one-liner getter setter that share a common validation routine

3628014
width	height
a 24bit bitmap is 3 width height bytes plus the header which irrc is usually 54 or 52 bytes

3628037
width	height
after that it shows your image with a square that you can move around and make bigger smaller width height

3628094
union	distinct
it is better to use union all when you know you want all the result rows whether or not you know they ll be distinct or not

3628094
union	distinct
union without all will always perform the distinct check regardless of what the data actually is

3628842
redmine	trac
but i d be curious why they need this feature just because someone has a modified copy of a file doesn t really mean anything in management terms branches can still be protected very effectively using repository security any task tracking system like trac or redmine will tell you who s doing what and integrate with svn perfectly

3628845
svg	vml
populate it with your own svg vml polygons and attach a drag event to this custom polygon object

3628845
svg	vml
i went through the painful process of learning svg vml and writing a library to bridge svg vml together - you could do that but i would recommend starting by trying to use another library such as raphaã l

alternatively you could have the users download the file via an anonymous ftp account but that requires the user to understand how to use an ftp client and requires an ftp client on their machine for the pop-up dialog to not show up

3629010
terminate	timeout
the problems are that i want to avoid waiting for the timeout i don t have terminate data arriving and packets are of unknown sizes

3629063
bash	tcsh
it would be somewhat difficult to create a script that would run on both tcsh and bash

3629097
free	malloc
malloc ed memory is only free when you call free on it

3629117
min	max
qprogressdialog s progress bar cannot be used showing busy state because that would require setting qprogressdialog s min and max values to 0 which immediately closes the progress dialog

3629117
min	max
then you can set this progress bar s min max and value to 0 and then getting the busy look

3629118

3629387
tripledes	aes
tripledes is generally not recommended because aes gives better security more efficiently you might like to see some comparative timings of block ciphers that i took in java to see just how bad it is

3629435
for-loop	loops
some optimizing compilers will be able to do better loops unrolling with a for-loop but odds are that if you re doing something that can be unrolled a compiler smart enough to unroll it is probably also smart enough to interpret loops condition of your while loops as something it can unroll as well

3629538
apache	nginx
the best in my opinion is passenger in conjunction with your choice of apache or nginx whichever you re familiar with

3629598

getter	setter
i for one think that testing stuff like getter and setter is a total waste of time but i m sure that there ll be more than one coverage junkie out there who ll be willing to oppose me on this

versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade just changing versioning number

3630273
serializable	deserialization
i personally did end up several times with the following serializable deserialization class hierarchy

3630295
versioning	upgrade
none of them force you to upgrade to the latest versioning and some people do run older versioning of all the other browsers

internationalization	localization
actually what you are talking about is internationalization i18n not localization l10n

i don t think anyone has cooked up a pandoc plugin for gedit yet there is elaborate support in emacs and in textmate i know -- that would be awesome

3630427
serializable	deserialization
beyond answer that reflection can by-pass checks which is correct this is also something that other jdk internal parts need specifically default object serializable and deserialization

3630438
for-loop	loops
case 1 i have a nested for-loop to run large realizations and save variables generated through that loops in .mat files which i can later use in another program

printf	strncpy
the variable names could be better and and it d probably be safer to use printf or perhaps strncpy

3630705
int	chars
there s probably a library for decoding these but you could do it yourself - according to the java language specification an escape sequence is always of the form uxxxx so you could get the 4-digit hex value xxxx for the chars convert it to an int with integer.parseint convert it to a chars and finally replace the whole uxxxx sequence with the chars

3630726
ienumerable	ilist
basically any sort method is going to copy your ienumerable into a list sort the list and then return to you the sorted list which is an ienumerable as well as an ilist

3630732
folder	directory
this is overriding the java builder and copying the folder in src main resources into the target classes directory

width	height
evening all - whats the best way to access an image s height and width dynamically

3630734
width	height
i want to add 20 to an images width and height and animate when the surrounding div is hovered i guess i need to use this but not sure how to access the image

3630758
width	height
use the width and height methods of jquery

3630768
width	height
you can give it a try here if you wanted a smooth animation you could store the initial height width and .animate like this

3630802
apache	nginx
apache according to ryan is using a single thread to satisfy the original request whereas nginx is outperforming it in the cases he s talking about because it s not.

qwindow	qtabbar	qtabwidget	qmenubar	qtabwidget	qtabbar	qmenubar	qwindow	qmenubar	qtabbar
if i understand correctly just create a qwindow that contains a qtabbar widget and not a qmenubar or simply use a qtabwidget as your main program widget

an interpreted-language is likely to have some speed penalty when compared to a compiled-language but this is often unimportant

3631051
tcpclient	networkstream
once you have extracted the reference to a tcpclient in your onacceptclient callback you will want to get the networkstream via getstream and then call beginread or beginwrite immediately to start the asynchronous operation

google-chrome	firefox
in this regard i need the utility to read the url from the visible active tab on any of the three browsers firefox ie google-chrome that are currently open and then go off and do something with that url

3631232
rss	feed
well the beauty of rss feed is they always come in some standard structure even though some feed contain non-standard fields like google picasa s rss feed

3631232
rss	feed
the most straightforward approach in my opinion is to use a tool that allows you to unmarshall the rss xml feed into your rss bean

3631232
rss	feed
in my case i use castor to perform the unmarshalling process where i read the google picasa rss feed and gather only the fields i want

3631300
draggable	droppable
if a draggable is dropped outside of any of the inner droppable it should be accepted by the outer droppable

3631300
draggable	droppable
if a draggable is dropped onto any of the inner droppable it should not be accepted by the outer droppable regardless of whether the inner droppable accepts the draggable

3631300
draggable	droppable
so that would be easy if i could guarantee 1+ inner droppable would accept the draggable because the greedy attribute would make sure it would only get triggered once

3631300
draggable	droppable
unfortunately the majority of the time the inner droppable will also reject the draggable meaning the greedy option doesn t really help

3631300
draggable	droppable
summary the basic functionality is a set of valid invalid inner droppable to accept the draggable but when you toss the draggable outside any of the draggable it gets destroyed by the outer droppable

3631323
for-loop	loops
in c++ you use a for-loop to loops through anything but in ruby you ll find you re usually looping through an enumerable object so it s more common to do something like

3631338
implements	modifiers
so in a nutshell developers will complain about protected and private access modifiers simply because it gets in the way of what the developer feels would be the simplest and fastest way to implements a solution ignoring the future cost of relying on such implementation details

maybe there are some sense to send something like get post or just variables to your proxy but where from you are calling it its another one question to you

3631476
google-chrome	firefox
looking at those pages with google-chrome s devtools or firebug in firefox will show that the slideshow.css in index.asp has a style in it that is every element to set padding to 0 which makes the padding and margin of your body and everything else zero

3631479
folder	directory
in this case the download starts downloading to a temporary directory i assume and we only know that it failed when it ends and tries to move the file into the folder

3631489
for-loop	arrays
and using i j in your for-loop will take i from the first element of each inner arrays and j from the second element

3631495
public	protected
protected classes are kind of the same - they re adjuncts to your public class that presumably do something but they only do it for certain clients

3631495
public	protected
so even just to subclasses isn t very restrictive - your bad protected interface isn t far from public

3631550
subtract	add
obviously the first one i need to add the timezone difference before showing it to the user using dateadd in sql while the second i need to subtract the timezone difference before store it in the database also using dateadd

free	malloc
new delete uses malloc free which are not tuned for allocations of small objects

3631560
free	malloc
malloc free

3631560
free	malloc
boost object_pool helps reduce both these costs at the costs of not being as general as malloc free

3631560
boost	allocator
so instead of allocator node with new i use boost object_pool

3631560
boost	allocator
so if boost object_pool works for you it might help reduce the memory allocator overhead significantly

3631564
hide	show
if all requests have finished then it can call some method in the application delegate and tell it to hide the loading view show the root controller etc

3631581
onfocus	onblur
start the timer in onfocus and stop it onblur

3631585
google-chrome	safari
as of writing google-chrome and safari do not support the filereader object so they cannot break apart binary files and thus not send multipart encoding asynchronously

3631594
public	protected
protected is meaningless or reduces to private without inheritance although not in java but with inheritance it explodes into a slimy public degenerate and more so in java programming scala chapter 5

3631594
public	protected
allen holub writes in holub on patterns which is a java book but great from a general oop perspective that protected is public by another name especially in java where

public	protected
second protected generally indicates some flaw in class design especially if both protected and public are used

3631846
public	protected
the pattern would expose a public non-virtual driving function and several handles to helpers as protected abstract or virtual methods

3631851
int	chars
in fact where the conversion is probably completely optimized to get the numeric value it s much better to use the instrinsic chars value of the digit string which in every encoding including ebcdic gives the numeric value by means of an int subtraction instead of a str parsing

getter	setter
considering getter setter i d want a model class somewhere that has a few tests on those methods maybe test the database column type ranges

3631996
getter	setter	int	double
my advice would be to wrap scale in its own little class and name the getter operator int or operator double or whatever you re using for it and the setter

3632042
width	height
i d like the cgrect to use the width and height of the image without me specifying it

when you re copying files if you re physically moving the bits from one disk to another like with cp or drag and dropping then you might consider creating a bare repo on your external drive to push pull from on your other systems

floating-point	integer
and also figure out what causes the huge difference between integer and floating-point performance especially when compiling without optimization

3632226
getter	setter
what you re doing is a clever use of getter but unfortunately getter and setter aren t part of the current javascript standard they are in ecmascript 5 which isn t widely supported yet

3632267
jobs	cron
check out whenever and its railscast to easily schedule cron jobs that can run rake tasks or thor or shell scripts or anything else. you can use the rake tasks to update your models and then have some sort of dashboard controller that looks at the various statuses

3632290
hide	show
it s doing this so .height .width works even on elements that are currently hidden as long as their parents are visible...so you can run .height .width without doing the show hide trick it s doing in your code it s handled within .height and .width

3632295
put	get
but when i try and put it on another page with the straight up iframe code i just get

3632304
int	double
this stems from replacing the floats with int bitmaps and then subsequently interpreting them as double

3632310
range	median
if one has examined most but not all of the items that will allow one to guarantee that the median will be within some range if the list contains duplicates the upper and lower bounds may match but examining the majority of the items in a list implies o n item retrievals

3632337
post	get
i am using jpa with hibernate and trying to connect to the a datasource to retrive information but when i run the application i get no error as such but no results are displayed when i run the following code.the question arose from a previous post located here when i was setting up the environment to do some testing of jpa with hibernate on glassfish

3632362
getter	setter
synchronizing the getter and setter would also fix the problem but may look strange to other programmers who don t know why you did it and can also break down in the face of things like binding frameworks and persistence frameworks that use reflection.

the first gets the max value for each group the second gets the min id for each record from each group that has the max value in case 2 records in a group have the same value and then selects the top 10 records

3632489
rtsp	rtmp
while its public open source version is a bit dated now you can have a look at this project which did rtsp and image based camera transcoding into rtmp streams with xuggler and red5

3632503
int	double
so all the double will be denormalised since the reinterpreted bit patterns of the int will have zero for the exponent field

3632503
int	double
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

3632514

min	max
min and max

3632558
width	height
height and width attributes

3632558
width	height
the height and width attributes specify the height and width of an element

3632558
width	height
note the height and width attributes are only used with

3632558
width	height
tip always specify both the height and width attributes for images

3632558
width	height
if height and width are set the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded

3632558
min	max
min and max attributes

3632558
minimum	max	min	max
the min and max attributes specify the minimum and maximum value for an element

3632558
range	max	range	min	min	max
note the min and max attributes works with the following input types number range date datetime datetime-local month time and week

3632558
range	max	range	min	min	max
tip the step attribute can be used together with the max and min attributes to create a range of legal values

3632576
getter	setter
by mandating the use of set get methods one can implement useful side-effects in the getter setter for example when the argument to get set is an object

3632585
getter	setter
there is the advantage that if you implement getter setter you can change their implementation later without having to alter code that uses them

3632586
getter	setter
getter and setter were a concept used in c++ when it was used for development of ui s but truth be told it s an expensive proposition to develop ui s in what is effectively a systems language

3632586
getter	setter
the general problem with getter and setter in c++ was that since they weren t a standard everybody had a different standard

3632590
aptana	radrails
i ve previously tried intype eclipse with aptana radrails plugin gvim and freeride

3632600
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to change the background-image of a div by altering it s css via jquery and i got it to work in firefox but for some reason its not doing anything in google-chrome i tried clearing the cache but still no luck there s no errors in the console either here s my code

3632603
stdout	stderr
if i could capture stdout to one variable and stderr to another that would solve my problem because i could just check if the error variable was empty or not

3632608
folder	directory
if in a jsp page i create a new file only giving it s name it s created in the bin directory of tomcat folder rather in the same folder of the .jsp

3632627
folder	directory
it s definitely intuitive as the current directory of the running process is the bin folder

3632635
getter	setter
they have to use that interface and you control what happens when methods in that interface are called - the getter and setter would be part of the interface

3632635
getter	setter
all you do is set breakpoints in your getter and setter and assuming all else is fine you re able to see how your object gets to the weird state

3632636
fiddler	charles
i seem to remember previously using charles fiddler and wire shark for this as well

3632642
try-catch	exception-handling
using an event can be better than calling thread.interrupt since you have more control over of the flow of the program thread.interrupt throws an exception-handling so you would have to strategically place the try-catch blocks to perform any necessary cleanup

3632660
int	chars
you are returning a chars but kind of trying to put an int value in it

3632755
submit	submission
as far as the button not submission the form is concerned it won t submit the form until you submit the form yourself on the click event of button

3632762
int	chars
from a performance perspective int are best because they offer a decent range of values and the number of bytes used is small when you compare to varchar of five or more chars

3632790
getter	setter
i would argue that c++ needs getter setter more than java

3632790
getter	setter
in java if you start with naked field access and later you changed your mind you want getter setter instead it is extremely easy to find all the usages of the field and refactor them into getter setter

3632795
nunit	mstest
you might also look at - it is a silverlight and wp7 unit test framework runner that also has an add-in dll for nunit mstest so you can write tests and have the same test code run in .net silverlight and wp7

3632803
jboss	glassfish
i don t know if jboss or glassfish have an equivalent i couldn t access the supportwlddincontainers page to find an answer for glassfish

3632807
domcontentloaded	onload
browsers give you two signals the page is ready for scripting domcontentloaded event and onload

3632807
domcontentloaded	onload
if you need to read dimensions from the document or its elements you probably need to wait until all images and css are loaded wait for the onload event if not you can use domcontentloaded

3632835
background-color	transparency
i then tried using background-color transparency but that unfortunately doesn t work

3632835
background-color	transparency	background-image	background-color
so the solution is to either add a solid background-color or a transparency background-image to the 2nd level links in your drop-down menu

3632840
min	max
if you are comparing numerics sqlite db engine used by android supports functions such as min and max

public	protected
because protected is public to its subclasses it s kind of api to subclasses

3633117
for-loop	arrays
this may not work as you would expect though as objective c doesn t like it when you modify an arrays while you re iterating through it in a for-loop

3633147
folder	directory
this way you don t need to publish anything the virtual directory points to your project s folder

mouse	keyboard
however we do not want or have the wherewithal to write keyboard and mouse input method code line services code etc - the solution must support all languages that the standard textbox supports

3633191
mouse	keyboard
therefore the approach we re considering is to use a hidden textbox and to route keyboard and mouse events to it after suitable translation and to use its public accessors to determine how the characters are laid out

filesystems	hfs	hfs	umount
i m creating a macfuse filesystems for adding hfs write support to mac os x snow leopard and it mostly works but the system creates .spotlight-v100 and .trashes directories on the mountpoint in volumes before the volume is actually mounted so those two directories stay there after the volume is umount which prevents the mountpoint from being deleted

3638021
superclass	subclassing
basically what i d like to have is that the subclassing does not create its own attributes but rather just passes the parameters to the superclass

3638025
waitpid	fork
in the parent process fork returns the pid of the child process so you can store that in a variable and then use waitpid to wait for the child process to terminate

3638934
width	margin
if you know the width of your table you can use margin 0 0 0 auto

3638996
public	protected
ie i have already thought of simply changing the public interface of the pages and nodes into the protected category and then declaring the b-link tree as a friend but that gives the b-link tree access to private methods that i want to stay private

3639002
free	malloc
i would say use the c version of malloc and free from the std.c.stdlib

3639007

besides providing access to native windows controls like button textbox checkbox and listview windows forms added its own controls for activex hosting layout arrangement validation and rich data binding

3639336
tostring	string.format
you can use generic tkey tvalue because any object has tostring which will be used by string.format

3639340
typedef	typename
i realize that i can qualify the typename of system_t in the derived concretetemplatemethod by using but that s a bit verbose and i d like to avoid having to re- typedef to the base everytime i inherit and need to use that same system_t

3639367
equals	gethashcode	equals	compareto	compareto	gethashcode
it won t be using compareto that s for ordering but will use gethashcode and equals

3639367

one problem i found is that the iphone sdk does not include the nsstream method getstreamstohost port inputstream outputstream which is what mac os examples use to open a nstream connection but there are lots of places that show you how to create your own like here

3640331
int	double
one note if you do this you ll probably want to collect it into an int and then convert to a double and divide by 10 number_of_digits_after_decimal_point

3640341
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme

3640344
hide	show

3640575
setinterval	settimeout
don t ever pass a string to setinterval or settimeout if you can avoid it it performs an eval and has scope issues like the one you re currently experiencing since currenttime isn t a global variable

3640603

use the floor and ceiling of the min and max with the pretty value for significance

3640634
getter	setter
but remember creating getter setter with private fields is no encapsulation

3640682
postgresql	mysql
you could in theory use oracle or sql server or postgresql which are all mysql s competitors if you will in the database space

client-side	server-side
essentially you wire up client-side event handlers which do ajax http post requests to your server-side handler web service which then return back the response

3640722

tvos	ios
core plot is an open source plotting framework for macos ios and tvos

3640877
git-rebase	git-am
implementation details if you re interested by default git-rebase uses git-format-patch to create the diffs and then applies them with git-am with the --3way option directing it to fall back on 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to and we have those blobs available locally. it s also possible to tell git-rebase to use merge strategies internally in which case it directly calls the merge strategy recursive by default

3640907
verilog	hdl
the hardware design language hdl verilog is not hard for software engineers to pick up and learn you just have to think more in parallel execution than sequential execution

3643234
hash	salt
1 when two or more people use the same password without salt you can see who uses the same password the hash are all the same

3643234
hash	salt
by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult

3643234
hash	salt
so even if your user uses an easily attacked password say password which is pretty much guaranteed to be any in any password dictionary rainbow table by pre-pending your random salt value you make the hash pretty much guaranteed to be useless to the attacker

3643236
hash	salt
the salt isn t appended to the hash its appended to the password then hash

3644065
int	chars
i can think of a number of incredibly inelegant ways for instance having virtual functions in the global worldobject class to identify attributes - for instance a getobjecttype function returns int chars s anything that identifies the object as monster box or wall then in classes with more attributes say monster there could be more virtual functions say getspecies

3644073

3644455
disk	ram
on most modern oses oom will occur long after the system has become completely unusable since before actually running out the virtual memory system will start paging physical ram out to make room for allocating additional virtual memory and in all likelihood the hard disk will begin to thrash like crazy as pages have to be swapped in and out at higher and higher frequencies

getter	setter
i can avoid it using reflection - find all properties with public getter and setter in class1 and call prop.setvalue child prop.getvalue parent null null

3646568

getter	setter
it s ok to not use getter setter if members are immutable const or simple with no dependencies like a point class with members x and y

3649082
getter	setter
if member is private only it s also ok to skip getter setter

3649082
getter	setter	public	protected
if member is public or protected protected is just as bad as public and non- const non-simple or has dependencies then use getter setter

3649082
getter	setter
as a maintenance guy my main reason for wanting to have getter setter is because then i have a place to put break points logging something else

it supports single and multiple parent child multiple children chaining site columns content type and inline choice entry

3649311
floating-point	integer
you can compute the latter as a floating-point number to get more possible values for the frame rate which you can still round to the nearest integer of course

3649311
queue	fifo
for minimal computation consider a fifo queue of the last 5 delays pseudocode ...

3649369
bit-shift	xor

google-chrome	firefox
can use as much little javascript as appropriate i ve used dwr with ie6 firefox 3 google-chrome

3649668
google-chrome	safari
this happens because when specifying margin auto google-chrome and also safari as they both use webkit sets computed value of margin-left and margin-right to an equal sized used values

3649668
width	margin
so if you have a 1000px wide page and your element takes 50 width 500px and has margin auto then chrome will set element s computed value of margin-left and margin-right to 250px so it fills all the empty space between element s border edge and its parent element s content edge with margins and by so horizontally centers the element

3649668
google-chrome	firefox
you can actually see it happening using firebug in firefox and developer tools in google-chrome

3649669
client-side	server-side
you would have to generate javascript code that mimics the resources you need as asp.net runs server-side and javascript runs client-side

3649675
disk	ram
other than that as long as you have sufficient ram and or disk swap space you can have std strings of huge size

3649739

post	get
but when i am trying to get value of these post variables in my asp file contact_us.asp then it returns blank

3649809
post	get
and it should work but it not the right way of doing things for several reasons the most anoying one of which is that you won t get a full url on your edit page because you got there with a post request so if you refresh the page your item id param will be gone and will produce an error

3649813
int	chars

3650247
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
check out avaudioplayer class of the avfoundation

3650261

the issue is one of coupling since protected exposes the attributes methods to an unknown number of classes it s no different than public in that it s impossible to reliably state how many methods will be affected by a change of implementation

3650282
apache	nginx
apache and nginx are now supported via passenger or you can use a proxy with a mongrels cluster all these solutions don t need a dispatch.fcgi

3650979

i had thought in splitting the given string in the white spaces or punctuation symbols with a regular expression and the joining them controlling the length of the stringbuilder but i think splitting in all the words and then joining them may not be very efficient

3650989
google-chrome	firefox
i moved the mouse over event handler to the parent div and now firefox google-chrome etc

3651134
uiview	uiwindow
if you want to add a uiview to the top window you can use the application uiwindow for that

the second post suggests apart from mousemove a function which via css display property makes the image disappear after it s loaded and then reappear at the same spot thus according to the poster making the mouseover event fire

3651206
width	height
c should have the same fixed width as b but otherwise be of a variable height depending on how many components are added in the flow

ant	maven
i m not sure how you would change the names of the projects as part of the build without the help of a build tool like ant or maven

3651262

post	get
for my pennies worth i try and avoid using jquery to event handles such as post and get since normally the page then tries a refresh since no action was declared in the form statement

qstring	qfile
another advantage is that yourpath can be a qfile or qstring so that you can use it directly with the handle currently you are having

3651941
range	minimum
this alone is not quite enough to get the minimum while it works for normal values that has an unbounded set so the result will definitely lie within set s range and is therefore valid

3651941
range	minimum
we need the minimum within a range defined by the segment

3651984
pascal	delphi
i see that you like delphi so you can take a look at avrco multitasking pascal for avr

3652788
children	parent
i need to be able to return a list of all children given a parent id at all levels using sql

3654191
int	chars
the cast int - chars is a narrowing primitive conversion java language spec 5.1.3 and int is a signed int hence

3654191
int	chars
now what this means in terms of chars depends on how you want to interpret the int values

3654191

so if each of your int values is the number of a 16 bit code point you re fine actually this is only true for chars in the bmp

3657278
getter	setter
it may be that the getter or setter for the name in myobject is incorrect

3657316
int	chars
first of all never send int s and other types larger than chars like that - you will ignore endianness and the recipient might be unable to interpret the data properly

3657321
put	get
put is used as an opposite of get

3657321
put	get
the usual flow is that you get a resource modify it somehow and then you put it back at the same uri that you got it from

3657321
put	get
the uniformity of put also allows clients that understand this to modify a resource by first retrieving it get and then send a modified copy back put

3657321
post	put
so the answer to your question is that both post and put can be used for both create and update

3657382

wan	lan
generally tcp ip is preferred in a slow lan wan or dial-up network whereas named pipes can be a better choice when network speed is not the issue as it offers more functionality ease of use and configuration options

3658609
children	parent
you would have to store the whole state of the activity then change the layout to the layout that should be the child activity and if the user switches back to the parent activity you would have to save the state of the children activity and restore the state of the parent activity

3658635
executable	upx
i would like to test and validate an application that analyses executable files obfuscated with upx asprotect pecompact etc.

3658664
portrait	landscape
in windows phone 7 i simple write margin properties in landscape and portrait

3658673
inherited	properties
functions in addition to the hidden prototype properties also have a properties called prototype and it is this that you can access and modify to provide inherited properties and methods for the objects you make

3658673
inherited	properties
it s like class inherited because now any objects you make using new objmaker will also appear to have inherited the b properties

3658684
int	double
and then at some point in the future somebody notices that getthenumber only ever returns whole numbers so refactors it to return int rather than double

3658684
floating-point	integer
no compiler errors and you start seeing unexpected results because what was previously floating-point arithmetic has now become integer arithmetic without anybody noticing

3658692
rss	feed
i feel your pain - i agree that it all seems a bit cumbersome for a low volume rss feed .

3658783
post	get
however you can always lookup in the request post data - to get the selected drop-down value

3658824
folder	directory
if i set the output directory unit output directory and dcp output directory boxes of blgpackage package to its folder not only its bpl dcu dcp files will be stored there but also the bpl dcp files of mycontrols will be stored there

3658840

3658872
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
nsurlconnection and nsxmlparser are the classed you need to look at for solving first 2 problems

3658904
stateless	stateful
some people claim that web is stateless but applications are stateful one should not mix these two

3658921
128bit	64bit
extra details file is 40gb records are 128bit machine is 64bit os is posix

3658933
mouse	keyboard
at the moment i have code that runs in the application s sheetbeforerightclick event but i ve found that this code doesn t run when i press the keyboard s context menu key instead of using the right mouse button which means that i get the wrong menu

3658968
rss	feed
i m getting an rss xml feed from a url

3658982
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
if you are wanting a faster memset or memcpy memmove etc it is almost always possible to code one up yourself

3658996
google-chrome	firefox
ch for google-chrome f for firefox

3659023
mergesort	in-place
even so you re probably better off with a mergesort than a true in-place sort

3659036
width	height
this is a built in behavior of the newly released microsoft ribbon the containing window is stored in the ribbon object and the ribbon collapses when the width of the window is under 300 or the height of the window is under 250 the purpose is of course is that when space is scarce priority is given to the document not the ribbon

3659051
rss	feed
realistically you ll want a client side pull of the rss feed to get the latest data so you aren t dependent on google crawling the website

3659051
rss	feed
the client side software will directly pull the updated rss feed from the blog capturing the posts as they are published to the rss feed

3659073
hide	show
i have myself faced this issue many times as in like if i set toggle visibility handler on ahref click and some other action hide it show it by some other event like ajax load toggle will not keep track of it it will do what it is supposed to do alternate action to previous

3659073
hide	show
so for toggling requirements like such hide show i drilled down a much more obvious and controlled solution

3659073
hide	show
this way i can show hide even by some other event and it will be tracked commonly by a class showing

3659074
mouse	keyboard
this is strange because the documentation says that the change event is dispatched when the slider changes value due to mouse or keyboard interaction - the event is not triggered when you change it programmatically and the listener shouldn t even be called

3659080
flip	slide
so if i could flip the view in or fade it in or slide it from the right or the left or something that would be much better asthetically

3659114
post	put
json_response is the answer i collected from my manual tests - i put a printf in lib oauth tokens access_token.rb 44 in post to capture the response

3659116

width	height
image width and height of 100 100

3659174
bada	maemo
bada webos maemo etc

3659202
getter	setter
it seems odd and rather error-prone if i can only create a cronexpression with a string to parse instead of with getter and setter

3659263
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
because of how mouseover mouseout mouseenter events work they won t work while you re dragging an element - you ve got your draggable div under the mouse at all times so there s no mouseenter leave events being fired on the rest of the page

3659263
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
if you enter one of those zones then internally the libraries fire their mouseenter mouseleave mouseover events to simulate an actual mouseenter leave over event having occured

3659263
width	height
resizing is somewhat similar except you re adjusting height and width instead of top and left

3659283
intrinsics	inlining
also compilers might have an easier time optimizing inlining memset because it can have intrinsics support for it

3659283
memcpy	memset
for instance visual c++ will often generate inline versions of memcpy memset that are as small as a call to the library function thus avoiding push call ret overhead

3659283
memcpy	memset
but it all depends - and for normal stuff please stick to memset memcpy

3659299
pop-up	dialog
i m able to select this link with jquery and even to open a pop-up dialog when the user clicks it

the width beeing sent into scaletofitinside is the width and height trying to scale to 950px both in my example

3659354
put	get
anyway how i can get current host name and put it like this

3659372
keystore	jks
i have the public ca-cert and have created a keystore jks that i would like to use during generation of the client but this when run in to trouble

3659373
portrait	landscape
now when iads gets its turn in and the phone is in landscape orientation before the ad shows it will display the normal portrait iad

3659373
portrait	landscape
if i then turn the phone to portrait and back to landscape it shows the correct longer and thinner landscape version of the iad

3659411
rss	feed
of course if your cms can provide an rss feed of updates additions perhaps based on that update page you could use one of the many rss to twitter posting services

3659699
client-side	server-side
server-side authentication server-side authorization client-side encryption

3659699
client-side	server-side
server-side authentication server-side authorization client-side encryption using server credentials

3659699
client-side	server-side
if the data needs to be protected from your system you will need to do client-side encryption in addition to server-side authentication+authorization your option 3 as i restated it

3659722
fadein	fadeout
i need to make something fadein then stay there for a second and then fadeout using jquery

3659729
querypath	phpquery
it is said that phpquery is often faster than querypath because of fewer overall features

3659784
free	malloc
also doing another malloc free every time you replace one instance is pretty expensive

you can also use height and width together for a diagonal effect

3659830
hide	show
also try hide and show keywords instead of toggle they re cool too

3659842
curlpp	libcurl
you may use any other subclass of libcurl info found in instead of curlpp infos effectiveurl

3659874
post	get
each post has an id and a title and i need to be able to get both

3659938
post	get

3660038
pull	push
the key is to push or pull often

3660226
modula-2	oberon
wirth later developed modula-2 and oberon and those languages share much of pascal s design

3660260
uiview	subviews
called the subviews from uiviewcontroller instead of the the uiview

3660278
portrait	landscape
i think your view controller s shouldautorotatetoorientation method is not returning yes to landscape but to portrait orientations

3660288
put	get
however in order to get it completely random i have to put the thread to sleep for at least 300 counts between the random shuffling of the two columns anything lower than 300 returns both columns sorted in the same order as if it is using the same seed for randomness

3660336
post	get
have the link submit an ajax request to the controller action using an http get unless clicking the link changes server-side state in which case a post should be used

ok i could embed the aspectj ant tasks using the maven antrun plugin but i d hate to resort to that

3660558
integer	unsigned
sometimes i think it would be useful to have a 31-bit integer type which would support widening casts to both signed and unsigned int but i ve never heard of a language supporting such

3660617
hex	binary
ok so i ve got an array with integers converted from intel hex file and need to output it as binary

3660627
margin	height

put	get
but whatever value i put in there seems to get ignored

3660821
internationalization	localization

3660941
google-chrome	safari
webkit-based browsers like safari and google-chrome hide xml markup from the rendered text

3660969

3661197
put	get
features like that get cut immediately and put on the never do this list

3661198
post	get
this is why you get a warning when you refresh a page that was generated in response to a post

3661198
post	get
use get or post but capture the parameters and store them the redirect the user back to another clean url that displays those stored value

3661211
getter	setter
if you look up the pattern for a singleton and store your variable in that singleton add a setter and a getter you are on your way

3661211
getter	setter
in the long run setter and getter and singletons are all bad code smells but no where near as bad as a settable public variable

3661228
width	height
you need to wrap your width and height values in quotes

3661236

jquery ui s draggable and droppable functionality would be the standard but it will require some javascript programming

3661558
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i assigned the code above to the viewwillappear to the root uiviewcontroller of my uinavigationcontroller and it worked

3661636
filesystems	ntfs
there is one way using multiple streams but only works in ntfs filesystems

3661648
min	max
edit originally used uint32_min but as jens gustedt poited out this is the one combination of signed unsigned and min max that doesn t occur

3661685
children	parent
however whenever the value of this is changed the existing children created by the repeater will be removed from the parent and new ones will be added

3661792
dictionary	map
the problem ended up being the dictionary class i got it to vaguely work by throwing in a bunch of try catch blocks but that wasn t what i wanted so i replaced it with a map and it works fine

3661793
folder	directory
the solution folder is typically one above the project directory so give this a shot

3661833
equals	gethashcode
btw the ide is probably already giving you a warning that gethashcode and equals should always be treated together.

3661858
webclient	httpwebrequest
it would take more work but rather than using webclient use httpwebrequest and set the allowautoredirect property to false

3661941
int	chars
use the select int int method first to select the last chars

3661975
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox 3.6 ie8 and google-chrome 5

3661980
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for settings in httpd.conf eg that pertain to apache itself rather than php you ll need to use .htaccess files

3662011
button	checkbox
you need to use radio button and group them rather than doing it by checkbox

3662024
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for apache use .htaccess which will grant you control over much of what would httpd.conf would have given you

3662159
put	get
i ve put logging in all the functions which get registered with register_shutdown_function and it s not happening in any of those

3662160
single-quotes	double-quotes
in mysql by default single-quotes and double-quotes are literal string delimiters while backticks are identifier quotes

3662164
spweb	spsite
i m still a little fuzzy on when to dispose of sp objects so i always dispose of my spweb and spsite objects.

3662303
width	height
i am persisting the positions of these boxes using core data into a sqlite database by holding the height width x and y of the top-left corner

3662303
uiview	subviews
however once the uiview for the subviews is on screen it is positioned at a different location clearly visible and confirmed by checking the values in the frame of the view

3662329
int	boolean	int	double
the object types of primitive types in java double int boolean etc are if i remember correctly immutable

3662347
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
and i do not wish to parse the body content into an object model created by xsd.exe or svcutil.exe whether or not those tools could even produce an object model that could successfully serialize deserialize this particular xml is a matter of vigorous debate

3662355
ilist	icollection
icollection and ilist provide a set of similar functionality to accomplish an operation on a collection without worrying about the specifics

3662366
superclass	subclassing
in your subclassing constructor super has been called implicitly the constructor of the superclass is finished the final fields in the superclass should not be modified

3662377
folder	directory
first you can make your script search every folder under it s starting directory

3662383
width	height
the static method basically just looks at the number of characters and determines a scaling factor to apply to the textview s text size and then incrementally increases the text size until the overall height an estimated height -- using the width of the text the text height and the width of the textview is just below that of the textview

3662399
superclass	subclassing
every constructor of a subclassing must invoke a constructor of the superclass as its first operation

3662399
superclass	subclassing
given those rules it is impossible for a subclassing constructor to directly assign a value to a final superclass member

3662429
width	height
and then used .getscreensize but i am sure you could use it to get the width and height of your parent application with something like this

3662431
parent-child	one-to-many
only way i know to do this is with foreign generator but for one-to-many relation with parent-child i can t have parent-key as primary key in child table

3662452
awt	swing
finally it is not possible to use swing component with blackberry j2me.mobiles doesnt support swing awt

3662497
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me in firefox 3.6.8 ie 8 and google-chrome 5

3662509
yacc	bison
some useful tools are yacc and bison and lexx

3662515
subtract	add
in the second cte allmissingtests we subtract the tests that have been taken using the except operator and add a 0 to represent their not-done status when we insert them you can replace that with no - when i ran this test i used a bit column

3662531
google-chrome	firefox
the site runs fine under both google-chrome and firefox

3662568
converter	multibinding
one of the ways to force the converter to be called again is to add a binding to the multibinding that is bound to a property that will change every time the text of the richtextbox changes

3662637
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox 3.6.8 google-chrome 6.0.472.53 beta and ie 8.0.7600.16385

3662654
int	chars
in function int main int chars chars expected unqualified-id before token

3662705
folder	directory
i created two directory in my webapp folder named 1 and 2 and i am able to navigate to both packages using the urls above

3662734
spaces	delimiter
delimiter should be spaces semicolon or comma just like in stackoverflow

3662746
strstr	substr
since what we re looking for is a constant we can use strstr which finds the first instance of a substr in a string case insensitively instead of a regular expression

3662746
content-disposition	content-type
there are four mime headers that can appear here content-type as we saw before content-id content-disposition and content-transfer-encoding

3662772
actionscript	mxml
i guess you have to use actionscript or mxml states to achieve a similar behaviour

3662776
serializable	deserialization
if you want to avoid serializable and deserialization to objects it is way to go but in that case any xml can arrive

3662792
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and i think google-chrome can be configured by their users not by your code to allow focus requests but by default they won t

3662807
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
because only fortran 2003 standard includes fflush statement and the ability to determine numbers that corresponds to stdout stderr units

3662807
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
however in gfortran for example you can use fflush intrinsic procedure with the equivalents of unix file descriptors unit 5 for stdin unit 6 for stdout and unit 0 for stderr

3662843
nexus	artifactory
ivy is great for managing small repos however i d recommend considering a full blown repository manager like nexus artifactory or archiva

3662876
prepare	execute
you must use dynamic sql to prepare and execute an sql string to achieve what you describe

3662899
int	chars
int sprintf chars str const chars format .

3662909
post	put
i put together a blog post a while ago on how to interrogate groovy closures for values

3662924
min	max
select id rid min modified max active did from foo group by rid did order by id

3662926
serializable	deserialization
seems that there really is a problem with serializable deserialization

3662930
put	get
as you can see i have put uiapplication sharedapplication statusbarorientation to try and get this but it still only save the photos in portrait

3662985
width	height
i have tried setting explicit pixel values for the width and height as well as using the border_width definition and fill_parent options

3663012
rsa	dsa
adding to erickson s answer if your certificate does not use a rsa key-pair and instead turns out to use a dsa key-pair then no amount of rsa cipher suite stuffing will aid in resolving this issue

3663012
rsa	dsa
the reason this edge case might turn out to be your problem is due to the default behavior of the keytool utility when generating secret keypairs - dsa and not rsa is the default algorithm

3663027
getter	setter
i have an object field that contains a field called value which is a string with getter and setter

3663042
multicastdelegate	delegation
maybe someone with a bit more esoteric knowledge of delegation and multicastdelegate can shed some light on this

3663044
portrait	landscape
i also receive notifications in between landscape portrait changes such as when the device goes 45 degrees between landscape portrait

3663044
portrait	landscape
i only care about changes from full 90 landscape portrait changes and would like to discard all other changes without doing anything

3663066
cpu	affinity
try using windows task manager to set the affinity on your matlab.exe process to a single cpu

3663066
cpu	affinity
on the processes tab right-click matlab.exe set affinity... un-check all but cpu 0. if the crazy timing goes away while affinity is set looks like you found the cause

3663066
cpu	affinity
you don t want to have to muck around with cpu affinity

3663086
post	get
i have a php script that gets a string from a post or get request and looks for that string and returns a value in that row

3663090
folder	directory
alternately you can place a completion template in your resources directory in the perl folder

3663105
actualheight	actualwidth
you can use actualheight and actualwidth to get the size and you can work out the bottom and right by adding those to the location

3663107
post	get
in this post you see how you get the position

3663121
uiswitch	uibutton
i ve done this successfully with a uiswitch in each row but can t use the same method for the uibutton

3663173
getter	setter
you can t use a basic lock command to control access to a resource outside the scope of the object and that means that the traditional getter setter designs don t work

3663173
getter	setter
another possible method is to expose getter and setter but implement your own access control by using a checkout model

3663173
getter	setter
until that thread calls the setter aborts etc. all other threads attempting to access the getter are kept in a yield loop

3663174
width	height
jframe.setresizable true lets the user resize both the width and height of a window

3663189
width	height
you will have to play with padding and width height of the elements to get it to float where you want it

3663239
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also this is happening in firefox google-chrome safari have not tested in ie

3663336
mouseover	mousemove
every time you mouseover the elements you attach a new mousemove event

3663336
hide	show
much better to have it in the dom to start with just hide and show it

3663367
implements	extends
probably you need to extends org.apache.shindig.gadgets.render.proxyrenderer implements org.netmera.portal.shindig.requestpipeline org.apache.shindig.gadgets.templates.templatemodule and more and more.

3663370
google-chrome	firefox
i can get the right result from firefox and google-chrome

3663419
children	parent
this doesn t make any sense for a one-to-many relation you can t use the pk of the parent as the pk of a child if you can have many children

3663419
parent-child	one-to-many
only way i know to do this is with foreign generator but for one-to-many relation with parent-child i can t have parent-key as primary key in child table

3663435
jobs	cron
1 - may not look production quality but i m using this and others like it on some cron jobs and php sites and it s working well

3663456
width	height
alright i have a div which is 50px height and the width does not matter that has a title displayed

3663474
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
as for sequential programming the minimum is one imperative language and one functional language ideally both lisp scheme and haskell but f# is a good start

3663547
maple	maxima
macsyma maxima maple mathematica or any other cas would also help you if you need answers and not solutions

3663584
for-loop	loops
when you add the layer to the root layer inside the for-loop set the animations media timing s property begintime with a cgfloat that increments every time loops fires

3663588
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
i ve created a static archive library that uses the avaudioplayer class and links against the avfoundation

3663616
scheme	racket
you might check out the typed variant of racket previously known as plt scheme

3663616
scheme	racket
since racket is a scheme metaprogramming is par for the course and the runtime can emit native code by way of a jit

3663633
comparator	comparable
i would imagine that in the general case this saves a fair amount of code being developed to implement comparator since the key is likely a type that is already comparable

3663641
children	parent
one way to do this would be to keep track of how many items are in the left and right branches of each node on an insert or delete change the node count of parent nodes when changing the count of the children

3663655
width	height
i want the imagesz to be displayed at 80-90 of the original width and height

3663665
oncreate	recreate	portrait	landscape
i just want to set some flags when my orientation is in landscape so that when the activity is recreate in oncreate i can toggle between what to load in portrait vs

3663674
dotcms	velocity
i am working on a dotcms project where we are writing html javascript and velocity - but no java there has been no need yet

3663701
post	get
i ve been working on an app that uses both get and post requests to web services

3663701
post	get
the get requests are no problems but the post requests are killing me

3663711
cos	sin
so i tried to multiply these by the sin and cos os the y rotation but it did not work

3663722
post	put
i know this doesn t directly answer your question - i was going to post this as a comment but with the amount of content i wanted to put it in my only choice was to provide an answer.

3663725
vmware	virtualbox
i suspect it s not that common to have multiple network cards in a machine running winxp but it is common to have vmware or virtualbox virtual interfaces that expose this issue with msmq binding

3663798
comparator	comparable
for instance maybe you require classes to be comparable to one another comparator and you also want to make sure the user of your template class remembers to override tostring so the data can be displayed iformattable

3663801
uiview	subviews
but i want the two subviews -- the scrollview containing the image and the uiview containing the buttons -- to autorotate when the user switches orientations

3663812
bash	tcsh
open your terminal and run bash if you use tcsh and do

3663868
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
you duplicate the source tree for that project to your machine and put the duplicate under a version control system svn hg git bazaar -- whatever -- there s a bazillion good free ones quite independendently from any vcs it might have been in originally -- the point is being able to save your edits all the time and revert them easily if and when you make mistakes

3663889
min	max
there are also min and max attributes and a required attribute

3663894
switching	screens
the full-screen mode potentially changes the screens resolution and switching to windowed mode changes it back to what it was previously

3663930
draggable	droppable
as it turned out writing my own calendar based on jquery s draggable droppable ui component is not that hard and is way more flexible and extensible

3663966
range	minimum
realize one thing school is there to teach you a wide range of things - to a minimum level

3663996
put	get
as with most secrets if you don t want others to get them don t put them on the page

3664077
public	protected
the constructor is fine with the default or private modifier but gives me a compiler error if given the public or protected modifiers

3664096
public	protected
thus you cannot have a public or protected constructor because that would allow more instances to be created

3664168
opera	google-chrome
tested with success in ie 8.0 opera google-chrome

3664171
dictionary	map
if you decide to implement the map as a list you would keep the elements sorted by key so that lookup is o lg n giving you another sorted dictionary -- in the form of a sorted list

3664171
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
of course the name sorteddictionary was already taken but sortedlist wasn t

3664183
put	get
extract one class will open the file and get all the data in chunks you know how to work with usually you take a single row from the file and parse its data into a poco object containing fields that hold pertinent data and put those into a queue that other work processes can take from

3664200
ready	each
then you will perform the two recv calls only on those which are ready -- say for a very busy system half a dozen of them each time around for example

3664200
ready	each
in addition with approach 1 you can block until at least one connection is ready no overhead in that case which won t be rare in systems that aren t all that busy -- with the other approaches you ll need to be polling churning continuously burning huge amounds of cpu to no good purpose or if you sleep a while after each loop of checks then you ll have a delay in responding despite the system not being at all busy -- eep

3664256
post	get
rest is pretty simple to use from any client that you can access libraries that do http get post

3664259
rar	zip
each fontfile is supposedly i didnt check all there are really many inside a rar archive which together with a readme is in a zip archive which together with another readme is in each its own folder

3664286
pull	push
rollback is a one-level undo of the last pull or received push or commit

3664307
google-chrome	firefox
they don t appear in other browsers ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox

3664310
hide	show
if you have a headertemplate or a footertemplate defined you could add any htmlcontrol or servercontrol inside of either of them and then programatically show hide it in the codebehind

3664316
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need it to work under ie7+ firefox safari google-chrome

3664407
put	get
failing that put up a please wait whenever they select a tab statistics show that users don t feel the performance is bad if they get a please wait message

3664413
google-chrome	firefox
reading over the w3 specification i m led to believe that google-chrome and firefox are correct

3664413
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i also decided to test safari 5 opera google-chrome and firefox 3.6.8 all on a mac

3664464
width	height
it seems to me that all of denominators of the division operations are constants width height max... and these will not change throughout the course of the image

3664464
division	multiplication
as far as i can remember the multiplication operation takes about 10 clock cycles where as the division takes around 70

3664488
button	checkbox
when parsing an array set of checkbox radio button etc.

3664495
firefox	safari
internet explorer 8 firefox safari etc

3664537
recv	epoll
i ve got a problem sometimes not regularly recv returns -1 and while using epoll in edge-triggered mode

3664556
apache	nginx
use a similar strategy as #1 but do it via web server configuration apache or nginx avoiding the rails app entirely

3664578
width	height
instead of giving the anchor elements specific width and height which is useless anyway because they are given display block already you can give them a padding

3664685
versioning	upgrade
-u tells pip to upgrade packages to the latest versioning and -r tells it to install all packages in requirements.txt

3664692
clang	llvm
for example you could read in c with clang use llvm to do some optimization and then write out code in another language like java or maybe fortran

3664693
button	checkbox
for example when i hit do not refactor checkbox the affirmative action button says preview .

3664721
inherited	properties
the difference with the first method is that the in operator checks also for inherited properties for example

3664757
fastcgi	scgi
patches welcome that would be an async server instad and scgi fastcgi and ajp protocols for connection an external web server like apache to your application

3664788
post	get
it provided a nicely accessible somewhat dict-like object for accessing the form data whether in a post or get context

3664840
division	multiplication
performing multiplication then division will avoid some rounding errors but may fail if the image is huge if it overflows

3664881
primes	palindrome
you wouldn t want to use regex to detect palindrome for the same reasons you wouldn t want to use regex to find primes

3664914
rubygems	bundler
e instantrails-2.0-win ruby lib rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.0.0 lib bundler lo

3664957
hypersql	hsqldb
hypersql more commonly known as hsqldb is pure java rdbms which is specialized around running it as part of your application meaning that you can embed it to your software and it just works

3664965
mpmediaitem	avfoundation
from an mpmediaitem you can get an avasset see avfoundation

3664966
jsf	wicket
if you choose java as i am from java so easier to answer you can pick jsp-servlet jsf wicket spring mvc gwt etc

3664983
hide	show
i need to bind the click function on each div of this ordered list in order to make hide show an image on each imgxx div i m newbie with jquery

3665035
teamcity	nant
we are using teamcity v4 and nant for continuous integration builds on a server in our work area

3665035
mp3	wav
we would like to have the build server play an mp3 or wav file when the build fails

3665039
google-chrome	firefox
my greasemonkey scripts all work in firefox 3.6 but in google-chrome 6 nothing special happens when i load a page that is supposed to trigger them

3665098
csla	devforce
b return the object directly from a service operation as is done in a framework like csla and i think devforce follows a similar approach for returning business classes via a wcf service

3665108
google-chrome	firefox
the issue is not happening in google-chrome but is in ie6 7 8 and firefox

3665135
move	drag
drag an imagelist onto your form and use the image list functions to move it around

3665191
squash	merge	squash	branch
when your changes are ready squash your half-baked commits using rebase and merge the result into your master and delete the throw-away branch

3665223
post	get
when i just try to do where andthe post date time i get an error because of the space and if i quote it i think it takes it as a string

3665305
int	double
it s very unlikely that long is neither the same as or double the size of int so this is practical if not theoretically perfect

3665331
hash	md5
but you should be aware that crc32 will have more collisions than md5 or even sha-1 hash simply because of the reduced length 32 bits compared to 128 bits respectively 160 bits

3665362
webkit	gecko
i m set on supporting at least gecko and webkit but if i can manage opera and ie that would be a bonus

3665390
getter	setter
i m quite new in c++ after few years in java and eclipse i got little bit confusing using code blocks no autogenerate setter getter and also implement interface d

3665404
put	get
so that means hashmap is not able to identify that the two keys for get put call are same

3665444
richfaces	icefaces
however this library is compatible with others libraries like richfaces or icefaces

3665450
comparator	comparable
comparator comparable and comparator are typically used for sorting and only take the place of using the equals method for object equivalance in some cases - examples are implementers of sortedset such as treeset

3665487
filtering	grouping
using the same approach with the memberof 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 filtering but using the domain root instead of the user as a search base is not feasible as the query takes too long probably it computes all the grouping memberships recursively for all users in the domain and checks if they are member of the given grouping

3665493
jobs	cron
for one-shot jobs the at command is better suited than cron

3665593
post	get
i realise this is a special case in my application where the form field is not atomic but a list however its really confusing me that the data binds in the get request but not on the post

3665655
action-filter	onactionexecuting
it seems to me that either a base controller override of onactionexecuting or a custom action-filter is the most likely way of doing this

3665659
prototypejs	mootools
i don t know if you are familiar with the concepts of jquery or some other javascript helper framework like prototypejs or mootools but it s a vital idea to use one of them

3665662
width	height
i have not set the width or height of the usercontrol not even the viewboxes

3665662
width	height
because it does not have a height or width

3665755
uiview	subviews
typically the parent view the one acting as a tab bar controller contains a header which never changes and a uiview below which displays the 3 child views as subviews

3665755
portrait	landscape
but when the current view is small enough to fit in the window without scrolling so scrolling isn t possible and i change orientation to landscape the scrollview doesn t resize its height and i become able to scroll to the extent of the scrollview in portrait mode

3665755
portrait	landscape
the second one is a bit more convoluted say i am in the first view in portrait mode i switch to the second view go to landscape mode and the switch back to the first view still in landscape mode the part of the view corresponding to the child view isn t resized.

3665769
put	get
the instructions ask you to put a script block and script link into the head of the page to get it all working

3665818
ant	maven
i have resorted to compiling aspectj via ant using the maven antrun plugin

3665818
folder	directory
i compile java classes first and let apt do it s stuff use the compiled classes as binary input for aspectj compile aspectj into a new folder and move the resulting woven classes to the original compile directory overwriting the non-aspectj classes

3665818
ant	maven
in the next step i have now created a maven plugin that does all this ant calling internally

3665818
ant	maven
using ant gmaven integration it was easy to assembly the parameters combining the powers of maven groovy and ant

3665843
post	get
i am currently trying to develop a web server that can service basic get and post http requests from a browser

3665853
int	chars
a chars is basically an int but with a pointer in the ascii table

3665853
int	chars
all chars have a corresponding int value as you can clearly see when trying to parse it

3665857
post	get
can we able to upload a file using http get or post requet in html form tag

3665875
post	get
make your form post method not get

3665875
post	get
get is for requestig data and post for storing

3665880
post	get
get is limited to a few kilobytes in maximum length and multipart form-data will work only with the post method

3665913
google-chrome	firefox
firefox with firebug is good you can also try google-chrome which includes a suite of develop tools

3665924
getter	setter
i use project lombok to automatically generate getter and setter methods for all fields of a java class

3665924
getter	setter
when a field is annotated with xmltransient the annotation is not propagated to the generated getter setter methods thus in the resulting code it does not show any effect

3665971
width	height
see if there s a height or width difference

i thought this might just be me but i have looked in both firefox and google-chrome and on two different computers

3670684
textmate	textwrangler
what i want to avoid is the necessity of using the terminal to run scripts textwrangler textmate and idle for python can do this

3670710
post	get
one way you might get messages via the hook would be to have your post-commit hook post messages to rabbitmq or some other queue which your application could then consume and do its own processing

3670726
superclass	subclassing
from my understanding polymorphism stretches the fact that you could exchange an instance of a class by an instance of a subclassing and late binding means that when you call a method of an instance the type decides which method subclassing superclass gets called

3670760
post	get
i have tried doing an http post with their sample data and the response i get back doesn t match what it s supposed to

3670774

google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox google-chrome

3670841
hash	md5
they are too fast--you can calculate at least 1 000 000 md5 hash a second per core with a modern computer so brute force is feasible against most passwords people use

3670841
hash	md5
attempts per second against the md5 hash

3670841
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
crypt sha512 on the other hand is a very different beast that like its bcrypt counterpart performs key stretching producing a very different hash with a random salt built-in and will take anything between 500 and 999999 times as much to compute stretching is tunable

3670841
crypt	md5
or at least crypt md5 phk

3670858
folder	directory
from the command-line in my working space i could svn cp the working space directory to the branch folder selecting only the modules particular to a project

3670866
allocator	stl
you could also experiment with writing a custom allocator for the stl containers although it seems that that sort of work is generally advised against

3670875
allocator	stl
for this particular thing you can either mess at the c++ layer by overriding new and supplying custom allocator to the stl

3670911
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is unique to firefox this doesn t happen on ie safari or google-chrome

3670952

3670966
folder	directory
i have a site with a virtual directory structure like mysite.com folder title which is actually a .htaccess rewrite to

3670966
folder	directory
but i don t want to password protect the main site mysite.com and right now if i put the .htaccess file in the mysite.com directory i am protecting mysite.com and mysite.com folder

3671106
width	height
i just need to know whether i am on iphone iphone 4 and then determine the image width height to load

3671122
g++	gcc
g++ 3 is very old and the gcc community has long since dropped maintenance of it

3671122
g++	gcc
also boost support for g++ 3 seems to be nearing an end as boost 1.44 considers gcc 3 .4.6 as an additional test compiler on only a single platform rhel

3671138
content-disposition	content-type
install firebug and examine response headers to figure out what s being sent probably content-type or content-disposition header

filtering	grouping
added a where to filtering single-occurrence grouping

3671249
hide	show
this code will show and hide the divs based on the mouse position

3671250
for-loop	arrays
for string and arrays handling most probably i am inventing some for-loop algorithm in java when in php i always find some ready-made function

3671257
superclass	subclassing
that pattern allows you to define a series of steps in the superclass and default implementations of those steps if applicable - then subclassing need only override the steps relevant to their specific processing

3671382
int	double
i picked this function specifically as the math.pow is very prohibitive and only allows a double s or int s for its parameters

3671405
wordpress	joomla
i almost went with wordpress but the company wanted joomla for there site

3671421
post	get
this works by hitting an http post request with a username and password if you re good you get a session id back if not you get a 401

3671429
np-hard	np-complete
and if you could explain me where np-complete and np-hard got their names that would be great i m pretty sure i get the meaning of them i just don t see what their names have to do with what they are

3671436
folder	directory
example using git creates mojo folder in current directory

3671461
jtextfield	jfilechooser
i would like to have a jbutton with a folder icon image inside a jtextfield like over on the far right of the jtextfield so that when clicked the button opens up a jfilechooser and when a file is selected the path to the file appears inside the jtextfield

3671486
jboss	weblogic
or you can create connection pools in your container jboss weblogic etc

3671503
np-hard	np-complete
an np-complete problem is simply one of the problems in np that is np-hard

3671506
getter	setter
another option would be to actually store the bar field as a string and to do some conversion from and to an enum in the getter setter

3671528
np-hard	np-complete
formally a problem is in np-hard iff there is an np-complete problem that is polynomial time turing-reducible to it

3671592
objectdatasource	formview
i have a asp.net page that contains a formview and objectdatasource

3671605
int	double
you don t have to cast the number to an int if a double works for you i was just keeping with the spirit of what you wrote above.

3671611
width	height
i have a square canvas with a width of 100 and a height of 100

3671635
int	chars
no files will ever have eof neither chars nor int in them

3671653
partition-problem	np-complete
this is the optimization version of partition-problem which is np-complete although according to that article there are heuristics that solve the problem in many instances either optimally or approximately.

3671673
x86	64bit
compile for x86 run on 64bit os crashes with module not found

3671724
width	height
i m tasked with auto-generating a rather large document consisting of a number of distinct sections of varying height and constant full-page width

3671767
free	malloc
since newperson is dynamically allocated with malloc remember to free it when you no longer need it

3671808
portrait	landscape
when i add the first view it is in landscape that s fine but when adding the second it is automatically in portrait mode

3671812
satisfiability	np-complete
as you might guess finding a way to restate every possible problem as one particular one wasn t easy and i ll just say that the problem with logical statements above the satisfiability problem was the first proved np-complete

3671812
np-hard	np-complete
therefore the tsp is np-hard since it s at least as hard as an np-complete problem

3671819
free	malloc
the most important thing you should learn in writing this program is that anything you malloc needs to be free d

3671819
free	malloc
if you change your structure member to be a pointer you will need to malloc it and then free it whenever appropriate

3671877
google-chrome	firefox
i thought the best solution for this may be http streaming however i can only get it working in firefox not google-chrome or ie8.

3671879
oncreate	setcontentview
so for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place

3671881
post	get
in the post action reconstruct the list in your view model using a repository the same way you did in the get action that rendered the form

3671907
strcpy	strncpy
then use strcpy rather i d suggest strncpy instead as the others have suggested

3671942
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome work fine but ie6 doesn t really care about this div

3671977
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i am developing for all major browsers out there ie 6+ firefox 3+ current safari google-chrome opera 9.5+

freebsd	linux
less on linux freebsd macosx has the + option to send initial commands to less

3672058
hide	show
show all images of row but hide via styling other images except first last - theming views or styling css

3672066
rsa	aes
you can encrypt an rsa public key using aes encryption if you wish but it is unnecessary as it is not something you need to keep secret

3672066
rsa	aes
you can encrypt an rsa private key using aes encryption

3672072
strcpy	malloc
you need no strcpy you need no malloc you need no sizeof etc

3672077
folder	directory
recursively enumerate all of the files and folder in the top-level directory

3672077
folder	directory
for each item that you enumerate either create the folder in the destination directory or copy the source file to the destination directory hierarchy

3672077
folder	directory
the following will enumerate all of the files and folder in a directory

3672143
jobs	cron
i forgot to do the cron jobs

3672145
folder	directory
so far the best way to deal with this situation which i found is to substitute automatically generated by eclipse makefile which is stored in debug directory created by eclipse in the project folder with my own makefile in which i just include this lines

3672180
hide	show
i am using hide and show

3672180
hide	show
i made it so that when you click on a menu item it show but i cannot figure out how to make it so that when you click on anything other than the menu it will hide

3672221
button	checkbox
i m trying to use a radio button in my modelform but its just outputting nothing when i do an override this way it just prints the label in my form not the radio buttosn if i don t do the override it does a standard checkbox

3672234
punctuation	words
words are anything separated by a space and punctuation doesn t matter as long as it s part of a words

3672264
vsto	add-in
they need to sign not only the msi package but also the vsto add-in inside of that msi

3672264
vsto	add-in
worst case my current thinking is that i split the setup project into it s own solution and i ll build the vsto add-in pass them to the customer and then upon receiving those back use the second solution to create the msi and then give him that to sign as well

3672296
put	get
the formdetails action would get all the data including the url to your image only and put it all together

3672297
gson	jackson
choices like jackson and gson are big improvements so it is worth considering using them

3672347
serializable	deserialization
then you can have special cases for the actual type of element being deserialized but note that each element type serializable deserialization has to be phisically written as static c++ code

3672360
google-chrome	safari
this works splendidly in google-chrome however in safari and safmob there is noticeable latency

3672367
postgresql	mysql
so i m left wondering whether i should stick to mysql which i m fairly familiar with or should i switch to something like postgresql

3672376
client-side	server-side
if you don t then not only do you have to write and debug new parsing code but you re also side-stepping a lot of form functionality provided by browsers web servers web crawlers client-side scripts and server-side frameworks

3672377
accessor	properties
i can code the basics of reflection inspection to produce a list of properties but how do i wire up a set of delegate based accessor for a potentially random set of properties types

3672426
client-side	server-side
comparing primarily client-side and server-side languages is comparing apples and oranges

3672438
stretchblt	bitblt
so far i have found a couple of ways of doing this one below which i modified to use stretchblt and another which i create another larger bitmap and then bitblt it onto this new enlarged bitmap which has a higher dpi with this like bicubic scaling set to high

3672442
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are both open-source dbmss that will continue to be developed by independent parties should their current maintainers corporate or otherwise get bored

3672449
postgresql	mysql
if you re looking for a reason to switch to postgresql sunoracle bought mysql isn t a good one

3672503
post	get
it s not an easy thing to get right but there are some post about it here

3672522
stretchblt	bitblt
instead of using bitblt you can use stretchblt

3672558
getter	setter
prints out hello by first using the dynamic setter to set it to hello and then using the dynamic getter to obtain the property from the object

3672566
translation	localization
in other words the foundation framework developers have provided more useful messages and had the localization folks translation them etc

3672569
opends	apacheds
we are looking at building an application that either proxies a standalone ldap server or delegates to an embedded java ldap instance ie apacheds opends in order to log requests and determine who is accessing which applications on our very large corporate network

3672569
opends	apacheds	pull	push
my question is is there a good way to intercept an ldap request and pull it apart or have either opends apacheds push notifications of requests coming into ldap

3672577
int	chars
because is c x is actually an int while in c++ it s a chars

3672584
folder	directory
but in general to copy a directory tree excluding certain files or folder i d recommend using rsync instead of cp

3672613
min	max
min and max are your friends

3672617
int	chars
change type of chars literal is changed from int to chars

3672636
min	max
using sorted the min max builtins or the second solution above seems overkill in this case

3672636
range	max	range	min	min	max
and remember that range min max will iterate from min to max - 1

3672673
inherited	properties
the current directory is a properties of a running program process that gets inherited by processes created by that process

3672701
firefox	safari
in firefox 3.5 and safari 4 a cross-site xmlhttprequest will not successfully obtain the resource if the server doesnâ t provide the appropriate cors headers notably the access-control-allow-origin header back with the resource although the request will go through

3672760
decimal	ieee
ieee floats only have 24 effective bits of mantissa roughly between 7 and 8 decimal digits

3672760
subtraction	addition
this shows why addition subtraction between numbers of very different sizes in not a good thing from a numerical point of view when calculating with floating point arithmetic.

3672770
rss	feed
you could create a website with the yahoo pipes rss output as the auto-discovery feed set up bidirectional links to your google profile and then plug it in as a connected site in buzz

3672777
versioning	upgrade
i m only trying to upgrade because i figured it s good to have the most recent versioning

3672777
serializable	deserialization
the array had values before being serializable r282 but not after deserialization r282

3672779
folder	directory
the contents of the library s library folder are structured so as to be suitable for autoloading so ideally i want the contents of library to exist in the zf app s library directory

3672844
kerberos	ntlm
the service may be hosted with either ntlm or kerberos authentication and needs to work under either

3672844
kerberos	ntlm
that is if connecting to the service via kerberos fails then it should fall back to ntlm

3672848
organization	naming
they help avoid naming collisions between types that different developers and different organization create and share

3672853
width	height
wpf is ridiculous in that not manually specifying properties such as width and height in this case causes them to have the values doulbe.nan

3672853
width	height
i m not going to manually set a width and height in the xaml because that stops it from resizing

3672853
actualheight	actualwidth
i read about actualwidth and actualheight but they were consistently returning 0 and 0 for me

3672865
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you can use elements actualwidth and actualheight properties to get the values of the width and height when they were drawn

3672890
google-chrome	firefox
the npapi is being gradually deprecated by google-chrome and mozilla firefox

3672890
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox team has indicated that they will be eventually supporting native messaging like google-chrome does

3672897
width	height
the wpf frameworkelement class provides two dependencyproperties for that purpose frameworkelement.actualwidth and frameworkelement.actualheight will get the rendered width and height at run-time

3672913
activemq	rabbitmq
and if you do need them you can add them to tomcat with openejb and rabbitmq or activemq

3672940
super	self
when you say super cls self .helloworld python

3672944
getter	setter
you could have a getter and setter for a pointer though that raises a whole host of memory management questions you ll have to answer

3672959
post	get
i m trying to have a select form with a list of months but i can t seem to get it to post correctly

3672963
post	get
i am using post method for get method we can use hash but i am looking for post method

3672964
free	malloc
the trick is that you have to use malloc and free instead of retain and release

3672964
accessor	properties
as for the properties you can declare them you ll just have to write your own accessor and mutators

3673006
getter	setter
if you want getter or setter for the int elements of the array you will have to declare and write them manually the old fashioned way before properties

3673015
post	get
i get everything working except that my created comment doesn t know the post_id in mysql the comment is persisted yet it doesn t know the post it belongs_to

3673080
jms	jta
and if you are not going to use jta ejbs jms jmx etc there is no real advantage at using jboss especially during development tomcat is lighter and starts faster this is often appreciated by development teams

3673137
led	electronics
bullshit- all digital electronics control light output from led s by flashing on and off many many times a second

3673197
ati	nvidia
in non-solr geek terms this means the ati cards 34 nvidia 23 intel 5 style of navigation links that you can use to drill-down through product catalogs on sites like zappos amazon newegg and lowe s.

3673205
jndi	jta	jms	jta
jboss is j2ee specification compliant it supports j2ee specification very well such as ejb jta jms jndi and etc

3673217
rank	max
edit it appears the best way to do this is to find the get the max for a member s existing rank and add one.

3673244
move	drag
therefore if you d be having an interface that allows users to drag and move tracks around to rank them in order simply assign them a sequential rank number and when they hit save send this information to the database

3673252
qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel	qstandarditem	qtreeview
1 c++ only attach your qtreeview to a qstandarditemmodel and when you add items as qstandarditem objects you can call qstandarditem setbackground with either qt blue or qt red depending of whether the item is a room or a user

3673252
qtreeview	qstyleditemdelegate
2 c++ and css define a qstyleditemdelegate that you attach to your qtreeview

3673278
rank	max
if so you could simply cheat and keep a max rank field in the users table for each userid

3673299
for-loop	arrays
will give you an arrays like object which you can treat as an arrays for-loop of ids

3673314
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup use keyeventargs which exposes the keys enum via the keydata property

3673330
min	max
connection to db spring connection pooling min 50 max 350

3673332
hash	md5
since there are only 1000 options and their md5 hash are known it should take an attacker just a 1000 trials to verify the account without it really belonging to them

3673334
vpn	lan
their needs are varied from rfid or gps asset people tracking to simple stock control systems displays communications sometime satellite sometimes vpn or lan wifi or rj45

3673342
post	get
using xmlhttprequests you can send http get or post commands

3673358
typedef	struct
it is interesting to note that the same thing can be used for templates by defining typedef and the like in the struct i usually always use class in my code since there is basically no difference between struct and class in c++ instead of normal members

3673387
identifier	ambiguous
there s no way to resolve to the unnamed namespace otherwise since it has no identifier you can give it to solve the ambiguous resolution problem

3673430
httphandler	httpcontext
in other words you would intercept a request using an httphandler referencing the httpcontext to get information about that request like the query string etc.

3673459
punctuation	words
after reading the text file after the keylogging occurred i noticed it had the words all in upper case and for punctuation such as space or enter the words space and enter was used

3673460
agile	greenhopper
also jira has a nice little agile component to it it s called greenhopper such as burndown charts etc

3673460
mef	prism
there are also frameworks like prism mvvm light and mef to provide architecture level patterns

3673461
versioning	upgrade
also this puts you at risk at forgetting to update the versioning string and the users will be prompted to upgrade from versioning 1.0 to versioning 1.0

3673482
google-chrome	safari
it doesn t work well in google-chrome or safari --

3673500
versioning	upgrade
there are plenty of people out there using versioning of mysql that are many years old who have never bothered to upgrade to the current versioning

3673525
width	height
from the css to make sure that your div is positioned where you want it to not overlapped by another div or not off to the wrong side or perhaps at 0 width or 0 height

3673529
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show
use some css to hide it then use the jquery fadein method to show it when you want it visible and the fadeout method to hide it when you need to

3673616
int	chars
for a i think this is would be correct int chars foo

3673665
width	height
using percentages also helps you somehow to remember that a piece of text can never have an exact width and height and force you to adapt your design

3673665
width	height
if i have a with some text inside and a pretty 200ã 100px background the most obvious thing is to set the width and the height of this to 200 and 100 pixels

3673683
post	get
you need two requestmappings one for get and one for post

3673718
mef	prism
i know that it is possible to load xap modules dynamically using prism or mef framework

3673764
pull	push
you can then just pull their changes when you re ready and push them to tfs when you ve looked at them

3673779
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
rad components code completion code generation code templates etc can be included in almost any smart text editor like vim emacs gedit or scite

3673779
vim	gedit
i use vim and gedit for most of my programming and i find that i don t need ide-ish stuff other than that what is already included in those text editors

3673780
width	height
before you draw it on the canvas determine the sizes of areachart including width percentwidth and same for height and scale your graphics to fit the canvas areachart

3673790
hide	show
optionally your view or view controller can implement -canperformaction action withsender sender to show hide menu items on an individual basis

3673807
swt	swing	awt	swing
1 i was able to add a jtextfield to the jframe and i initialized the class java2sautotextfield as given in auto complete jtextfield swing awt swt jface forum at javaranch

3673811
width	height
if the original width and height of the box are w0 h0 and the expanded ones are w1 h1 animate left to left- w1-w0 2 and top to top- h1-h0 2

3673818
punctuation	words
and similarly the analogy does this sequence of english words with punctuation form complete sentences

3673823
post	get
if any thing wrong please post any link related to how to get image from local folder through xml file

3673911
consistency	acid
see also acid atomicity consistency isolation durability

3673915
post	get
the issue here is that the html helpers assume if you are rendering a view after a post there mustve been an error otherwise you wouldve redirected back to the view with a get method - hence the post redirect get issue

3673932
rdf	owl
perhaps they mean any source of semantic data using open standards like rdf and owl

3673937
postgresql	mysql
for some databases may need to replace with mysql postgresql

3673968
post	get
since any pair of users could possibly be posting at the same moment then every users post must be on the same shard to get the same effect

3673972
superclass	subclassing
if you have a subclassing that needs to call the superclass s constructor you can call it with

3673972
super	implements
an example would be if the super class has some arguments in it s constructor and it s implements classes needs to call that

3673987
gridsplitter	visualstatemanager
i ve found a solution that works for silverlight 4 but i need this to work for standard wpf in .net 3.5 which means that the gridsplitter doesn t implement the visualstatemanager stuff that is used in shemesh s solution

3674002
vim	textmate
vi 1 is the lightest-weight and fastest plain editor around and yet vim 1 can now colorize every language under the sun and textmate is classified as lightweight so all of the categories have really begun to merge a bit

3674069
x86	64bit
keep in mind that you ll be injecting code and making fixups to an in-memory image that may be a different bitness than yours your app is 64bit but it s starting a 32-bit process so you ll have to have both x86 and amd64 versions of your shim code to inject

3674082
boost	allocator
incidentally i recommend you use boost s shared_ptr or scoped_ptr which is also functionally equivalent when allocator on the heap with the additional usefulness of scoped_ptr constraining you from copying non-copyable pointers

3674083
post	get
i will post code with my question but to keep it readable i ll get rid of some of the crap let me know if you want more code posted

3674103
caliburn.micro	mef	mef	caliburn
the viewlocator in caliburn.micro caliburn uses di reflection but can be swoped out for mef

3674103
viewmodel	caliburn
some frameworks work viewmodel first like caliburn and others like mvvmlight is view first.

3674471
post	get
try following scott gu s excellent blog post about model validation and you should get it working

3674488

i would recommend checking on the rights in the installed folder seeing if only the one who installed it has rights and also checking the file list for the directory to make sure vs didn t automatically place some files in the user profile

3674489
put	get
when the call aa.get_dummy is not assigned to a variable its return value is only put on the stack so it would be silly and erroneous to get the address of a stack item

3674530
inherited	properties
properties value inherited by properties value inherited we mean that value of a dependency properties can be overridden in the hierarchy in such a way that the value with highest precedence will be set ultimately

3674530

post	get
it seems i can use the openid+oauth hybrid protocol to both identify the user and get an access token to the data apis as described in this blog post

3674680
put	get
the closeablequeue class differs a bit from glenn s suggestion in that closing the queue will prevent future put s but not prevent future get s until the queue is emptied

3674680
put	get
subsequent calls to put and subsequent calls to get once the queue is emptied as well as outstanding blocked calls matching those descriptions will raise the closed exception

3674681
keydown	keyup
but i want to check that my application actually got my previous keydown and keyup before i do next set of keydown and keyup for synchrnization is there any api that will let me know that the my application has actually recieved processed the event

keydown	keyup
i need to catch keydown especially keyup events for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 keyboard buttons

3674814
getter	setter
one fix would be for the unsafe code to do all reads and writes through getter and setter function pointers avoiding all the pointer arithmetic and ensuring that all access to c_node instances is done through c_node pointers

3674814
getter	setter
even better - the interface becomes a class with getter setter methods etc

3674849
ssl	https
in our java application we need to communicate with a list of servers on ssl using https protocol

3674875
super	self
if self super init

jar	manifest.mf
java 6 also implements a parameter on the jar tool which will create modify the entry point in an existing jar s manifest.mf if you prefer

3675125
hide	show
but looking at your code maybe the opposite approach makes most sense hide the by default and show it in the onload event of the image

3675212

3675444
disk	ram
the tmpfs ram disk

3675444
disk	ram
if that is the case then python allocates its own buffers to hold all the data anyway and the tmpfs filesystem only buys you a performance gain if you reload the data from the ram disk many many times

3675444
disk	ram
reading the data into python unicode objects all at once will require either 2x or 4x as much ram as it occupies on disk assuming the data is utf-8

3676287
children	parent
the parent menuitem normally sets the style on children of type separator but since yours is a menuitem it won t so you will have to do it manually

3676300
curlpp	libcurl
you don t want to link your program against plain-c libcurl -lcurl but against curlpp

3676300
curlpp	libcurl
don t forget libcurl without pp is a c library the c++ library is called curlpp

3676314
post	get
you just need place it before your get post method

3676356
i2c	spi
but if you want to talk to some io i2c spi 1-wire and other peripherals you will have a problem to access them via mono and you will probably have to make some translator probably written in gcc that will be a gateway between real hardware and your mono application

3676395
google-chrome	firefox
i don t think that there is any other error in code as this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

3676418
textview	imageview
i have a custom listview with an imageview and 2 textview above each other next to the imageview

3676525
post	get
this is similar to what other people posted above but not exactly so i figured i may as well post exactly what i did to get it going

3676544
sorting	grouping
if the goal is to simply grouping like sequences together then simply sorting the data will do the trick

3676544
fasta	biopython
here is a solution that uses biopython to parse the input fasta file sorts the collection of sequences uses the standard python itertools.groupby function to merge ids for equal sequences and outputs a new fasta file

3676560
outputstream	inputstream
every process in java has inputstream and outputstream

3676561
post	put
while i click that link to edit a project the form does come through through ajax but the method for the form is now post instead of put

3676563
post	get
it has options for get post and also has https support. you can then group these requests to transactions which represent a series of requests to simulate user interaction

3676567
int	double
i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart

3676567
int	double
this is the x filter code it is valid both for int and double cases

3676567
int	double
my goal is to achieve fast perfomance thanks to int + byte int vs double + double int

3676567
int	double
filter size 9 0.031 double 0.027 int

3676567

int	double
filter size 25 0.078 double 0.070 int

3676568
getter	setter
to my knowledge it s almost common practice aside from the .designer.cs files it seems to place all global variables at the beginning of a class definition followed by the rest of the code in any order i prefer getter and setter then constructors then events then misc functions

3676586
int	double
at least it is not fair to compare int dword 4 bytes and double qword 8 bytes on 32-bit system

3676586
int	double
compare int to float or long to double to get fair results

3676586
int	double
it is not correct to compare long to double but still comparing int and double on 32 cpu is not correct even if they have both intrinsic instructions

3676611
disk	ram
that may be an explanation why with a hot cache data already in memory the reads recorded are very low....and then when the data is no longer in ram the reads would increase as it has to read it off disk again

3676675
int	chars
i would simply do a string.padleft int totalwidth chars paddingchar on the user input to ensure the length of the string is 4 chars minimum

3676676
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so if you have an array of nsstring objects you can change those to nsmutablestring objects

3676734
put	get
i know that if i put the response.redirect before the .end i will get redirected but the file is never generated and if i put the response.redirect after the .end i get the file but no redirection

put	get
if i put the ajax call s url in a normal ie window i get the expected content - well formed html - back

i find that my example works as expected on chromium and opera but i get a very annoying flickering behavior of jquery fadein happening twice on firefox

3676947
postgresql	mysql
though my client s php server will have mysql anyhow as it will be hosting the php based simple machines forum my django server will be using postgresql throughout

3676955
floating-point	integer
on my machine i find that floating-point multiplication is about the same speed as integer multiplication

3676955
multiplying	add
each time you re doing one multiplying one add and 3 array indices

3676955
floating-point	integer	addition	multiplication
as you see integer multiplication floating-point multiplication and floating-point addition all took about the same time

3677071
hash	salt
consider hash ing and salt ing them

3677118
post	get
so that i have to embed the variable inside the http post string to the server backend then get it back from the http response

3677146
multiplying	add
for example if you implement such a multiplying and an add and use it like this

3677156

they can be edited with any text editor padre kokomo vim emacs notepad++ etc.

3677158
gtk	motif
there are look and feels for gtk motif and windows as well as cross platform themes like metal nimbus

3677158
gtk	motif
or it may be that it can t detect gtk correctly in root and is defaulting to motif

3677193
submit	submission
this would imply that two users could write over a given row with different data in any such column and the conflicts would not be detected...meaning the last user to submit the row would overwrite the values of the previous users submission

3677221
range	max
since this max function needs to be able to handle the entire range of integers a sentinel solution is not viable

3677301
hide	show
if they pass then show the main app form and hide the login

3677304
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller
also that modalviewcontroller s sit ontop of the topviewcontroller in the stack on the navigationcontroller and do not require them to have their navbar s redrawn when the modalviewcontroller is dismissed.

3677355

fadein	fadeout
these two lines queue up two functions - fadeout and then fadein

3677433
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3 and google-chrome and the simple way to have a vertical scroll bar always visible is simply

3677494
put	get
there s no way to get these to appear above the #sublist because the #sublist is a child of them you can t put a child of an element behind its parent

3677536
yacc	bison
actually it s like yacc bison

3677566
google-chrome	safari
in webkit based browsers safari and google-chrome there is sometimes problems calculating dimensions if the css is included below the js

3677569
lisp	smalltalk
it borrows all the best features from perl 6 clos lisp smalltalk java beta ocaml ruby and more while still keeping true to its perl 5 roots

3677663
int	double
using int should make this slightly faster because int are 32 bits while double are 64 bits meaning cache will be used slightly more efficiently

3677717
google-chrome	firefox
is all it takes to display my custom font in ie firefox and google-chrome

3677748
google-chrome	firefox
my code works fine in firefox google-chrome everything except ie failed in both 7 8 didn t bother going furthur down

3677748

basically i am adding a element ontop of a pre-placed element and then registering mousedown mousemove events to that div

3677751
post	get
i ve tried adding a .html extension allowing post get in iis manager through adding a managed handler however this doesn t seem to work

3677760
folder	directory
in one of my python projects i assume that all unit tests are run in a special directory that contains the folder data input files and output output files

3677760
folder	directory
i m using a test script that first checks whether those folder exists if the current working directory is correct and then runs the tests

3677777
rdf	owl
since the following rdf is valid a corresponding owl should be achievable

3677793
actionmailer	railtie
for rails 3 railtie takes the place of engines and is officially supported and actually used - actionmailer is a railtie plugin

3677842
folder	directory
note this installs the entire directory structure within your resources folder so you ll need to change your code to load the files from the appropriate subdirectory

3677846
serializable	deserialization
won t you be better off using some kind of serializable deserialization library such as xstream or something

3677855
ubuntu	linux
and in my real-world experience i just checked my code 2 seconds ago that seems to be the case on windows and ubuntu linux

3677859
typemock	nmock	moq	typemock	moq	nmock
you can either hand code the mock or use a mocking framework such as moq rhino typemock or nmock

3677914
base-class	subclassing
what you d end up with is a classmap for your base-class then a subclassmap for each of your subclassing

3677926
textmate	notepad++
as a mac user i ve used such ides as notepad++ coda textmate textedit netbeans and of course dreamweaver

3677953
min	max
it s better to avoid iterating over the annotations list and instead compute the min max boundaries of your placemark using your objects directly

3677982
textmate	notepad++
by the way notepad++ coda textmate and textedit are just editors not ides because they don t integrate build automation or debugging tools out of the box

3677999
pop-up	dialog
in my application i have a component which opens a pop-up window save dialog

3678048
folder	directory
if vanilla html pages are working from the directory but .cfm pages are not then you probably need an cfide mapping i think one quick workaround is simply to copy your cfide folder and drop it into web root

3678068
folder	directory
you can also make the directory structure you want then copy at the file level straight into your fresh folder

3678085
client-side	server-side
additionally i have no access to server-side languages - just client-side javascript

3678100
hide	show
my preference has been to keep toggle methods rather than separate methods for hide show

3678108
apache-poi	jxls
npoi is a .net port of the java apache-poi apache-poi is used by jxls internally

3678114
put	get
appending to gc.garbage is not such a good idea because it s where unfreeable cycles get put and you might want to check for those.

3678115
google-chrome	firefox
if you compare it to firefox or google-chrome or even ie8 it works ok

3678124
hide	show
you would have to work with the cell index though to show hide cells within the column

3678205
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason this very basic page shows up fine in google-chrome but not firefox or ie

3678208
bash	zsh
if you re using bash ksh or zsh you don t need tr and bc

3678221
hide	show
how can i show hide that file browser anyhow

3678235
for-loop	arrays
is the correct way is to go over the entire arrays with a for-loop and write

3678254
thin	unicorn	apache	nginx
a typical small application deployment will have nginx or apache and a handful of thin or mongrel unicorn etc servers running all on one machine

3678254
apache	nginx
the benefit of nginx thin over something like apache mongrel is that nginx thin can communicate directly via a unix socket removing the overhead of communicating via the tcp ip stack

3678259
content-disposition	content-type
set both the content-type header and the content-disposition header

3678288
gmail	hotmail
everything works fine until a user specifies a gmail or hotmail address as their address

3678288
gmail	hotmail
is a gmail or hotmail address the mail never gets delivered

3678299
int	chars
via format file i map output column data types to avoid further conversions from chars to int for example

3678372
post	get
i ve read some post about it but i can t get a clear answer explaining why it seems not possible to accept the prompt using autohotkey

3678378
width	height
i d like to have an image to have either a height of 725 or a width of 500 and maintain it s aspect ratio

3678378
width	height
when i have images with a height of over 725 and thinner than 500 they get stretched out to fit a width of 500

3678378
width	height
if i specify just the height it will maintain the aspect ratio but it exceeds the max width of 500px that i want

3678423
gmail	hotmail
if it doesn t get delivered gmail hotmail spam filters might be filtering out your email

3678427
width	height
if you only specify either the height or the width but not both most browsers will honor the aspect ratio

3678427
width	height
because you are working with an asp.net server control you may consider executing logic on the server side prior to rendering to decide which height or width attribute you want to specify

3678427
width	height
that is if you want a fixed height under one condition or a fixed width under another

3678431
public	protected
basically for each of your classes you need to take out the functions and leave only the data members inside the class struct you will rename class to struct and remove public private protected specifiers

3678437
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
replace constructors and destructors with functions that use malloc calloc and free and return take pointers to your typedef d structures

3678438

3678976
clang	llvm
it does seem only to be a simulator problem with clang llvm

3679074
actualheight	actualwidth
this method only tries to hit test frameworkelements since it needs to know the actualwidth and actualheight to calculate the hit region

3679078
mbunit	nunit
nunit probably also has some better tool support resharper s test runner works with nunit out of the box but requires plugins for mbunit

3679085
getter	setter
this is where you should use getter and setter

3679123
integer	unsigned
a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

3679123
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

x86	64bit
however if the program is compiled for x86 and uses a 64bit integer data type then the operation would not be atomic

3679385
post	get
anyway if i get any answers in my post you might find them useful

3679398
uilabel	uibutton
1 use standard uibutton of custom type add the elements you want to show uilabel and hook up actions for touch down and touch up and react accordingly change the views trigger actions etc.

3679702
getter	setter
i understand that auto-properties get compiled with backing fields but if the property is by definition a vanilla getter setter what advantage is garnered by going to the backing field directly versus using the setter using the fnh defaults

3679726
mef	prism
i have an app based on prism v4 ctp and mef

3679726

someone pointed out on irc that this code would call isspace using a chars - but isspace takes int and requires the value given to be in the range of unsigned chars values or eof

3679916
ubuntu	debian
the debian and ubuntu projects use a script checkbashisms that looks for particular patterns that might indicate that someone is relying on bin sh being bash

3679921
disk	ram
which may not be a problem for disk like media but if you wanted to run execute an embedded processor out of nand flash well you cant you boot and with using minimal loops copy a small program to ram branch to ram have that small program function have a loop that copies the rest of the program to ram and you run out of ram

3680375
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen this problem in firefox and google-chrome

3680381
client-side	server-side
namely you can set the menu s clientidmode property to static to ensure that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the server-side id property and the client-side id attribute but you must be careful using this approach

3680390
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome both are based on webkit that features a 100 acid3 test result

3680390
google-chrome	firefox
it works with ie but not with google-chrome and not with firefox

3680427
post	get
using the technique described in that post if i ctrl+shift+rightclick in the javascript editor i get the following dialog

3680441
int	double
reinterpreting double s as int s is platform dependent think endianness and sizeof issues and will also fall foul of strict aliasing rules

3680446
width	height
the width and the height

3680456
inherited	properties
inherited all page and custom control classes from a common ancestor that processes all properties on a suitable page-life-cycle event evaluate visibility conditions and alter the control s visibility and or other properties

in the meantime i have upgrade my database structure additional fields is best example and my latest versioning of the application makes use of that new fields

3680503
put	get
i get the data from the database put it a table and then select the data from the table for usage in the javascript

3680510
int	double
what you are saying to do is to take the address of p a double treat it as an java int address and then add one to it

3680523
punctuation	words
words that start with a leading hyphen - end up sorted as if the hyphen wasn t there rather than being sorted in front of actual letters which is what happens with other punctuation

3680551
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works for me on safari firefox and google-chrome

3680625
int	chars
otherwise it is of type int â 4.2.1 . section 4.2.2 refers to the numerical operators which result in a value of type int or long . so the result of the addition should in my understanding be an int which cannot be assigned to the chars variable c

3680637
range	max	range	min	min	max
and with a random generator i need to create a double value between the range of min and max

3680639
hide	show
if you don t want to reload the current page you will need a javascript based system to show and hide a logged in state

3680655
jar	war
i was wondering if there was any way to while doing something like mvn clean test in the rest jar to have a local version of the war set up and then run the unit tests

3680655
jar	war
right now we re going to take the tests out into a separate jar but that s still not ideal as if something happens to go wrong during a release that d mean the rest jar and war were already released

3680692
int	chars
in you are adding a chars to an int an int can be much bigger than a chars so it chooses the bigger data type int to be the result a.k.a

3680692
int	chars
so the result of the addition is an int which cannot fit into the chars c

3680710
width	height
i have a control on my form and i want to be able to control the width and have the height of the control change to maintain its original aspect ratio

3680730
centos	linux
the file system could differ nfs local reiser etc however it would always be on a centos linux system

3680731
width	height
aspect ratio is width height

3680731
width	height
on form load you can persist the aspect ratio of your controls by dividing width by height and persisting to a variable and then on form resize reset the height of each control to match what the saved aspect ratio is by doing

3680741
tarfile	zipfile
to solve my problem i have since used tarfile to first tar all of my files and then used zipfile to compress my tarfile

3680784
width	height
the aspect ratio is simply the ratio of one axis to the other width height

3680784
width	height
to retain the aspect ratio given a target newwidth newheight you simply have to make sure that newwidth newheight width height

3680784
width	height
to achieve this you have to decide whether the width or the height is the most important axis

3680784
width	height
if you fix width then you can calculate the height from the width to retain the aspect ratio

3680789
button	checkbox	inherited	properties
first the checkbox already contains a listdata properties inherited from button

3680847
apache	nginx
and that s for good reason you ve got all your plugs running apache config .htaccess config rewrites the kitchen sink - you might be able to switch to a lighter weight http server - nginx lighttp - and realise some serious performance increase strictly speaking it won t help much with bandwidth - but one wonders if that s what the host is really complaining about or that your service consumes serious server resources

if that s too much to ask - you could generate a md5 hash based on the combination and some salt then add that hash to the url

3680960
mouse	keyboard
the caret must move in order for the user to make selections with the mouse or keyboard

3680991

mbunit	nunit
even though nunit now includes the most popular mbunit advanced features mbunit is still more feature-rich for example

3681067
mbunit	nunit
nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers

3681075
fgets	fread
you should be using fread instead of fgets

3681075
fgets	fread
also when calling send you need to specify only the number of bytes that fgets fread actually return do not send the entire buffer unless the entire buffer was actually filled in

3681168
getter	setter
i have to use setter and getter but also instead of using regular fields have to use an enum

3682267
put	get
you can put the same code that you have kept in viewdidload for selecting pickerrow on the event that get fires when button is clicked

3682297
addition	multiplication
this works wonderfully and while i m proud of myself i know that the conversion to bytes is not done correctly it should be a direct conversion without a lot of addition and multiplication

3682312
profiler	callgrind
i ve been searching for a linux sampling profiler and callgrind has come the closest to showing useful results

3682314
post	get
i was doing it this way so back in the controller action that handles the post back i could read over the formcollection by key to get the questionid and the value for each index to get the mcoptionid

3682367
mp3	speex
both nelly and speex can be converted to mp3 or a plethora of other codecs with ffmpeg should you need to

3682369
post	get
this is basically the same idea as post redirect get except that you want to modify the request by unsetting a parameter in between the different stages instead of doing something persistent the images on that wiki-page shows inserting data into a database

3682378
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
maybe the easiest way here is to add uinavigationcontroller to the main window uiwindow

3682415
free	malloc
all it has are two functions for allocating memory new malloc and two functions for freeing memory delete free and a frew related functions

3682428
virtualenv	setuptools
try keeping setuptools in the same folder as virtualenv.py and then create virtualenv

3682456
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout may be of interest

3682493
post	get
whether you use get or post parameters here doesn t matter much in this context - what the script needs first is some sort of authentication

3682493
post	get
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

3682561
int	double
if you want to access an 8-byte quantity int or double the address must be a multiple of 8 bytes

3682604
django	turbogears
i would suggest that you try django and turbogears 2

3682623
opencv	emgucv
i use emgucv library opencv wrapper on c# to implemented face detection and facial recognition using eigenface algorithm

3682675
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox google-chrome ie 7 8 but ie 6 breaks

3682693
google-chrome	firefox
and here s the test to prove it works tested in firefox 3.6.9 ie 6 google-chrome 1.0.154.36

3682693
post	get
if i get time i ll work on it and post the code

3682701
folder	directory
or are they always for the user to do a bundle install --local and they all contain only text files so they will generate the appropriate binary files if any on the gem directory so whether adding this folder to the project is optional although if we run bundle package to generate this folder the intention is probably so that everybody create the gems using this folder instead of pulling it from rubygems.org

3682755
int	double
so i find myself having to cast c to double and then since that makes the expression a double also casting the entire expression to int

3682760
unix	aix
windows server os uses ad as a directory server aix which is a unix version by ibm uses tivoli directory server

3682763
post	get
this is not related to your question and i really don t mind getting downvoted just because i did not post this as a comment since most of the inexperienced people never bother to check the comments - they just scroll to the answers and get it over it

3682763
put	get
i not sure about others get really put off when reading code which is not styled properly forget its correctness

3682765
atomikos	bitronix
atomikos we have tried this but it is a little harder to configure than bitronix and it has some hardcoded dependencies to java.util.logging which we did not want

3682780
hide	show
in this case you could show the loading element immediately when the page is first requested along with the dashboards and hide it later when those dashboards are finished loading

3682811
mp3	wav
i would like to be able to convert the wav file to an mp3 but keep both files

3682828
charindex	substr
they cannot be used as variables in a procedure or a function and they cannot be used inside string functions such as replace charindex or substr

3682850
width	height
you could apply a translatetransform to the ellipse but that requires you to know its width and height

3682875
maven	pom.xml
yesterday though i took it to the next level making a maven lesscss plugin to minimize pom.xml configuration and code duplication

3682983
put	get
if this will create too many threads thousands then put a limit on how far ahead the main thread is allowed to get it might read create 10 objects then join 5 then read create 10 join 10 read create 10 join 10 etc

3683003
post	get
i am trying to use apache bench to load test a create action in my rails application but ab doesn t appear to be sending the post data - though it does correctly submit a post and not a get request

3683003
post	get
if the post file is not there then i get an error message saying it can t find the file so i know at very least it is finding the file.

3683012
min	max
zoom min max

3683027
getter	setter
i think that the accessors getter and setter is far better at least in your example

3683044
int	chars
i need to parse strings of four hex chars to an int

3683056
many-to-many	one-to-many
in case of one-to-many method 1 is better or in case of many-to-many method 2 is better etc

3683082
many-to-many	one-to-many
the difference between one-to-many and many-to-many relationships so i am not sure what you are asking

3683118
stdout	stderr
thankfully this problem does not exist in unix because the catalina.sh script automatically redirects stdout stderr to catalina_out

3683121
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have any problem in google-chrome nor in firefox and ie

3683130
textinput	textfield
expected result is the entered text should go in the flex textinput field but the actual result is it goes into html textfield

3683134
folder	directory
you should be able to create a folder called libs in your main project directory and add any jar that you want to use to this folder

3683154
thin	webrick
neither webrick nor thin support streaming that way

3683172
int	double
but the basic concept is to create a type that can be used for arithmetic expressions internally using a double for every term in the expression only to be evaluated as the desired type in this case int at the end

3683172
int	double
then you d define implicit conversions to from double and the type s you want to support again int

3683185
cout	cin	stdout	stderr
if you redirect stdout stderr and stdin to the console you can then call std ios sync_with_stdio to make sure std cout std cerr and std cin all work

3683194
opera	google-chrome
this is only available on modern browsers ie8 ff3 opera 9 google-chrome

3683233
distance	altitude
so your pitch would be atan hotspot altitude - camera altitude ground distance

3683233
distance	altitude
for example if you had a ground distance of 100m and the hotspot were at 10.75m with the camera still at 2m altitude then you d compute your pitch as

3683239
unsigned	short
also i fixed a stupid oversight and made the accumulator an int instead of unsigned short

3683265
versioning	upgrade
once all dependent applications have been upgrade you can then remove the old versioning

3683310
int	boolean
these classes have various properties on them of differing types strings boolean int etc...

3683339
lxml	beautifulsoup
if you are willing to replace beautifulsoup then lxml has a really powerful xpath implementation

3683339
lxml	beautifulsoup
these days lxml has an html module which the beautifulsoup implementer himself recommends over beautifulsoup

3683349
post	get
what i would like to do with this post is to clarify correct my own understandings and hopefully help other learners get that first step into understanding

3683406
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup cannot be used reliably to get character information

3683453
serializable	deserialization
this is all possible thanks to changes to java 1.5 memory model - the changes of interest allowing final to be not so final where made to enable serializable deserialization

3683471
pop-up	dialog
select properties then a main properties dialog pop-up

3683485
put	get
i will readily admit i have never bothered with manifests except for what you need to know in vs 2005 to get anything running at all and i would recommend to skip the idea of the library subdirectories for implicitly loaded dlls and put them in the app directory and be done with it

3683565
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i have a qgraphicsscene with a huge qpixmap that i added to a much smaller qgraphicsview

3683613
int	chars
in c++ the type of a chars literal is chars but note that in c the type of a chars literal is int that is sizeof a is 4 in an architecture where int are 32bit and char_bit is 8 while sizeof chars is 1 everywhere

3683615
implements	modifiers
for example in c# access modifiers implements information hiding by default by giving classes and fields the most restrictive access possible by default

3683616
int	chars
edit as david stated in another answer the type of a chars literal is int

3683660
hide	show
according to msdn it says roothidden will only hide the root element and expands the child items to show when you hover over it -

3683727
width	height
i also found a bug feature issue which is absolutely new for me when i remove the background in my note root element which is currently transparent the note is only visible within the 200dp width height i have set in the inner linearlayout

3683730
post	get
it is also possible to get the current eventqueue instance a post any event you want

3683750
srp	principles
such as dry don t repeat yourself srp single responsibility principles etc

3683799
postgresql	mysql
keep track in a database that runs on the host machine mysql postgresql sqlite etc

3683822
hash	salt
it sounds like you ve been given advice to salt your password hash i think you re calling the salt a key

3683822
hash	md5
a rainbow table takes a wide range of possible passwords eg a range of passwords like a rainbow has a range of colours and calculates their md5 hash up-front

3683822
hash	salt
hardware is now fast enough that rainbow tables are unnecessary you can compute hash really quickly it s fast enough to just brute force the password from scratch every time especially if you know the salt

3683823
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note that this is only supported by real webbrowsers google-chrome safari firefox etc

3683912
put	get
so you need to get the language settings from windows registry and put them into process environment

3683926
folder	directory
it seems that team build only copies the contents of the binaries folder to the drop directory if the build ends with succeeded

3683962
cout	cin
the trouble is after use cin cout handle is closed or released

3683991
maven	m2e
for example m2e gets the maven dependencies and appends them to your eclipse build path thus making the usage transparent

3683991
maven	pom.xml
dependency resolution - in pom.xml you define multiple tags with name and version and maven fetches all the required jars from the remote repositories

3683996
int	boolean
an int or boolean false on failure

3683997
lxml	elementtree
suppose i have this sort of html from which i need to select text2 using lxml elementtree

i tend to use something like this for working with external xml documents rss feed etc

3684023
apache	nginx
for a small sites the apache nginx and phusion passenger will be very good because it is easy to use

3684035
rss	feed
i want it to get 3 random items from the rss feed it s pulling

3684046
int	chars
6.4.4.4p10 the value of an int chars constant containing more

3684089
filtering	grouping
however i need possibility to filtering and sort query results by product properties - that s where i got problems - always getting errors like column p1_.id must appear in the grouping by clause or be used in an aggregate function

3684120
put	get
but if you want dynamic url you should code init function which will get from flashvars the needed url and put it inside of your videodisplay or flvplayer component and start playback

3684128
folder	directory
i realized the directory weren t being created because the folder var from the js is not getting passed

3684128
post	get
i tried get and post as well

3684150
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in httpd.conf look for â œaccessfilenameâ and change the value to any valid windows filename for windows .htaccess is not a valid filename

3684270
rss	feed
i then have the following code but i get errors trying to load the rss feed whit the warnings

3684393
centos	linux
i am generating x86-64 code at runtime in a c program on a linux system centos 5.4 to be exact

3684424
range	minimum
the criteriarange is simply a 2 row range giving minimum and maximum values for each column

3684439
free	realloc
freebsd and mac os x have the reallocf function that will free the passed pointer when the requested memory cannot be allocated see man realloc

3684482
width	height
the basic idea is to use background image on a fixed sized element in the example it s an a tag with width height 20px

3684490
gdal	ogr
gdal ogr api tutorial is here

3684506
width	height
they are placed as background on block elements which are also sized with css using width and height

3684517
google-chrome	firefox
so far i ve seen that ie9 google-chrome 7 and firefox 4 will all sport some form of hardware acceleration

3684550
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
i m performing an asynchronous nsurlconnection in an nsoperation

3684560
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox safari google-chrome and on the ipad

3684631
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r git gitgroup path to repo.git

3684664
maven	pom.xml
when i try to build then when maven comes to look at the module s pom.xml it will say it cannot find the given parent pom.xml with version 8

3684682
ubuntu	linux
os is linux ubuntu

3684710
client-side	server-side
ria services is a server-side technology that automatically generates client-side silverlight objects that take care of the communication with the server for you and provide client-side validation

3684739
width	height
as others have said here you cannot use php to read the height width of a div already rendered

3684739
width	height
however aside from the javascript options already presented keep in mind that you can use php to set the height width of a div before it is sent to the browser

3684779
post	get
i m using http method post to to get data from my mvc2 project and i saw that you can add a parameter using get doing like this

3684834
implements	extends
to do that you create an interface that extends remoteservice and an implementation on the server that implements that interface and extends remoteserviceservlet

3684858
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you will realize on google-chrome 6 and safari the server never gets contacted while on firefox ie google-chrome 5 the server gets contacted

3684877
post	get
for both get and post you can set postdata

3684880
width	height
keep in mind that if you used the postscript function in r you have to specify the width and height of your picture as well

3684880
width	height
if you saved from the graphics window it normally should take the current width and height of the graphics window

3684880
width	height
check ps.options and see if width and height have value 0

3684880
width	height
it allows you to specify the width and height of the picture and reproduces correctly in latex

3685043
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
so basically i have a navigation-based app that uses navigationcontroller s pushviewcontroller method to show views a and b

3685065
for-loop	loops
declaring a variable within a for-loop might lead to the wrong assumption that this variable can only be accessed within loops body which is totally wrong

3685093
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome works like a charm but internet explorer all versions and opera doesn t want to execute it properly

3685113
maven	pom.xml
update2 set up maven plugin for openjpa in my pom.xml

3685127
onmouseover	onclick
the script i have been working on for a star rating system saves the filled in stars with an onclick event and changes the onmouseover onmouseout values to null so moving the mouse off them afterwards won t mess that up and the form has multiple ratings and a clear button at the bottom which i need to have reset the onmouseover onmouseout events through the function below but within those ratings y and x are taken to be literal rather than what they contain and makes the onmouse events fail because the parameters are incorrect

3685135
rss	feed
just get the rss feed and display them on a page

3685135
rss	feed
some sources don t provide rss feed

3685157
hex	binary
if you re reading binary data i would personally write that out in hex

3685171
mouseover	mouseout
you could even use event bubbling since mouseover and mouseout bubble to hook the events on the overall container rather than each element since you re getting the data from the element

3685200
hash	md5
a simple c-based implementation of md5 on a simple pc mine a 2.4 ghz core2 using a single core can hash 6 millions of small messages per second

3685206
puts	gets
when my application loads it goes to the database and gets several different lookup tables worth of data and creates .net lists for each one and puts them in cache

3685248
children	parent
hard code the version in the project parent version element of children

3685248
maven	pom.xml
you ll find an infinite number of threads on this topic on the maven user list see for example pom.xml parent version properties and i ll just say that any attempt to workaround the above rules is wrong and doesn t work

3685319
rss	feed
see at the right there is an rss feed of this query

3685320
hash	salt
in mysql connector j and jdbc i believe that one of my applications allowed multiple preparedstatement s to be executed while another one is open like i could perform a query that returns a resultset and while that resultset is still open i could open another preparedstatement and get another resultset or i could just execute an update based on the data i got from my first resultset insert a salt value and update the password column with a sha512 hash when i realize that the row has a plaintext password in the password column

3685360
vbscript	vba
you ll need to reference microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5 in your vba project then.

3685426
button	checkbox
there are controls on the view page named searchavm searchbpo searchappraisal checkbox transactionage a set of radio button with integer values and description a text box

3685426
int	boolean
when i break at the entry to create createmodel is there but has all default values null for the strings false for the boolean 0 for the int

3685427
width	height
you do not need to use fixed values for width and height - you should rather specify a minimum width height for your controls using the minwidth and minheight properties

3685462
width	height
width and height canvas attributes always parse to pixels so writing width 100 just means 100 pixels as far as the canvas tag is concerned

3685490
bids	ssis
i know that in order to edit ssis packages you need the same version of bids or visual studio

3685543
min	max
since b is sorted this can be done in o b time start with two pointers one at the max and one at the min

3685578
stdout	stderr
reditect stdout and stderr

3685578
stdout	stderr
windows reditect stdout and stderr

3685578
stdout	stderr
reditect stdout and stderr

3685603
getter	setter
for readability i think there are some advantages to this approach over getter setter

3685614
post	get
when a form gets submitted all of its elements with their names and values become a part of a get post - query

3685632
vsto	add-in
i ve set up my vsto excel add-in to use log4net for logging

3685679
stdout	stderr
in order to catch both stdout and stderr you should use

3685697
submit	submission
i assume that your both forms will submit at the same time. because the whole purpose of captcha is to avoid the automatic form submission

3685699
postgresql	mysql
newer databases are mysql and postgresql

3685716
folder	dir
apt installs libs in their official place usr local usr lib .. but i develop in windows using local libs that are in a folder into my project dir

3685732
serializable	deserialization
type system.collections.generic.dictionary 2 system.uint64 mscorlib version 2.0.0.0 culture neutral publickeytoken b77a5c561934e089 system.nullable 1 system.uint64 mscorlib version 2.0.0.0 culture neutral publickeytoken b77a5c561934e089 mscorlib version 2.0.0.0 culture neutral publickeytoken b77a5c561934e089 is not supported for serializable deserialization of a dictionary keys must be strings or objects

3685797
hex	binary
there seems to be an option show binary contents as hex that s checked by default

3685835
interpolation	splines
have a look at some equations on how to interpolation splines

3685845
quicksort	mergesort
use quicksort or mergesort or the like

3685863
floating-point	fractions
however if you really feel you want to do it all without floating-point operation i would suggest creating some kind of fractions class which is far more complex and less efficient but you can keep track of all dividend and divisor and then calculate it all at once

3685874
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	debian	centos	centos	linux
this can all get complicated because of the large number of linux distros out there but a debian ubuntu compatible .dpkg and a red hat centos fedora-compatible .rpm should cover a good percentage of end users

3685885
instances	transient
instances - save the transient instances

3685900
sorting	filtering
we are developing some new gui screens to display tabular data which require sorting filtering paging

3685900
sorting	filtering
sorting paging filtering can be done entirely by grid add-on

3685900
sorting	filtering
sorting paging filtering functions are super fast as they run on the client

3685900
sorting	filtering
to do sorting paging filtering on the client using the grid you need to download the entire data set to the client

3685952
tapestry	appfuse
we re running appfuse and tapestry

3685953
opera	google-chrome
v8 google-chrome and carakan opera are probably the two fastest production-quality engines

3685953
firefox	safari
tracemonkey firefox and squirrelfish safari are far behind with kjs bringing up the rear

3685956
actualheight	actualwidth
ended up using a converter to bind to the actualwidth actualheight divided by 2

3685979
trie	tree
in a ternary search trie the edges children are stored in a binary tree so the characters are in sorted order and can be searched in log a time

3685995
java.util.date	simpledateformat
use jsp usebean to construct a java.util.date instance and use jstl fmt formatdate to format it into a human readable string using a simpledateformat pattern

3686097
post	get
when submitting post forms and get parameters in the url only the keys and the values should be url encoded

3686156
udp	tcp
try this instead allow every tcp udp traffic to destination port 53

3686172
post	get
you can see that this example is a work in progress and not fully functional post get etc

3686228
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and safari have issues with spacing on the windows platform

3686232
min	max
not pkid but you can use max or min to return that since you ll only have one record per group in the results set.

3686258
button	checkbox
so some button s click event some checkbox s check event everything on a basic control event list

3686277
hash	salt
since it s on the intranet most likely i guess you could get away with using hash of the username + salt as a session identifier

3686301
post	put
another way is to put the area where you want your mouse to be allowed where the slide to remain triggered in a transparent div and call the mouseleave function from the first paragraph of my post in the mouseleave event of this transparent div

3686302
put	get
i ve conceived of this as middleware but i m not sure a where to put it in the middleware stack without interfering with other aspects of the middleware b how to get at various bits of the wsgi environment and so on.

3686306
subtract	add
when a book s category changes which i assume is rare you ll need to subtract book.viewcount from the old category and add it to the new category

3686379
nsmutablestring	nsstring
unfortunately invoking copy on an nsmutablestring does not result in an nsmutablestring it results in an nsstring which cannot be mutated using something like appendstring

3686387
getter	setter
in that case you would want to make the getter setter method synchronized or better yet make the variable volatile which will ensure that the variable s value is the same for every thread

3686399
oncreate	ondestroy
and onaddringtone is used in oncreate and oncancelringtone is used in ondestroy as well as where you can see if in the code above

3686402
implements	extends
it s to extends the standard interface with extra methods that you can implements for that specific implementation so that the compiler knows about them

3686416
pylons	turbogears
google around for some of the other tools you use i don t think there s one for pylons specifically nor turbogears

3686497
sorting	grouping
you can discard your order by from the query because the access report will use whatever settings you give it for sorting and grouping instead

3686497
sorting	grouping
in access 2003 with your report in design view choose view - sorting and grouping from the access main menu

3686498
jobs	cron
cron jobs don t get the same environment settings that you get at a shell prompt - those are generally set up by your shell on login - so you want to use absolute rather than relative paths throughout

3686504
post	get
another idea i thought about would be sort of making the js operate even more in order so i do get the issue and try to optimize my code so even with my additional code it won t post the script notification error

3686529
portrait	landscape
now if you select your portrait-only tab and rotate to landscape the application will stay in portrait

3686559
comm	grep
by using ps -e -o comm you avoid having to do the silly grep -v grep thing because only the actual process name appears in the ps output not the arguments

3686559
jobs	cron
final piece of advice when writing scripts that will execute without user supervision such as cron jobs it s a good idea to put set -e at the beginning

3686630
google-chrome	firefox
it also works perfect on google-chrome 5 6 7 and the canary build and on firefox 3.6

3686663
typedef	struct
your struct s name needs to match the typedef

3686675
typedef	struct
typedef struct handle_t handle

3686686
rss	feed
i made an rss reader that gets a feed from blogspot

3686719
postgresql	mysql
if you have more complex needs you may want to consider an sql database like mysql postgresql oracle sybase or so forth

3686743

hash	salt
here the client nonce acts as a salt for the hash password

3690883
bluetooth	usb
compatibility with a huge collection of usb peripherals including hubs keyboards mice wifi bluetooth web cameras and much more

3690891
hide	show
1 in my plugin i want to show right click context menu item for only links anchor tags and hide the menu item for rest of the page

3690895
int	double
you will need to split each line into its consituent parts you could use the scanner class to do this as it will let you extract the pin account number as strings and the balance as a double int

3690897
width	height
it might just be that your div gets 0px height 0px width and this is why it isn t showing up

3690899
getter	setter
in stendhal we do use getter setter

3690905
width	height
i made a dirty hack wich does not update the params width and height on resize in ckediotr.js but i was wondering if there is maybe a clean solution or if someone had same issues or if there is already a plugin for a flv player

3690937
aptana	radrails
i personally prefer netbeans since i have a feeling that pydev is going to be going downhill since aptana bought them previously they ruined radrails which is the eclipse plugin for ruby on rails development and don t want to get comfortable with a tool that might not be useful long-term

3690945
vim	gedit
i ve been using regular vim and gedit to develop in python and never really missed using ide

3690945
vim	emacs
text editors like vim or emacs itself can be configured quite flexibly to match an ide power though so it doesn t really matter which way you go

3690948
debian	linux	debian-based	linux
i m using crunchbang linux statler a debian-based distro so i ve also tried debian repositories and it actually worked it could connect to internet but the newest version there is 6.0 which is very old at least for me

3690958
vim	textmate
it s horses for courses personally i m much happier with textmate or vim and a nice cup of coffee but it s what feels more comfortable to you

3690970
listview	gridview
in theory sections in a gridview should be no different than sections in a listview

3690992
hide	show	uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
you can just use the addsubview method on your uiwindow or your visible uiviewcontroller s view to show the uiview and you can hide remove it later by calling removefromsuperview on the presented uiview

3691008
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
in c# sorteddictionary is implemented as red-black tree while dictionary uses hashtable and sortedlist is basically list with binary search for keys lookup

3691009
post	get
you have to manually create one httpclient call get post method

3691035
portrait	landscape
but when i do the transition the window to transition to is displayed in portrait and after the transition is finished it goes to landscape

3691114
vim	emacs
when using vim emacs or similar i guess you would have to install lots of plugins or custom scripts to achieve the same

3691201
hide	show
here is my show hide code

3691242
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if your scope is narrow modern desktop web browsers only ie firefox google-chrome opera then just test your site on all of them to make sure it displays and operates properly on them

3691249
hide	show	children	parent
this hide all elements then show if they directly contain the value or are a parent that contains it ...and for those also show all descendant elements showing all children hopefully like you want

3691257
uiview	subviews
i am creating a loading screen uiview which is added to a subviews while some xml is parsed from some url

3691270
move	drag
i want to be able to drag files over folders and then run my server file move script

3691282
hash	salt
therefore i want to salt the hash in a time-sensitive manner limiting a session to 10 minutes

3691325
hash	salt
your salt hash passwords can still leak to the outside world through many other channels

3691371
google-chrome	firefox
when i started to test it it is working properly with firefox and google-chrome but not with ie8

3691381
scikit-learn	libsvm
i believe that the scikit-learn s binding of libsvm should answer your needs

3691392
codeigniter	cakephp
i need to make a http post call to a hudson codeigniter server from cakephp

3691397
vbulletin	ipb
you may want to move to a commercial solution like vbulletin ipb etc

3691405
boost	stl
boost stl

3691439
sse	avx
you should look into avx the new instruction set extension that evolves sse to support wider vector units

3691486
tcpdf	fpdf
generating pdf using tcpdf or fpdf with kohana framework may result error because while generating pdf there are still some html code executed by kohana through template controller

3691509
ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
the client provides a rich interface providing wrappers for .net s generic ilist idictionary and icollection for redis s rich server side data structures

3691515
overwrite	preserve
because with this the variable t is overwrite twice by the two previous settimeout s so only the code for the last settimeout is preserve so when you call cleartimeout you re only clearing the last settimeout

3691534
ilist	icollection
it natively supports persisting poco types and exposes all of redis s advanced server-side data-structures as native .net ilist icollection data structures so they can easily be used in existing c# apis like linq etc

3691536
hash	md5
see generating a md2 md4 md5 sha or sha1 hash by using hashbytes

3691597
des	aes
otherwise take a look at some of the encryption algorithms available pgp gpg des aes etc and their python ports modules but this is hard stuff which you have to get right

3691625
profiling	benchmarking
i revisited this question and decided to run the benchmarking again with xdebug completely disabled not just profiling disabled

3691634
nhibernate	automapper
the ones i mapped a few of them i used automapper and for the peskier ones regular fluent mapping heck i even have nhibernate calls which span across different databases like human resources finances etc.

3691691
width	height
all you need to do is setting the red divs width and or height as percentage and setting your small-black divs float left

3691711
x86	64bit
.net applications which are compiled with the anycpu option can run on both x86 and 64bit systems

3691768
decoder	encoder
i used a utf-8 encoder decoder to encode decoder the chunk

3691777
hash	md5
md5 hash can have collisions but this is pretty effective and very simple

3691810
kde	gnome
you could use the system s key ring gnome key ring or kde wallet

3691822
jgit	egit
basically there appears to be a situation where egit or jgit change the file mode of a file either immediately pre- or post- commit and then the file gets marked as dirty in the project

3691828
integer	unsigned
an integer is a signed 32-bit integer and a cardinal is a unsigned 32-bit integer

3691828
integer	unsigned
smaller integer types are smallint 16-bit signed word 16-bit unsigned and byte 8-bit unsigned

3691828
integer	unsigned
larger integer types are int64 64-bit signed and uint64 64-bit unsigned

3691878
hash	salt
you could always add a salt to the hash like abdpasswordabda where password is the password

3691898
hide	show
so hide all of them then look for matches and then for each matched li show it and all child li

3691907
width	height
image with the given width height and

3691909
int	double
if your image data is stored as an int type you will probably want to convert the image data to double precision floating point first by doing the following

3691965
portrait	landscape
the tricky things is that the iphone app has to be locked to portrait view and the ipad app has to be locked to landscape view

3691990
jtwitter	twitter4j
jtwitter twitter4j and a grails plugin

3692031
post	get
the problem is that the post request gets converted into a get request and post data is lost

3692070
post	get
when assessing this in firebug i see two requests going through first a post request which receives the reply get request. and then a get request which receives the reply get request. as well

3692070
post	get
the post request is met with a 301 response and the get with 200

3692080
bash	zsh
it works for bash ksh pd ksh and zsh with optimized scripts for each one of them

3692085
short	base
the short answer to your question is use a base sdk version of at least 4.0 for your application and a deployment target version of exactly 4.0

3692150
put	get
get the classes of the element process it as a string and put it back

3692155
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
regardless of your math skills doing 3d transforms at such a low level is extremely costly performance wise and highly variable between different browsers google-chrome is the fastest by far firefox will chug along at fairly low framerates and safari is somewhere in the middle

3692168
udp	tcp
udp send buffer size is different from tcp - it just limits the size of the datagram

3692168
udp	tcp
because tcp breaks the application data into mss-sized chunks something that has no counterpart in udp

3692203
nsstring	nsdata
in my project i want to convert nsstring value to nsdata without encoding i.e i am using

3692230
post	get
by default django will redirect that request to xhrtest - with a final slash - and that redirection will be a get not a post

3692240
rss	feed
an example you could be developing an xml rss feed so you would need change the content-type to text xml instead of text html default

3692248
memcached	apc
although using apc memcached or xcache would be a better alternative if you consider performance

3692255
rank	max	min	rank	min	max
it s acceptable if you need data from a copy of the table due to using aggregate functions max min etc though analytic functions row_number rank etc might be more accommodating assuming supported

3692290
content-length	content-type
common headers are content-type date server and content-length

3692294
mouseleave	mouseenter
but maybe you can use mouseenter and mouseleave events on your canvas to enable disable the mouse position capturing

3692300
gif	png
it then has to to â sniffâ the contents of the file to see whether it looks like a jpeg a gif a png or some other kind of image it knows about so it knows how to display it

3692309
filesystems	ntfs
since the definition of true case on ntfs or vfat filesystems is truly bizarre it seems the best way would be to walk the path and match against os.listdir

3692366
onchange	onkeyup
then you can set a handler on your form inputs onchange onkeyup etc. that checks the data in your form and if it checks out then use the method which will enable the button and your user can now upload files

3692387
paramiko	pexpect
i d like to start an interactive ssh terminal from a python script without using modules like pexpect or paramiko - i want to stick with what centos pre-installed python provides me to ease compatibility and deployment issues

3692389
int	chars
converting a string to a big int usually requires the intermediate step of applying a chars encoding to convert the string of chars to a string of bytes

3692413
ssl	https
is there a good reason why a site that has an ssl certificate wouldn t use https for their entire site rather than http

3692420
serializable	deserialization
if all you want to do is write that one and only structure then you should hand-code serializable and deserialization

3692420
int	chars
i d recommend writing a count then the string chars then the dimensions of the array and then all the int

3692420
int	chars
you will have to worry about byte order for yourself taking two bytes for each chars and four for each int

3692488
memcached	apc
i ve seen mention of memcached apc and xcache here cache results of a mysql query manually to a txt file but don t know the pros cons and differences between each

3692489
folder	directory
i am trying to get current directory but its giving me path of debug folder how i can get the path of current directory

3692500
hash	salt
never ever include the password as part of the hash even as the salt

3692500
hash	salt
each site to use this hash should have their own 32 or 64 byte guid to be used as a unique salt

3692516
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both work as i would expect whilst ie is having a problem

3692546
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
of safari google-chrome and opera all do

3692547
post	get
if you get stream_publish extended permissions from the user you might be able to like post on their behalf by doing a post to post_id likes

3692552
for-loop	arrays
then create a for-loop on each case arrays to add up for total

3692555
int	chars
if you think about it kind of makes sense because if you want to cast a long int to a short one or even a chars the starting address remains the same you just look at less bytes

3692580
spaces	delimiter
the second string seems a little more difficult because the spaces between the characters differ but always seem to be delimiter by at minimum a single spaces

3692596
width	margin
i know i can increase the width and add margin to compensate but i need to understand why this happening

3692604
nsstring	nsdata
this works with several foundation classes including nsstring nsdata nsarray and nsdictionary among others

3692606
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven just include the commons-lang dependency in the section of your pom.xml

3692696
width	height
for instance if you had a rectangle class with width and height properties and an area read-only property that returns width height you could put changed width area

3692738
integer	radix
fixed point type stores numbers with 2 words one representing the integer part another representing the part past the radix in negative exponents 2 -1 2 -2 2 -3 etc

3692738
integer	radix
float are better because they have wider range in an exponent sense but not if one wants to store number with more precision for a certain range for example only using integer from -16 to 16 thus using more bits to hold digits past the radix

3692756
google-chrome	firefox
only firefox and google-chrome were showing an empty ajax response so it seemed to be a cross domain problem yet everything was on the same domain

3692756
google-chrome	firefox
i had my test site open at that particular moment as with no www. so firefox and google-chrome treated it as a different domain

3692766
int	double
and what s the typ of int | double | biginteger .+

3692768
firefox	safari
it doesn t matter what browser i use safari firefox ie8 ie6 they all exhibit the same problem so it doesn t seem to be an ie8 issue that i saw on other similar issues

3692781
nunit	mstest
i nead some open source projects written in c# with unit tests nunit or mstest for my experiments

3692789
integer	fractions
64 bit mantissa scaled by 2 -33 now the integer and fractions parts cannot be separated by an octet boundary

3692790
multiplying	add
compilers are also smart to use special adress calculation instructions to optimize add multiplying in a single instruction

3692868
floating-point	fixed-point
when vectorization is used the efficiency of vectorization matters a lot more such that the performance differences between fixed-point and floating-point is moot

3692868
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
some architectures provide hardware implementations for certain math functions such as sin cos atan sqrt for floating-point types only

3692877
jquery	scriptaculous
sure jquery can probably handle this but cannot simple replace magentos use of prototype and scriptaculous with jquery

3692900
ssl	https
i have an ssl certificate set up and when i use the https prefix google chrome puts a skull next to it and crosses out the https

3692902
128bit	64bit
if you are willing to use gcc or clang on 64bit platforms they have a builtin 128bit types that come for free __uint128_t and __int128_t

3692928
matplotlib	scipy
i installed matplotlib by cloning astraw s matplotlib github repository and then loosely following hyperjeff s installation instructions for numpy scipy matplotlib

3692928
powerpc	i386
i installed python 2.7 using python.org s python 2.7 powerpc i386 x86-64 mac os x installer disk image for mac os x 10.5

3692987
width	height
and the buttons height was the only thing adjusted it still retained the default width it was given

3692988
vim	emacs
a friend of mine is using r and emacs ess which seems to work perfect however i d rather like to keep using vim

3692988
vim	emacs
i know that unlike emacs vim is designed to be a simple text editor

3692992
division	multiplication
i understand how they work but i can t think of any scenarios where i might want to use them unless i want to do some really quick multiplication or division

3693004
width	height
width and height should definitely be grouped together.

3693037
public	protected
generally order the members by their nature constants fields constructors methods and then by their visibility private protected public

3693044
division	multiplication
historically multiplication and division were significantly slower as they are more complex operations and some cpus didn t have those at all

3693093
src	attr
additionally attr is used to get and set the src attribute of the images

3693109
firefox	safari
after creating a div and applying the properties everything looks fine in firefox safari and internet explorer 8 compatability mode

3693128
post	get
as was suggested in other similar post though i still get the same output

3693138
int	double
is there a way to put an int and a double in the same array

3693138
int	double
i want to have an array where the first is an int and all the rest of the elements are double

3693144
int	double
you can have an array of object s in which case you can put int and double objects in it

3693171
int	double
you can do this by having an array of objects that are superclasses of int double as pointed out elsewhere

3693171
int	double
however i would perhaps enforce type safety by implementing an object that has an int component plus an array of double s and store an array of these

3693171
int	double
the upside despite the additional complexity is that you ll have type safety and not have to cast the first element to an int whilst casting the remainder to double s

3693187
folder	directory
folder 2770 owner and group have read write list access everyone else has no access setgit bit set to preserve group ownership of files created in directory

3693221
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
hash them with md5 with some random sort of salt

3693246
vp8	ogg
you could also stream in ogg vorbis theora or vp8 to an icecast server see the olpc gstreamer wiki for examples

3693257
lisp	smalltalk
in particular incremental background compilation is a standard feature of all smalltalk ides since at least 1978 or thereabouts and even longer than that in lisp ides

3693257
ecj	jikes
and this compiler called jikes was open-sourced together with eclipse and became the ecj eclipse compiler for java that powers all of the incremental on-the-fly compilation syntax highlighting code completion type inference and refactoring capabilities of eclipse jdt

3693263
min	max
the group by must include all the columns that are not referenced inside of aggregate functions ie max min avg count etc

3693295
ati	nvidia
in the meantime there are still some issues with opengl interop at least with the most important nvidia ati implementations

3693306
ssl	https
this does not apply to https anyway since https uses ssl tls from the beginning of the connection.

3693309
awt	swing
in their media tools examples they offer a simple player example using awt swing

3693314
portrait	landscape
it works perfectly in portrait mode but when i try to have it display in a landscape orientation it still slides in from the bottom

3693319
int	chars
the first is to convert each chars into a small int and then convert the resulting sequence of small int into a large int

3693354
getter	setter
normally accessors have setter and getter

3693354
getter	setter
when you set something using the setter you get the same thing back from the getter

3693367
vim	notepad++
i ditched notepad++ for vim and it s been great

3693384
ftp	telnet
libcurl currently supports the http https ftp gopher telnet dict file and ldap protocols

3693384
post	put
libcurl also supports https certificates http post http put ftp uploading this can also be done with php s ftp extension http form based upload proxies cookies and user+password authentication

3693387
std	ostream
so now you should be able to do anything to iostream_object in the above example that you would normally do with any other std ostream like stdout

3693464
groupbox	panel
i don t know the underlying reason why the groupbox behaves differently from textbox or panel but it might have to do with the fact that groupbox is used as a container control but doesn t actually inherit from any container types

3693539
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview with a bunch of subviews all positioned using layoutsubviews

3693548
folder	directory
put your images in a spearate folder not in your virtual directory for the application

3693595
implements	extends
this will force other developers to implements their own calculatetax method and extends your base class

3693634
width	height
boxlayout s implementation of layoutcomponent involves a call to a method that creates sizerequirements objects for the width and height of each of the components you add to the jpanel based on their getminimum preferred maximumsize methods

3693634
width	height
later it calls sizerequirements.calculatealignedpositions for determining the correct width values for each component because your orientation is boxlayout.y_axis the height are calculated using a different method

3693637
min	max
float min max

3693650
caanimation	calayer
there are more complicated things you can do with calayer caanimation directly but i haven t investigated this much

3693652
subclass	abstract-class
for instance a movegenerator abstract-class had two subclasses suicidemovegenerator and normalmovegenerator and depending on the type of game chosen by user a factory would instantiate the right subclass

3693652
polymorphism	specialization
c++ template specialization provides exactly this - static polymorphism

3693710
slideup	slidedown
android animation slidedown slideup

3693712
client-side	server-side
- server-side javascript choices and as a consequence the possibility of the development or porting -- a framework like dojo could already offer a lot to a js server-side app only parts of it are actually client-side of powerful simple and therefore eventually popular framework

3693742
getter	setter
instead of using setter getter are also queryable

3693749
rvm	bundler
this is closer to freezing gems or using bundler in rails rather than rvm

3693839
superclass	subclassing
you can prevent the subclassing from calling a public method from the superclass

3693853
filtering	grouping
it sounds like you want to do something like this in pseudo-linq data.groupby .select count .where -- you grouping consolidate by some criteria count the number in each grouping and then filtering by the results

3693866
free	malloc
malloc free

3693866
free	calloc
calloc free

3693881
pop-up	dialog
the problem i have is that when the user clicks the button associated with the ibaction it will pop-up the login dialog but then the window disappears without ever pulling up the publish story to wall dialog

3693892
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but i get an error in firefox and google-chrome and safari

3693912
submit	submission
if you use return false inside submit the form will not be submitted through the html and you ll have to handle the submission with jquery javascript ajax

3693921
prepare	execute
prepare and execute a single

3693954
width	height
if that doesn t work then also use self.innerheight and self.innerwidth via javascript for the div height and width

3693991
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome

3694005
jar	war
deploy the webapplication war project and make sure the ejb jar is in libraries which netbeans automatically does and needs no worry

3694007
int	double
be mindful of data types image data loaded into matlab is typically in the form of an unsigned 8-bit int but sometimes it can be an unsigned 16-bit int or a double precision type

3694007
int	double
when dealing with int types conversion to double precision is usually desired before performing certain operations in order to avoid certain aspects of int arithmetic such as round-off and saturation

3694024
width	height
i have concluded that this is because the new google maps api v3 is a bit querky in how it interprets css inheiritence and more or less demands that the map be rendered to a block element with 100 values for both width and height

3694024
width	height
by rendering the iframe window into the div i can control the size i want through the div s css while at the same time giving the google maps api the 100 width and height values through the iframe document

3694024
hide	show
so now i have a workaround where the div is not initially hidden the iframe show the maps builds perfectly and then a settimeout event written into the iframe page then closes the div to hide the map on the parent page

3694026
int	double
you can store the int easily but the double needs more work

3694058
rss	feed
i am trying to parse rss feed from a news website but i am unable to fetch the images from the rss feed

3694058
rss	feed
can someone suggest me some easy implementation for parsing rss feed with images in android

3694060
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works like a charm in google-chrome firefox safari

3694081
implements	modifiers
if you want to use interfaces for constant definitions in order to spare the bunch of modifiers that an interface assumes but you don t want to use the anti-pattern of implements a constants-only interface

3694089
strtol	atoi
if you are planning multi-digit id values you d need to use atoi or strtol et al

3694091
ienumerator	idisposable
note that disposing of the iterator at the end is important - but you can t use a using statement as ienumerator itself doesn t implement idisposable unlike

3694127
children	parent
use a parent container with overflow auto and white-space nowrap and children with display inline or inline-block

3694131
int	chars
naturally using chars would result in more operations than int

3694146
doc	rtf
also as far as i know document.saveas api can convert any document docx doc rtf which it can open in word to html or any other format

3694160
next	except
i think that using performselector withobject afterdelay without a delay would be appropriate for your situation because that does perform the selector on the main thread except that it s performed in the next iteration of the current run loop

3694178
put	get
there are many approaches that can be employed in this case and it depends on the cost you re willing to put in order to get the value

3694186
integer	unsigned
i would guess that the types size_t for an unsigned type and ptrdiff_t for a signed type will usually correspond to quite efficient integer types on any given platform

3694186
int	chars
there are 5 different possible ranks for standard int types chars short int long long long

3694242
google-chrome	safari
it does not work in safari and google-chrome

3694242
google-chrome	safari
also on you can see youtube videos inside the info window working in google-chrome and safari by clicking more... on the top right of the map and then checking videos

3694243
serializable	deserialization
right now i m just trying to set up the deserialization and i was going to add in serializable after

3694246
google-chrome	firefox
i want to check which web sites is open in browsers ie firefox google-chrome to write a program in c# which can block web site which is in list of forbidden web site

3694265
flask	web.py
web.py flask celery twisted etc look interesting - so far only the latter seems like a candidate for something i could properly contribute to but even though im a decent ish python programmer i think the whole event driven thing is probably too steep a learning curve for me to be able to contribute meaningfully for a while.

3694283
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the format used by objectinputstream objectoutputstream is not something you can type out

3694304
setlocale	strftime
this may be by design setlocale does not automatically change the output of the format of dates output using date and strftime

3694338
stdout	stderr
but all the stderr and stdout output of ghostscript s processing the input.pdf will still appear in your console

3694367
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0.6

3694388
width	height
since your current callbacks look very similar you can make them generic and run them through a delay function it needs to be per type though since they affect different things height width depth

3694400
int	chars
represent your wide chars strings in tpl as arrays of 16-bit int

3694418
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
alternatively implementing an nsurlprotocol subclass isn t very hard for this because your protocol can internally fire up another nsurlconnection using the correct http url and map its delegate methods to the protocol client s

3694462
hide	show
in this if we select others then the text box will show otherwise text box will hide

3694482
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
a few things i d use mouseenter instead of mouseover since mouseout will fire when entering a child and also make sure it s running inside a document.ready handler like this

3694495
hide	show
the purpose of the dropdownpanel is to be able to hide and show another component on it

3694495
hide	show
the only thing that forces the proper behaviour is to hide and show the jtable via the dropdownpanel

3694535
free	malloc
about once every three times i run my program malloc reports a double free error

3694602
width	height
the jtextarea has a previously set width and a height

3694698
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
on google-chrome firefox opera and ie8 i think it looks fine so lets me add only one hyperlink so i ve linked you to the broken image

3694746
versioning	upgrade
i wish to use the foreign keys facility and thus upgrade my versioning of sqlite to the latest stable versioning 3.7.2

3694746
versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade the sqlite3 versioning used by both firefox and xcode also

3694775
post	get
please post some alternatives and help me to get out of this juncture

3694778
inherited	properties
in prototype-based languages the prototype of an object is a set of properties which is inherited by all objects which are based on this object

3694810
getter	setter
make a private collection anothercollection with setter and getter in your class

3694814
int	double	ostringstream	std
additionally there were some runtime c++ changes in gcc 4.2 which meant a gcc 4.2 app running on os 2.2.1 crashed when casting unsigned int long to float double or using std ostringstream

3694847
setinterval	settimeout
the two fundamental ways to do ui loops in javascript on browsers are settimeout and setinterval

3694847
setinterval	settimeout
note that the intervals in setinterval are counted from when the callback was called whereas if you schedule a new settimeout at the end of your callback processing it ll obviously be scheduled from that point instead

3694874
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that it works fine in the debugger but when i publish it to the market and upgrade my app i ve purchased a versioning of my app with my personal gmail-accout so i am a legitimate user i get the error that the my app is not licensed

3694877
folder	directory
if you want to ignore all folder files in the current directory use a leading slash for directory or for files

3694935
backgrounding	multitasking
i know with multitasking on the iphone 4 a user could open the app and run it in the backgrounding

3694943
keydown	keyup
you can call it on keydown keyup check the state of the keyboard and act appropriately

3695038
hide	show
when you click on a link some jquery code hide the div container and show another div

3695047
content-length	content-type
specifically the content-length and content-type headers will be of interest

3695079
inherited	properties
now the problem here is redunduncy because there s already a properties companycode to the company class is there any way that user will be able to just use company s companycode properties without inheriting the company class problem here is c# doesnt allow multiple inherited of classes or using an icompany interface but interface is a pain in value objects

3695082
google-chrome	firefox
however when i opened up ie firefox and google-chrome and i asked for index.html at different times about 2 seconds apart it looked like each browser was receiving the page simultaneously in other words at one point there were 12 different images being served 4 to each browser

3695093
width	height
the bad thing is when an app is maximized this code stores the width height left and top of maximized window not the normal size position before maximization

3695124
subtraction	addition
the assignment is the classic addition and subtraction of big integers using linked lists

3695160
getter	setter
getter and setter would be the easy way to go

3695194
opera	firefox
file upload fine in ie and not work on firefox opera

3695213
hide	show
to not clutter the menubar unnecessarily i want to hide and show the menubar icon depending on whether safari is open or not

3695214
awt	swing
when you use awt or swing there is a special thread running in the background called the eventqueue

3695218
super	self
i can fix this by calling super b self .__init__ a

3695218
superclass	subclassing
if yes how can i check b is an attribute of which class - the subclassing or the superclass

3695221
public	protected
the difference is that on objects properties allow controlled access to private and protected members whereas on interfaces all members are public so there s no need for the properties

3695224
put	get
i have data with latitude and longitude stored in my sqlite database and i want to get the nearest locations to the parameters i put in ex

3695261
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there s firebug a firefox add-in google-chrome s and safari s development tools built into the browsers microsoft visual studio or script debugger for debugging with ie etc

3695275
int	double
it is not so bad when primitive types int double etc. are passed by value but when a class instance is passed by value temporary objects are created which requires constructors and later on destructor s to be called on the class and on all of the member variable in the class

3695283
fancybox	jcarousel
on one of my content pages i m using the jcarousel and fancybox jquery plugins

3695295
int	boolean
the fact that string 0 int 0 boolean false is one example

3695307
strcpy	malloc	strlen	strcpy
and if you are using strcpy it actually copy the whole string including the terminating null so you will allocate one byte less if you use strlen in malloc

3695324
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp _www library webserver documents db

3695374
calloc	malloc
the return value of calls to malloc and calloc and friends should always be tested to ensure the operation worked as expected

3695402
width	height
basically i have a 8x8 grid in which each cell should have the same width and height

3695402
width	height
the colored cells are the ones i added to the actual grid gray which has cells with the same height and width x

3695402
width	height
so the grid s height and width is

3695402
width	height
i now want the additional cells to have the necessary width height minimumsize plus the rest of the available width height from the full size

3695408
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
you just have to be mindful nsdatecomponents won t contain valid information for any fields you ask for unless you generated them with that valid information request nscalendar to provide that information with nscalendarunit s

3695408
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you want to also get an era for instance out of nsdatecomponents you ll have to feed the generator method from nscalendar with the nscalendarunitera flag

3695440
versioning	upgrade
you should also consider persuading your company to upgrade to a versioning of linux where the inotify mechanism is available

3695502
sorting	grouping
the grouping by is performed before the sorting so the order by useremail.emailid has nothing to do

3695527
subclass	abstract-class
let s say scala had finally unified parameter list and tuples and that all tuples were subclass to an abstract-class tuple

3695599
folder	directory
it has a dependency on vspmsg.dll from that same directory you ll have to copy it by hand into your bin debug folder

3695602
rss	feed
there is a problem when trying to read some rss feed that express their date differently

3695614
apache	nginx
nginx + apache wsgi + django 1.1.2

3695638
multiplying	multiplication
so you re calling the function and multiplying the result by cd_dir_entry and promptly ignoring the result of the multiplication

3695644
x86	64bit
on register-rich cpu architecures like arm powerpc 64bit x86 680x0 - but not 32-bit x86 - pointers and references which are secretly pointers wearing fancy syntatical clothing are commonly be passed or returned in a register which is really freaking fast compared to the memory access involved in a stack operation

3695644
webkit	gecko
and he should look at the internals of large c c++ systems like the webkit or gecko html rendering engines or any of the mozilla browsers or the gtk+ or qt gui toolkits

3695686
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit firefox 4 already implement this very useful property but it is not available in ie11 last i checked and only available in google-chrome 29 and safari 8

3695732
int	double
im sure you know your data-types such as booleons strings int double floats but im not sure you understand how logical operators work within php ill give you shour example

3695736
hash	salt
store the user s login the salt hash of their password and the salt in a database

3695739
ncover	testdriven.net	ncover	ndepend	testdriven.net	ndepend
it is worth mentionning that best alternative to a wide range of tfs features are not necessarily oss but low-budget commercial like ndepend for code quality and architecture exploration ncover for code coverage testdriven.net for testing nested in ide .

3695781
super	self
super scrape self .__init__ none

3695787
maya	blender
the easiest is probably to draw a model of a rounded cube in one of the many 3d modeling programs around maya blender and load 27 instances of the model in your code

3695833
cvs	svn
cvs vss svn

3695862
range	max	range	min	min	max
on the other hand balanced binary search trees red-black and avl support o log n operations which is indeed slower but have the added advantage of keeping the elements sorted - thus enabling a lot more operations min max k-th element upper-bound lower-bound range queries etc. that are simply not possible in an unordered structure such as a hash table

3695876
multiplying	add	int	chars	int	double
with c you can add chars to double you can multiplying chars and int .

3695896
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but it stopped working today in firefox safari google-chrome and opera - although it still works correctly in internet explorer

3695896
opera	firefox
opera and firefox show no error at all

3695964
post	get
this blog post shows you how to get started with a nibless iphone project

3695974
aggregate-functions	sum
it is easy to get the sum or max of all the descendants but the way the aggregate-functions are combined complicates the matter greatly

3695986
post	put
i put post id into url and it solves problem

3695992
subtraction	addition
the assignment itself is to make a program that performs addition and subtraction of big integers using linked lists and i m slowly starting to hate linked lists outside of lisp

3695992
subtraction	addition
everything seems to be working now save for the actual addition and subtraction

3696061
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.date and java.util.calendar

3696143
boost	allocator
personally i would go for the one parse scheme trying to keep the allocator down using boost variant and the strategy pattern as much i could

3696152
xul	xbl
in this case the main namespace xbl and xul

3696164
elf	coff
gcc on the other hand works with elf linux most unixes coff on windows or mach-o mac

3696180
subtract	add
it is not easy to add to a structure like this because a naive approach of adding something to the end would not work when subtract when q is negative you will go to all the trouble of subtract q from p and then discover that you should have added instead

3696196
button	checkbox
mind the radio button and checkbox with their white appearance

3696228
vaadin	smartgwt
flex looks very oriented to content display while gwt and its heirs smartgwt vaadin .. seems to preval for business-like applications

3696265
lxml	html5lib
i m trying to work with html5lib and lxml but i can t seem to figure out how to use the find and findall operators

3696280
getter	setter
for example setter and getter are seldom needed

3696282
qlineedit	qlabel
is it multiple qlabel s and qlineedit s

3696359
qlineedit	qlabel
i have done something similar with several qqueue containers full of qlabel and qlineedit items

3696376
struts	wicket
i d recommend spring mvc or wicket over struts

3696403
x86	mips
architectures x86 arm mips

3696414
lxml	html5lib
it appears that using the lxml html5lib treebuilder causes html5lib to build the tree in the xhtml namespace -- which makes sense as lxml is an xml library and xhtml is how one represents html as xml

3696422
google-chrome	safari
anyway the error message on safari google-chrome are cryptic

3696458
int	chars
to support all unicode chars including supplementary chars use the touppercase int method

3696475
qtableview	qtablewidget
if the ui contains a lots of these items you could consider using qtableview or qtablewidget

3696565
mouseover	mouseout
the only standard events it applies to are mouseout and mouseover

3696573
postgresql	mysql
stores it s content in a database mysql sqlite postgresql - your choice

3696607
fancybox	jcarousel
it appears your problem is in the fact that jcarousel moves images in and out of view - causing a problem with fancybox

3696616
width	height
you may be wondering why there is a width and height argument for the processing function but if the image is not exactly divisible by 64 then there will be smaller chunks at the edge of the image right-hand side and the bottom

3696616
width	height
see this image for a better understanding what i mean red chunks are the chunks that will have 64 width or height arguments

3696670
width	height
i would also check width height for accuracy and basically you don t really need them you can easily calculate them inside the function

3696747
range	infinity
generate these interpolated points summing them together while halving the amplitudes see perling noise as the number of sums approaches infinity the limit of the range now approaches twice the previous values or -4.5 4.5 and is now even less uniform

3696766
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome safari and opera but in internet explorer 8 it returns the error object required for this line

3696817
children	parent
the recursive option is simple if you don t have to track the previous enabled state of all the children and restore them when you want to re-enable the parent container

3696858
fgets	strstr	fgets	strcmp	strstr	strcmp
depending on how much complexity you actually need you might get away with just using fgets in a loop and parsing each line manually with strstr strchr strcmp etc

3696913
multiplying	subtract
once you ve divided by 100 000 000 and taken the integer value you can then multiplying this integer value back by 100 000 000 and subtract it from the isbn

3696914
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you want relations between instances works in many-to-many or one-to-many manner maybe you could study nsnotification class reference or notification programming guide

3696919
stdout	stderr
child s stdout and stderr which

3696919
stdout	stderr
i had a similar problem with my program not disappearing from task mgr when i was consuming the stdout stderr

3696919
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
of course you could always fflush and then redirect back to stdout and stderr before exit

3696924
int	double
in php a whole number that is too large or too small to represent as an int type will automatically be represented as a float or a double if necessary

3696929
disk	ram
floats may gain importance when you have large arrays of floating-point numbers to manage scientific calculations or stuff like that so having a smaller data type may be convenient both to use less memory and to be faster to read them from ram disk

3696929
int	double
on pcs imo you can just use double in normal contexts just try to avoid mixing datatypes double floats int ... in the same expression to avoid unnecessary costly conversions

3696931
width	height
if you can figure out width height stride and color depth it should be doable to skip to the 7fe0 0010 data element value and just grab the succeeding bytes

3696947
hash	hmac
a hmac algorithm is simply a specific type of mac algorithm that uses a hash algorithm internally rather than for example an encryption algorithm to generate the mac

3697004
folder	directory
i used environment.currentdirectory to get the applicationfolder at the start of my prog though when i passed commandlinearguments from an other folder to my app the current directory changed so my app chrashed due to the lack of correct errorhandling i didnt passed the exception anywhere i didn t notice that this was the problem

3697063
swt	swing	awt	swing
in java awt swing swt you name it... but android is a really tough beast

3697066
put	get
please put in mind that the eventclass will be implemented so many times sometimes to get data from an oracle databases and sometimes mysql databases

3697072
put	get
i use an nsxmlparser to parse youtube s api and i get all the content i want and put it into a class called video

3697072
for-loop	arrays
however when i use parserdidenddocument i use a for-loop to read through the arrays and all of the entries have the same title value of the last object added

3697084
content-length	content-type
this would explain why content-length and content-type are missing in the output

3697105
put	get
of course you can t redefine your addressid in order to put your custom logic in its setter as you ll get compiler error

3697145
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i have a qgraphicsview with a qgraphicsscene

3697172
google-chrome	firefox
this is doing nothing in ie but works fine in firefox and google-chrome

3697191
accessor	properties
another reason is that debuggers commonly provide watches or other user interfaces that cause additional code such as properties accessor to be executed which can in turn change the state of the program

3697194
awt	swing
- replace remove all dependencies on java awt swing

3697215
fast-forward	merge
after the rebase you can merge your branch to main which should result in a fast-forward merge

3697266
bash	zsh
bin xxxxx where xxxxx could be bash csh korn zsh ash..

3697292
folder	directory
but as i said the .dll is copied to the bin folder sub20dnc.dll is in the same directory as the executable

3697309
width	height
i would expect that would cause the width to be calculated if i only specify a height

3697316
config	ini
to your config ini

3697336
codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
+1 for symfony and another i d like to recommend is kohana built on codeigniter

3697358
width	height
with liquid layouts like this i tend to set up a really basic table not as evil as some would say because they do these kind of auto calculations where you need to figure the browser height width and minus a certain value for you

3697383
mouseover	mouseout
i have dynamically created divs with mouseover and mouseout live events where i simply change the div s opacity using the animate method with a stop to prevent the queue to build up

3697384
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
if you want to use a byte array you re going to have to malloc memcpy and free the memory appropriately every time you want to reassign it

3697387
portrait	landscape
i am trying to rotate my mpmovieplayercontroller to landscape view but it always stays in portrait mode

3697392
rss	feed
i m fetching data from different rss atom feed and sometimes the html data i receive contains html tags but they dont have close tags or some other issues and it screws up the page layout styling

3697394
filtering	grouping
even then its only worth it if you expect a lot of filtering based on these values as the cost of building these tables is high and for most queries the standard sql grouping by .

3697406
mouseleave	mouseenter
what this does is first uses the mouseenter and mouseleave events like .hover maps to which don t fire when entering leaving children

3697445
hash	md5
i want to implement a caching system whereby i generate an md5 hash of the sql query and then return a cached dataset for the query if it exists in the collection

3697461
jquery	jqmodal
you can use jqmodal or jquery ui dialog

3697482
put	get
you can also get to other standard properties like project.name project.description or even arbitrary properties you put in your pom etc

3697497
versioning	upgrade
the cocoa world changes quite quickly and the documentation tends to describe only the latest versioning so i would recommend you to upgrade to 10.6 if it s possible

3697510
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade from crystal report 2008 basic to crystal reports 2008 dev versioning 12.3.1.164 and used embebed reports in my application since that the dll size grew may be ten times

3697543
width	height
you donâ t know the page width and height could a5

3697552
hash	md5
hash all that with md5

3697552
rss	feed
additionally you will find that html tag escaping is weird with rss feed

3697552
rss	feed
creating an rss feed from html is quite nasty and i can only point you to services such as spinn3r which are fantastic at de-duplication and content extraction

3697555
google-chrome	firefox
this function executes during the forms onsubmit and works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

3697560
vim	emacs
it s an emacs mode that makes emacs feel more like vim while giving you full access to the wonderful mind-boggling complexity of emacs if you ever want it

3697593
post	get
i have the basics working but have spent the weekend trying to get maruku to work eg a post body saved from a text area with markdown extra markup to the db and then back again to the browser

3697593
post	get
i used the following code in my post model but i get an error when i try to load post - undefined local variable or method maruku for #

3697600
width	height
correct you must specify both height and width

3697600
width	height
however if you want to make sure it s always a certain height set the master_dim config option to height then you can set width to anything and it will always make the resize image that height while maintaining aspect ratio with the width

3697607
skip-lists	tree
since it s extremely unlikely that you will want to enumerate your cache in order or at all a skip-lists and likewise a binary tree is unnecessary

3697619
speex	ogg	mp3	speex	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	speex	wav	ogg
anyways as far as encoding on the server side i rolled my own python cgi script that converts in my case speex to wav using speexdec and then wav to mp3 using lame and wav to ogg using oggenc

3697649
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to using versioning 4.1 of the flex sdk and flashbuilder

3697704
folder	directory
my templates directory is within my project folder

3697715
altera	xilinx
xilinx tools suck but their raw silicon is better than altera

3697748
apache	nginx
must work in a shared hosting environment where the user has no control of the web server apache nginx etc

3697764
width	height
would you have 3 separate images each saved with a different width height

3697764
width	height
smiley.png that is saved in high resolution large width height and then scaled with interface builder

3697832
integer	unsigned
but there are simple tests for overflow that do not involve invoking overflow or unsigned integer wrapping and they re even simpler than doing the addition then checking for overflow which is of course undefined behavior for signed integers

3697847
width	height
the use your columns and rows attributes to define the width and height

3697850
hide	show
here is a basic tutorial for using show hide on events with jquery

3697873
google-chrome	firefox
it works great on firefox google-chrome but the behavior is messed up on ie see screenshots below

3697914
punctuation	words
use words boundaries instead of splitting on or using just indexof the spaces on either side which would not find the. and other instances next to punctuation

3697918
awt	swing
you would also have to be familiar with either awt or swing development to build the gui in jython

3697930
int	boolean
1 boolean boolean boolean boolean boolean boolean boolean int int

3697994
rtp	rtcp
... a participant must not assume that the source port of the incoming rtp or rtcp packet can be used as the destination port for outgoing rtp or rtcp packets

3697994
rtp	rtcp
when rtp data packets are being sent in both directions each participant s rtcp sr packets must be sent to the port that the other participant has specified for reception of rtcp

3697994
rtp	sdp
rtp does not have any mechanism to inform of these addresses and ports that s up to sdp or some other setup protocol which would lead me to understand this paragraph as if you re receiving data from an unknown source just discard it

3697994
rtp	rtcp
but in section 6.3.3 it basically says that when an rtp or non-bye rtcp packet is received with an unknown ssrc a new participant should be added to the table

3697994
rtp	sdp
sdp doesn t define the ssrc that will be used by each of the rtp participants

3698009
codeigniter	pyrocms
i recommend you codeigniter mvc framework and for cms pyrocms which is built upon codeigniter is cool

3698028
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in touchesbegan and touchesmoved

3698050
content-length	content-type
do remember that unlike a submit action which internally creates a request you re trying to create the request yourself so you might need to deal with stuff like request headers content-type content-length etc. content etc

3698053
boost	stl
their biggest usage is in stl and boost libraries

3698062
getter	setter
you can also interface the getter and setter if you want separation of layers wrt your data objects but that might make gxt type binding harder

3698073
post	get
you first need to add a control that get the data from javascript and post them back

3698073
post	get
and then on post back you get them

3698134
post	get
if you could post the logic of page_load it might get clarified

3698160

invokerequired	begininvoke
as its name suggests invokerequired means you need to call invoke or begininvoke when accessing the control

3698175
post	get
then you could call it like dictone.transpose enumerable.first to get the above behavior dictone.transpose enumerable.single to get an exception when there s a duplicate key the behavior of other post dictone.transpose enumerable.min to pick the first one lexicographically or pass in your own function do whatever you need

move	drag
one of the things i ll need to do is have a drawing layer where i can have a circle in the middle and be able to drag other circles near it to attach them and then be able to move them around changing their position around the initial circle

getter	setter
it s usually a bad idea to not use the javabeans convention getter and setter

3698215
google-chrome	firefox
the message however doesn t show up in google-chrome or firefox

3698218
fast-forward	merge
if z is the last commit on master a simple git merge sha1 a will fast-forward master head to a

3698223
opera	firefox
window.onload is the built-in javascript event but as its implementation had subtle quirks across browsers firefox internet explorer 6 internet explorer 8 and opera jquery provides document.ready which abstracts those away and fires as soon as the page s dom is ready doesn t wait for images etc.

3698248
folder	directory
be aware that if you put it in a separate module this module needs to be in the same folder as the templates directory or you ll end up with the wrong directory again

3698250
hide	show
you ll also want to define some methods things like -show and -hide to show the view and hide it

3698305
cout	cin
there are some minor differences between the two with the biggest difference being that iostream puts the included contents in namespace std so you have to qualify cin cout endl istream etc

3698317
versioning	upgrade
but after upgrade to mysql 5.x versioning this php source can t send form data info to other page

google-chrome	firefox
now i m quite sure that the requests are correctly formed since they are sent by major web browsers like firefox google-chrome or perl c# which have http modules dll s

3698408
accessor	properties
additionally accessor should always return a copy of the properties s value not the value itself

3698408
accessor	properties
combining an accessor and a mutator gives you a javabean properties

3698464
free	strdup
if you can find where the writeable strings are actually being used another possibility would be to use strdup and free on the subset of literal strings that the code is actually editing

3698488
versioning	upgrade
every time i increase my database versioning and push the upgrade app to

3698709
mouse	keyboard
i want to do it with the mouse as well but i imagine it will be a very similar process and i think but i might be wildly mistaken that starting with the keyboard will be easier

3698711
rvm	bundler
in short if you run bundle install before you have the bundler gem getting the standard gem not found error then do gem install bundler followed by another bundle install the bundler gem has been install to your system not rvm

3698711
rvm	bundler
then i would open a new term do rvm ree proj and gem install bundler prior to bundle install

3698777
range	max
however this form can t handle empty tables correctly since max id is null and neither can you setval 0 because it would be out of range of the sequence

3698787
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome 6.0.472 as well as firefox 3.6.8

3698788
mouse	keyboard
if it wasn t for the usb i d connect the two via lan and have a client server c# program that emulates a keyboard mouse via directinput

i m a bit of a linux noob trying to get ruby rails mysql and sqlite all playing nicely on ubuntu 10

3698855
sorting	grouping
in order to fully construct a sorting of a list of things which this problem equates to as the list is completely reordered by the grouping you always have to know the entire set

3698886
google-chrome	firefox
however everything seems to work perfect in firefox and google-chrome but ie throws an error

3698904
post	get
that target page takes in the parameters passed via post or get and performs actions with them eg add database record and prints out any response required

3698945
disk	ram
all resources that may need serialization ram disk etc. are a possible bottleneck

3698991
getter	setter
it s best to just use the x.classname getter setter property which avoids needing to call attribute functions and works on all browsers just the same

3698996
singleton	facade
in my industry banking i see a lot of the following gof patterns factory method singleton adapter and facade

3699004
versioning	upgrade
our product is installed in windows machines all over the world with our latest versioning we need to ensure that internet explorer is upgrade to versioning 8

3699012
getter	setter
yes accessor methods are an overhead although the syntax for using setter getter is just as clean as direct access of public properties.

3699012
accessor	properties
biggest benefit of accessor methods is that you can use your set method to validate values and reject inappropriate values trying to set a properties that should always be an integer to a string or an array .

3699019
apache	nginx
i would advise setting up a development preview on shared hosting or something or even locally with a proper web server such as apache or nginx

3699032
uilabel	uibutton
all the uilabel and uibutton are required as mentioned above as they re showing data coming from a web service request so they re all required if we re using interface builder to design our gui s

3699033
getter	setter
getter setter arose in java

3699033
getter	setter
it allows you to validate types in a central location you don t have duplicated code in multiple setter getter

3699033
getter	setter
it s a code smell to implement hollow getter setter to have enterprisey-looking code

3699033
getter	setter
and it s also inadvisable to have getter setter with side-effects

3699035
uploadify	swfupload
the other alternative is using a flash-based uploader like swfupload or uploadify

3699046
getter	setter
setter and getter are always the best option because they provide more stability for validation sanitization

3699048
uilabel	uibutton
the uilabel s and uibutton s in particular seem like strange things to have outlets for.

3699072
post	get
i wish to execute an exe as a part of my post msbuild tasks once all the projects in my solution are build the exe should get executed only after the complete build of my solution and not the individual projects

3699171
versioning	upgrade
while they may be required by your deployment scenario eg for customers who want to upgrade in-place they duplicate information from the versioning history of the database and per murphy s law duplication means desynchronization sooner or later

3699256
subtraction	addition
this allows easy addition subtraction

3699290
int	chars
constants in c you asked about that are numerical constants 0 1 0x0 0.1 1.e-10 ... integral chars constants a n l a ... and enumeration constants that are of type int

3699352
backtracking	greedy
it looks like the problem is triggered by the attempt to backtracking a greedy repetition when there s a reference to a capturing group inside a lookahead the out of bounds index is the difference in length between the first and the second a+ aabaaaaab gets -3

ienumerable	iqueryable
there are many framework interfaces like idisposable iqueryable ienumerable available which have different uses

3699723
versioning	upgrade
i had similar issued with this on versioning upgrade but by also executing a db.exec update.

3699777
versioning	upgrade
if so how are you going to deal with versioning and upgrade

3699795
ilist	ienumerator	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	ienumerator
the main ones i d add to the above are ilist sets collections lists generic version of ienumerable and ienumerator plus generic twin although in truth few people need to code against ienumerator

3699818
onclick	onchange
for this i have used the javascript on onclick of checkbox and onchange of file upload

3699826
pdcurses	ncurses
the neat beauty is pdcurses is compatible with the unix equivalent of ncurses

3699940
qgraphicsview	qpainter
how is it possible to add an qpainter arc to the qgraphicsview foreground

- an aes key encrypted with my rsa public key

3700046
width	height
i suggest you to set height and width of selected cells s row minus your border width

3700119
versioning	upgrade
but after upgrade to mysql 5.x versioning this php source can t send form data info to other page

3700137
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
you reset the fx.morph options every mouseover event where there are no changes although you seem to have a different duration for mouseenter and mouseleave - this is expensive

3700137
children	parent
another possible improvement here would be the use of event delegation event bubbling will cause events to fire up the dom tree to the parent mootools has an api to deal with it so you can add singular events to parent elements and not have to attach nnn events to all children - look it up

3700187
ienumerable	ilist
edit the other method with the predicate which i now see you are talking about is not as optimised and relies on the ienumerable interface to perform a foreach rather than ilist

3700233
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome iceaweasl it s working perfectly

3700247
swt	swing	awt	swing
and this is bad practice to mix awt or swt and swing controls

3700265
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
eclipse is used for development but i use the m2e plugin and a maven pom.xml with the gwt plugin to build run it

3700265
maven	m2e
invoke run as ... on a maven project via m2e war exploded gwt debug

3700323
hide	show
if user is connected hide the regular fb login button and show your fake fb login button

3700329
client-side	server-side
but the these padded words should not be removed easily by using either jquery client-side htmldocument server-side coding

3700362
hide	show
so if you hide the placeholder and move it s contents out these changes will be lost and the standard menu will be show

3700485
base	fractions
the base don t share a common factor which means that the number of digits required to represent a number from the source base in the target base is fractions 6 frasl

3700497
pop-up	dialog
if you mean letting the user click a link and have a dialog box pop-up to save certain content as a text file

3700547
folder	directory
directory in apps folder

3700594
put	get
i ve looked at these three crm systems for some very simple lead management they have the usual rest get info out put info in data sync api some have colour changing stuff but aside from that its seems impossible to integrate

3700603
width	height
i have to set up the layer with map with 100 height in 100 width minus 200 px for the toolbar to the left

3700651
listview	gridview
views are typically selected in the context of an adapterview like listview or gridview

3700660
google-chrome	firefox
works fine with firefox and google-chrome

3700736
git-rebase	amend
finally if you really do get this set in the history this way others have pulled so you don t want to git-rebase amend you can check out the old commit and then check out the files from the newer commit

3700771
min	max
the xml file describes its object structure - each class its properties and the corresponding min max and default values for those properties as well as a text field documenting the property

3700814
width	height
modal dialog has still the same default width and height

3700817
maven	m2e
i use the m2e plugin maven and i would like to generate a project like struts 2 hibernate 3 mysql

3700826
jar	war
maybe intellij puts this additional jar in the exploded war cos i didn t see it before

3700868
cout	cin
i do know that the functions cout cin etc.

3700868
ostream	istream
and theior actual implementations inside istream and ostream .

3700876
cout	cin
cin and cout are not simple variables - with cerr they are streams registered by default for every application using iostream

3700887
rdf	owl
even though there are many commonly used abbreviations rdf owl foaf dc ... each person can make up their own and use them as they see fit

3700931
versioning	upgrade
maybe not a direct answer but if you upgrade to delphi xe you will also get license keys for some of the older versioning of delphi down to 7 and delphi 7 included clx it was dropped in borland delphi 2006

3700935
width	height
depending on the width and height of your div you ll play with the left attribute to position the btns correctly

3700958
maven	pom.xml
basically it will create the pom.xml file the structure of directories using the maven conventions and some simple files

3700966
cout	cin
edit however the definitions for cin cout etc need to be extern and defined in some sort of library

3700983
distance	polygons
i want to find the minimum distance between two polygons

3700993
uitableview	reloaddata
the uitableview has a method called reloaddata that will take care of this for you and you need to call this everytime you change the data source after the table has been created

3700993
uitableview	reloaddata
so in rootviewcontroller add a method called reload which in turn calls reloaddata on your uitableview and modify your code

3700999
cout	cin
to use cin and cout you really only have to know that they re in the std namespace and that you need to include iostream to use them

3700999
std	ostream
to give you an idea how it might be implemented the definition of class std ostream could be in the header ostream which is included by iostream

3700999
std	ostream
also in the header ostream std cout could be defined as a reference to an std ostream

3701013
post	get
the api may have changed since this post but this get your started at least

3701021
width	height
the problem here is that the height and width of each button could be different so its not like storing one image and use this as a background or

3701025
memcpy	memmove
the key difference between memcpy and memmove is that memmove will work fine when source and destination overlap

3701045
hex	binary
so instead of doing your math in binary and then trying to do a bunch of divide by 10s to put in a human decimal ascii format you do your math in bcd from the start then it is more of a conversion to hex without the upper letters shift right 4 and with 0xf add 0x30 and with 0xf add 0x30 repeat

3701059
memcpy	memmove
having said that i have seen platforms that have exactly the same code for memcpy and memmove

3701074
onmousedown	onmouseup
i m using onmousedown and onmouseup for that

3701117
modula-2	oberon
as missing faktor mentioned above not only project oberon but all of niklaus wirth s languages are tremendously well documented algol-60 algol-x algol-w pascal modula-2 and oberon

3701132
sorting	filtering
the filtering are at least 5 which includes a keyword a category and subcategory a date range filtering and a sort expression filtering for sorting

3701189
post	get
this blog post should get you going

3701195
memcpy	memmove
at best calling memcpy rather than memmove will save a pointer comparison and a conditional branch

3701196
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the most recent versions of google-chrome firefox and ie

3701215
memcpy	memmove	inline	inlining
this means that without the ability to optimize in favor of memcpy memmove is at least slower by one branch and any additional space occupied by inline instructions to handle each case if inlining is possible

3701215
memcpy	memmove
reading the eglibc-2.11.1 code for both memcpy and memmove confirms this as suspected

3701215
memcpy	memmove
in summary this means if you can guarantee the regions are not overlapped then selecting memcpy over memmove avoids a branch

3701215
memcpy	memmove
if the source and destination contain corresponding page aligned and page sized regions and don t overlap some architectures can employ hardware accelerated copies for those regions regardless of whether you called memmove or memcpy

3701263
hide	show
i have requirement to show the toolbar button border on mouse hovering and otherwise hide it

cos	sin
2 x87 offers some operations that are not covered by the sse# instruction sets namely instructions for triogonometric operations sin cos ... and logarithms

3701489
rss	feed
you need the rss reader to be in the same zone as the feed

3701489
rss	feed
so if you want a web-based rss reader that can read feed available on your company network the web-based rss reader also needs to be running within your network

3701503
kerberos	ntlm
i ve tried doing this using c# and it kind of worked yet with plsql it seems like am having problem authenticating to sharepoint since it uses kerberos ntlm

3701546
post	get
the xsrf protection on post data using tokens like you said should work on get data as well

3701546
post	get
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

3701549
keydown	keyup
iirc you ll get one event for keydown one for keytyped and one for keyup

3701672
width	height
if you scale the shell up by 10 to get 10 larger fonts you must decrease the height and width of the scale by 10 so that is still fits the same area just with scaled up content

3701689
kerberos	ntlm
that way you can use the extranet zone for applications that don t support ntlm or kerberos

3701709
width	height
if not give it a set height and width and the should fit tightly around it making it all clickable

3701747
google-chrome	safari
if you set size to say 1 on your input field it fixes the bug - testet in google-chrome and safari

3701778
tcpclient	networkstream
the first step is to call getstream on the tcpclient instance which gives you a reference to the networkstream with which you send and receive binary data

3701778
networkstream	binaryreader
you can wrap that in a binaryreader and binarywriter to send and receive .net primitives like int32s strings et cetera or use the networkstream methods directly for byte arrays

3701805
getter	setter
so if they have a worker thread that does the heavy lifting then they will have to marshal all calls to your library onto that worker thread even for simple getter and setter

3701813
versioning	upgrade
add to that all the other new features in sl4 mentioned in the other answers already and in vs 2010 as well i strongly recommend everyone upgrade to the latest versioning of both

3701951
lxml.html	elementtree	lxml	elementtree
you could use the lxml library specifically lxml.html which gives you an elementtree object which you can then serialize as xml with amongst others the

3701951
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
if this fails on your html it is too broken you can use elementsoup an extension on beautifulsoup to build a lxml.html tree

3701959
folder	directory
on the open dialog i have set the optionsex to ofexnoplacesbar and that removes the bar that would let them select folder and directory to go to quickly but the user can use the bread crumb address tool to go up a level and type a different directory into the filename text box to change directory

3702002
for-loop	arrays
i am adding the jlabels using a for-loop which iterates through an arrays of colors

3702006
inherited	properties
the control class gives you a fontsize properties so if you set a base style your other styles could inherited from this

above the for-loop loops put

3702063
google-chrome	firefox
also i only need to support the lastest versions of firefox and google-chrome

3702073
google-chrome	safari
but interestingly both google-chrome and safari which are also webkit running on my desktop report the actual screen resolution

3702073
width	height
according to mdc these properties are not part of any specification so there s probably no strict definition of what width height should report

3702074
hide	show
just looking at the code i m not sure what to expect from calling a show or hide method on it elsewhere

3702096
int	chars
even with non-extended chars top bit not used you are still out of luck as you are trying to encode 35 bits of ascii data into 32 bits of int

3702106
mousemove	keydown
if mousemove and keydown had the same type you could skip the event.map step and just directly merge them

3702129
hash	md5
you could also use a hash function such as md5 or sha-1 and use only the first 32 bits

3702137
udp	tcp
i don t have access to a solaris 10 system at the moment but according to the oracle documentation you can use the ndd utility to query and set the configured buffer size maximums for tcp and udp

3702155
getter	setter
i once read a comment from someone about unit-testing that you don t need to write tests for code that can be easily broken for instance getter setter can be easily broken for example getter returns the value it is supposed to do and we can break it easily by not returning the value so we don t end up writing unit tests for getter and setter unless there is some logic embedded in it in which case these are not actually getter and setter

3702159
firefox	safari
i used safari s web inspector to look at the markup that is generated by the twitter widget firefox s firebug would have worked just as well for this purpose

3702171
integer	unsigned
i am making an emulator for z80 binaries but i cannot find out whether all the integer data types are signed or unsigned from the manual or from google

3702190

my idea is to create the app in portrait mode but rotate everything by 90 degrees the player thinks that he is playing the game in landscape mode when really i ve just rotated everything

3702239
webkit	gecko
for something more robust or at least more browser-like i guess you could try webkit or gecko

3702319
post	get
i m try to post in a hidden input a base64 encoded image 500kb and all i get is an error

mef	prism
i need to do some more research on mef but in prism you can guarantee that one module s initialize fires before the others via a moduledependency

3702353
mef	prism
i m fully-qualifying this by saying i might not know some inner working of mef that does not allow this but this is how things work generally with prism

websphere	ibm
i have an existing java web application running through ibm websphere i m unsure of the version but could find out if it helps that i am looking to implement two factor authentication with

3702383
integer	unsigned
so the same register may be handled by imul instruction as signed integer and by mul instruction as unsigned integer

3702391
post	get
rest is simple to implement trivially easy if you use asp.net mvc on your server accessible by any client that can handle http post get without the need for libraries and easy to test so rest would be my technology of choice

3702398
hash	salt
the user s password is stored as a salt hash so nobody can decrypt the key and the data even if he sees the hash

3702398
hash	salt
create salt hash

3702425
explode	nl2br
then use the nl2br function to create s or you can explode it for or n

this approach relies only on addition subtraction multiplication by two and averaging

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
i m experiencing a strange css spacing issue in google-chrome but not in firefox and or ie

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
the vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desired

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
the redline represent the extra spacing that google-chrome is adding that firefox ie are not

3702732
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

3702747
width	height
the form class will help you with the other stuff like the width and height properties etc

3702757
hash	salt
best practice for this use case is to store only a cryptographic hash sha1 of the password and a random salt

3702757
hash	salt
that is sufficient to verify it but giving only the hash and salt it would take a nearly infinte amount of time to figure out the plain password

3702761
children	parent
you would be defining a method that hid a method of a parent and allowed children to override

3702786
user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
you should see your tabitem with view s user-controls under the tabcontrol

3702790

3702836
mouse	keyboard
i know i can use low-level keyboard mouse hooks like in

3702884
vsto	add-in
i have visual studio com add-in built in vs 2008 on pure com technology not vsto see bottom of this for more on that which references 2003 primary interop assemblies but the add-in may be used on 2003 2007 or now 2010 office machines

3702884
vsto	add-in
finally i am aware that writing a manged com add-in for excel or word is now generally done with vsto instead of pure managed framework code but this is not an option presently to change the legacy app to this direction

3702889
emacs	textmate
i use textmate to debug python script as i like the feature of using command-r for running python from textmate and i learned that emacs provide similar feature

3702889
emacs	textmate
i need to know if the python is run from command line or from textmate emacs

3702889
emacs	textmate
i got an answer in the case with emacs and i happen to solve this issue with textmate

3702906
google-chrome	firefox
according to w3c line-height normal tells user agents to set the used value to a reasonable value based on the font of the element. firefox and google-chrome could be setting different reasonable values since they are built on entirely different rendering engines

3702921
post	get
i think i m going to implement this feature didn t think it was needed but now i like the idea in my app and i ll post some code if i get it working let me know if you get yours working as well

3702922
error-handling	exception-handling
2 use non-local control flow to separate error-handling code from the usual path exception-handling

3702945
emacs	textmate
i don t know about textmate but when i tell emacs to eval buffer its value is

3702945
emacs	textmate
you might want to set up your python-mode in emacs and whatever the equivalent in textmate is to put something special like -t in the command line

3702948
portrait	landscape
whenever i rotate my screen between landscape and portrait this method returns false

3702952

i wouldn t maintain upgrade script for versioning 1 to 3 or so directly usually it s not required

3703069
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie7 google-chrome firefox

3703091
draggable	droppable
upon clicking the close button the item disappears from the droppable area and re-activates as a draggable

3703092
memcpy	memmove
it s certainly possible that memcpy is merely a call to memmove in which case there d be no benefit to using memcpy

3703092
memcpy	memmove
on the other extreme it s possible that an implementor assumed memmove would rarely be used and implemented it with the simplest possible byte-at-a-time loops in c in which case it could be ten times slower than an optimized memcpy

3703092
memcpy	memmove
as others have said the likeliest case is that memmove uses memcpy when it detects that a forward copy is possible but some implementations may simply compare the source and destination addresses without looking for overlap

3703111
nsstring	nsdata
for converting nsdata to a nsstring try initwithdata encoding

3703119
sorting	grouping
tempdb - used as a temporary work space for temporary tables and lots of other stuff like sorting and grouping

3703140
onkeyup	onkeydown	int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown
you could overwrite the public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event and public boolean onkeyup int keycode keyevent event functions in your activity class and test if keycode is equal to keyevent.keycode_power

3703211
put	get
i usually don t put anything in main i let the no-arg app.run get called and call everything i need in the onstartup method but this wouldn t change the behaviour you re seeing

3703232
tolower	toupper
i mean if i would create a new instance of the string class it would create an object with dozens of methods toupper tolower etc.

3703331

if you want to prevent apache from exposing the source code if something is wrong with php add this in your httpd.conf .htaccess

3703501
facebook	fbconnect
the facebook fbconnect api supports fql which is similar to sql queries

3703568
hid	keyboard
i would find even if i hid the iframe flash player was never getting keyboard focus back

3703568
mouse	keyboard
now there is no really good way to determine if you need to instruct the browser to give keyboard focus back i end up executing this javascript on every mouse down rather inefficient but it was the only way to gaurentee whenever my user clicked on flash player content that the browser gave keyboard focus back

3703634
execl	fork
but as pekka mentioned this is a really bad idea because you must set up first a lighttpd web server on iphone not really comfortable or if you re planing to implement a cli php script you should first launch it using some c functions like pipe dup2 fork execl and then parse its output inside your -not-so-objective-c- iphone app

3703688
post	get
i haven t done this as i m not a python programmer yet but there are many ways to expose access cake - url param param post get rss whatever

3703688
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana

3703732
public	protected
why python doesn t have super-complex protected private and public declarations

3703738
mouse	keyboard
since no one said it directly yet ipad does not render exactly the same as safari on 10.6 nor can interactions be tested because one is gesture and touch based and the other is keyboard and mouse

3703761
versioning	upgrade
once you do that if someone is in versioning 1 and you want to upgrade them to version2.3 then you just need to run the sripts for each versioning in order and you will have a datbase in versioning 2.3

3703801
pop-up	dialog
so when the time to show the pop-up dialog comes it s only showing the text intereactive meaning that the rascs_interactive state was reached but no terminal window is showing up and the connection remains freezed waiting for the user input of course.

3703834
mp3	ogg
this is somewhat inherent to mp3 because blocks of the same length are written to the files instead of allowing to define the length of a block like ogg vorbis does for example

3703840
jax-ws	jax-rs
i have only heard about jax-ws and jax-rs so far

3703895
google-chrome	firefox
the code works with no problem in firefox and google-chrome but does not work at all in ie 7 or 8

3703902
client-side	server-side
as for the second question i think the few sources i heard that from were either incorrect in their assessment or incorrectly referring to client-side image maps when they meant to say server-side image maps

3703953
post	get
i don t want to lose get or post values

3703954
daemons	launchd
furthermore the only way a macports port could grab port 80 on startup is if it installed a launchd daemons but macports doesn t activate any launchd daemons on its own you have to do that manually

3703984
typeerror	attributeerror
it s a tossup as to if we should be catching the attributeerror and typeerror or just let them propagate to somewhere that knows how to handle them but this is just an example so we ll let it fly

3704084
postgresql	mysql
i ve read through all the licenses and faq s of mysql postgresql and hsqldb but i am still not certain if i need to purchase a license commercial type or have to publish the source code of my web project open source license since i am not a lawyer

3704094
postgresql	mysql
you can use mysql and postgresql commercially without any sort of purchase

3704356
dictionary	map
std map a dictionary that maps a key to a value

3704377
disk	ram
the devices have fairly modest resources 20 mb ram depending on the device making it desirable to store these on disk rather than in memory if feasible

3704402
division	subtraction
since division is repeated subtraction but you have a very special case not a general case division to deal with i d be tempted to compare the timings for the following code with the division version

3704402
division	subtraction
this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division

3704402
division	modulo
and removing the modulo 10000 operation will only skew results in favour of the division it knocks about 0.02 seconds off the time with division when replaced with the comparison

3704405
ssl	https
i would like to change it to use ssl https

3704420
ring	hiccup
right now we are using ring base layer middleware moustache routing hiccup html generation

3704481
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
an unchecked-exception is any exception that inherits from runtimeexception

3704523
int	chars
it would be possible if the internal implementation of mysql s string to int function dropped all chars from the string after the first non-numeric when parsing it

3704536
hide	show
wire a hidden image view in the xib to an iboutlet and simply show it before the task starts and hide it when it is over

3704567
disk	ram
a file is inherently an on-disk entity unless you have a ram disk - but that s not something you can create in java

3704626
apache	nginx
i am running a website locally all the traffic is routed through nginx which then dispatches requests to php pages to apache and serves static files

3704626
google-chrome	safari
works perfectly in google-chrome safari ie etc

3704629
webkit	gecko
i ve achieved this on windows with .net and ie gecko and webkit but now need to do the same for safari on os x

3704798
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i have a superclass called device which has a number of subclassing that inherited it

3704814
oncreate	onstart
android kills the activity every time you rotate so best place is onstart or oncreate

3704825
width	height
if i remove the width and height declaration from the images the animation runs smoothly but the images exceed their block-level parent s dimensions

3704825
firefox	safari
safari 5 and firefox 3 on mac and ie7 on windows handle the animation very well but there are some browsers where the performance gets killed when scaling down images

3704826
comparator	comparable
it discusses both comparable and comparator interfaces with examples

3704830
comparator	comparable
see collections.sort with an explicit comparator or the collections.sort kind that requires the input to implement comparable if you prefer

3704833
comparator	comparable
if you almost always want to use that order you can add the comparable interface to quote and implement a comparator method

3704922
userid	usergroups
so put all users not in group a into group b a user is in a group when there is a usergroups with that userid and that groupid in existence

3704967

in safari and google-chrome once the #scrollbox javascript hits the #scrollbox div jumps out of the #hangerleft div into the middle of the page and ignores the positioning of the #hangerleft div

3705248
folder	directory
in an attempt to centralize all of my repositories in one folder i also tried pushing to root git repository.git as root and then checking out to the appropriate home directory from there

3705248
chown	chgrp
i can solve that problem with chown and chgrp commands in each repo s post-receive hook--however that also raises the not quite right flag in my head

3705254
width	height
however my dimensions are max-height and max-width as opposed to the regular height width

3705254
width	height
i have tried probably 5 different methods that people back as functional for regular height width and all have failed

3705343
mvp	presenter
in first example presenter hold the contract to what view must implement in other words drives what should be implemented by views a classical mvp approach

3705343
errai	gwtp
any how you should also look at framworks like gwtp or errai from jboss

3705370
filtering	grouping
what i imagine happening is the first selection box business grouping is pre-populated and once a selection is made an event listener send a message that filtering the second selection box and the same for the third

errai	gwtp
gwt dispatch can be used just by itself if not using errai or gwtp

3705462
getter	setter
1 a virtual attribute usually needs a setter in addition to a getter

3705504

one thing i wanted to do was get raster or vector snapshots of fairly complex multi-page diagrams and put them in a wiki page and dia really couldn t cope with that - the fonts went all wonky and so on

3705562
gridview	rowdatabound
i had to register each button as a postback control with the scriptmanager on the gridview rowdatabound event

and programmatically show hide it

3705809
hide	show
hide show the imageview spinner i

3705822
client-side	server-side
i mentione actionscript as an example because client-side is where this concept is most known but it can be on the server-side too just maybe not as relevant for normal applications and so not as known

3705892
multiplying	transpose
later on in the code i need to multiplying transpose a by a bunch of vectors

3705919

3705964
unix	solaris
also the coldfusion system does not require .net run-time software installed to use remote .net components so coldfusion running on a unix linux solaris or os-x system can access and use .net assemblies

3705965
rss	feed
i am trying to process rss feed using google reader api but the issue is that even if feed encoding is utf-8 it is returned in an unreadable format

when i put this on my production server i get following error

3706199
spaces	delimiter
the data is intitally avaiable to me as a spaces delimiter textfile

3706201
postgresql	mysql
so while fpc on windows uses own assemblers and linkers the .o s it generates are still compatible with mingw32 in general fpc s output is very gcc compatible and it is often possible to link in gcc static libs directly allowing mysql and postgresql linklibs to be linked into apps with a suitable license

3706257
button	checkbox
so i would have a form with three checkbox and a submit button

3706276
multiplying	add
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations

3706276
multiplying	add
if you needed to multiplying by some small constant value such as 2 then maybe you could use add to speed things up

3706342
post	get
but since you are doing a post on the action you can always get the data the following way

3706387

3707592
innodb	myisam
i ve tried several times innodb and always fall back to myisam for one reason or the other

3707614

3709175
google-chrome	safari
at the same time my plugin work properly both in safari and google-chrome

3709182
width	height
to do that you ll have to develop layout code that sizes and positions your children so that they do not extend past the height and width of your available content space

3709190
ienumerator	idisposable
so i wrote because the type of e does not necessarily have to be an implementation of or even ienumerator -- which also means it doesn t necessarily have to implement idisposable hence the part

3709190
ienumerable	ienumerator
the ienumerable interface exposes an ienumerator which in turn provides access to a current property of type object

3709215
subtract	add
i wrote a type extender to allow me to add or subtract weekdays to a given date

3709218

i m working with jstree and i would like to know how to hide show nodes if possible

3709315
google-chrome	safari
everything works fine on safari or google-chrome but after the deployment with phonegap webview it does t work anymore.

when i scale the image to the width and height of the print width and height obviously i ve got a page full of purple

3709424
versioning	upgrade
allow those that depend on the shared libraries to upgrade and adopt new versioning as their particular timeline and bandwidth allows

3709577

you will be doing int division so your coin values should not be double but int

3709633
hide	show
i ve been trying to hide and show the imgareaselect selection box depending on whether a checkbox is checked or not

3709644
prng	random
actually what you need in practice is what freebsd s dev urandom provides it will read an initial seed of sufficient length from dev random then use a prng

3709644
freebsd	linux
to sum up under both linux and freebsd you should use dev urandom not dev random

3709650
ireport	subreports
if you are using ireport in your subreports properties look for the parameters property and click the button on the right of the text box

3709666
put	get

3709942
google-chrome	firefox
it s fine in google-chrome and firefox

3709945
migrate	upgrade
you also get the benefit that scalaj-time can be easily upgrade to use jsr 310 when it s available so it ll be much less painful to migrate your code at that time

3710002
portrait	landscape
you can supply two layout files for landscape and portrait specifying the number of columns in the gridview in each case to achieve the 2x3 vs 3x2

3710034
webrat	cucumber
i need to test with cucumber webrat the presence of this button

3710083
free	memcpy

3710304
java.util.date	zoneddatetime
instant zoneddatetime offsetdatetime java.util.date compatibility

3710312
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	setcontentview
look at the onstart method in the activity class i think you are wanting to override that instead of oncreate or in addition to typically you call setcontentview only in oncreate

3710337
children	parent
your best bet is to have a parent bean and have those multiple beans as children

3710379
nsstring	nsobject
i ve read that using a struct to hold two nsstring instances or any nsobject subclass is a bad idea

3710452
mouseleave	mouseenter
it really shouldn t matter see source code but typically hover takes in two functions as parameter -- the first is executed when the mouseenter the element and the second is executed when the mouseleave the element

3710473
free	malloc
then the objective c memory overhead is 0 and you can encapsulate all the nasty malloc and free stuff into the innards of one .m file

3710482
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
i only see quite few structs in cocoa framework like cgsize cgrect and cgpoint

3710493
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven you can add to your pom.xml

3710516
put	get
the weird part is that even if i put if-else or try-catch blocks within the read and write methods i still get the error

3710517
children	parent
when you say comments which are in parent node do you mean comments that are children of the root node outside of all elements

3710528
int	chars	int	double
i believe is a good idea to use structs specially if you are dealing with c-based frameworks lets says opengl coregraphics coretext specially stuff that will require a couple triple of int double chars etc

3710528
cgpoint	cgrect
if they are already not implemented in some of apple frameworks cgrect cgpoint ctrect nsrange etc... c stuff plays and looks better with other c stuff

3710551
int	double
struct s with two int or four double s are borderline cases

3710558
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	nsrange	cgsize	cgrect
there are already several examples of this in the cocoa frameworks cgrect cgsize cgpoint nsrange for example

3710759
width	height
set a condition which triggers the mouse up event handler when the x or y is equal to the stage width or height respectively

3710771
post	get
my idea was to have maybe 25 book listings per page and rather than use hyperlinks that submit the form data as a get request of url parameters the page number hyperlinks would simply resubmit the form passing the requested page number as an additional form post parameter

3710793
atomic	compare-and-swap
the condition variables cannot be implemented using only the atomic primitives like compare-and-swap

3710805
width	height
my attempt was going to be injecting some javascript to add width and height attributes to all images in the dom that don t have any

3710807
lambda	first-class-functions
the jvm doesn t support first-class-functions or lambda out of the box

3710808
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome safari and ie8 there s a border around this button.

3710837
toggleclass	each
what you have works you could slim it down with a dual class toggleclass call on each but there is one problem area

3710861
post	get
imo the request being a get or post shouldn t make much difference so i d say do whatever floats your boat shielding head from restful rebuttals

3710908
getter	setter
custom actions can be invoced in the property s getter or setter if needed

3710960
serializable	deserialization
deserialization process needs to know what type have to be deserialized - such information is not part of serializable data

3711015
post	get
however if i do a post test i get the following html doc as a result

3711018
nsstring	nsdata
you shouldn t need to convert the image to an nsstring to post it to a web service just to an nsdata

3711051
google-chrome	firefox
the second command stops the slideshow from happening and firefox it works great but google-chrome the slideshow keeps going

3711062

i changed your jquery a bit so items hide or show based on the click of the button

3711102
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this can be added to the httpd.conf file or even in an .htaccess

3711115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i am styling the wordpress more link on the blog index page and i ve used some custom styles and markup that are displaying inconsistently between webkit based browsers safari and google-chrome and firefox

3711163
width	height
now with font size of 15 and font arial these should be giving me a desired size of around 8 width and 10 height

3711215
mvp	presenter
there are a lot of variants on presenter don t get too caught up in the specific details just start off with the simple mvp if you have never used it

3711254
post	get
another common source of these sorts of errors is trying to parse a get request on the server for arguments or whatever while you re getting a post request

3711267
int	chars
usr lib gcc i686-pc-cygwin 4.3.4 include c++ bits basic_string.h 1458 instantiated from static _chart std basic_string _chart _traits _alloc _s_construct_aux _initerator _initerator const _alloc std __false_type with _initerator std istream_iterator std allocator chars std char_traits int _chart chars _traits std char_traits _alloc std allocator

3711285
udp	tcp
in applications like that where you often have limited bandwidth you can really tell the difference in terms of how long it takes to get the data from the remote host to the server between udp and momentary tcp connections like http

3711285
udp	tcp
a udp packet will get to its destination in what seems like an instant and the setup for the tcp connection is very conspicuous often taking several seconds to complete

3711331
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
gzipinputstream can wrap a fileinputstream for gzip keeping in mind that gzip only works on single files

3711331
outputstream	inputstream
both types of inputstream also have their respective outputstream

3711334

it works well enough on firefox 3.6.9 google-chrome safari and opera

3711451
button	checkbox
perhaps you could disable the button so that it greyed out until all the checkbox have been set or whatever.

3711453
ant	maven
both ant and maven support a very easy mechanism for using tokens and filter files to filter certain resources

3711508
rss	feed
look at your newsfeed in a rss reader and see what s already included in the feed

3711510
equals	gethashcode
you need to make your thing type override equals and gethashcode to indicate its equality semantics

3711525
post	get
so first we should get number of post in category for example from memcache and then check if cached version valid by this number

3711583
ubuntu	linux
on my linux ubuntu i was able to install multiple versions of eclipse for various purposes

3711589

3711598
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
the truezip api provides drop-in replacements for the well-known classes file fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

this is great because thumbnails such as small_square large_thumbnail etc are pre-generated along with meta data such as size width height views etc

3711705
implements	extends
you can t add extension methods use generic or whatever else to extends implements service

3711714
firefox	safari
since firefox and safari users typically upgrade their browsers

3711716

all the typical mouse events are supported onclick onmouseover onmouseout onmousedown onmouseup etc.

3711720
svg	vml
for more interaction you ll have to look at javascript and for even more possibilities i heartily recommend raphael as a cross-browser vml for i.e svg for the rest tool capable of more complex images events on parts of that image

malloc - error for object object pointer being free was not allocated

3711839

you can group by the domain_name and index_path and include one min or max value of collection_name per group

3711864
google-chrome	firefox
this will though require your users have a browser that supports canvas firefox google-chrome or for ie to use something like explorercanvas

3711874
google-chrome	firefox
but i keep getting a problem to display it correctly in ie8 while i have no problems with firefox or google-chrome please take a look at the links to see it

3711885
keydown	keyup
add keydown and keyup methods to toggle the booleans accordingly

3711937

it seems that both firefox and google-chrome have the same issue

3711941
firefox	safari
the code works in firefox ie8 safari etc

3711956
ssl	https
one other note..the package you ve referenced does not appear to include ssl support - so you will not be able to deal with https urls using that library

3711956
ssl	https
grab one of the ssl packages if you need to support https

3711980
put	get
check wether typeof iactivity .isassignable type if so i want to get string typedescription type.attribute.value or similar what i want is to put a attribute on a class or on the above classes depends what suggestions you make or what solutions are possible like

3711992

before you had an arraylist containing three linkedhashmap objects

3711993
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i d stick with whatever rendered cleaner and more consistently -- ie firefox google-chrome safari etc

3711999
width	height
technical differences yes most notably you can set the width height of an img tag and it will stretch the image which can be useful in some situations

3712014
post	get
but that s not what happens...somewhere from when i submit the form and get my results and theme it all up i get redirected some how and lose all my post data

3712055
punctuation	words
i think your best bet is going to be a regex match for the last words excluding punctuation marks being in a list jr sr iii etc

3712061
union	distinct
the default behavior of union is to eliminate duplicate rows and since we re asking only for articleids with the intention of joining something to this list of ids the query below would result in the set of distinct article ids that meet the criteria

3712090
uilabel	uitextview
let the uilabel or uitextview or uiwebview do that for you

3712152
subscript	superscript
offset 4 points to the colour index if you want to change font colour while offset 8 identifies superscript subscript and offset 10 identifies underline type

3712158
charindex	substr
set lastname substr lastname 0 charindex lastname iii

mouseup	mousedown
alternatively you can set a fmousedown flag to true in mousedown and reset it to false in mouseup

3712226
post	get
you may need to post some code to get a better answer

3712226
hide	show
instead of adding and removing views you could hide or show them if they should only be initialized once

3712275
getter	setter
but it seems like setting the class variable without going through the setter could be equally bad if the setter does something special or if the property is changed to something besides retain and the getter isn t checked

3712300
put	get
i generally don t put anything in the resource dictionary that doesn t get created in xaml

3712312
button	checkbox
i m using microsoft.office.interop.excel to read the values of cells of a worksheet but i m unable to find information that shows how to read dropdowns checkbox and option button

3712340
int	chars
i m storing the chars as an int so i can check for the eof signal but things aren t going so well

3712357
getter	setter
the best solution is to not do lazy initialization as a part of your getter setter

3712366
wsimport	wsdl2java
we re using java 1.5 axis2 and client classes generated with either wsimport or wsdl2java

3712388

3712494
superclass	subclassing
you create a superclass that declares dosomething and then you create subclassing each of which implements it differently

3712531
jruby	mri
i just recently installed jruby and the thrift gem after using it in mri

3712531
jruby	mri
edit after digging around on my mac i found that the mri gem and jruby gem are different even though the gems are the same version 0.2.0.4

3712531
jruby	mri
now this seems like a terrible idea but if you copy the .rb files from the mri gem into the jruby gem and add require thrift struct_union to thrift.rb you will no longer get any errors related to the thrift gem except that it can t find thirft_native and will use pure ruby libraries

3712589
serializable	deserialization
my guess when spring beans are serializable for example as part of the http session on restoring spring tries not to restore their original values since they might be meaningless after the deserialization but instead tries to fetch them by their id

3712627
uiview	subviews
this is because uiview objects retain their subviews

3712777
profiling	instrumentation
check the documentation for your profiling if you can run with sampling instead of instrumentation

3712787

edit in the javascript for-loop shown above i had it tap each of the buttons in the main.buttons arrays and only 1 of the 12 identical buttons on the view gets the tap

3712801
moq	moles
my company is trying to decide if we are going to standardize on moq rhino mocks or ms moles and stubs

3712946

3712969
bazaar	svn
i can get summary log from emacs bazaar repo for about 1 min and search through it instead search for each separate changelog and with modern tools like emacs vc or tortoise svn hg immediately get diff for change

3713064
folder	directory
the folder on the server will be stored in an arraylist called directory

3713064
folder	directory
if a directory exists on the server but it doesn t exist in the database it will be deleted first all of its files are deleted then the folder itself will be deleted too

3713081
put	get
i know this all sounds very vague and it definitely lacks a small sample but i can t put my whole code in there as it is too long and complex i will try at some point to get some small example going

3713144
fink	macports
i didn t find either a fink package or a macports package however and don t have it installed yet

i ve tried chmod and mkdir with 777 0777 755 0755 1777 01777 and more

3713175
accessor	properties	getter	setter
by providing accessor setter getter methods or by using properties in languages that support them like c# the developer can define a more-stable contract between the class and its users

3713175
getter	setter
note that performance is not a concern because modern jit compilers are able to optimize calls to trivial getter setter in a way that the actual call is eliminated and the code is equivalent to direct access to the underlying memory location

3713175
getter	setter	public	protected
also setter and getter may usually have different visibility public protected private providing the added benefit of more-granular control to read write operations over a specified value

3713175
getter	setter
hence the best practice is to avoid public fields wherever possible and use setter getter methods or properties instead

3713183
post	get
if you re trying to make a post request and for whatever reason it matters for you to not send a get request for example you re modifying information stored on the server you may want to use

3713206

disk	ram
before spending money to invest in faster hard drives try building your project entirely on a ram disk assuming you have the ram to spare

3713370
disk	ram
you can find various free ram disk drivers on the net

3713370
disk	ram
you won t find any physical drive including ssds that are faster than a ram disk

3713370
disk	ram
in my case a project that took 5 minutes to build on a 6-core i7 on a 7200 rpm sata drive with incredibuild was reduced by only about 15 seconds by using a ram disk

3713370
disk	ram
considering the need to recopy to permanent storage and the potential for lost work 15 seconds is not enough incentive to use a ram disk and probably not much incentive to spend several hundreds of dollars on a high-rpm or ssd drive

3713387
inherited	properties
all my controller s inherited from a base controller that has a properties on it referringpartialview

3713401
getter	setter
other features that work well together are case classes and pattern matching allowing you to easily build and deconstruct algebraic data types without having to manually write all the tedious equality hashcode constructor and getter setter logic that java demands

3713406
padding	overlapping
if you are worried that the possibility of overlapping with padding bytes in the struct might somehow invoke nasal demons you could avoid this by replacing the 1 in with a value which ensures that there is no padding at the end of the struct

3713443
folder	directory
so that it gets the programs current directory then looks for the images in that same folder

3713448
folder	directory
it creates a symlink in the virtual env folder bin directory

3713482
pull	push
for that to happens any user wishing to push anything needs to pull first and rebase his changes on top of whatever new changes were already pushed there

3713482

3713494
dbcontext	objectcontext
considering i was using dbcontext the solutions were to either expose the internal objectcontext or to create a method that would call the context internally

3713513
slideup	slidedown
i ve made a very simple dropdown menu using jquery slideup and slidedown for the functions - but it gets very jumpy i m using firefox 3.6.8 if the mouse is moved to quickly over it or if the mouse is held on one of the submenu items

tabcontrol	tabitem
this could be achieved with a centered and stretched tabcontrol with 15 tabitem s

3713780
post	get
if you don t once i get my act together and cant figure out will post to one of these

3713780

hide	show
hide show type technique to reveal pages as user requests them and using ajax to populate update data

3713868
margin	height
by default the div will have the same height -- unless you restrict it somehow or add padding or margin

3713868
width	height
this double-wrapped approach will let the div still work within the layout like a normal div while allowing you to sniff the width height from #b via javascript if you need it

3713873
firefox	safari
even between windows 7 and a mac i have only ever noticed font differences between the two in firefox or safari

3713910

3713974
condor	checkpoint
if you have used the condor_compile tool to relink your code with the condor checkpoint code it does a few things differently than a normal link

condor	checkpoint
if it doesn t can you correlate the segfaults to when condor restarts the executable from a checkpoint the user log will tell you when this happens

3713982
tapestry	wicket
for a comparison between tapestry and wicket see this article

3713983
vim	emacs
as far as i know viper mode is an emulation of common vim functionality in emacs

client-side	server-side
bl both at the server-side and client-side via ajax

3714117
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome

but you have the possibility of using the other parts of emacs that you can t get in vim whatever those things are that you find attractive

3714135
email	dkim
i have configured a new email server for my company we are using a cloud server on theplanet.com and a shared hosnting on bluehost.com i configured the server using iredmail all works great but when i try to test the dkim keys with amavisd testkeys it returns

3714303
postgresql	mysql
i think to understand that it s my local db as it s mysql throwing the error while heroku runs postgresql which is complaining thus there seem to be some duplicate keys in some index not sure i really know what this means

3714318
inherited	properties
when you set a value for a properties that was inherited from a parent as your twoway binding is doing when it writes to the source it overrides the value that was inherited

3714318
inherited	properties
in this case using an attached properties with inherited isn t gaining you anything so you could simplify your xaml a little by just using a standard dp instead

3714321
ubuntu	debian
currently using the tools bundled with vpb-driver for voicetronix hardware that is available via debian ubuntu

3714329
case-sensitive	case-insensitive	postgresql	mysql

min	max
i have to use min max 0 99999 because java doesn t support and + in lookbehind

3714489
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
if i can t solve this relatively quickly i will have to abandon lighttpd + fastcgi and look at apache + mod_wsgi or perhaps nginx + fastcgi and the prospect of going into another webserver config is not something i m looking forward to .

3714489
nginx	lighttpd
i wanted to figure out whether or not it was django s fcgi impl or lighttpd that was at fault here because that will determine whether or not moving to nginx + fastcgi would actually solve anything so i took a look at the packet trace in wireshark

websphere	ibm
c program files ibm websphere mq java bin i had to run this

3714591
boost	stl
boost may well use stl or other c++ standard libraries but i think your best bet is not to be biased against that but just to try including asio or whatever it is you need and see if your compiled optimized module is still small enough to meet your requirements

3714638
rpm	yum
building the rpm works fine except when i try to install the rpm on a completely clean system it yum wants to install this as a dependency

3714899
versioning	upgrade
one advantage of this multi-layer method is that you can have multiple potentially incompatible libraries of the same name but within each major versioning you can freely upgrade them since they re supposed to be compatible

3714936

what happened was that all children and the parent record was being deleted

3715423
gridview	formview

3717502
int	chars
4 is a chars which is freely convertible to int

3717508

i have microsoft .net framework 3.5 sp1 installed on my pc but when i run the app a message box advises me that i need to upgrade to this versioning of the .net framework

3718157

a quick workaround is just to create it as an int array and then convert it to a boolean array

3718157
versioning	upgrade
obviously both of these are suboptimal but if you can t upgrade to a more recent versioning of numpy they will work

3718162

come up with a serializable and deserialization function

3718201
jar	manifest.mf
i managed to do that manually via editing the nb generated jar file of the project that is its manifest.mf file + copying the resources manually but there should be a way to tell netbeans as well to mind the resources no

we tested the same pages with ie8 ie7 via compatibility mode ie6 with ietester ie7 with ietester latest google-chrome latest opera and latest safari but all would behave normally

3718376

i would like to get the mean sd + min max for each of my continuous variable but didn t succeed

3718499

3718592
free	malloc
if your program does a lot of other things you should do them before malloc or after free

3718633
google-chrome	safari
it seems google-chrome and safari do not allow the flash object to be focused because by default it has no value defined for the tabindex property and as such takes no part in the tab chain

3718802
jsf	seam
as nathan hughes mentioned if you want to use jsf then seam is probably the best choice out there and if you don t need to use jsf then grails is by far the best option that i have found

3719231
fadein	fadeout
but the problem is that when the user stay on hover it continue to loop fadein fadeout fadein fadeout..

3719283

3719330
hide	show
if it s others then show the textbox else hide it

3719372
multiplying	add
the fuzziness will be that you give each of these properties an accuracy score add or multiplying or otherwise combine the total accuracy level and accept the password if it passes some threshold

3719393
width	height
what you should be doing is changing the width and height attributes of the tag

3719394
int	double
at a guess your other code is missing the cast to double on one of the arguments and int int always returns int in java

3719410
apache	nginx
i know this is for apache mod_python but my guess would be it s the same root issue of file system encoding not being utf-8 and there is a similar fix when using nginx

3720213
inline	inlining
or the developer might assume that force-inlining a method call essentially by stripping out the call itself and replacing with copied pasted code will be worthwhile when in reality keeping the method call as-is would result in its getting inline by the compiler only when it makes sense when the benefit of inlining outweighs the growth in code size

3720220
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
if it doesn t change it s probably good you might need to browse around a bit if you ve just changed something including box model-issues or width height padding margin in general

hide	show
if you hide a lot of complexity in the function then the complexity also tends to be hidden from the query plan so if you have problems and need to tune the query later you ll generally be fixing things that show up as high cost but are in reality trivial cost compared to the udf

3720427
shadowing	named
i don t know offhand of any library way to re-parse the output of sprintf a on a union - keep in mind that the compiler and fsi have a much different task knowing scopes and dealing with namespaces and qualified named and shadowing and whatnot and even ignoring that parsing the data carried by the unions ints strings arbitrary objects etc. is potentially a whole task in itself

3720444
int	double
added special type hints for primitive arrays - # int # floats # longs # double

3720517
cvs	svn
we re a small software company that has been using cvs and svn for version control and eclipse for writing code for about 10 years

3720517
cvs	svn
cvs and svn are tightly integrated with eclipse via plugins like subclipse so any new version control system that we switch to will need to have its own plugins that live up to that standard

maven	m2e
i am able to trick m2e into putting the maven managed dependencies to libraries for the war file onto the launcher classpath when run from eclipse

3720768
jar	war
i did this by creating two dependencies for the same artifact one of the type war and one the type jar jar dependence tricks m2eclipse into doing what i want

3720768
jar	war
however the maven-assembly-plugin for the launcher fails when it cannot find the jar for the war project

3720768
jar	war	maven	m2e
after moving to maven this approach was outsmarted since m2e knows not to include the libraries that the jar depends on since they are war scoped

3720771
google-chrome	safari
webkit google-chrome safari supports html5 and css3

3720771
mouseleave	mouseenter
edit regarding hover mouseenter mouseleave

3720789

you need to compile with g++ not gcc

3721578
hash	md5
you could use a sub-string of such a hash md5 on your path previously converted to lower case so that the hash is effectively case-insensitive requires that you use a method for lower-casing which knows how to convert all utf-16 non-standard characters that may occur in the file system

3721585
implements	extends
i ve written a class that implements iterator and works fine in a foreach loop but i was just wondering if there was an extra class i had to extends or function i had to implements in order for count to work on my class to return a value i want

e.g. if the valid digits are 0 - 9 just subtract 0 modulus 10 and add 0 back.

3721703
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
ideally i d like it to be timer-based so i can also deal with multiple key presses etc but at the mo i m only able to do it using mouseup mousedown and mousemove events coz the timer makes the rubberband a pain

3721723
hide	show
i am working on a simple faq page that will show hide answers on clicked questions

3721949
dns	spf
spf is sender protection framework and entails adding to your dns a txt record that authorises other servers to send mail on behalf of your domain

3721970
cpu	processors
it might be easier to think linearly like a processors does computation not today - there is a lot of internal parallelisation for processing optimization- but the general idea of a cpu is that is apply your instructions in the order you give it

3721971
int	chars
the c standard says that the chars constants such as ã are int constants

3721971
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

3721971
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant

3721971
int	chars
numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

3721971
int	chars
if the chars type is signed on your machine it is on linux then when comando contains ã and is promoted to int it becomes a negative int whereas ã is a positive int

3722034
implements	extends
equally this approach works nicely with custom assembly probing implements by hanging off the appdomain.assemblyresolve event as well extends the app s bin folders to any plugin container folders you may have so that they get scanned

3722051
width	height
the following code will print out the width and height of the image followed by the width and height of the opaque portions of the image

unzip and copy the folder to you plugin dir then activate the plugin

3722126
bazaar	git
the version control tools i work with bazaar or git mostly have no trouble isolating changes line-by-line

3722130

3722195
ant	maven
it is easy to integrate into an ant or maven build

3722243
post	get
on a regular page it is get but on a webservice call it is a post

3722269
post	get
also to get your code formatted nicely edit your post select the code section and click the button with the ones and zeros icon just above the text area

3722444
width	height
i haven t had a need to do this myself so i m not sure if it s sufficient to just set the autoresizingmask to have flexible width and height

we have an existing tfs 2008 system and according to that the build server requires vsts 2008 to be installed in order to compile code and run automated tests

3723148
vsts	tfs
i would assume the same for tfs 2010 where vs 2010 ultimate should be installed in the build server but we are not sure whether vsts 2008 is required as well in this use case

i will have to deal with basic stuff like strings int double

3723948

even just storing a password hash with common methods like md5 is not quite save in this case

3724366

qlayout	qwidget
i looked into qt sources and found that qlayout takes sizepolicy directly from qwidget avoiding qwidgetitem

3724577
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx

3724592
put	get
once i have that info i have in the past used it to replace some known sentinel text that the web page expected me to replace as in i would put something in the html that had say where i could download the html data get it into string format then do a replace on that string replacing that text with the url of the 2x image if we re on a retina display with the appropriate scale factor or the normal sized image if not using the above code

3724655

3724701
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop has the most efficient handling for arrays

3724746
setinterval	clearinterval
i think it ll have to be some equivalent of javascript function setinterval to move the mouse and clearinterval once the button has been clicked

3724752
uiview	uiwindow	uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
but when i sandwiched a uinavigationcontroller between the uiwindow and my uiview the problem went away

3724921
width	height
if you re using photoshop to process your artwork you just need to record an action while resizing an image to 50 of its original width and height

also keep in mind that the larger resolution images should be easy to resize to half the original width and height - you should be able do divide both values by two

3724929
sorting	grouping
basically i m sorting words into grouping

3724945
maven	m2e
with m2e and the maven integration for wtp that you install from the extras you could use the wtp and start your app in debug mode

if this repositories are specified directly into a maven project pom.xml everything is just fine but not through nexus

3724953

i ve had and idea of measuring 1 normal frequency 2 current frequency 3 min 4 max

3725070
min	max
a set of metrics avg min max count could be kept per bucket at each level

3725098
serializable	deserialization
what i want to say is that if you cannot obtain image as it should be you need to search problems in serializable deserialization

3725108
salt	md5
even better salt md5 and in db you should keep also salt md5

3725111
int	boolean	int	double
jsonarray may contains any mix of objects jsonobjects other jsonarrays strings boolean int longs double null or null

3725141
implements	extends
you can use extends instead of implements in above code

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator
yet all the linq extension methods sit on ienumerable rather than ienumerator

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	idisposable
in short i have an already opened stream of results which i can convert into an appropriately idisposable ienumerator - but unfortunately all of the downstream code requires an ienumerable rather than an ienumerator even though it s only going to do one pass

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator
i can then return an ienumerator whose dispose method closes the resource - but all of the linq operations require an ienumerable

3725269
ienumerable	ienumerator
the best workaround i know of is to implement an ienumerable whose getenumerator method returns the one-and-only ienumerator and throws an error if something tries to do a getenumerator call twice

3725322
firefox	safari
i have a list and in firefox it looks like this but in safari it looks like this

3725332

3725415
int	chars
basically looking for an alternative to sprintf to convert int to chars buffer

3725461

3725546
opera	firefox
above code throws error in ie firefox and opera stating that return statement has to come in the function

3725546
google-chrome	safari
but it works shows undefined in safari and google-chrome

3725587
opera	firefox
opera ie and firefox are right to throw an error because this code is really not valid since you re not able to return unless you are in a function

3725587
google-chrome	safari
if it works in safari and google-chrome it must be because the javascript engine they use is ready to handle buggy code

3725721

at first all i was getting was touchesbegan and touchescancelled events

3725721
touchesmoved	touchesended
no touchesmoved no touchesended

if you re wrapping a networkstream in an sslstream use the networkstream.read write methods before calling authenticateasclient server and the sslstream.read write methods after

3725838
networkstream	sslstream
don t call the socket or networkstream methods then this will break the sslstream

3725838
networkstream	sslstream
it s possible to ignore these rules under certain circumstances but then you need to be really careful and precisely know what socket networkstream and sslstream do under the hood

3725873
hash	salt
i m using zend_auth with setcredentialtreatment to set the hash method and salt

3725874

3725927
for-loop	loops
when i try to trace what actually happens when i run the code it runs through the for-loop perfectly and it seems to attach the image aswell however - it runs through loops once again with the last child in my xml file so the trace output will look like this

3725978
mouseup	mousedown
if there is common functionality for both the grids mousedown and mouseup events and the button then i d suggest methodising it and calling it from their own respective handlers

3725983
width	height
i suspect that this happens because when the notes div are created dinamically the container div still has nt fixed height and width which will be set on dom ready of course and so the elements can not be absolute positioned inside it

3726010
button	checkbox
i am using uitableview and adding custom type button to the table as checkbox

3726032
superclass	subclassing
there rarely is a good reason to changing the meaning of equality in a subclassing where the superclass is already being compared

for obd-ii i would suggest bluetooth odb-ii dongle which side-stepps problem with usb host adapter

3726186
for-loop	loops
if i do all the code manualy with m 0 and m 1 - everythings work fine there are events connected to m 0 and m 1 but creating markers with for-loop with m i looks like binding event not to m 0 and after one loops m 1 but adding event to m i when i is just letter i not a value of i

3726188
hide	show
i need to show login window when application starts if login succeeds hide login window and show main app window

3726459
post	get
don t use get to send data to the server use post instead

3726463
hash	salt
so you ll have to implement your own php sha512 function load the salt for the user out of the db first hash the result and not do anything to the variable in setcredentialtreatment

3726525
avr	microcontroller
avr or other microcontroller âµc related programming is very close to the hardware filling registers shifting bit sets and so on

you can then use the built-in excel filtering and sorting tools as you need to make changes and re-publish them to the tfs server

3726590
nginx	lighttpd
for what it s worth i did eventually end up jumping ship to nginx and everything seems to work fine so my suspicion that it was lighttpd s fault rather than a buggy fcgi impl in django seems to have been well-founded

3726590
nginx	lighttpd
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

3726623
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu gnu linux 10.10

3726635

3728327
post	get
one with a get and the other with post

3728341
getter	setter
just to clarify - i was wondering if there was a better way than marking all of the parent classes getter setter as transient and then having to go back to the child classes and add getter setter and annotating those as xmlelements as well

3728342
cpu	processors
the magic of a processors is the patterns and sequences in which its pins change voltages and the internal feedback that allows the state of the cpu at one moment to contribute to its state at the next

collabnet	svn
i m using svn collabnet subversion edge and tortoise svn to manage a website being edited by multiple people

3728469
facebook	fbconnect
instead of #import fbconnect fbconnect.h then the xcode can locate the facebook sdk

3728474
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the problem is that if white block is big enough and it height is almost or even bigger than the browser window and scroll bars appear the red block is in the bottom of the page there is still gap between red div and end of the window in firefox safari opera

3728474
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
how to solve this problem and have the same page without blue gap in firefox opera safari

hex	binary
use a binary hex dump to view the text file bytes to determine whether you have a bom or not

3728501
uilabel	uitextview
when user clicks on one of the books instead of viewing the books detail booksdetailviewcontroller in a second uitable i would like the title author and summary to be in a custom view laid out in interface builder with uilabel and uitextview

3728524
decimal	ieee
in the case of an ieee double precision floating point the maximum precision that can be represented is about 20 decimal digits

3728527
robocopy	xcopy
for windows batch scripting xcopy native to windows or robocopy a free download in windows both work extremely well

3728527
filesystems	ntfs
xcopy is typically fine for your needs until you deal with sync between ntfs and fat32 filesystems - the later only has a 2 second resolution and problems with daily savings time so you occasionally run into issues a on time change day you might not get a backup of a changed file - depends on change-regularity of course or you might get a backup of all files even though none have changed b because of time resolution some files may backup even though they haven t changed

3728601
firefox	safari
this works great in safari and firefox but in ie the .ipa extension is removed and is instead replaced with .zip

3728616
int	boolean
i would like to use boolean boolean and prefer not to use int

3728666
int	chars
the value is either a primitive type value an int chars etc or a reference to an object or null

3728668
put	get
if you update the one you get from the vector you re updating the one you put into both vectors

3728728
folder	directory
in windows you can look under windows directory or mysql home folder

3728733
portrait	landscape
i can suggest you a trick that you examine the width and the length of the returned image and see if it is portrait or landscape

3728761
simplecursoradapter	listactivity
after that to set up the list view in a listactivity you can call setlistadapter and pass in a simplecursoradapter

3728762
post	get
your post get me going on

3728784
min	max
simply manipulate the min max and numberticks options to create an x-axis that is better formatted for your purposes

3728821
uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller
you would need to make your uisegmentedcontrol a peer of the uitabbarcontroller view

3728821
uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the key here is that your uisegmentedcontrol needs to not be a subview of the uitabbarcontroller view so i would create a separate uiviewcontroller subclass that owns and lays out the uisegmentedcontrol and uitabbarcontroller views

3728867
children	parent
or you would have to pass the children to the parent object as collections but then it might be just at easy to have the collections on the model to begin width so nh could fill them for you

3728894
drawrect	layoutsubviews
instead of drawing each image in drawrect just move the uiimageview to the correct position in layoutsubviews

3728908
puts	gets
with team projects whoever puts the first version tag gets to decide

3728914
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 534.3 khtml like gecko google-chrome 6.0.472.59 safari 534.3

3728951
int	boolean
i need to design my schema in informix such that querying a boolean with an int type will work

3728951
int	boolean
works if i provide either a boolean false or an int 0

3728960
versioning	upgrade
i think we ll either have to upgrade to the latest versioning of dreamweaver and stick with it forever or we ll have to find some sort of ftp collaborative editor or we ll have to implement versioning control

3728974
x86	64bit
in x86 architecture an int is 32 bits but in x64 an int is 64bit

3729041
webclient	webrequest
short of writing your own http client you re pretty much stuck with webrequest or webclient which leverages webrequest for its work

3729046
auto-generate	edmx
i have a property auto-generate from database in my edmx description

3729063
kde	gnome
both kde and gnome have one for instance

3729099
width	height
i can t get paper size working with a custom width and height in cm

3729127
disk	ram
if there will be hundreds of millions of instances in memory the savings are going to get pretty big but if that is the case you may just not have enough ram to deal with it and you may have to store this structure on disk and work with parts of it at a time

3729183
subclass	abstract-class
i have an nsarray of objects that all subclass with their different types from a more abstract-class

3729206
int	double
there s a nice example of how to use sortedarrayusingfunction to sort with int values in the answer to this question sorting an array of double or cllocationdistance values on the iphone

3729220
pascal	delphi
and finding reliable implementation in pascal delphi might be difficult too

3729301
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
if you re not a systemd daemons with elevated privileges your only consistent choice is a dot directory in the launchd user s home directory

3729326
integer	unsigned
you will therefore have to convert your output image inv back to an unsigned 8-bit integer using the function uint8 to recover the original image

3729344
width	margin
the usual cross-browser compatible way is the div wrapper with a margin then setting the width of the div to 100 inside that

3729344
width	height
this is necessary for ie6 too which doesn t support absolute edge positioning setting left and right but not width or top and bottom but not height on any element

3729345
post	get
see this blog post for the difference between load and get

3729346
kerberos	ntlm
i m pretty sure this has to do with the ntlm kerberos issues descibed in the article but i m not sure how to get around it

3729349
int	chars
the standard requires that the int value of all chars required by the standard a-z a-z 0-9 basic punctuation etc. be positive so any system using an encoding where these chars values are outside the range of signed chars must have plain chars be unsigned

3729401
uiview	subviews
i have a root uiview with two subviews

3729428
x86	64bit
as far as i am aware if the unmanaged dll is 32-bit my wrapper dll will have to be 32-bit and that will force my c# project to use the x86 platform even if i have both 32- and 64bit versions of the unmanaged dll available

3729464
serializable	deserialization
also be prepared that the actual bottleneck will be in serializable deserialization of objects passed between client and server of course if they re complicated

3729483
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox and google-chrome and in fact the correct headers are passed in firefox and google-chrome

3729483
post	get
note the new page is on a different site but i don t know why that would cause a problem with a post and not a get

3729483
post	get
my current work around is to use a get instead of a post but that s ugly and it limits us in the size of data we can pass but for now at least it works

3729526
versioning	upgrade
keeping jar separate is better as it is easy to upgrade only the specific jars to its new versioning without touching any other configuration

3729532
stdout	stderr
capture stderr from python subprocess.popen command stderr subprocess.pipe stdout subprocess.pipe

3729571
folder	directory
the problem is that the class library assembly only gets installed in the application folder directory but i also need it in the sub directory otherwise one of the windows form applications will not run

3729604
express	node.js
express is a framework much like sinatra based off of node.js

3729645
integer	unsigned
which is i believe why some languages have opted to not have unsigned integer types

3729645
width	height
so in this scenario even though width and height cannot be conceptually be negative there is no real gain in making them unsigned except for requiring some casts to get rid of warnings regarding mixing signed and unsigned types

3729655
many-to-many	one-to-many
as far as actually determining the relationship between these it s generally many-to-many with the unifying context for a useable one-to-many relationship being a class or section of a course or subject

3729676
division	modulo
the way it works is to use integer division and the modulo to extract the hh mm and ss parts of each timestamp and convert each part into seconds

3729678
hide	show
i think you could clean it up by using a little more html and then just using the js to hide show the desired bits

3729696
pop-up	dialog
i m using the jquery dialog feature to provide pop-up windows with fullcalendar

3729708
integer	unsigned
regardless of how inelegant the above unsigned cycles might look to you there s no way to avoid them entirely even if you never use unsigned integer types

3729714
google-chrome	firefox
update your js to this and it will work in ie google-chrome and firefox

3729770
children	parent
without going through and assign all of the data to its parent nodes through opject children type of scenario.

3729787
hide	show
should i hide the entire page s content put a message about needing js enabled and then hide the message and show the content with js

3729790
suppressfinalize	finalizer
if idisposable is implemented properly with a finalizer that calls dispose and no suppressfinalize the garbage collector will get to it eventually

3729793
put	get
you have the href int he anchor so all you have to do is use the jquery load function to get the linked to html and put it on your page

3729810
ubuntu	linux
i could compile using code blocks and run the code on linux ubuntu but when i ported it over to the mac and installed the boost library i can compile it using code blocks and specifying the location of the regex libraries but it won t run

3729878
width	height
you could also of course set the height and width of the containing div as well

3729894
pull	push
instead of having the worker thread push the updates to the ui thread via events consider having the ui thread pull or poll them periodically

3729934
bazaar	git
what you can do is use a distributed version control software git mercurial bazaar fossil.

3729934
pull	push
until you pull from or push to other repositories

3729934
pull	push
those are transactions push pull of changes between repositories your s a clone of your s with some special modifications a friend s repo a teammate repo a dev team repo a public repo what you want

3729934
put	get
as the organisation is free in your specific case you certainly want to have a private team repo somewhere where your teammates will get and put changes in and another public repo maybe on bitbucket.org or github.org if your choose git that will not move until you decide to push your team repo changes in the public repo

3729944
bash	zsh
no idea about zsh but bash doesnâ t know about regular expressions in paths only wildcards

3730014
folder	directory
for scripts that go in the home directory you d typically use home bin folder instead which is usually on the path

3730034
google-chrome	firefox
please for the sake of peace and everything else i already know i can make firefox or google-chrome addons

3730036
pseudo-class	visited
and that is not by far the worst problem with putting a secret token in the url it remains in the browser history it can be seen in the referer when the user leaves your site and any website the user visits can launch a brute-force or dictionary attack via the visited css pseudo-class

3730040
base	fractions
even in base 10 this notation cannot accurately represent most simple fractions

3730040
int	double
the problem with floats and double is that the vast majority of money-like numbers don t have an exact representation as a int times a power of two

3730040
integer	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
in fact the only fractions of a hundred between 0 100 and 100 100 which are significant when dealing with money because they re integer cents that can be represented exactly as an ieee-754 binary floating-point number are 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 and 1

3730167
hide	show
i have used css to hide and show the drop down menu

3730167
hide	show
i have used css to hide and show the drop down menu

3730205
min	max
all other columns or expressions used in the query other than those defined in the group by must be an expression based on an aggregation function like count sum avg min max etc... that produce a value based on a calculation which will be applied to all the rows in the pre-aggregated result set

3730205
min	max
once this is done there will be only one row per the other columns in the select statement need to have a min max would work just as well only in order to satisfy the syntacical requirement mentioned in bold italics above

3730205
min	max
in your case there will only be one non-null row in the set so taking the min or the max is necessary only because of the syntax requirement.

3730280
apache	lighttpd
i m trying to run lighttpd on ubuntu in parallel with apache but it won t startup on the ip address and server that i have specified

3730318
int	chars
digits â gives you a zero-padded chars string of your int

3730369
bash	zsh
this would work in bash and probably zsh as well

3730371
getter	setter
so you must have a getter for the company which must not return null or the next operation will fail and a setter for the address on the company object

3730371
getter	setter
the setter getter must be public

3730396
hash	salt
for our own framework pulse we decided to sign each url by generating a custom hash code on the uri which is then salt with session stored secret a long which serializable out of the box before being digested with sha-256

3730465
gridview	rowdatabound
implement the gridview s rowdatabound event and make the change in there if the user s security role is inadequate

3730599
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
however if you are going to need to vary the size of the storage you re better off using a with malloc realloc and free

3730604
strcpy	strncpy
use strncpy if at all possible or strcpy for your assignment

3730641
jstl	taglib
then i found out that i have to replace all my c taglib declarations with the new uri of java.sun.com jsp jstl core instead of java.sun.com jstl core

3730722
collabnet	svn
i have both tortoisesvn gui and the collabnet svn cli installed

3730737
jobs	cron
provided this is not a server application i would recommend breaking up the script into cron jobs

3730765
packets	multicast
udp multicast message - you can use the system.net.sockets namespace to send udp packets and build a client to listen for them which can be run of n number of remote server

3730778
feedback	review
the coder takes that feedback and does a destructive rebase on that topic branch re-pushes it rewriting the history on his github repo then the review cycle repeats until it s acceptable to merge

3730785
int	boolean
if you want to use int or long int to represent as arrays of boolean or as sets of int take a look at

3730834
put	get	post	put	post	get
there s nothing preventing you from having routes like resource id with http methods get put post delete in asp.net mvc

3730883
pop-up	dialog
you click on an icon which pop-up with the modal dialog box to allow you to add the car brand

3730897

3730905
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly in google-chrome but the keyboard shortcuts do not work in firefox

3730905
keydown	keyup
in fact in firefox it does not seem to register the events for keyup keydown at all

3730937
put	get
what do i put in my view to get the query results of my model

3730974
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my site in progress is working great so far in all browsers i ve tested to-date firefox safari google-chrome and ie8 but not in ie7 i dont know about ie6 or other browsers ..

3731028
post	put
as mark b suggests in his comment on his own post you can put this in a function and call it in the reset handler for your form

3731187
division	modulo
you want to do you want int division not modulo

3731212
int	chars
i have unsigned chars signedchars unsigned int signed int utf-8 chars and blobs that i want to populate in a single column

3731240
int	chars
the above link as well as the below link claim that for fixed length columns chars 10 or int a value of null occupies the length of the column plus 1 byte to flag whether it s null or not

3731278
hex	binary
i have a hex value that i m grabbing from a text file then i m passing it to a2b_hex to convert it to the proper binary representation

3731292
boost	stl
the easiest straightforward way is to use an stl list or maybe boost offers something appropriate

3731340
public	protected
that way you can expose the protected methods on the abstract class you want to test through public methods on the extending class that simply call through to the method on the abstract class

3731360
boost	stl
same code can be used for an stl vector which if you predict the size of your input in advance well enough will give you a performance boost

3731367
google-chrome	firefox
i only tested this in google-chrome firefox ie7

3731391
ant	maven
i use ant and maven and configure both of them to run with tests and without tests to speed up my build process

3731393
ciimage	nsimage
i am trying to convert an nsimage to a ciimage

3731400
put	get
the easiest way to do this is to put your click binding code in a separate function call it in document.ready to set up the binds and then also call it in the ajax get callback to set new binds on the new elements that have been returned

3731420
post	get
when i use jquery 1.4.2 to send a post request to my server to which the server responds by sending json data i occasionally get xhr 408 errors meaning that the server timed out while waiting for the client to finish its request and less frequently xhr 12152 errors i don t know what these signify

3731420
opera	safari
safari and opera seem fine

3731455
awt	swing
my application uses the awt so not swing

3731477
ssl	https
please note i m trying to use ssl and https

3731477
put	get
i also have used httpcfg and set the cert thumbprint to port 9307 however when i put 9307 on the service address i get connection actively refused

3731534
ciimage	nsimage
your best bet is probably to get a cgimage from the nsimage and create the ciimage from that

3731546
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb will perform very differently for example not least because myisam is non-transactional and can therefore skip a lot of consistency logic

3731608
min	max
points with the min and max x coordinate form an even closer pair than the linear

3731632
initializer	class-method
of course meta is a class but i say it is not seen as a class because it is not used as a class you don t initializer it you don t put class-method only class attributes.

3731639
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
the main problem with this solution is that it need to be allowed by the web server and either isn t installed by default apache isn t active by default lighttpd or need a specific configuration nginx

3731650
free	malloc
c resort to c functions like malloc free and cast the pointers.

3731693
zsh	tcsh
see the keychain man page for csh tcsh zsh or whatever

3731765
accessor	properties
if you re using c# and the properties is just a simple field accessor then you can use auto-implemented properties and the naming problem just disappears

3731770
rdf	owl
one option is a so-called lifting tool that converts a xml schema xsd to a rdf schema such as rdfs or owl

3731894
put	get
without this line and changing the sql the code works fine but when i put this line back i get this error

3731902
ubuntu	linux
also to note i mainly develop c# on linux with ubuntu mono and monodevelop and i haven t had any problems with it working under the mono 2.6.7 runtime

3731908
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout setinterval are the best ways to implement wait pause function in javascript

3731924
children	parent
alternatively if the relationship between children and parent isn t defined by a foreign key you can use a few simple linq queries or a helper class but the actions behind will still be to walk the collection adding the children to the parent

3731998
range	min
min mean range a3 a20

3732060
google-chrome	safari
loading css rules dynamically in webkit safari google-chrome

3732081
post	get
alternatively if i get around to changing it i ll post here also

3732105
punctuation	words
i would like to create a regular expression to match every words whitespace punctuation and special characters in a string except for specific keywords or phrases

3732155
post	get
with this code i managed to get a custom post type appearing in the admin section just fine

3732187
put	get
we can now put those two snippets together and get the hue

3732227
post	get
i ve already spent almost an entire day checking out post related to stencils in mdx but just couldn t get it to work

3732232
mouseout	mouseleave
the normal state will work as the mouseout or mouseleave

3732241
r5rs	r6rs
there is no standard multi-line comment in the scheme reports up to r5rs but r6rs has added a syntax that was widely used anyway #|...|#

3732252
spaces	delimiter
note s string of characters delimiter by white spaces or newline ie

3732261
mouse	keyboard
you may be thinking that you don t want to restrict yourself to mouse clicks don t worry there s a mouseclick event for that click includes keyboard changes as well.

3732329
google-chrome	firefox
so far this code only works correctly on firefox 3 and google-chrome

3732347
backtracking	greedy
by contrast the greedy repetition causes as much damage as possible but the backtracking fails to leave things as they were to the a stack

3732375
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the browsers i tried google-chrome firefox safari and opera appear to ignore values set using scientific notation in css

3732403
16-bit	64bit
i ve got code to get set up into 64bit mode as well as well as an assembly language editor that i specifically designed for os development search for inventor ide in that it has built-in assembling and linking of 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit code at defined addresses and file offsets

3732404
min	max
the original array itself will contain around 70 to 80 sets and the min and max values can get as high as 9999999999 so iterating through a number line in a n n+1 n+2 manner is not feasible

3732423
put	get
hey i am new to programming in c++ and i get the hang of it but i got stuck on this one simple problem i am suppose to create a shift cipher using the letters a-z and shifting them 3 places i get everything but when i do my output i get extra letters that are unneeded like i know i have to put a terminator and i did but doesn t seem to work

3732444
jquery	scriptaculous
the webapp was built using prototype scriptaculous and we typically use jquery when building our web apps

3732509
mouseleave	mouseenter
one for mouseenter and one for mouseleave

3732509
mouseleave	mouseenter	keydown	mouseleave	keydown	mouseenter
bind a keydown on mouseenter and simply .unbind it on mouseleave

3732523
punctuation	words
i am reading in the words one letter at a time stopping on appropriate punctuation or spaces

3732546
bytearrayoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
one option is to use a bytearrayoutputstream to buffer the data bytes that you ve read from the bufferedinputstream .

3732551
post	get
it is important to realize that you will have to encode the data whether you send the data through post or get

3732566
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
i have a lengthy operation o that is called through a nsinvocationoperation itself scheduled by adding it to a nsoperationqueue so that it runs asynchronously

3732571
prepare	bindparam	prepare	execute
digging through the zf code i see things like bindparam and execute and prepare

3732580
int	double
my double linked lists have a type int and a type string to hold a number and a word

3732594
direct3d	directdraw
that depends on the game and whether they are using directdraw or direct3d

3732594
direct3d	directdraw
directdraw only uses 2d surfaces thus everything is an image direct3d however is built around everything 3d thus to even draw an image you would draw a shape using vertices then apply a texture to it the texture would be the image

3732594
direct3d	directdraw
it should be noted that directdraw is old having stopped in dx7 and microsoft recommends using direct3d with textured quads to do 2d blitting

3732618
subtraction	add
but one day they forgot the leading c and the compiler choked trying to add dozens of variables between what it thought was subtraction operators

3732654
union-find	tree
i was building a metadata migration tool and i had to use topological sort for dependency resolution various forms of graph traversals for queries on metadata and a modified variation of tarjan s union-find datastructure to partition forest-like structured metadata to tree

3732656
getter	setter
you usually place these kinds of constants in a configuration object which has getter and setter in the servlet context and access them with

3732678
children	parent
you re not gonna be able to have the count of the parent comments and the children comments on the same query

3732683
union	distinct
one more thing to mention your union select s should be union all select because without the all the engine has to remove duplicates just as if you d indicated select distinct

3732701
put	get
i put the function calls on separate lines to get gdb to step over them one at a time

3732735
maven	pom.xml
from what i understand the problem here is the pom.xml file created from the 2.1-snapshot requires maven 2.2.1 but eclipse-iam does not use that version yet

3732761
textarea	textbox
examine the source to find your multi-tline textbox and you ll discover that it already is a textarea

3732812
uiview	subviews
using the example posted by brock i modified it so that it is a category of uiview instead uiviewcontroller and made it recursive so that any subviews can hopefully find the parent uiviewcontroller

3732850
try-catch	exception-handling
these will catch unhandled exception-handling as for exception-handling you are handling yourself with a try-catch block you could write a helper class to manage your exception-handling and do what you need with them

for example if i m adding an onsubmit handler to the this is much easier more straightforward when the natural submit behavior from a button is happening it s also easier with any js library tying in your functions in the right order when not set server-side when it renders is much easier when there is no client-side onclick interfering

3734460
onclick	onsubmit
you can tie into event bubbling the onsubmit set onclick events yourself to prevent any default behavior etc...just easier to deal with all around

thus making super a self .__init__ call b s constructor

3735569
super	self
i have no idea why super a self .__init__ calls b s constructor

3735620
spawn	execv
it sounds like the implementation of system or execv or whatever s being used to spawn sub-processes is passing the create_default_error_mode flag when it calls createprocess

3735642
cpu	affinity
another possibility is that the cpu affinity needs to be explicitly set

3735679

3735845
int	chars
i would suggest for starters int unsigned auto_increment primary key unique hash chars 32 and assuming 64k chars suffices text url

cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
the input formula for the above image is arg sin x+iy sin -1 sqrt 2 cos x sinh y sqrt cosh 2 y -cos 2 x link

mp3	wav
the trick is to get the decoded audio from the mp3 - if they re just short hello sounds i d store them inside the app as a wav instead of decoding them though i ve never used coreaudio or any of the other frameworks before so mp3 decoding into memory might be easy

3736269
mse	mean-square-error

pop-up	dialog
because i d like this dialog to pop-up without user interaction i m using the ready event in my jquery code

3736495

3737432
cos	sin
it s very convienent and common at least in embedded land to use a u8 value to access the table so that the index is wrapped naturally to the table size while preseving the circular nature of sin cos

3737515
integer	unsigned
if you re just working with signed or unsigned integer types it s pretty simple

3737515
floating-point	integer
in mixed floating-point and integer calculations it will convert the integer to the floating-point type perhaps losing some precision

3737518
hash	md5
this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5

3737546
cout	cin
here s a basic tutorial on cin and cout see-in out

3737547
post	get
in this situation the code above does not work because if it is placed inside a service method it sends a post request instead of a get request which of course results in a method not allowed error

3737555
cout	cin
these are exposed most simply in c++ by std cin and std cout

3737573
hide	show
i need a button that is overlayed on my page that i can show hide and dynamically position just about anywhere on my page

3737574
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in google-chrome and firefox

3737576
cout	cin
to accomplish this you could use cout cin and string

3737646
cos	sin	cos	exp
you can imagine some sort of expression tree with predefined constants arithmetical operations and perhaps algebraic roots of polynomials and transcendantal exp sin cos log etc functions

3737670
unsigned	short	int	chars
int 32bits uint16_t unsigned short int8_t signed chars

3737670
int	chars
int 16bits uint16_t unsigned int int8_t signed chars

3737690
versioning	upgrade
the technical details such as library names visual studio c# and .net versioning are all different and the problem being solved library upgrade vs new project setup is different

3737701
gif	png
just for graphics photoshop elements will do - photoshop is overkill as is the gimp - unless you re using flash for complex interactive stuff you only need to generate jpg gif animated or not and png files

3737741
width	height
draggable.helperproportions height 10 width 10

3737935
ienumerable	icollection
these can also be iterated as an icollection is an ienumerable meaning you can use linq to check for the existence of a key

3737988
portrait	landscape
an issue to watch out for is that while you can supply different layouts for portrait and landscape onupdate won t be called on a screen rotation

3738014
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in the following using firefox opera and google-chrome

3738024
int	chars
bytes can represent some chars for the same reason an int can represent a long

3738075
innodb	myisam
checksum table - this would be almost perfect for my needs except that it only works for myisam tables we use innodb

3738101
getter	setter
your getter and setter looks good.

3738103
versioning	upgrade
even though they fix things very fast it s always a pain having to wait and then upgrade to a new versioning only to find other regressions

3738134
unsigned	short
unsigned signed is just short specification for unsigned int signed int source so no you don t have variable with no data type

3738153
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
some webserver options apache nginx lighttpd

3738153
mamp	wamp
try having users install wamp mamp or zend server ce all of which are free and come with both a webserver and php

3738164
division	modulo
using modulo and division to extract the bits into a voting matrix cf m in lieu of bitwise ops only added to r recently i believe

3738167
hash	md5
what i d like to for example do is have thread procs in the class somehow so that ex i could create an md5 checksum class and have an array of these objects each on their own thread checking its hash while the ui thread is not impaired by this and another class could simply keep track of the handles and wait for multiple objects before saying complete or something

3738173
ubuntu	linux	libusb	pyusb
i have been toying around with pyusb lately and found that it works beautifully on linux ubuntu has libusb 0.1 and 1.0 as well as openusb .

3738188
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but instead of trying to detect any number of mobile browsers i d just like to see if the user is using ie firefox safari google-chrome or opera

3738220
put	get
put together some repeatable performance tests the closer you can get these to real life scenarios the better

3738222
rss	feed
my application is taking in various streams of data from social media rss and combining it into one feed on the service that i will offer to businesses

3738233
stringstream	fstream
currently i have a program that loads binary data into a stringstream and then pases the data to a fstream like so

3738243
range	minimum
the rate can vary from .5f to 2.0f though the extremes typically don t sound great so you may want to set an acceptable range .4f and a minimum rate .85f

3738244
touchesbegan	touchesended
i know how i detect this gesture touchesbegan and touchesended for example is x coordinates are distanced more than 100 pixels or something else but i really donâ t now how to animate my needs

3738244
uiview	subviews
in fact my uiview will contain subviews which are 9 uibuttons

3738387
post	get
if you manage to get any of the latter options to work please go ahead and post them as an alternative answer - i will upvote and mark them as the favored one

3738397
put	get
i found that when you get the required watir not found message in regular ruby you need to put before require watir the text require rubygems

3738424
margin	height
basically i want to take the height of ul#bar then add 80px to that number and make that #foobar s top margin

3738433
multiplying	add
find the index of the ordinal in the array add 1 and multiplying by 1024 that many times to get to bits per second

3738469
folder	directory
deleting the bin folder in the project directory doesn t help as then vc just complains that it can t find the .exe instead of recompiling

3738500
namenode	hdfs
namenode hdfs

3738561
disk	ram
the os could decide not to flush changes to that file to disk because it may think that doing so won t matter unless it needs to free up some ram

3738598
realloc	malloc
if i can t pin down a reasonable maximum i tend to use malloc and realloc to grow the array as needed

3738660
mouseover	mouseout
we want to make each of the states react to mouseover mouseout click

3738672
post	get
in the standard rest scheme the index action and the create action both have the same url recipes and only differ in that index is accessed using get and create is accessed using post

3738687
rss	feed
if i m dealing with data from an external source - for example a user has many messages - and the external source simply provides the latest few entities like an rss feed how can check for duplicates unless it either is aware of the mapper or it searches through the collection seems like an inefficient thing to do

3738694
tabs	tabpanel
if you set the width of the tabpanel to something larger it will be assuming this is not a tabpanel that allows the user to continue to add other tabs in it

3738726
put	get
since you have a lot of string literals which are constant they should get put in a read only section of your executable

3738730
hash	salt
use the returned string as a salt when building the user hash again i would use the userid or username as an input for the hash builder because they wont change like the users password or email

3738780
post	get
when accessing post with the get method the default routing send the request to the show action with the id param set to sort

3738792
int	chars
what you should do to get int values of digit chars is substract 0 instead of simple casting

3738797
width	margin
a way you can automate the width guessing is having a span that has no margin or padding add in each character for each font and size then measure the width of the span and use that

3738850
equals	tostring
where this most noticeably falls down is tostring and equals because neither of them behaves in a reasonable fashion on arrays but we cannot intercept those calls with implicit conversions because they are defined on java.lang.object

3738895
tostring	getter
your foo class has a tostring method which prints like and the val probably called the wrong getter

3738903
ddms	adt
it means you have two copies of ddms or the eclipse adt plugin running simultaneously and they re stepping on each other

3738934
children	parent
now i need to load a parent instance remove some or all children and save the changes

3738966
cells	tablecell
hi i was wondering if it was possible to merge cells using table tablecell for powerpoint like colspan in html similar to this example for excel

3739018
post	get
and you can get all the comments for a given post in the similar way namely feeds xxxxxxxx comments default where xxxxxxxx is the post id

3739023
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox google-chrome safari ie8 and ie7

3739037
gridview	rowdatabound
you probably want to use the rowdatabound event of the gridview something like this

3739047
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar java.util.date

3739085
profiler	visualvm
is there a way to remote start a cpu profiler and specify package exclusions like you can with the visualvm tool through i assume jmx

3739085
profiler	visualvm
it appears that visualvm uses some netbeans library to do the parsing of the cpu profiler

3739165
width	height
then i get reported to the console that the width is -2080177216 and the height 0

3739165
width	height
although i know that the width is actually 50 and the height 50

3739221
width	height
sets the width and height of the image

3739232
cvs	svn
i m wondering if it s possible in eclipse to continue to use both cvs for importing and updating some contributed code and at the same time use another eclipse svn module to version control my code

3739240
width	height
the size method returns an nssize a struct whose width and height members are of type float

3739260
cvs	svn
there is absolutely no problem using both the built-in cvs support and one of the two major svn plugins for different projects in the same workspace

3739260
cvs	svn
i haven t tried using svn and cvs for the same project but i believe that it should in fact be possible as long as each vcs is configured to ignore the other s metadata directories

3739300
post	get
if it was sent over post get did you escape it properly before inserting it into that query

3739316
lxml	elementtree
try elementtree or lxml

3739329
onmouseover	onmousedown
edit i did some experimentation and found that you might want to use the onmousedown event instead of the onmouseover event

3739332
png	ico
end with .js css ico giv jpg png redirect it to index.php

3739335
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know why this happens and why it works in google-chrome and firefox

3739339
gif	png
it s a rewriterule redirecting every request except requests for those file types js css icons gif jpg png graphics to index.php

3739369
getter	setter
from my point of view there is no difference between making data members public or having public properties which have getter and setter where you pass your private data members through

3739370
min	max
it selects min max interval just fine

3739372
put	get
besides he s got the basics and he s not a beginner so the best you both can do is get good guides cookbooks and programm put some goals and write code

3739374
jar	manifest.mf
instead the class-path entry in jar s meta-inf manifest.mf file will be used

3739375
width	height
if yes you can t get the width height of any component before showing the form you should use getpreferredwidth instead

3739384
getter	setter
the benefit of properties is that later on you could decide to add validation etc to the setter method or make the getter method do some calculation or caching and none of the code that already calls your property would need to change - since the class interface remained stable

3739401
cdr	cons
for example in a lisp where cons cells are used to implement singly-linked lists the car operation returns the first element of the list while cdr returns the rest of the list

3739410
getter	setter
instead of simply making the property public thus allowing public access without any verification you can use property getter and setter in c#

3739416
getter	setter
the unfortunate truth of oop is that a lot of your methods are getter and setter and properties are just a way to make this easier to write

3739422
integer	fractions
the result is an integer so the fractions part is truncated

3739426
public	protected
normally singleton classes have protected constructor and this will cause a problem because the ams needs the midlet class constructor to be public not protected nor private

3739444
phpstorm	webstorm
i recommend you to give webstorm or phpstorm from jetbrains a try

3739444
cvs	svn
it even brings ftp and svn cvs git support

3739444
phpstorm	aptana
i completely abandoned aptana in favor for phpstorm

3739452
post	put
if you want to pass a complex type then it cannot be anywhere in the uri but rather in the body of a post put request

3739522
unicorn	webrick
different servers mongrel webrick apache using various mechanisms unicorn all have different memory characteristics

3739534
apache	nginx
your apache or nginx in front of the passenger will queue requests until a passenger worker becomes available

3739577
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions as avg sum group by degrade performance

3739579
spweb	spsite
it s not an answer to your question you already found the solution yourself but you may want to put your spsite and spweb objects in a using block

3739586
put	get
if you are going to have to put a special check in there anyway with different logic when you get nan you might as well just check for 0 in the denominator up front

3739590
hash	md5
the c# key is encoded in utf8 before being hash with md5

3739602
google-chrome	firefox
aparently you can fake tables like here but i am not sure if this works in all browsers edit it works on winxp ie8 google-chrome 7 firefox

3739645
min	max
until such a time as browsers implement the calc min and max functions this isn t possible outside of scripting either server- or client- side or using a table

3739645
opera	firefox
currently and surprisingly perhaps only to me neither firefox webkit or opera support calc function not even with the various flavours of vendor prefix

3739647
pop-up	dialog
click rate - that should pop-up a normal boxy dialog but styles aren t working

3739680
centos	linux
on centos 5.3 linux i started selenium server 1.0.3 java -jar selenium-server.jar

3739710
width	height
so you might have a function called littlehouse that takes x y for the centre and w and h for width and height then you would do something like

3739737
easymock	powermockito
i found this example where they used powermockito and easymock to stub mock the menu and menuitem classes for android

3739793
restrict	shared
i assume you re running off a shared web host in which case you should watch out lots of hosts use a custom php.ini file that restrict what exec does such as preventing it from being used at all or there might be some system in-place that prevents processes spawned from exec from taking more than a couple of seconds to run which it why it might work fine from the shell but not within php s context

3739808
int	chars
internal exception org.postgresql.util.psqlexception error operator does not exist int chars varying

3739808
int	chars
caused by org.postgresql.util.psqlexception error operator does not exist int chars varying

3739900
int	chars
i want to validate the data contained by value objects before inserting into the database check that php string is smaller than 255 chars before inserting into a column of type varchar 255 or that a string is not inserted in an int 11 table column php date has the correct format etc.

3739974
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

3739974
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

3739974
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

3739974
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

3739974
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

3739984
hide	show
first of all define the view you are going to show hide it will contain the big green arrow .

3739987
put	get
note that it s a bad idea to use gets it provides no way to put a limit on how many characters get read into the buffer so if you type in more characters than will fit in the buffer you ll end up overflowing the buffer resulting in data corruption an application crash a huge security vulnerability and or any number of other unpredictable results

3739993
gentoo	ubuntu
what s interesting is that i have python 2.6.4 on karmic koala ubuntu and python 2.6.5 on gentoo

3739993
gentoo	ubuntu
on ubuntu the unicode_escape-decode result is udbb8 udc03 and on gentoo it s u u000fe003 both correctly of length 2

3740009
perforce	svn
but i agree with the earlier comments - i ve gone the other direction moving projects from svn to perforce because svn could not cut it when it came to merging

3740024
client-side	server-side
new now has xcode client-side libraries header files and objective c objects that let your apps do multi-threaded odbc using server-side drivers

3740031
free	malloc
there is a compile-time option in memcached to enable malloc free mechanism

3740031
free	malloc
why not use malloc free

3740039
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome and firefox

3740039
google-chrome	firefox
i love google-chrome and firefox

3740043
free	malloc
in many cases a malloc fill free will leave the memory mapped in unless your allocator uses mmap instead of sbrk

3740069
rubygems	bundler
usr lib rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.0.0 lib bundler shared_helpers.rb

3740074
client-side	server-side
new has xcode client-side odbc libraries header files and multi-threaded objective c objects that let your apps send sql to server-side odbc drivers and get back binary results

3740078
width	height
my imade doesnt display when the image height is less than 981pz width is less than 477pz

3740094
width	height
but if you are looking for a way in php to find the height and width of an image you can use the getimagesize function

3740105
min	max
there are settings for min max heap size settings

3740111
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the documentation doesn t show uiviewcontroller as inheriting from uinavigationcontroller

3740114
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller has a property called navigationcontroller which is an instance of a uinavigationcontroller

3740137
width	margin
for example in a fixed width center aligned layout its typical to use margin 0px auto

3740137
google-chrome	safari
on my osx machine safari and google-chrome don t exhibit this behavior with flash objects

3740155
free	malloc
you need to use malloc and free or other dynamic allocation

3740162
width	height
also you can reduce both load and processing times by optimizing the images width and height beforehand for their target use

3740202
config	ini
what you re describing in your edit is how an ini config file works

3740241
sproutcore	qooxdoo	sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i have recently been browsing frameworks such as javascriptmvc qooxdoo sproutcore and others alike which are using javascript to create desktop-like apps in the browser with minimal or none css html depending on the framework

3740245
move	drag
attempting to drag does not move the handle

3740254
clang	llvm
there are additional improvements that can be made by using the clang parser with the llvm compiler

3740254
clang	llvm
my recommendation is to use clang + llvm llvm compiler 1.5 if you can for faster build times more performant applications and much better compiler errors

3740254
clang	llvm
if you use c++ code or something else that the clang parser cannot handle right now use llvm gcc to still get the performance benefits in your compiled application

3740274
min	max	min	median	median	max
utilize the technique of doing several runs of the same scenario get rid of outliers your lowest and highest and evaluate your avg max min median values

3740300
consistency	acid
acid atomicity consistency isolation durability is a set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably

3740308
hash	md5
you can test if the pdf is fully generated by creating an md5 hash for the pdf at the time the file is first sent and then again while the email is sending and finally after it has been sent

3740308
hash	md5
here s an example on how to use md5 hash

3740308
hash	md5
you will notice that the md5 hash changes on each iteration of the function because the file is still being written

3740311
post	get
you really need to post the compilation errors to get more detailed answers

3740315
try-catch	exception-handling
i managed to overcome this by putting the loop in a try-catch block and discarding the exception-handling and everything works fine but it seems kind of dirty if i may say so

3740333
rss	feed
i want to display an rss feed user control

3740341
post	get
there is just one server where i get this error during a post back from an update panel it is supposed to populate and open a popup panel

3740348
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
that is uinavigationcontroller use pushviewcontroller to manage their stack of uiviewcontroller instances because that s how apple decided uinavigationcontroller should work

3740359
children	parent
i think i ve tried every combination of prev parent children next etc. and i m completely out of patience

3740363
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
finaly i solved the problem with a category of uinavigationcontroller just rewrite - uiviewcontroller popviewcontrolleranimated bool animated

3740366
width	height
one exception maybe i should allow width height in a predefined range for images.

3740372
rss	feed
to include your rss feed

3740384
calloc	malloc
malloc isn t guaranteed to initialize the memory it allocates - if you want the memory to be filled with 0 s then use calloc

3740416
htmlcleaner	jsoup
it s unclear what programming language you re using or are preferring but in java there s jsoup which is a pretty slick html parser api which contains among others a htmlcleaner based on a customizable whitelist of html tags and attributes unfortunately no css rules since that s completely out the scope of a html parser

3740416
htmlcleaner	jsoup
use the jsoup htmlcleaner with a configuration specified by a whitelist

3740439
outputstream	inputstream
if it s binary data use inputstream outputstream

3740482
hash	salt
as far as how long it would take someone to crack a password stored in the varying hash it s difficult to say without knowing the processing power of the attacker how long the passwords are if they employ rainbow tables how random the salt are etc

3740482
hash	md5
however if there is something wrong with the algorithm it could possibly lead to a much easier way to find the hash value or a different value that equates to the same hash called a collision as is the case of md5

3740502
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the root view controller call it crashingviewcontroller in the uinavigationcontroller configured for tab 4 is derived from uiviewcontroller and conforms to the uitableviewdatasource and uitableviewdelegate protocols to support a uitableview subview which is just a 4-row table each cell of which allowing the user to navigate to another view

3740512
ssl	https
most of my clients do not want to run their application on an https ssl protected site

3740523
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0.6

3740615
gif	png
if you do this you will be able to get the mime type from the _files array and know not only whether or not you are uploading a picture but also what type of picture you are upload png jpeg gif

3740625
int	boolean
it can t be a boolean anymore it needs to be an int according to this source code

3740646
versioning	upgrade
it might behave one way now but differently with a new compiler versioning an os upgrade on another platform at a customer s site when your boss watches on sundays or depending on the moon phase

3740647
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can use the .htaccess or put in directly in the httpd.conf file

3740670
free	malloc
also you should always free memory explicitly after calling malloc otherwise you will get memory leaks

3740672
object-pascal	delphi
no for the moment but soon check this link for more info about how develop android applications using the object-pascal language the delphi-prism programming language wich is based on the delphi language with monodroid

3740686
folder	directory
by using this you can move your folder containing all your includes anywhere you like in your directory structure and not need to worry if your includes will still work

3740698
yslow	pagespeed
the disadvantage one that i can think of is that some website performance measuring tools such as pagespeed and yslow will warn you about the number of css and javascript files referenced by a page

3740739
put	get
you could put all of the objects in the same entity group but you might get some contention if too many users are trying to modify objects in an entity group at the same time

3740767
switching	screens
a common cause for crashes when something repetitive happens eg switching between tabs screens etc is memory problems

3740774
width	height
ditch the table combine the two anchors into one remove the width and height on the img tag remove the em tag then use vertical-align to center the image

3740774
width	height
removing width and height makes images display better because browsers suck at image interpolation

3740823
post	get
to handle get and post request

3740896
mouse	keyboard
now the second the part is how to move an object on the valid path or location using mouse or keyboard

3740917
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
nsdatecomponents weekdaycomponents nscalendar currentcalendar components compflags fromdate date

3740947
getter	setter
for consistency i ve always applied comments in the form of a javadoc to all methods and classes even if they are simple getter and setter methods or very small wrapper classes

3740951
google-chrome	firefox
mozilla introduced this feature in firefox 3.6 i m not sue when webkit google-chrome did

3740982
getter	setter
also there is no need to write comments for things that are obvious like setter and getter

3740988
width	height
problem is when i set my windowstyle to none and change resizemode to no resize and run it the height and width is bigger at runtime

3740992
hide	show
then you can just show and hide the right panel to make controls appear and disappear

3741001
dwoo	smarty
modern template engines for php say dwoo or smarty can use objects as variables

3741006
stdout	stderr
if your process is stalling running but just not working then i suspect that it s blocked waiting for you to consume stdout stderr

3741006
stdout	stderr
consume stdout stderr both in separate threads and finally get the exit code

3741016
gentoo	linux
i am on gentoo linux emacs-vcs-23.2.9999 package terminal only

3741025
binutils	glibc
there s an extension to elf available at to use it you need to patch various parts linux kernel binutils glibc etc. as these changes are not integrated in the mainline yet

3741649
wgs84	utm
having said all that if what you want to do is just project a gps provided lat lon gs84 datum onto a local map covering an area 6â of latitude then you could do worse than projecting the wgs84 lat lon to a wgs84 utm projection then scaling and possibly rotating the map to fit at 2 known coordinates

packets	multicast
the wifi interface on android phones will drop multicast packets automatically to save power

post	get
to give an example of when it could be useful to use this technique rather than having two separate tables if you want to query for a user s ten most recent post regardless of whether they are wall post or shared links then it is useful to have a single table where you can get the ids for these post with a single simple query

3745577
width	height
i have a textblock of width 600 and height 80 in my wpf 4.0 application

3745637
integer	unsigned
i must be missing something because for the unsigned integer 0xfe12adcf the first example correctly gives 0xcfad12fe while the second one yields 1

3745661
int	chars
other than that it should work provided that z is a zero-terminated array of chars and m is an int or similar

i also have another file - 16x16_correct.png when i load it in the same manner both the imagesource s width and height are equal to 16 002

3745830
inherited	properties
jquery supports an extend method which mimics multiple inherited by allowing you to extend an object with the properties of as many objects as you want

3745830
inherited	properties
this only mimics multiple inherited because it essentially uses a for-loop to iterate over the properties of the other objects and attaches them to the targeted one -- if it actually provided multiple inherited you would be able to add remove modify attributes from one of the super objects and have the changes inherited by the sub object but that isn t the case

3745833
next	except
you can also click step over to execute the next line then stop or step into which will execute the next line except it will step into any functions that you used

3745867
qtreewidget	qtreeview
it might be better to use qtreeview instead of qtreewidget

3745916
jax-ws	jax-rs
totd #124 using cdi + jpa with jax-rs and jax-ws

3745930
web-inf	context-param
i usually place mine in web-inf classes applicationcontext.xml and set this as a value of the context-param

3746019
put	get
so if you want to get some informations from your methods either you wrap them into a big object here a list or you give to the method the means to put informations in your parameters

3746062
xml-rpc	json-rpc
there are so many things like soappy xml-rpc json-rpc restful web service

3746100
accessor	properties
since this is a kvc-compliant accessor kvo will wrap it when the tree controller starts observing the properties which means that sending the accessor message should be enough to trip the right notifications and cause the right side effectsâ namely updating the controller and the view

3746103
profiling	benchmarking
do it the conventional way first then profiling and benchmarking later to see where you need to optimize

3746118
getter	setter
c# properties are like getter and setter functions in java

3746136
getter	setter
is equivalent to following getter and setter in java

3746136
getter	setter
this is known as automatic property where compiler generates a backing private field and getter setter for this property

3746151
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have very little experience of javascript and have never used jquery but if all you want to do is change border colour on mouseenter and mouseleave i may be able to help you out

3746248
mouse	keyboard
everything works fine using the mouse but using the keyboard i can t bring up the context menu

3746262
profiling	instrumentation
try profiling your code with instrumentation

3746300
width	height
set the width and height properties to 16 and the stretch property to uniform

3746312
pull	push
if dom tree parsing or even traversal is the issue you should seriously consider switching to one of libxml2 s more efficient xml parsing tools xmltextreader the xml pull api or sax the xml push api

3746359
children	parent
i want to save just the parent to the database without having to load the children from the database

3746359

3746440
google-chrome	firefox
i would like this plugin to work in google-chrome firefox

3746448
x86	64bit
finally if youâ re using 3rd party assemblies that were compiled to target x86 specifically this will mostly be assemblies that wrap other c c++ assemblies like system.data.sqlite you either need to grab the 64bit versions of them as vs2010 by default compiles to x64 when using any cpu as the target or change your target to x86

3746498
ubuntu	linux	g++	gcc
i work with linux ubuntu and gcc g++

3746503
integer	unsigned
then for any array of unsigned integer elements no larger than size_t the bitop macro can access the array as a bit array

3746541
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
if you are look at using fileinputstream and fileoutputstream with inputstreamreader and outputstreamwriter wrappers respectively

3746541
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
the fileinputstream and fileoutputstream classes work with bytes and then the stream reader writers work with converting bytes to characters according to the encoding you choose

3746571
post	get
but since codeigniter only supports post and not get method it can be enabled but i m looking for way around i need to pass that variable via post to uri

3746593
slideup	slidedown
you are calling the slidedown without waiting for slideup to finish

3746609
children	parent
this is weird a cascade all-delete-orphan should cascade the delete operation from the parent to the children

3746618
post	get
so i read your post dear fred and get some ideas about binding like this

3746696
for-loop	arrays
foreach creates a copy of the arrays and therefore is not as efficient as a for-loop

3746708
post	put
just put your file inside of request.data and setup method to post

3746736
cos	sin
then you may do the following trick first calculate sin a and cos a

3746736
cos	sin
sin n+1 a sin n a cos a + cos n a sin a

3746736
cos	sin
cos n+1 a cos n a cos a - sin n a sin a

3746749
vmware	virtualbox
you need macos to run the sdk and macos generally runs only on apple computers - unless you want to run it inside vmware or virtualbox hardware virtualization must be supported by your cpu

3746779
free	malloc
also because malloc and free have their prototype there

3746795
stdout	stderr
on linux stdout in line buffered and stderr unbuffered

3746795

3746810
getter	setter
some getter setter under the domain folder under the code parent folder

3746838
button	checkbox
in the above code onclick of the button all the selected values of the check box should appear in the selectedhome td with a undo link next to to it and be invisible from the first td.onselect the undo button the checkbox should go back to the initial position.how to achieve this using jquery

3746839
post	put
the best decision that i see is to set image in maindiv with background option and just put infpanel inside maindiv but because of some technical requirements it is better to post image through just tag

3746843
int	chars
this takes care of the simple atomic case simply replace type with chars or int as appropriate

3746843
ceil	floor
in particular if we are rotating up k places then we are moving bits from k n words away in the array and the n bits can span floor k n and ceil k n locations away in the array

3746843
ceil	floor
for each word in the array the new upper n- k mod n bits will be the lower bits of floor k n words away and the new lower k mod n bits will be the upper bits of ceil k n words away

3746853
min	max
use instead returns a number between min inclusive and max non-inclusive

3746872
getter	setter
i know that you use synthesize to create setter and getter methods which makes things easier because then you don t have to write your own

3746872
getter	setter
there are certain places where you have to use self.property instead of just property in order to make use of the setter and getter methods such as in dealloc and initwithcoder

3746872
getter	setter
this tells me that these setter and getter methods are doing something else that s important besides making it easier for you to set and get a variable

3746878
punctuation	words
this still allows words to contain punctuation but it disallows both numerals and whitespace

3746878
punctuation	words
there is a problem with your usage of words boundaries - if a words can consist of punctuation then words beginning or ending on punctuation won t have a words boundary so your regular expression will miss them

3746900
accessor	properties
these lines generate an accessor that correctly calls release and retain when you want to change the mystring properties of an object

3746922
int	double
i m creating a generic class csvreader so that i can handle data of different types int double string

3746932
udp	tcp
data will normally be sent over dial-up hence udp instead of tcp but also needs to support fast ethernet

3746932
udp	tcp
it s ok to occasionally drop frames hence udp instead of tcp

3746950
getter	setter
just property in order to make use of the setter and getter methods such as

3746950
getter	setter
this tells me that these setter and getter methods are doing something

3746950
getter	setter
the difference here is that using self.propertyname specifically invokes the getter setter when used within that class where directly using propertyname doesn t - it accesses the instance variables directly

3746950
getter	setter
per carl good practice is that you use the getter setter sequence everywhere you absolutely can as that keeps you pretty safe from missing a corner case of memory management

3746973
min	max
the error is because you can t use an aggregate function count min max avg etc in the where clause without it being inside a subquery

3746983
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
then these accessor might access other properties of your class or a subclass

3747002
rubygems	bundler
usr ruby1.8.7 lib rubygems 1.8 gems bundler-1.0.0 lib bundler runtime.rb 64 in

3747029
hash	salt
my initial idea is to store a hash of the password and the salt

3747029
hash	salt
if so should the hash and salt be stored in plain text or is there a way to ensure that even they are encrypted

3747065
postgresql	mysql
in distributed environment at least the client-server centralized type database must be used e.g mysql postgresql oracle

3747112
subtract	add
it is a single place for managing the desired type and it s flexible so you can add subtract values or edit as needed

3747162
int	chars
you must also understand that you are dealing with chars which are actually int

3747185
innodb	myisam
i managed to fix this problem by changing the database engine back to myisam rather than innodb

3747203
perl	tcl
in the abstract all the common scripting languages--lua awk sh tcl ruby perl python ...--are about the same

3747207
getter	setter
letter is basically left the same as above i only made the fields private renamed thenextnode to next and added getter setter as needed

3747207
equals	tostring
the constructor tostring and equals are not relevant for computing the hashcode so they are omitted for the sake of simplicity

3747211
width	height
for an animation i d need it s width and height

3747211
width	height
actualwidth is always the max width of the window width and height properties say nan

3747245
put	get
the hashcode is not very discriminating all letter permutations get the same hash code but it should do the trick unless you usually put many permutations into the hashset

3747246
perl	tcl
many many automations can be done with what perl python tcl .

3747265
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth actualheight will give you the actual sizes of the window - given by the layout system which is based on the actual rendering of the window

3747265
width	height
width height are requested sizes and if not set explicitly they will hold their default values which is double.nan

3747301

i ve noticed that when trying to use superscript or subscript in the following way.

3747325
google-chrome	firefox
ps - i ve viewed this on google-chrome 6 and firefox 3.6.9 and it happens in both so i m assuming this is a universal problem not a browser problem

3747336
width	height
i ve fooled around with setting the height width properties of my view and even grabbing ahold of my view s parent which is the region in this case -- a contentcontrol and setting it s height width properties to no avail

3747386
pop-up	dialog
the dialog will pop-up but by the time the user selects the application will already have gone through the if statement so yup never has a chance to equal yes

3747408

3747420
uiview	subviews
i am drawing on a uiview several other subviews

3747482
google-chrome	firefox
all three using the delay would be blocked firefox and google-chrome whereas all three directly would open

3747518
unix	bsd
on unix linux mac os x free bsd etc. there are a number of ways to do this

3747556
post	get
facebok wont let you do a post to post_id likes you can only do a get request to retrieve their likes

3747570
int	chars
printf returns an int the total number of chars written so if let s say printf writes out the 25 chars then it returns 25 and your if statement is doing something like this.

3747600
accessor	properties
you need to use the properties method accessor -

3747604
textarea	textbox
you need to continue return true if he key pressed within a textarea a textbox or a password box

3747614
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
in the .net framework version 2.0 the array class implements the system.collections.generic ilist system.collections.generic icollection and system.collections.generic ienumerable generic interfaces

3747629
getter	setter
will getter and setter be created

3747629
getter	setter
now what kind of code goes into the getter and setter depends on what property attributes you define nonatomic atomic assign retain copy

3747629
getter	setter
edit to op s revised question yes a getter setter will be created for the myobject instance variable of the detailviewcontroller class

3747635
int	boolean
add_column table_name column_name type options adds a new column to the table called table_name named column_name specified to be one of the following types string text int float decimal datetime timestamp time date binary boolean

3747667
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari this works as expected but on webkit not only does it not respond to the readystate but instead it appears to fire off a repeat request to the server

3747685
portrait	landscape
i have a view controller for portrait and a view controller for landscape

3747685
portrait	landscape
the portrait view controller works fine with the scrollviewdidenddecelerating function but i did the same exact thing on the landscape view controller and it does not respond

3747717
public	protected
a common solution that can be found in the .net framework is to split a method in a public method xxx and a protected virtual method onxxx that is called by the public method

3747735
inherited	properties
i want to implement a control with a specifiable datasource properties and it would be great if i could inherited and the type of the datasource implements some sort of hierarchical interface with properties and methods ensured

3747750
int	chars
you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars

3747776
google-chrome	firefox
i was experiencing some weird behaviour in some of my javascript code but only in firefox and google-chrome

3747795
google-chrome	safari
i assume that safari and google-chrome have a similar object structure since they are both based on the webkit engine

3747795
opera	firefox
i also assume that opera generally uses properties defined by firefox ie just to be compatible with those browsers .

3747822
facebook	fbconnect
i am unclear on why the initial fbconnect is needed for the include when all the source files are under the src directory and either xcode or facebook s directions seem to be faulty as that approach fails

3747829
post	get
when handling the post request for the form you will be able to get the value of the text area like so

3747886
google-chrome	firefox
fwiw firefox 4 beta doesn t exhibit the problem only google-chrome

3747914
prepare	execute
unless you re prepare to parse the contents of routine_definition in information_schema.routines then your best bet will be to execute the procedures and read the column information from the records returned

3747920
google-chrome	firefox
the small medium fullsize text will be off to the left in ie8 or ie9 works fine in google-chrome firefox and will not be aligned with the left edge of the image

3747920
portrait	landscape
to clarify the issue arises when you transition from a landscape image to a portrait image otherwise everything works as expected

3747935
post	get
here s an example i found to get you started jquery post codeigniter validation

3747936
google-chrome	firefox

3748250
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
rmagick will not work without imagemagick or graphicsmagick installed on your system

3748290
opensuse	linux
i ve seen other posts and questions that would indicate this is a problem with windows virtual directories when deployed to iis but i m not sure what the problem is on linux using opensuse 11.3 with mono 2.6.7 and monodevelop 2.4

3748293
serializable	deserialization
i recently refactored a similar data structure due to slow performance and slow serializable deserialization times

3748297
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox it looks fine and in the standalone version it seems ok too even on google-chrome

3748300
portrait	landscape

3748326
ubuntu	debian
we were having similar panic segfault issues with apc in our saas environment across multiple versions and distros debian etch lenny ubuntu lucid and finally resolved them by switching to xcache

3748343
cpu	processors
in practice the idle task will put the processors to sleep with a hlt instruction so the cpu does know when it isn t being used

3748349
webclient	webrequest
you need to use the webrequest or webclient classes to manually download the content

3748357
width	height
whenever possible you should use a scaletransform instead of changing height and width values when animating a size change

3748386
division	modulo
instead of you can use the modulo to get the remainder from a division and instead of using a looping variable you have to set outside the slideshow function just pass which photo you want to show in as an argument.

3748393
post	get
you could also get really clever and use a post commit hook on the svn server to do this automatically for you everytime a new revision is committed

3748411
switching	screens
then at least you can switching to new view you should make sure that there is something on the screens in waiting for the xml parsing

qobject	qmetaobject
i m look for data models for editing and displaying a collection of qobject qmetaobject properties

3748415
qobject	qmetaobject
i can kind of understand why this isn t included in the qt library as it would not be possible to expose all of qmetaobject in a clean way but i m hoping i don t have to write a bunch of data models and proxy models to display the hierarchies and properties of qobject

3748416
restrict	shared
one of your processors restrict access to a page of that shared memory

3748428

3748535
webkit	gecko
i don t see the issue with using the navigator.useragent to determine if you need to cater for webkit gecko css3 prefixes

suppose i want a collection type that isn t really supported by anything in the stl or by boost like a spacial index or a fibonacci tree if i think that might be useful on my really big dataset

3748635
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i am trying to create a superclass whose __init__ takes an optional named parameter and subclassing of it which also inherited from built-in types

3748635
superclass	subclassing
it s still a little hacky by changining __new__ s signature partway through construction but it will work as long as the superclass appears in the subclassing mros before the built-in type and defining __new__ this way allows me to make subclassing which work with different built-in types without adding a separate __new__ to each one

3748648
width	height
also i found that most elements don t actually have a width or height when queried in an activities constructor so trying to transform based on those is going to give you a lot of 0- 0 movement ie none if you are animating based on element dimensions you may want to do some logging toasting to make sure you actually have a width height at the point that you create the animation

3748652
post	get
i recently upgraded django to 1.2 and am not able to get http post to work from my gwt app

client-side	server-side
the forms authentication cookie is a client-side cookie it has nothing to do with other server-side session you may have ie a shopping cart

3748809
firefox	safari
i ve read the firefox javascript logging question and hoping that there is a simple native way to do it in webkit safari

3748867
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works just the same in safari as it does in google-chrome and firefox

3748875
firefox	safari
console.log will work natively in firefox with firebug ie8+ and webkit browsers including safari

3748959
subtraction	addition
there is no difference between addition or subtraction subtraction is addition with the negated operand

3748959
subtract	add
you are correct in order to add or subtract you have to shift the number with the smaller exponent off into the bit bucket in order to perform the operation resulting in fewer significant bits for that operand

3748959
subtraction	addition	exponent	addition
if the exponent are more different than the size of the mantissa then addition or subtraction you get the number with the larger exponent as the result all the bits of the smaller number have shifted off into the bit bucket n + 0 n - 0

they re supported in some form or other by firefox with greasemonkey google-chrome opera various lesser-known browsers and with the ie7pro extension by internet explorer 7 and 8

3749063
git-rebase	undo
if you are not going to merge your working branch with or git-rebase it onto the â safeâ branchâ right away then you will probably want to undo the â œsafe changesâ â after you pop the stash the â œsafe changesâ were saved in the original stash and you probably do not want to end up with commits that make the same changes from scratch in two different branches 2

3749112

modify getgriddata to return and ensure the numeric values are added the dictionary using a numeric type such as int or double

3751204

i set my player height 225 width 400

3751445

put	get
an alternative is to put the validator on the other component the one that appears the last in the tree instead of the current component then you can get the value by uiinput#getvalue

3751564
tabcontrol	tabitem
the tabcontrol also stretched correctly if i removed the border rectangle from the tabitem

3751565

you could put it inside a div that is set to the maximum height width that you want for the image and then set overflow hidden

3751836
minimum	max	width	height
if you don t set any minimum and you set a max height and width then your image will not be distorted aspect ratio will be preserved and it will not be any larger than whichever dimension is longest and hits its max

3751853
tinyint	boolean
i use boolean but my colleague uses tinyint 1

3751861
put	get
you could put some inline assembler in your macro that called a function with a pointer to the string generated by __funcdname__ and if it looks like a member function get the this pointer in the assembler and if not just use null

3751890
tinyint	boolean
personally i would suggest use tinyint as a preference because boolean doesn t do what you think it does from the name so it makes for potentially misleading code

3751896
tinyint	boolean
i will not recommend enum or tinyint 1 as bit 1 needs only 1 bit for storing boolean value while tinyint 1 needs 8 bits

3751896
tinyint	boolean
tinyint vs enum 0 1 for boolean values in mysql

3751944
children	parent

as said by you the standard specifies that the memcpy and memmove should handle this case without problem

3751945

3752292
put	get

mkmapview	mapkit
use mapkit mkmapview object instead of a webview pointed to a google map image and use google map api to retrieve coordinates of the address

3752343
post	get
of course if you do either of the above and your form uses post rather than get as most forms do then whether you get the parameter value from the same source on the server will depend on what server-side mechanism you re using

3752343
post	get
for instance java s servletrequest#getparameter method doesn t care it looks in both the get and post data whereas with some other technologies more of a distinction is drawn

3752695
int	chars
since printf is a variadic function the value of is promoted from type chars to type int

3752695
int	chars
note that this whole example assumes that int and chars pointers have the same size and layout

3752695
int	chars
that s not guaranteed to be true everywhere see the online c standard n1256 draft section 6.2.5 paragraph 27 so you can t rely on this working everywhere the way you expect assuming i m correct in thinking that int and chars are not compatible types as defined by the standard but i could be wrong on that

rvm	bundler
you ll probably see your standard usr local bin and usr bin but that s not where rvm has bundler et al. stored

3752836
capistrano	bundler
that finally got capistrano to see bundler and start loading gems appropriately

3752849
google-chrome	firefox
the best way to prevent this flicker which can also happen in google-chrome firefox when the server connection is slow is by hiding the cãºfon text until it has been rendered

3752849
hide	show
what this does is hide the content until all your scripts have loaded and cãºfon has run then show the content

3752856
factories	presenter
if you just don t want the dependency in your presenter inject a factories interface the real implementation could do new commentforoverridegetter or whatever

despite what that warning in the manual says though versions of php after 5.1 still are affected by the 2038 bug when using mktime and strtotime

3753243
castle	common.logging
given that context support is not available yet in common.logging take a look at the context implementation in the castle project log4net implementation is here

or can i use some function to convert the chars into an int

3753339
vb.net	vb6
many of the principals and procedures were simply just grandfathered to vb.net for a comfort level and to attract vb6 and earlier programmers

3753339
vb.net	vb6
so why it is the way in vb.net 2008 and before is probably because it was that way in vb6 and earlier

3753350
width	height
anyway the article has some code sample showing you how to read width and height of files

3753376

prepare	execute
i usually prepare the dataframes with perl and write the r script in the perl modules as templates and save to a file and execute them from perl

3753618
free	malloc
had the application used malloc free it s possible that the interleaving of allocations for tests and results could have fragmented memory but with the system used there was no such risk

3753641
ubuntu	linux
i then tested the code on linux ubuntu 10.04.1 lts and the problem is still there

3753659
google-chrome	firefox

the easy way would be to start with all div s invisible then just put the querystring in switch and write out cases for all the possible modenames or get it in a big if-else structure

3753813
udp	tcp
all you need to do is make tcp udp connection and have your c++ server in place to respond to that

3753823
translation	localization
this doesn t meant that is wrong but you have to live with the fact that localization is always a compromise and that usually it is better to have 20 languages with 50 translation than having 10 languages 100 translation

hide	show
the rest you should know use an scriptmanager to execute javascript code to hide show proper divs depending of what you read from querystring

3753916
children	parent
in the admin you could even have an inline for child models that exposed the is_favourite checkbox if you only have a few children per parent otherwise the admin would have to be done from the child s side

3753920
free	malloc
so when you malloc something if your app doesn t already have a place to put that in its existing address space it asks the operating system for more but when you later free it unless that happens to be at the very end of the address space for your app you can t give it back to the operating system to make that memory area cause an error when you try to read it

it is possible to extends icarus by providing a plugin that implements ipackage but this is actually more of a generic gallio question

3754925
yslow	pagespeed
pagespeed and yslow suggest that to combine javascripts file to reduce httprequest

3754979
struts	stripes	jsf	stripes
jsf stripes and struts requires a lot what are we missing

google-chrome	firefox
the part that doesn t validate is the embed portion and it works fine without this line in google-chrome but breaks in firefox ie

3755028
jsf	stripes
not familiar with stripes jsf the only required change i can think of is changing file extension from html to jsp

what i would like is to cache it apc memcached

3755110
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome 6.0.472.62 latest and ie8 at least this behaves correctly but in firefox 3.6.9 latest both the click event and enter event register making it hard to discern between the behavior

3755123
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
that should work on ie firefox opera safari and google-chrome

3755145
getter	setter
it s the same if you set setter || getter method in the property

3755158

3755178
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this solution does use css3 the nth-child odd which limits its cross-browser friendliness though works in opera google-chrome safari and firefox on ubuntu 10.04 so for ie-friendliness you d have to explicitly add a class name to whichever column s you wanted to float right

3755215
google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed that safari and google-chrome behave the same when it comes to html and css

3755215
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however there are differences between firefox and safari and hence google-chrome as well

3755215
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
sometimes things can look great in firefox but the css misbehaves in safari and google-chrome

3755217
innodb	myisam
if the apps aren t creating new persistent tables switching from myisam to innodb and adding indexes on frequently-queried columns might help

3755220
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
because illegalaccessexception is not runtimeexception is checked exception and illegalstateexception is a runtimeexception is unchecked-exception

3755233
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
as you can see in the javadoc of the jdk the illegalstateexception is a runtimeexception which is not the case of the illegalaccessexception

it worked perfectly and my wcf service uses https via that ssl cert

3755522
linefeed	delimiter
in other words you could use delimiter such as a cr linefeed after a line of text or you could give the length of an upcoming piece of data

3755571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this means that the loading of ga.js occurs in a non-blocking way for most modern browsers and as a benefit the async true part currently supported in firefox 4+ ie10p2+ google-chrome 12+ safari 5.1+ formalizes this asynchronization

3755627
spaces	delimiter
for a delimiter format you choose a character that you will not use as a valid part of the filename or size a pipe a spaces a tab character newline etc and insert one in between the filename and size and between size and file contents

3755635
sproutcore	cappuccino
unlike some others like gwt or cappuccino sproutcore is really about using javascript directly

when you set your toload variable add the all children selector so that you don t get the parent element

3755762
getter	setter
here are the annotated classes but i trimmed away getter setter and non-id columns annotations from the javax.persistence namespace

3755783
stdio	fflush
you probably just need to fflush the stdio buffer using fflush

3755783

3755886
put	get
however when i take my code and put it into my ssrs report i get the above error

3755934
put	get
then i could put the buttons using interface builder and to get the custom graphics i just have to change the class to my new subclass

3755938
concave	convex
my first idea was to use a convex hull but my polygons are most of the time concave

3755957
getter	setter
the difference is that ivar is just a variable pointing to a location in memory whereas self.ivar calls the setter in the case of and getter for methods

3755957
getter	setter
the synthesize keyword automatically generates these getter and setter methods for you to cut down on boilerplate code

3755991

i put a blog post together on this very subject

3756138
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following page works fine in ie8 and firefox but elements of the css don t seem to be being respected in google-chrome and safari

3756140
inherited	subclassing
i have a base class that is inherited by about ten subclassing

3756164
accessor	properties
synthesize is just one of three ways of telling the compiler how the properties s accessor are implemented

3756164
accessor	superclass
my superclass will dynamically supply the accessor at run time

3756164
accessor	properties
failing to do one or more of those things for a properties will get you a warning from the compiler and probably some run-time exceptions because you never actually stated an implementation for the accessor that by declaring a properties you declared the instances would have

3756233
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
the pointer you pass to free needs to be exactly the same pointer you received from malloc or calloc or realloc not just a pointer into the region of memory that malloc returned

3756233
strdup	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
your first and third are fine because the pointer you pass to free matches the one you received from malloc via strdup

3756234
free	malloc
since trim modifies the pointer variables main passes a pointer to free that was not returned by malloc

3756255
awt	swing
i ve also used swing and awt to build graphical applications and other than the learning curve for the layout system it works really well for building applications

3756311
children	parent
you d have to add the logic to the __autoload function or an spl_autoload_register which by string comparison decides what file to load if it possibly is one of the children of your parent

3756357
hash	md5
there really is no length that will guarantee unique- if you want to make sure a string of a given length is unique you need to take a hash of the string and compare it md5 and sha1 are common algoritms people use

3756373
mongodb	bson
you might check the mongodb drivers for those languages since mongodb uses bson

3756406
short	base

perl	tcl
wikipedia reports that there are javascript perl python ruby and tcl tools that can generate apple events with the javascript osa component being best integrated and a better macruby interface coming

3756451
free	malloc
some heap allocation libraries are implemented so that when malloc allocates data the size of that data chunk is stored in the bytes just before the address that malloc returns and when you call free the bytes just in front of that pointer are used to determine what the size of that memory chunk actually is

3756451
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you pass the something that was not returned by malloc or calloc or realloc or similar then free may look in the wrong place and use whatever it finds there as the size of the chunk you are freeing -- and nothing good comes of this

my gridview are using datasets and implement filtering sorting and paging using an objectdatasource

3761229
getter	setter
you can pass a float variable from one view to another view by implementing getter and setter in the delegate class

3761229
getter	setter
so the value you to assess is set in the currentvalue by setter method and class where you want the value just use the getter method

3761231
cos	sine
anyway the only way i ve found to do it is to render lines for every 0.1 degrees around the edge which does sine and cos calculations per point and is horribly inefficient

3761263
int	chars
using the default int underlying type and chars literals as the enum values which are implicitly convertible to int is good enough

i m writing an application where quite a bit of the computational time will be devoted to performing basic linear algebra operations add multiplying multiplying by vector multiplying by scalar etc. on sparse matrices and vectors

3762016
width	height
if you know what control the graphics area was generated from you can also use the control s height and width

ie google-chrome firefox safari

3762385
createelement	each
i know i can do this using createelement etc but it seems extremely long winded to do this for each element

3762472
getter	setter
these methods will return null if the getter setter is non-public

3762490
getter	setter
note however that the getter setter may have different accessibilities

3762490
getter	setter
so you can t assume that the getter and the setter will have the same visibility

3762510
post	get
the first line suggests that a post request is expected - it can t be both post and get at the same time.

3762511
post	get
you are mixing get and post

3762517
post	get
you re sending the whole form as post so get will be empty

3762521

3762528
portrait	landscape
i would like to do this because the keyboard buttons are slightly bigger in landscape mode than portrait and i will have older users using my app

see tim heuer s post on how to get the bug filed

3762667
iboutlet	ibaction
interface builder makes a view that binds to your delegate through iboutlet and ibaction

3762676
portrait	landscape
unlike the tutorial at i would like to keep both the navigation bar and the toolbar preferably with the toolbar at the top when in portrait and not visible when in landscape so that i still have a functional back button when the ipad is in portrait orientation

3762685
post	get
i resolved it by passing the page name to the action by get or post then i use it in the result this way

3762685
getter	setter
don t forget to set the getter setter for currentpage in the action class

3762700
vim	emacs
i ve recently return to vim after several years in emacs and something i m missing is the ability to set filetype-local keybindings i want to make _ underline the current word in markdown-type files but do something completely different in say python

post	get
i m not sure why asp.net mvc is looking at them as an action get post

3762748
accessor	properties
i need to reference my view in my presenter interfaces assembly to be able to use one of my view type non-system type custom control to define a properties and accessor in my interface

3762748

3762809
width	height
you can also specify image size new image width height but i m not sure if it can help

3762859
subclass	abstract-class
if several objects share common functions you can create an abstract-class your objects could subclass

3762885
accessor	properties	getter	setter
recall that properties in .net are pretty much syntactic sugar for a specific getter and setter method structure and a backing field accessed as if the accessor were the field itself

3762885
inherited	properties
you should only need one of the two as they ll both have the inherited qualifiers given to the properties but make sure that your properties has a get or a set at all levels of the hierarchy or this will blow up

3762885
inherited	properties
now methodinfo exposes several properties regarding accessibility and inherited

3762885
getter	setter
whether the type has a base type other than object or an abstract type you specify and whether ishidebysig on the getter or setter is true

3762885
children	parent
now remember that these roots are not the ones that will be called unless their children explicitly call them using the base identifier and this can happen regardless of whether the current property hides or overrides its parent

3762887
for-loop	arrays
i would like to create and populate an arrays using a for-loop

3762909
mouseleave	mouseenter
but hover is not it s a separate shortcut method that registers a mouseenter and a mouseleave event

3762914
children	parent
also you should check the value returned by getlasterror this should indicate if its an actual error and what that error is or if the control really has no children which then might be an error in the res file or if the parent control even exists

3763043
width	height
elmonty please look how not only width but height is shorter in ie8

3763085
stdout	stderr
well it turns out that the exception handler is getting called every time but depending on the crash circumstances stdout and stderr might already be closed by the time the error handler runs which means the nslog messages won t get printed

3763206
portrait	landscape
some are portrait and some are landscape but all are known and will not change

3763221
post	get
i found this site through a post on stack overflow and i like the approach - but i use ioc repositories and decided not to try and get global.asax to communicate with the database for fear that it would be incompatible with the repository pattern

3763248
sorting	filtering
scott mitchell has a post about sorting and filtering data in the chart control here

3763295
onmousedown	onmouseup
the new control would have an isselected property that gets set to true onmousedown and false onmouseup

3763402
children	parent
in this case i think the best thing to do is list the children then get the parent from them like this

3763414
google-chrome	safari
these tests work in google-chrome and safari as well so i know webkit can do it but for some reason it s not doing it for me

3763507
short	base
as the base class exception specifier throw int float does not allow a short to be thrown the derived class cannot allow a short to be thrown

3763512
put	get
what do you get when you put in home.ctp

3763557
stateless	stateful
the usual example is where a client wants to know something from a server thus we implement a service that can provide that information given a client request it can be stateless or stateful etc

3763599
uploadify	swfupload
consider looking at uploadify or swfupload

3763602
stateless	stateful
per a request in the comments below i ll explain why i believe there should be multiple vectors of stateless cards rather than a single vector of stateful cards

3763604
hide	show
show progress bar do work with doevents hide it

3763631
getter	setter
another thing that threw me for a loop that someone might find helpful if they didn t read carefully enough about groovy to begin with like me is that groovy exposes all the properties without needing to call the getter or setter

3763648
hex	binary
it is actually the decimial representation of the number that you are testing to be a palindrome not the number itself 255 is a palendrome in hex and binary but not decimal

3763734
hide	show
the fact this show is a good sign but it also hide any errors as i think i should be authorised

3763748
hash	md5
if you just need a hash you can still use the first 12 characters from the md5 hash

3763778
post	put
i ll post a separate question regarding where to put the file

3763784
multiplying	subtract
multiplying all values in datecomponentobject2 by -1 because you want to subtract them from the first date

3763797
vb.net	vb6
you can write a dll to save in png in vb.net and then call from vb6

3763799
put	get
however - both objects must not be of the same class - that means that even if you put a __sub__ method returning notimplemented on your example above you will still get the same error python just assumes your subtract class can t subtract from subtract iobjects no matter the order

3763816
versioning	upgrade
now i upgrade versioning to 2.8.0 and problem was solved

3763852
subscript	superscript
the convention i ve seen is that just as a caret indicates superscript as for exponentiation an underscore indicates subscript

3763885
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
in the case of wpf you d use built-in classes in system.windows.media.imaging which handle the most common formats natively bmp jpeg png gif tiff wmp

3763919
fast-forward	merge
if it s a fast-forward or empty merge then git diff --cached should be empty given that it was empty before the merge

3763975
ubuntu	linux
install vmware ubuntu on the windows xp developer boxes and run linux on it

3763980
set	bag
to prevent this problem you must use a bidirectional association with the many valued end the set or bag marked as

3763984
qframe	qwidget
select qframe d in the object inspector window and cut it right click qwidget and break the layout ctrl-0 then paste

3764007
folder	directory
i created a windows service that watches a directory using filesystemwatcher and when a file is put into the folder it zips it

3764048
sorting	grouping
if you re not suppressing grouping you could also try groupnumber+3 as your formula but that can get confusing when you factor in sorting suppression etc

3764078
http.sys	httplistener
look at the various examples online about using the httplistener host for usingthe http.sys integration

3764082
post	get
3 if you have a separate page you wish to post to that you don t control that s not asp.net-based another site s form or a php asp3.0 site you run things get significantly more difficult

3764082
submit	submission
since tags cannot reliably be embedded within each other in html you will either have to do a silent post manually from your codebehind or use javascript to quietly submit an ajax request upon submission

3764152
rss	feed
i think i want to do something like this but currently i am using wordpress out-of-the-box rss feed

3764168
folder	directory
i haven t tried simply putting the whole folder in there but that seems like an ugly hack and i m not sure if there are other files in the java install that need to be put in system directory

3764173
width	height
using aspect_ration float width height opengl computes the view angle in the x-dimension

3764182

3764235
devise	cancan
i have devise and cancan and i want to access these roles

3764302

if createfile returns invalid_handle_value then you should determine what getlasterror returns in your particular situation pending delete and loop back to createfile based on that error code only

3764313
jar	war
anyway if you succeed you could package those in a jar or war and deploy that as a contained application

3764417
children	parent
i want to find all parent and their children with conditions on the children only

3764417
children	parent
but if the parent has no children that match that criteria i still want the parent

however this doesn t return parent that have no matching children

3764417
children	parent
i want all parent and only the children of those parent that match my condition

3764439
post	get
this is what i use to send post to any url and get results

3764440
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ended up using contenteditable but only for ie - i m still using readonly for firefox and safari google-chrome because contenteditable seemed to not work for those browsers

3764459
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
then i use this date parser to parse it see below but it only works in google-chrome 6.0.4 firefox 3.6.8 but not safari 5.0.2 --- i get nan errors

maybe i misunderstood the question but i changed onclick to onfocus and it seemed to work fine

3764531
jar	manifest.mf
open the jar file with any archiver go to meta-inf manifest.mf and edit it

3764548
union	distinct
caveat some versions of oracle would implicitly sort data in ascending order if certain operations were used such as distinct union minus intersect or group by

3764581
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
i d like the functionality of an aggregate-functions to choose a food but none of the built-in aggregates sum max min etc. really applies to the situation

3764609
mouseover	mouseout
i handle the mouseover mouseout events over the rows of the grid in a couple methods in javascript to change the mouse cursor to the pointer and back to the default as they mouse over rows

3764637
toolchain	binutils
if greenhills is using gnu toolchain with binutils and allows customizing the linker script then you can add into an application namespace a variable using provide to mark the end of the 128k block

3764767
lisp	smalltalk
it depends on the system you develop with when using smalltalk or lisp i d say none

3764908
put	get
but i can t put in place a solution that can hide the id in a table cell and when the user clicks on that cell i can get the hidden id and then call the delete.php script

3764942
facade	mediator
the mediator and or facade pattern come to my mind here

3764969
hide	show
the like button coded to show recommend is 84px wide and the like button is 44px will save some time for you css guys like me who need to hide how unpopular my page currently is

3764976
adc	uart
it does not have access to a real-time clock but it does have access to an adc and a uart

3764976
adc	uart
i found another way to solve my problem so in a way my question was a moot point but i am still looking for guidance on specific software solutions to gather entropy from low-entropy sources like least-significant bits of the adc and system timing for receiving uart characters

3764979
post	get
if the user did a post they d get 5 points if the user submitted a thread topic they d get 20 points and so on and the ranks would be like if the points are over m and lower then mx they d be the r rank and so on

3765007
processors	hyperthreading
while it used to be that one could estimate the performance of a piece of code by examining the machine code produced and totaling up the number of cycles required for the various instructions new hyperthreading processors throw such computations out the window

3765014
mp3	flac
i have a large music collection composed of mp3 files flac files and others

3765023
fgets	strtok	fgets	atoi	atoi	strtok
however if that s not the case using fgets strtok and atoi will do most of the job but i still need to identify two whitespaces in a row

3765065
daemons	launchd
edit the double-fork method described down here by mike would be the proper way to launchd a daemons a long-running process which won t communicate per stdio

3765121
getter	setter
if the child needs access to many member variables that you wouldn t otherwise expose via getter setter or many member functions that would otherwise be private then the inner class arrangement will be cleaner

3765122
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
however has single quotes within it when it contains a link generated by the html.actionlink helper in asp.net asp.net-mvc

3765126
vim	emacs

google-chrome	safari
talk about developing for yesterday s technology ie6 doesn t support the range of features that other browsers such as mozilla google-chrome and safari do

3765174
post	get
first off i think it should be a post event and not a get and the data you are sending is a single string when the code behind method will be expecting two parameters

3765176
realloc	malloc
i use malloc to create the first 2 dimensions and realloc when i want to add new items

3765183
realloc	malloc
it is absolutely necessary to call realloc to resize a memory block obtained by malloc

3765204
hide	show
however i can t seem to add javascript inside the serverfbml tags which means there s no way to programmatically show or hide it

3765264
jar	war
class not found sounds like the war exploded or not doesn t contain the scala jar or possibly the lift jars

3765300
min	max
max ax bx max ay by min ax + aw bx + bw - max ax bx min ay + ah by + bh - max ay by

3765301
width	height
in your case you know that the taskbar fits exactly on one of the sides of the screen rectangle so the best way is indeed figuring out which side it is and subtracting the width height from that side

3765349
keydown	keyup
anything character-related you may infer from the keycode property of keydown or keyup events is unreliable and dependent on a particular keyboard mapping

3765367
inline	inlining
i believe that inline is conveyed via .net metadata actually means that the information about inlining is stored in some binary format in .net resources

3765395
portrait	landscape
this only happens in landscape not portrait

3765408

in all other browsers -msie google-chrome safari etc- you would only see nothing-saying empty squares

3765851
inherited	properties
even if smart obfuscation does not catch every one of your scenarios it is very easy to define custom rules to exclude properties of certain types or inherited hierarchies by using custom exclusion rules including matching types by regex patterns

3765856
getter	setter
the property generates public getter and setter method already

3765997

i have uiview with a uiviewtablecontroller added as subviews my device starts in landscape mode but tableviewcontroller is always in the portrait mode

3766431

3766442
datarow	dataadapter
you could event modify the code a bit and use a dataadapter to fill a datatable and then you could create a constructor that accepts datarow as argument so you can instantiate classes with different number of elements

comparator	comparable
note it is good practice for a class that implements comparable to declare the semantics of it s comparator method in the javadocs

3767129
junit	testng
i have read some comparisons of junit and testng and it looks like testng has more configuration options

3767158
testng	unitils
combination of testng and unitils is unbeatable..it would suffice all your requirements

3767184
uiview	subviews
the layer i want to animation is a uiview with uiimageviews as subviews

3767196
post	get
admittedly this technically violates the recommendations for the use of post which should only be for operations that change information rather than get which should be used when asking for information

3767201
int	double
to avoid duplication of code in the algorithm if it is a lot of code you could produce an abstract class called something like doublealgorithm with abstract methods like double getelement int i int j and handleresult double result and then write very small subclasses of this one for each primitive type

3767201
int	double
as thilo has pointed out it isn t safe to do all algorithms with just treating int longs as double but for a number it will be good enough

3767225
width	height
enumset is a good choice when you re naturally dealing with just options - but if you have multiple values height and width

3767276
put	get
i don t plan to save the thing i get to a db or anything it s just getting put into an email and sent off but i want to verify these things before it s sent

3767306
junit	testng
testng may have a few different features but junit has also evolved with features like annotations alternative matchers etc

3767323
post	put
if you do post you can put the filename in a hidden field and extract it in the handler

a good approach in these sort of situations is to use -keep-generated-actionscript for two projects one with the mxml approach and one with the actionscript approach

3767423
mxmlc	compc
the mxmlc is different to the compc compiler in behaviour for many valid reasons

3767429
put	get
in my popup.html in my chrome extension i have a button that will get the selected text in de webpage and put it in my textarea in the popup.html

3767442
int	chars
in this respect there is no difference between an int and chars or unsigned chars

3767442
int	chars
my guess is that the difference lies in the strict aliasing rules between int and chars - even though the programmer doesn t actually do anything wrong the compiler is forced to do a logical type cast for the array which it shouldn t do

3767442
int	chars
as jens gustedt said it looks more like a way to enable strict bounds checks not a real issue with the int or chars

3767460
post	put
put simply i need the simplest most straightforward way to make a facebook wall post from within a facebook product page tab whether using fmbl fbjs actionscript 3 asp or any combination thereof

3767547

the checked term will be the parent and any new ones can be added later on as children

3767578
dlsym	dlopen
the invocations dlopen - dlsym - dlclose are occur during my program execution in the loop

3767620
stdout	fflush
yes after using printf you have to do fflush stdout

3767636
gridview	rowdatabound
i have done this by writing the following code in rowdatabound event in gridview

3767637
min	max
in braces there is min and max char count

3767643
junit	testng
junit and testng are both quite similar and once you know one of them it is easy to pick up the other

3767654
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller and inside the first tab a uinavigationcontroller

3767668

actually there is only one or two persistent instances per thread session that should be present at all times for referencing them from other transient entities before saving

3767676
installation	upgrade
upgrade to the latest rvm installation

3767729
post	get
the type parameter sets the http method used it is most commonly set to either get which is the default value which appends any data being sent to the url or post which appends any data being sent to the request header

3767779
int	chars	int	double
9 means the number of elements of type t between a 9 and a 0 where t is chars int double respectively in that order

3767824
width	height
then in refreshlayouts you change yourself the width height like you want

3767861
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
additionally uiviewcontroller is itself a subclass of uiresponder which contains functionality for handling touch events touchesbegan withevent touchesmoved withevent touchesended withevent

3767970
queue	fifo
why don t you consider using a queue it s fifo store delegates in queue and when you call dequeue it will call your methods in a specified manner

3767974
many-to-many	many-to-one
every entity gets a relation and every many-to-many relationship gets a relation while many-to-one relationships get a foreign key in one of the entity relations

3768157
width	height
this- movewindow xposinscreen yposinscreen width height

3768221
redmine	trac
trac does a pretty good job also redmine - you can turn all the other features off on both of them

cifs	smb
configuring samba smb cifs

3768333
cifs	smb
smb samba cifs client configuration

3768346
client-side	server-side
note that if you use mqausx to validate a user id and password either use ssl encryption with it or use both the client-side and server-side versions of the exit

3768419
onclick	onchange
add onclick or onchange to show report dinamically

3768432
width	height
your silverlight object should occupy 100 of the browser height and width unless you are reserving space for other html elements

3768476
post	get
one of our most common error situations in a web application is that a user executes a get request where the form should have submitted a post

3768517
maven	cobertura
i m using maven cobertura plugin to report code coverage in my multimodule project

3768542
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome but not in firefox ie etc

3768549
domxpath	domdocument
using domdocument and domxpath is the most correct way to access those attributes

3768554
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

3768561
post	get
wrong the most obvious reason why you get a get instead of a post is that because you re doing a get instead of a post

3768561
post	get
the html standard specifies that the default method is get so if you want to post you must specify method post explicitly

3768587
opera	firefox
you need to use ogv for firefox and opera

3768596
filtering	grouping
i suggest editing the filtering on the grouping of col3 - as follows

3768596
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
in the grouping and sorting properties dialog select the filtering tab

3768596
sorting	grouping
click ok on the grouping and sorting properties dialog and then click ok on the matrix properties dialog

3768635
post	get
as you said your problem is intermittent so having a problem in form method set as get instead of post can be overruled but yes you are right that if user presses enter in address bar it would be a get request and back button request always depends upon the last request made if it was a post then any good browser will prompt you about resubmission and if it was get then no prompt page will be bought back may be from cache

3768635
post	get
and also get is always supposed to retrieve information so if browser is missing something or need something it will be a get but again check in iis log for those get requests and try them in browser if they contains query string for viewstate and eventvalidation then they are really mis-formed request from post to get if form method is not explicitly set to get

3768639
bsearch	strcmp
signature lookup tables can then be easily built using bsearch and strcmp

3768704
inherited	properties
avoid using inherited just to reuse some properties inherited should be used to add polymorphic behaviour to your classes

3768716
ubuntu	debian
the timeout package from ubuntu debian can be made to compile on mac and it works

3768721
junit	testng
testng was written to overcome some perceived limitations of junit 3

3768721
junit	testng
note that some of the limitations of junit 3 were by design and testng deliberately allows you to do things that the designers of junit expressly prevented

3768721
junit	testng
the biggest advantage testng had over junit 3 was that it allowed you to use annotations to define your tests rather than forcing you to extend the junit base classes

3768721
junit	testng
the biggest remaining difference between testng and junit is that testng allows your tests to be dependent on one another and allows you to express those dependencies through the test annotations

3768721
junit	testng
there are other differences too of course â testng defaults to assertequals actual expected message whereas junit is assertequals message expected actual â but this is the biggest

3768791
superclass	subclassing
i need to have a configurable file somewhere within the source for setting price constants that are to be accessed from multiple subclassing of a superclass

3768794
decimal	ieee
according to ieee 754 floats were always binary only the new standard ieee 754r defined decimal formats

3768813
ubuntu	debian
the timeout command from ubuntu debian when compiled from source to work on the mac

3768844
onreadystatechange	onload
it s pretty easy internet explorer will trigger an onreadystatechange event while others will trigger a onload event for the script object

3768863
integer	fractions
the integer part gets the priority and fractions part is as close as the type size

3768885
free	malloc
anyways this part of the coreaudio api is more c-ish than objective-c-ish so you d use malloc free instead of alloc release

3768885
free	malloc
you still need to malloc the actual mdata member of the audiobuffer but at least you don t need to worry about free ing the actual audiobufferlist itself

3768906
multiplying	add
now what i need is to add a 4th column unit price which is calculated by multiplying area and rate per sqm

3768907
jpql	hql
this is what i want to do in hql or jpql how to get the list of objects where properties of the object were id name gradename class

3768929
superclass	subclassing
putting them as static constants in the superclass means you have to recompile every subclassing everytime you modify one of the values

3768936
mouse	keyboard
but yes flex should work on touch screens and traditional screens with a mouse and keyboard

3768959
folder	directory
obviously to avoid losing data the original folder needs to be left alone but that breaks the association between the directory and the node

3768978
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie firefox and opera fire load on every src set even if the src is not changed whereas webkit google-chrome safari only ever fires it on the initial image load

3768985
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works correctly in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

3768991
typedef	struct
note how i use separate names for the typedef and struct tags to make it a bit clearer

3769048
stdout	stderr
i need a way to pass data from a shell function running in the interactive shellâ that will not mix with data created by other functions so i cannot use stdout or stderr

3769062
filesystems	ntfs
while on ntfs an many other filesystems the maximum number of files can go far beyond that

3769063
width	height
these will work in most capable browsers but not ie and would allow you to write css that only kicks in when the browser is of a certain width height and much more

3769095
inherited	properties
the inherited works fine i see the properties of the base class in my child class my problem occurs when i try to call a method from the service and pass the childtype as a parameter and not the basetype

3769123
jpql	hql
then of course you would not be using hql but jpql instead

3769127
rss	feed
i am displaying rss feed in my table view

3769148
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve try to do this with - void viewwillappear bool animated and - void viewdidload

3769230
factors	mean
i mean there are a lot of human factors for a language to be used

3769237
put	get
i want to get my hand of the clock to rotate 360degrees over 10 seconds but the tricky part is that i want to make it rotate not on the origin at topleft of the clockhand imageview put at a point 20 20 of the clockhand imageview

3769254
centos	linux
we build software running on linux servers centos

3769334
postgresql	mysql
use postgresql i would recommend this to anyone using mysql anyway

3769379
children	parent
use .children to get immediate children instead of .find which looks everywhere below on the parent for example

3769380
post	put
my problem the only way to put variables into post seems to be input elements in a form

3769405
cpu	processors
basically i need to determine the cpu utilization so that if it is high i can instead divert a new process to another controller in the system rather than executing on the main processors which could be busy doing a more important process

3769449
versioning	upgrade
we had to scramble a bit when doing a major versioning upgrade last year when we found that oracle 10 returned group by results in a different order than did oracle 9

3769485
sdl	freeglut
in my configure.ac it looks like this it worked like this for sdl so i just replaced some potions and hoped it works for freeglut as well but it does not

3769503
xslt	xquery
i don t know xquery well-enough to express this xslt solution in xquery but i think just providing it may be helpful

3769505
ant	maven
with netbeans your java project will be either maven or ant based

3769505
maven	pom.xml
for maven you can add the following lines to your pom.xml to accomlish that

3769543
min	max
when using aggregate functions ie min max count the non-aggregated column should be listed in the group by clause

3769553
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
split it like you do right now then loops the resulting arrays and join them all up using a standard for-loop

3769560
post	get
if you re using jquery you could get the entire html of the page using and send that with an ajax post

3769581
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

3769592
opera	firefox
webkit based browsers firefox and opera support what you need

3769623
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

3769631
chown	chmod
attempts to use chown and chmod even as root failed i don t recall the error

3769698
google-chrome	firefox
i am experiencing this issue with ie7 but not in google-chrome or firefox

3769793
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer

3769796
getter	setter
to do that annotate your annotation with one ore more annotations from scala.annotation.target getter setter or as in your case field

3769824
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy is like xcopy but with a much richer set of options

3769836
poe	anyevent
you might consider things such as parallel forkmanager poe or anyevent

3769881
iprincipal	iidentity
nerddinner implements iidentity instead of iprincipal

3769883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie11 and safari work firefox works with some bugs but nightly has fixed them

3769895
rss	feed
it depends on the webservice that provides you the rss feed

3769895
rss	feed
you can also put the loading and parsing rss feed in thread this will boost your performance

3769907
serializable	deserialization
the classes that inherit from tracksection are a lot simpler and i would be happy for all their fields to be serializable automatically but i assume that since the base class is iserializable they probably need to do it manually as well i have added the deserialization constructor and call the base class s deserialization constructor in each

3769908
google-chrome	firefox
so now when i call this function it responds in google-chrome firefox and the modern browsers but not internet explorer

3769915
google-chrome	firefox
works great in google-chrome and firefox

3769981
min	max
you can set in print.summary.formula.reverse to get the mean and standard deviation but there s no way to get the min or max

3769997
google-chrome	firefox
here s a working example works better in google-chrome than firefox - if you need any other browsers supported then you ll need a javascript solution

3770009
background-color	transparency
on your set the background-color transparency

3770013
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

3770150
terminate	timeout
the direct url session works for 10 minutes after that the session is terminate expired timeout and then use must login again and may get the same session id but after 10 minutes use won t be able to browse with the same session

3770207
width	height
your ratio property should actually be a method if you want it to change based on changes to width and height

3770207
width	height
also you probably want to refer to this.width and this.height instead of width and height in the resize method

3770221
width	height
alternately if width and height aren t going to change just calculate it afterward

3770253
width	height
then just size it down to a single pixel width or height

3770264
jsf	spring-webflow
spring-webflow jsf intgration war example file from spring site is not working in glassfishv3 server

3770296
put	get
you still could get it via viewdata id if you put it inside viewdata in the controller but if you do this you might as well put it in the model

3770308
int	double
note that the java 8 version works for int long and double but not for byte as arrays.stream only has overloads for or a generic object

3770315
qitemdelegate	qwidget	inherited	subclassing
you could implement your own setupdatesenabled bool for your qitemdelegate subclassing since it does not inherited qwidget and does not have one by testing a flag before executing your original paint or update

3770329
width	margin
i ve tried using various css hacks for this ie s box model double margin etc but i can t figure out where the problem is except that it seems that ie tries to render the contents of the page to the width of the window overriding the widths defined judging by the way background images are cut short even though their div tags have defined min-width s

3770360
ant	maven
if you re using sane build tools maven gradle or properly-configured ant then you can put the java interface in your clojure project and the cross-language dependency will be taken care of

3770392
ssl	https
if you send the file via email be sure to use secured connexions https imap or pop3 over ssl smtp over ssl on both sending and receiving computers and have the file encrypted prior sending

3770524
hash	md5
many cryptographic hash functions such as md5 and sha-1 use the merkleâ damgã rd construction in which there is a computation to compress a block of data into a fixed size and then combine that with a fixed size value from the previous block or an initialization vector for the first block

3770536
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
i use an nsoperation for the purpose of instantiating the connection and receiving incoming data through the nsurlconnection delegates but as soon as new data comes in and gets parsed i offload the processing of the message to the dedicated nsthread

3770542
sudo	passwd
so you will need to study that create some wrapper scripts which will be able to receive parameters from php to know what to do get the username and passwd of the new user etc... elevate their privileges hint look at sudo or suid and then run your command.

3770546
decltype	auto
c++0x will change the meaning of auto and add a new keyword decltype that lets you do things like this

3770546
g++	gcc
if you re using gcc g++ you might also look into using its typeof operator which is quite similar has a subtle difference when dealing with references

3770595
folder	dir
but of course if you do dir c the table will be filled with all the files and folder from that command

3770604
multiplying	add
so getting the checksum of a zero-padded message is just a matter of multiplying the checksum polynomial of the non-padded message with some other polynomial that only depends on the number of zeros you want to add

3770607
allocator	stl
for a heavy stl application if you re doing multi-threading there is the hoard allocator or the tbb intel version

3770630
libjpeg	libpng
if possible could you also provide the names of the corresponding routines in libpng libjpeg boost gil io

3770671
int	chars
you request two chars then an int

3770671
int	chars
now you free the two chars then request a new integer- but that int can t fit in the space of the two chars

3770700
try-catch	exception-handling
i m currently wrapping the whole onpaint code in a try-catch and was able to debug the code but i found it quite tedious so i wondered if there is a way to break into debugger from a gui thread exception-handling

3770736
inherited	properties
now you d have the properties methods from both a and b but you don t really have inherited since any changes to the prototype object of b will not propagate to c

3770761
min	max
lets say we have a simple model that stores two integers the min and the max

3770774
lisp	scheme
2 others heavily favored lisp common lisp scheme and clojure

3770774
lisp	scheme
from what i gather both common lisp and scheme have excellent introductory material on lisp and the reasoned schemer sicp

3770774
lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	lisp	agda	agda	prolog	scheme	prolog
it looks like a lisp scheme clojure prolog or a proof assistant like coq or agda are the main langauages being recommended

3770804
vim	emacs
i d like to be able to set multiple marks in emacs like vim does

3770831
wordpress	joomla
wordpress is not a true cms like drupal or joomla

3770841
jobs	cron
just when i thought i was understanding cron jobs i realize i m still not understanding

3770882
portrait	landscape
are referring to number of cells it can occupy in landscape and portrait

3770883
integer	unsigned
but really vector size_type will be some very large unsigned integer type so a conversion from id to vector size_type will always be safe but not the other way round

3770897
post	get
specifically i have a view where i set html.textbox to a value both in the get and the post

3770897
post	get
it sets fine in the get but after the user submits a value during the post i have the class change one of the values internally based on the other value submitted

3770906
uiview	subviews
do i have to create a uiview in cellforrowatindexpath with the height of the tablecellbg.png and then add the custom uitableviewcell as subviews to the created uiview with a less higher height

3770917
subtract	add
add or subtract some parameterized random value say -2 to 2

3770917
min	max
clamp the values at min and max overall values say -5 and 20

3770917
min	max
you can play with how much the height changes per node and the min max overall values to get more or less land - ocean s and continents vs archipelago s etc

3770919
lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
as other posters have suggested prolog and lisp scheme are nice even though both are dynamically typed

3770937
lambda	first-class-functions
it has lambda first-class-functions and many functionally-inspired compositions on iterators maps folds zips...

3770949
spaces	delimiter
i have a string of spaces delimiter numbers like

3770950
haskell	agda
another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me

3770970
ant	maven
actually maven allows to run ant targets using maven-ant plugin but i d like to perform such profiling without ant

3771011
ssl	https
to do ssl with asihttprequest you just need to pass a https url instead of a http one

3771032
serializable	deserialization
xmldictionarywriter is an abstract class used for serializable and deserialization of objects to and from xml

3771045
google-chrome	firefox
how do you achieve the help check for updates system that google-chrome firefox dozens of other applications use to make staying current less painful

3771062
allocator	stl
memory allocator like in libc actually handle the problem of a lot of small allocator which is typical for std string for instance in my server application there are lots of stl strings but as i see from running info heap they are not causing any problems

3771103
serializable	deserialization
however the serializable deserialization totally sidesteps the httpsession listener events so i do not have the opportunity to gracefully put the deserialized reference to the sessiondata back in my managed set of objects after the restart

3771142
maven	pom.xml
this modification can be done by simply modifying the pom.xml versions or it can be managed by the maven release plugin or also with the maven version plugin

3771145
disk	ram
your data patterns of the other keys shows that you have lots of disk ram space tied up in non-pk keys

3771145
innodb	myisam
side note innodb myisam engines does not automatically update table cardinality for non-unique columns the dba needs to manually run analyze table periodically to ensure its accuracy

3771186
put	get
if i comment all repositories and put a funny value 2.7.9 for the scala version in the sbt.boot.properties i do get like the op did

3771246
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
if the work could be encapsulated in an nsinvocation you can use an nsinvocationoperation and avoid an nsoperation subclass

3771256
hash	md5
the issue is if you enforce fips validated cryptography in the windows security policy settings an exception will be thrown because radius protocol uses the md5 algorithm to hash the request authenticator

3771272
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.6+ and google-chrome at least version 6 possibly older versions support the file api which lets you read local files from a file input

3771289
extjs	sproutcore
1 there are a bunch of libraries available for developing these applications sproutcore extjs etc

3771305

if you really want to put it in the resources like that you can get it out of the resources in the code behind loaded method or in the constructor after the initializecomponent call

3771307
udp	tcp
data are sent between two linux computers using udp and tcp protocols

3771314
google-chrome	firefox
the banner runs fine in google-chrome firefox ie7 and 8

3771408
udp	tcp
this actually happens more commonly with tcp connections but i see no reason udp can t have this problem as well

3771477
haskell	agda
coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itself

3771522
memcpy	strncpy
the reason that memcpy works and strncpy doesn t is because you actually passed a sensible length parameter to memcpy but totally forgot to make this parameter make any sense to strncpy

3771523
memcpy	strncpy
it s pure fluke that you ve passed the right length when using memcpy and the wrong length when using strncpy

3771523
memcpy	strncpy
memcpy would also not work if passed sizeof temp as the length and strncpy would work if passed the right length

3771527
oncreate	onstart
android start video recording upon starting an activity without using buttons ie when the activity starts video recording also should start without using any other component its working with buttons i tried putting video calling functions in oncreate onstart etc

3771543
inherited	subclassing
subclassing of dynamicobject would fail to inherited the somemethod function

3771553
keydown	keyup
you ll likely want to use keypress instead of keyup or keydown as those won t be called for subsequent characters if someone holds a key down

3771556
sorting	filtering
i suppose this problem also applies to sorting as well as filtering in the sense that if a collectionviewsource is based on sorting then when a property of an item that is used in the sort changes the sort order of the collection should reflect this as well

3771558
button	checkbox
i would have to say that because the checkbox list renders individual html checkbox that are not groupable like radio button the selected property needs to be evaluated on a item by item basis

3771645
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works fine in firefox safari google-chrome and opera but ie8 still aligns the main div to the left

3771653
public	protected
make alpha abstract and do what you like with the constructor so long as it s visible to beta public or protected is fine

3771657
width	margin
futhermore get rid of the width 100 on the first div and body must have padding 0 and margin 0

3771683
perl	tcl
we make use of test more for testing perl modules and have made a little use of selenium for web pages but we have never had any kind of automatic test rig for our tcl tk scripts

3771717
background-color	transparency
here is the problem i want to create reactive zones on a image using transparency div but the following code doesn t work on ie tested on chrome the background-color of the div hover_zone doesn t change at all

3771717
background-color	transparency
the problem is due to the background-color set to transparency

3771732
implements	extends
if you intend to draw this dynamically you would have to extends view and override ondraw you can implements ontouchlisteners etc to detect when and where people are touching it

3771760
width	height
the src attribute on the is _layouts images icjpg.gif and the width and height attributes are 0

3771761
folder	directory
you need to delete servlet-api.jar and jsp-api.jar from the deployed projects lib folder to fix the above error and setup custom build configuration so that the 2 files are not copied to the deployment directory

3771800
twitter	bit.ly
i am thinking of making it run under 4.0 but i use many 3rd-party dll s for compressing bit.ly twitter xml etc

3771816
int	boolean
public overridable function openpdffrommem byval lppdfdata as int byval npdfdatalen as int byval lpszuserpwd as string byval lpszownerpwd as string as boolean

3771840
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie it would work as expected but firefox safari and google-chrome would return an empty response

3771848
hash	salt
writing your own of course means implementing a session mechanism for retaining state across the user session and storing the passwords in a hash and salt state for verification

3771856
ubuntu	linux
since my laptop runs linux i m using mono 2.6.7 on ubuntu

3771910
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	scheme	racket
i would suggest you learn a lisp â common lisp scheme racket or clojure

3771917
pentaho	olap
pentaho is a full-fledged bi suite meaning it can handle everything from reports olap dashboards etc

3771917
pentaho	saiku
some recent examples of this are saiku previously called pentaho analysis tool

3771952
ibatis	mybatis
if you don t want to do the full heavyweight orm way then look at something like mybatis used to be ibatis which has sqlmaps

3771971
children	parent
ideally all the children will have a couple of unique settings name interval config settings and a getdata method while the parent manages starting stopping logging and anything else

3772016
portrait	landscape
one comment if i open the modal view in portrait and then rotate the device it rotates fine into landscape mode

3772103
hide	show
you can use conditionals inside the binding to decide which thumbnail to show or use the new property to hide show a 2nd image

3772124
primefaces	richfaces
richfaces 3.x isn t fully jsf 2.0 compatible while primefaces 2.x is hence this conflict

3772142
button	checkbox
as for putting a label over the entire group just put them in a container that has a text container above the stack of button or checkbox

3772190
inherited	properties
using this inherited method you can only mingle variables upstream. your child object will be able to see the public properties of its prototype but the prototype cannot see the properties of its children

3772208
zlib	libz
libz zlib compression headers

3772233
mouse	keyboard
this is a sort of kiosk design so the user wont even have a keyboard or mouse just a touch screen

3772245
int	chars
y or whatever is a chars and you can cast it into an int and therefore convert it into a l

3772250
unsigned	short
l ã is of type wchar_t which can be implicitly converted into an unsigned short

3772256
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the trick is border and margin are not included in height width calculation

3772256
width	margin
so if you have element with width 100px border 2px and left margin 10px the 114px of horizontal space will be taken up

3772264
hide	show
the qdockwidget class already handles the dock undock hide show options so all you have to do is do your own widget

3772292
width	height
don t forget to factor in those margins to show up light grey areas and that you can t use height 100 for the same reasons you can t use width 50 as described by others here

3772328
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade my rails versioning to rails 3.0

3772402
int	chars
i know that this might be stretching it a bit too much but i have the variable type defined using #define which i need to change from int to chars 10 type

3772407
int	boolean
int can be implicitly converted to boolean but that doesn t mean you always should

3772509
mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
bring tasks from different servers bugzilla trac mantis etc. into eclipse certified connectors list full connectors list

3772543
fadein	fadeout
or you could use fadein and fadeout to make them both fade like this

3772583
haskell	scheme	lisp	prolog	lisp	scheme	scheme	prolog
especially lisp cl not as much as scheme and prolog and haskell embrace recursion

3772610
free	malloc
ie all 5 occasions malloc is called are met with a corresponding free

3772615
int	chars
assigning a wide chars string i.e the address of the first address of a wide chars array to an int pointer is only possible if you guess the int type to which wchar_t corresponds correctly

3772619
fadein	fadeout
jquery might have better methods than fadeout fadein for this job

3772652
organization	naming
note path names above have been abbreviated to hide organization specific naming

3772727
typedef	struct
the typedef statement already defines the symbol actor as an alias for struct _actor before you attempt to declare a class with the same name

3772727
typedef	struct
the second message pointing to the typedef struct _actor line in the program is a little clearer and refers to the multiple declarations for actor

3772730
versioning	upgrade
i believe that an upgrade of jruby to a versioning matching the patch level of ruby that we were running solved our issue we had to install jruby from source to get the right one

3772732
prng	random
here you typically have three functions init_prng seed which returns some opaque representation of the prng state get_prng state which returns a random number and changes the state variable and destroy_peng state which just cleans up allocated memory and so on

3772732
prng	random
finally it s often the case that prngs can be made to perform better if you ask for a whole sequence of random numbers in one go the compiler can vectorize the prng internals

3772734
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i ve tried margin top width height and border so far nothing seems to work

3772783
google-chrome	firefox
i get this error when i m in ie only but firefox google-chrome just show nothing no error and no app

3772786
ilist	iqueryable
if you really want to keep the interface as an ilist instead of an iqueryable just add an additional expression to the expression tree before you compile

3772829
typedef	struct
next we create a typedef for struct _actor called _actor

3772829
typedef	struct
the third line creates a second typedef for struct _actor called actor

3772829
typedef	struct
therefore in your c++ code you should probably eliminate the typedef entirely and just rename the struct

3772835
ubuntu	linux
i have g++ 4.4.3 on linux with ubuntu lucid lynx and i am getting a

3772862
put	get
if you didn t put the result somewhere you would have done work for nothing as you have no way to get the result

3772866
put	get
in this case try to put a well-formedness condition around the xml feed you get from the weather data feed before parsing it

3772870
post	get
so if someone retweets my post i ll never be able to get that retweet using proper api call

3772942
spaces	delimiter
in ruby will only ignore leading spaces for the ending delimiter allowing it to be properly indented

3773025
typedef	struct
in the first version foo is a typedef for the named struct mystruct

3773025
typedef	struct
in the second version foo is a typedef for an unnamed struct

3773025
typedef	struct
in particular the second version doesn t allow the use of a forward declaration to declare foo and the struct it is a typedef for whereas the first would

3773047
decltype	auto
i think i have a good grasp on how the parameter packs are being deduced inferred and how auto decltype and the trailing return type are doing their thing but if i m mistaken please let me know how

3773081
lisp	prolog
all three lisp dialects offer meta-linguistic abstraction capabilities that few languages offer in such an elegant way prolog would be another interesting language that has similar capabilities

3773122
hex	binary
which would return you a list string containing the hex digits of the binary

3773190
explode	implode
im assuming that i have to implode the serialized data and then explode it because when i just use implode i cant access the entries in counties so i used explode

3773222
post	get
i m developing an android video uploading app and uploading large amounts of video is a problem i get different type of exception sometimes host not resolved pipe broken i do a multipart post but i have a feeling if i upload chunk of bytes one at at time that ll increase upload speed as well as solve connection timeout and these type of problems

3773250
subtract	add
remember that many but not all languages use arrays that are zero-based so when converting from a natural number to an index subtract one and then add one to go from index to natural number

3773251
globalization	localization
it is certainly possible - it is one of the common issues with globalization localization

3773310
mouseup	mousedown
but i can definitely see a problem with doing the other way around raising mousedown when you get a mouseup - the mousedown handler could potentially i have no idea if it does this query the input device for the actual status of that mouse and they wouldn t match

3773343
put	get
you could put the png into an image view and then use this method to get the pixel value from a graphics context that you would draw the the image into

3773354
unix	solaris
so i have a large c project that was built entirely on unix sparc solaris

3773355
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari google-chrome it s always null

3773483
post	get
if i get it cleaned up and tested i will post it at a later time

3773513
stateless	stateful
this programming model contains concepts such as security transaction demarcation state management and persistency stateful or stateless beans and more

3773567
width	height
this essentially means both width and height have to be the same value the value of your desired length for the line

3773577
onresume	onpause
i m very confused why the person writing the test thinks that the spinner could have been corrupted between the onpause and onresume

3773602
photoshop	fireworks
the designers can easily port their photoshop fireworks designs into xibs and we can focus on the functionality

3773604
versioning	upgrade
using installshield 2011 we re creating a major upgrade and having problems upgrading software with this product versioning format - 2009.727.1365

3773622
innodb	myisam
then when you want to do a fulltext search you do a join between the proper innodb table and the search-bait myisam table with a match condition against the myisam table

3773622
innodb	myisam
this also allows you to store different search-bait text in the myisam table to the â realâ text in the innodb table which allows you implement features like stemming or special apostrophe hyphen handling that mysql s fulltext engine can t manage

3773622
innodb	myisam
the problem here of course is keeping the myisam data consistent with the innodb data

3773646
inherited	properties
i m stealing the answer to this from the com interop base class properties not exposed to com link given in the very similar question c# exposing to com - interface inherited

3773671

google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the following code under google-chrome 6.0 firefox 3.6.10 and ie 8 and all behaved the same

3773696
width	height
assuming a circle with a width and height of 250 i can populate the circle with slices using the segment custom attribute like this assuming i have a div on my page with the id of holder

3773704
daemons	launchd
apache commons daemons is a c program that launchd a java app and doesn t let you put the sanity checks in the java code afaik and thus breaks what i would consider important daemons facilities

3773704
daemons	launchd
thus if you are looking to implement a daemons launchd that behaves similar to sshd apache etc

3773806
submit	submission
put an alert x as the first statements in your jquery document .ready and jquery .appnitro submit functions and see if both are displayed first one upon document load second one upon form submission

3773818
post	get
btw a tpackage is documented in the quick help and b you would get a faster answer if you post your question in the power++ question forum at gridplusplus.com

3773919
int	chars
data can be a pointer to anything like a single int or a chars or a struct of some kind my problem

3773921
onkeyup	onblur
you should look at the onkeyup or onblur

3773968
margin	text-align
the text-align fixes an ie 6 issue really you just need to assign a margin to your wrapping document div

3774023
post	get
you are saying that the post action is not hit but you get an exception

3774036
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not really a safer strcpy - it is designed for filling fixed-length text fields which means that it does not always nul-terminate the destination

3774054
actionscript	mxml
i originally had this application which was an mxml file consisting primarily of a huge mx script block of pure actionscript 3

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i know its a not a new concept that my site is perfect on firefox safari and google-chrome but jacked up on ie8

3774137
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you can look at it in firefox safari and google-chrome and then in ie8 and you will see the issues

3774167
hide	show
when the user plays the video use a trigger to hide the image and show the video

3774189

it also has issues when changing from portrait to landscape view 5 out of 10 images may be displayed then i ll turn the device and usually lose all the images

3774198
many-to-one	one-to-many
but the one-to-many many-to-one i am tired of trying it

3774234
min	max
when i add that i only get the first message for each string of messages when it should be the last regardless of whether i use min or max and the row count says 1 row returned when there is 2 rows shown

3774262
fink	macports
don t use macports or fink

3774270
firefox	safari
when level 1 is clicked it shows level 2 works perfectly on firefox and ie but not on safari

3774271
vsto	add-in
i am working on a vsto powerpoint 2010 add-in which will allow the user to playback a media object video or audio in a windows form using windows media player control

3774299
prepare	execute
you can create dynamic queries using prepare and execute to interpolate values

3774349
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval work differently in javascript to the way you want to use them

3774467
lisp	smalltalk
pretty much every lisp implementation uses them many smalltalk vms many ruby interpreters and so on

3774467
mri	rubinius
for example in the mri yarv and rubinius ruby interpreters integers are encoded the way i described above false is encoded as address 0 which just so happens also to be the representation of false in c true as address 2 which just so happens to be the c representation of true shifted by one bit and nil as 4

3774469
inherited	properties
if you use it on arrays or array like objects it can give you several problems first inherited properties are also enumerated meaning that if someone augments the array.prototype object those properties will be also enumerated in your loop

3774495
glassfish	weblogic
a web application refers to a specific kind of module that can be deployed onto an ee container like tomcat weblogic or glassfish

3774532
udp	tcp
unix domain sockets can be either sock_stream like tcp or sock_dgram like udp with the added guarantee that unix domain datagram sockets are reliable and don t re-order datagrams

3774555
put	get
you will get this error if you try and put an app signed with your distribution certificate on your phone -- it simply won t work

3774557
unix	sunos
gnu coreutils date what you get on linux and which may also be hiding somewhere on your sunos system i doubt you actually mean sunos sun microsystems hasn t called its unix variant that for about fifteen years but even so the stuff in usr bin is still incredibly obsolete junk -- look in usr local and all subdirectories of opt -- can also do this but you have to preprocess the input

3774561
post	get
you re going to want to use get_the_term to get an array of the terms used for the post

3774590
margin	height
based on the source order the only way you ll be able to do this is by specifying a negative margin for the top of the 6th div - if all your height are measured and it should fit exactly you ll probably just specify the height for the negative margin

3774592
webclient	networkcredentials
i m trying to do this using webclient passing networkcredentials posting the request to the asp.net mvc application from my wpf client

3774596
for-loop	arrays
note that the mutable arrays is necessary as you cannot modify an arrays that is being iterated over as in the for-loop

3774605
hide	show
if the user clicks the panel grid on the same cell again i want panel line grid to scroll rows as such visible rows hide and bottom rows show up

3774615
int	chars
this coerces the chars to an int

3774621
portrait	landscape
for now i am focusing on a portrait layout...i ll deal with landscape mode later

3774656
getter	setter
this allows me to pass up one of more values based upon how many changed without having to hard-code setter and getter with a call to a common server-api method over and over again

3774669
getter	setter
for this reason it would be next to useless to allow something to be stored in this variable which is essentially what that automatic setter does with no way of accessing this value at any point in the future after all the getter here is not an automatic getter it would return something entirely different

3774669
getter	setter
so to summerise without a getter there would which is the only way to retrieve the value from this backing variable there would be no point in having a private setter

3774782
pthreads	fork
system essentially fork blocks the parent and ignores certain signals in the child as per the pthreads spec links

3774820
hide	show
if the number and names of the dynamically created fields are limited create them all in the form and hide them using css then show them using javascript

3774846
apache	nginx
maybe use a server optimised for static content nginx etc rather than a full blown apache instance you might be using for dynamic content on the same domain

3774859
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller uisplitviewcontroller all go against this advice

3774884
cvs	svn
unlike cvs svn you do not need to checkout files to edit

3774884
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
if you have other vcss that vcscommand supports cvs svn svk git bazaar try it in one of their repositories and see if you get the same error

3774886
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you already have firefox google-chrome safari ie9 that you can test against and it s only fall of 2010

3774886
versioning	upgrade
by this time in 2011 enough people should have upgrade to some compatible versioning of their chosen browser that you ll have a good sized user base

3774951
children	parent
if we had defined the foreign key on table1 with the cascade option we would have been able to delete the parent and all the children would get deleted automatically

3774951
children	parent
if we were to repeat the previously failed delete the children rows in table1 will be deleted as well as the parent row in table2

3774985
installshield	dtf
if i was using installshield le i d create a c# wix dtf custom action and consume it in a wix merge module and then consume that merge module in your installshield le project

3774995
imagemagick	graphicsmagick	imagemagick	pdftk
aside from ghostscript i also have access to pdftk and imagemagick which might be replaced with graphicsmagick

3774996
subtraction	addition
it means in addition subtraction multipication

3775008
pycrypto	keyczar
i looked into doing this with pycrypto and keyczar but the problem is neither have the ability to parse x509 certificates keyczar has keyczar.util.parsex509 but it is limited and doesn t work for the aws cert or i m guessing any real world cert

3775020
hide	show
i need to toggle between hide and show the div based on the whether clicked or not

3775029

because you see i m a little tired of opening each computer with the terminal looking at the process get the files from each of the computers by ftp put these files in the corresponding folder on the file storage writing the schedule when each program should continue it s work

3775122
children	parent
i think the problem could be the use of children more than the use of parent

3775134
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
it doesn t seem to happen in flock google-chrome safari or opera

3775165
parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
uiviewcontroller.navigationcontroller tabbarcontroller parentviewcontroller modalviewcontroller

3775167
google-chrome	safari
the particular css animation i have below works in safari google-chrome and even the iphone simulator but for the life of me #image_cat1 #image_cat2 and #image_cat3 are not being displayed on the actual device and i can t find anything on google or anywhere else

3775181
profiling	instrumentation
your time is much better spent profiling your app in instrumentation and going where it tells you and ironing out the hot spots in your own code

3775187
maven	pom.xml
into something that could be placed into a maven pom.xml file

3775267
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
lisp scheme ml haskell scala you name it

3775292
put	get
i m using the google maps javascript api so that i can have someone put a marker on a map and then get the latitude and longitude from that to submit as part of a form

3775296
forth	turing
as you correctly state this should be interpreted reading from left to right as if the machine is in state 1 and the current square contains a 0 print a 1 move right and change to state 2. however your use of the word step seems to suggest that that step 2 must be followed by step 3 etc. when in reality a turing machine can go back and forth between states and of course there can only be finitely many possible states

3775299
hide	show
and the images can be cycled-through with a function that show and hide them in turn

3775313
hide	show
just show the loading image bind to the imagesloaded event and when it s triggered hide the loading image

3775338
ddms	adb
have a look at framebuffer.c in the adb phone side sources which appears to be what the ddms screenshot capability uses

3775362
ienumerable	iqueryable
return iqueryable or ienumerable via asenumerable in your repository if

3775376
post	get
especially since you seem to be wanting to do a post rather than a get from your question text

3775377
gif	png
with the command i can only exclude xml file type even though there are files in the folder image type png gif jpg txt php etc

3775384
ienumerable	ilist
the con is that changing your return type from ilist to ienumerable would be breaking

3775405
post	get
the query-string part of the url is normally used only for get requests not post requests

3775419
rss	feed
try the rss feed

3775421
google-chrome	firefox
since it works in google-chrome and functions in firefox i would really love to be able to use it with ie also

3775435
filtering	grouping
but then when i wanted to investigate pairwise comparisions between the individual grouping i had to make some inelegant filtering so that only two grouping entered the analysis at a time

3775444
post	get
i want to get the most recent post images in that post if present and the updated date of that post

3775462
rss	feed
however i think that you could just get an rss feed from the blogs and parse the necessary data from that

3775486
width	height
i ve tried to check the width and height and all those things

3775492
stdout	stderr
i think this is happening because errors are being sent to stderr instead of stdout

3775492
stdout	stderr
one way you can get around this is to redirect output to stderr to stdout and capture that

3775533
submit	submission
email will not be automatically sent by merely clicking on the submit button thereby submission the form

3775569
kerberos	ntlm
the problem is that ntlm authentication works however kerberos authentication does not

3775649
folder	directory
also take a note that the directory where iâ m executing this build has a folder src with the files listed in the files item

3775707
clang	llvm
there is also the ch c interpreter a commercial c interpreter and the open source ccons c interpreter which is based on clang llvm

3775711
prepare	pdostatement
to prevent sql injection simply use prepare statements pdostatement or mysqli_stmt

3775724
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop in the function searches the arrays from the last arrays value to the beginning

3775746
children	parent
you re storing all sub- files and folder recursively in a list but with your current code you store the parent folder before you store the children

3775788
int	chars
but then you can just do a find and replace on the regex by getting the int represented by the two hex numbers and then casting it to a chars or something similar to that

3775791
memcached	apc
edit 1 i agree it is very annoying to setup apc memcached on mamp

3775835
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
make your image view user interaction enabled in the xib or through the code if you are adding it programmatically and use the uiresponder methods touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended etc to detect the touch on the image view

3775862
uiview	uiwindow	uiapplication	uiwindow
in addition the uiapplication object maintains a list of all the windows uiwindow objects currently open in the application so through those it can retrieve any of the applicationâ s uiview objects

3775878
pull	push
my system is snow leopard 10.6.4 - i can t make pull from my rubymine but i can make commit and push

3775900
isnull	datalength
however i would use isnull datalength content -1 instead so that you can distinguish between length 0 and null

3775912
interpolation	splines
scale h via splines interpolation to be of size b + 2p t h_scaled

3775926
int	chars
from what i understand the documentation is saying it won t store a literal - chars which means it s probably now doing what the other signed int fields have always done and it s storing a sign bit to denote negative numbers instead

3775928
hash	md5
if you really wanted to you could javascript md5 hash the password in the browser but that is sort of giving you a false sense of security especially if you still send the password via http

3775982
jobs	cron
my problem is this google app engine allows cron jobs to be active for only 30 seconds before an deadlineexceededexception is thrown

3775982
jobs	cron
to achieve that i was thinking of creating a session from my cron job servlet_1 call the other servlet_2 test the session and then let the server do the jobs required and in the end invalidate the session

3775994
user-controls	elementhost
set the hostedcontent of the elementhost to the wpf user-controls

3776048
submit	submission
update per your comment below you re looking to see which submit button triggered the submission

3776065
google-chrome	firefox
the above works in all browsers ie firefox google-chrome

3776103
facebook	fbconnect
i know that fbconnect facebook api for iphone uses the following method when logging out to remove any cookie

3776121
stdout	stderr
this command calls the url but doesnt download the output and redirect stderr and stdout to dev null

3776146
ws-addressing	soap
it will not use ws-addressing and action soap header but instead it will use soapaction http header

3776186
textview	imageview
to use something other than textview for the array display for instance imageview or to have some of data besides tostring results fill the views override getview int view viewgroup to return the type of view you want

3776193
google-chrome	firefox
if you use a debugger google-chrome s dev tools firebug for firefox script debugger for ie ... it should tell you that

3776197
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
but i know that i actually don t have to use pushviewcontroller i just want a new navigationcontroller starting from that point and so for each tab in the splitview

3776206
put	get
i get this sometimes when i forget to adequately put the right namespaces in place

3776208
post	put
the only way i can concieve is to generate an upload url and then post to that url using the url fetch service but if i have to go to that amount of trouble i d rather just put the thumbnails in the datastore

3776232
folder	directory
the public folder is an important key feature of the zend framework because it confines apache to only read files in that directory and if used properly would keep all your other code outside public visibility

3776232
folder	directory
say for instance you have a public_html folder in your directory and that is the visible folder for your domain

3776253
crypt	hash
it s because it s used for unix password hash check crypt unix

3776253
crypt	salt
if the salt begins with the string digit then the modular crypt format is used

3776258
apache	nginx
i need to convertthe following apache htaccess rules to nginx rewrite rules

3776259
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve done automatic installation from web-page for firefox and google-chrome but i can t do it for opera and ie

3776288
width	height
bitmapsizeinbytes 2 width height

3776407
mef	prism
this is possible using modular loading techniques like mef or prism which now includes mef support

3776420
rss	feed
the rest of the application i can do myself such as parsing the rss feed using the touchxml library

3776430
hide	show
i can t get a simple answer to this when i press the letter j i want it to hide and when i press the letter h i want it to show

3776442
mouseover	mouseout
but try to mouseout then mouseover another link and mouseover that tooltip

3776501
lisp	scheme
when he s ready maybe at 13s it depends you should try to teach some lisp language plt scheme

3776533
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
i have qstandarditemmodel and qtableview

3776535
google-chrome	safari
silly web element inspector safari google-chrome question but i can t seem to figure out why some properties are dimmed

3776613
emacs	gedit
correct rendering which is displayed gedit emacs kwrite

3776616
button	checkbox
if i create an mfc dialog based application a checkbox will be present for minimize button asking whether minimize is required for the dialog being created

3776632
put	get
maybe i could just put the text in a uilabel and then get it s content bitmap somehow

3776649
vim	gedit
change the font in vim to the default font in gedit or whatever editor you were using in screenshot #2

3776706
hide	show
it also allows the user to filter the list via some checkboxes in a menu so the user can choose to show or hide each type of files

3776706
filtering	grouping
however the listview still renders a 1px grey line between each view even if they are viewstubs meaning i see a thick grey line whenever a grouping of consecutive items are filtering away

3776716
portrait	landscape
the 0 0 coordinates are top left in portrait mode but my chart needs to be viewed in landscape mode and converting everything isn t that easy afaik so i was wondering if i can change the coordinate system

3776814
width	height
you also should have no need to set explicit width and height on the labels especially if you don t have any form of border or background

3776851
free	malloc
the details of how malloc and free work are implementation-specific

3776851
free	malloc
this means that if your implementation of malloc enlarges the data segment the corresponding implementation of free can t shrink it unless it determines that there s space at the end that s not being used

3776851
free	malloc
in practice a humongous chunk of memory you allocated with malloc rarely winds up at the very end of the data segment when you free it which is why processes tend to grow monotonically

3776872
free	malloc
i would suggest you pass null instead of a malloc d pointer and you will be free of worrying about its memory

3776884
swt	swing
if you have any experience with swing or swt i suggest you stick to it

3776886
profiling	debugging
btw my sampling profiling reads delphi debugging symbols .map .jdbg etc because there is still no good delphi to pdb debugging symbol converter so you can view the stack of a delphi program in windows debugger or process explorer visual studio etc

3776945
button	checkbox
you can just use a checkbox and set its appearance to button

3776952
pascal	delphi
delphi is pascal

3776965
maven	pom.xml
this uses the maven properties http.url and http.attachmentfile that you can specify on the command line using the -d syntax or in a pom.xml file in a block

3776967
vim	gedit
vim in gnome-terminal seems to be correct as it uses the same routines for rendering as gedit does default ubuntu 10.04

3776997
waitpid	execl
you must call wait or waitpid in the parent process and it will give you the exit status of the program executed by execl

3777108
int	double
i ve replaced double by int because i don t see why you d use double to store int

3777140
cvs	svn
so for now it s just excel and doc file lugged into the project doc folder and check into cvs svn doomed to be outdated and be forgotten p

3777164
rss	feed
i have a script which caches a number of rss feed however i have noticed that i ve started getting strange characters appearing in the page where i output the cached contents stored in db

3777164
rss	feed
for instance the rss feed contains the characters

3777187
stdout	stderr
to also capture stderr in addition to stdout use the following syntax

3777234
rss	feed
the fact that there are 3 bad characters in the output suggests that the rss feed is being interpreted so that the html character reference is converted to utf-8

3777242
rss	feed
you need to make sure that the encoding of the rss feed is the same as in your db

3777260
ubuntu-server	centos
the server will be either ubuntu-server or centos based

3777360
rss	feed
since your application seems to decode the htmlentities of that cached rss feed before writing them to the db you may also output them like you got them in the first place

3777426
tolower	toupper
arguments to isdigit isblank ... and toupper and tolower

3777427
gridview	repeater
you also can query these attributes if the control is webcontrol many controls such as textbox label button etc are webcontrols but some databound controls like repeater gridview are not

3777443
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however applying text-transform uppercase to ä i the browsers checked ie firefox google-chrome and safari results in i i which is not correct and may change the meaning of the words so much so that they become insults

3777454
flask	django
if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django

3777454
pylons	turbogears	web.py	turbogears	web.py	pylons
there are others such as web.py again very compact pylons and turbogears but i guess you d have already considered them

3777486
r5rs	r6rs
procedure and it s not listed as a type in r5rs or r6rs

3777491
jar	manifest.mf
ideally the classpath of the jar file shall not contain root folder of the project netbeans adds library jars if you have added them to the project in the class-path property in the manifest.mf file automatically

3777491
jar	manifest.mf
if you have any custom requirement you can even modify the manifest.mf file which gets included in the built jar

3777508
hide	show
it s for fetching and displaying data not for making decisions what to show hide

3777583
ggplot2	lattice
once the data are in this stacked form it only requires a simple ggplot call to produce the plot you wanted with all the extras one reason why higher-level plotting packages like lattice and ggplot2 are so useful

3777592
melt	reshape
the general approach is to convert the data to long format using melt from package reshape or reshape2 or gather from the tidyr package

3777671
folder	directory
if you want to make sure that the file is created in a particular folder you have to provide a working directory to exec which only works in the three argument version

3777683
width	height
title frmpasdatepickertest height 300 width 300

3777683
margin	height

3777714
google-chrome	firefox
the link does not work in firefox or google-chrome but works in ie have only tested with ie8

3777714
google-chrome	firefox
if i remove any of the float styles or position styles the link becomes clickable in google-chrome and firefox

3777752
pull	push
i have a central repository and 3 users with local repositories that pull and push code to the central one

3777752
chown	chgrp
every time a user pushes code some directories and files get their owner and group changed from hg and hgusers to username and usergroup respectively which makes impossible to the others to push code.so i have to do chown and chgrp to go back to the initial situation again

3777775
typedef	struct
your typedef using a private struct any code outside the debugger class trying to use it will not compile

3777813
google-chrome	firefox
what s not working however is the quirk that causes a submit input in the form to be virtually clicked firefox and google-chrome include the submit input s name in the parameters posted while ie does not

3777813
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do still work but ie once worked and now doesn t. i can probably figure out what i changed to break it but as bobince seemed to understand something about this quirk i figured i d ask to see if there are known possibly even documented ways to control it

3777819
rss	feed
for the rss i use rome which reads an rss feed and contains the body of the article in a string

3777838
onkeyup	onkeydown
you need to implement the onkeydown and onkeyup method in your activity and return true for each of your required buttons

3777852
int	chars
internally the string s chars are held in a chars and all of the api methods use int as the type for lengths positions and offsets

3777856
postgresql	mysql
for mysql postgresql oracle better way is self join

3777862
ubuntu	debian
this file is located in etc mysql my.cnf on debian ubuntu this can be different if you use an other os

3777912
int	chars
a string is backed by a and arrays can only be indexed with int s and can consequently only hold 2 31 chars

3777930
interpreted-language	compiled-language
in interpreted-language and compiled-language which provide run time introspection reflection the name may take up more space

3777946
stringstream	fstream
because if properly programmed the stringstream could seamlessly be replaced by a fstream i

3777952
mouse	keyboard
and it works with keyboard navigation as well as mouse use

3777974
folder	directory
in the same directory i have the images folder

3777978
width	height
fixed by rebuilding the fullscreen code so the video player get s set to stage height and width rather than zooming a rectangle

3777989
submit	submission
add the hidden input to signify a submission and omit the name on the submit button

3778022
gridview	repeater
here is an example.suppose in gridview or repeater we want select all option.as you have seen

3778055
google-chrome	firefox
this code works in firefox but doesn t work in google-chrome

3778083
puts	gets
i have also noticed a few other issues through my use of this library - like a lack of a getfileinfo method or recursive gets and puts

3778092
int	double
nstimeinterval is defined as double so if you want to convert it to int you can make simple type cast

3778117
mdpi	hdpi
the mdpi and hdpi shows the resources from the right folder but when choosing my device with ldpi it shows the resources from mdpi - which is wrong

3778157
next	document.write
document.write succeed with the first element c but failed with the next two element

3778213
doc	rtf
however i wanted to use vim to edit doc or even rtf files

3778237
uitableview	reloaddata
in your uitableviewcontroller you own a uitableview call reloaddata on this tableview will reload your table view s data

3778372
disk	ram
the oracle server has disk space of 250g 32g ram

3778396
javassist	cglib
using cglib or javassist create a proxy that before each method invocation sets an internal field - the real applicationdata

3778398
punctuation	words
it ll trigger on spaces and punctuation between words as well so you ll effectively remove every words between 1 and 5 chars rather than every line as intended

3778405
int	boolean
protected boolean ontap int index

3778421
hide	show
this will show the when checked and hide it when it s not

3778427
jflex	cup
after this if you really want to do it the hard way you could build your own template processor using lexers and parsers such as jflex and cup

3778464
hide	show
however you can minimize the main window or hide it or whatever before you show the dialog

3778469
post	get
i believe that an answer to the question what are reasons for a browser executing get rather than post does not help to solve the problem of receiving a get on a form where you expect the a get

3778469
post	get
but to answer that question i would simply say that you receive an get because the browser sends an get and you can send a get on any page where you can send a post

3778469
post	get
thus your server has to be prepared to handle the get and it should handle the get in the same manner as a post with invalid parameters

3778485
hash	salt
passwords should be stored via a salt hash

3778497
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in ie but it does not in firefox and google-chrome

3778531
hash	salt
they should be stored using a one-way encryption or salt hash function whenever possible

3778593
subtraction	addition
if the numbers are unsigned modular 0100000 with modular 8-bit math addition of 11111111 is equal to subtraction of 1

3778620
cobertura	emma
unit testing is just the beginning though you might look at code coverage tools to give you an indication of how complete your unit testing is open source tools emma and cobertura provide this for java

3778625
qtableview	qtablewidget
i know your question was about qtableview but it might be easier if it is the only thing you want to display i don t know your objectives to use a qtablewidget with a qdoublespinbox since it has a method that allows you to set a suffix to the value that is displayed

3778649
puts	fflush
qabstractdata writedata puts data in qabstractdata fflush pulls it out

3778680
ubuntu	linux
i m on linux ubuntu 10.04 x64

3778732
firefox	safari
in our product we have a gaussianblur for some years now working well in firefox but never in safari

3778782
entity-relationship	diagram
if you re heart-set on having the data located within sharepoint perhaps think about using access services to create your entity-relationship diagram and then publish the database to sharepoint using access services

3778815
opera	firefox
i m targeting html5 browsers that is firefox webkit and opera

3778852
equals	gethashcode
in nhibernate we override equals and gethashcode to calculate entity equality

3778854
google-chrome	safari
i tried google-chrome and safari which work fairly well but both seem to have little issues

3778855
pop-up	dialog
so i run the following code to suppress all the dialog that may pop-up

3778880
touchesbegan	touchesended	minimum	diagonal
i d simply use an oldschool touchesbegan and touchesended and there check the x and y delta if both of them is greater then some minimum constant then this swipe should be a diagonal one

3778890
width	height
you should be able to do this with javascript finding the height and width values and injecting them into an inline style should do it

3778898
inherited	properties
in my pagebase class i checked the context items for that parameter and then set a properties so that my pages that inherited from pagebase can use it

3778900
aggregate-functions	sum
you need to set the scope of the sum aggregate-functions to be based on the dataset from which the report is created

3778962
ssl	https
the reason this message exists is that any https connection is served via ssl so the browser knows that the data coming in on it is indeed the exact data sent from the server

3778962
ssl	https
this is not the case for any components that have been deliverd via http - these can change components that have been delivered via ssl so the guarantee that the https data is correct cannot be maintained

3779003
width	margin
i ve now got the feeling that a possible cause would be incorrect usage of margin padding or width

3779090
hide	show
i have some jquery which show and hide the rows when you click on the rows above them click the ones with ids to hide show the ones with style tags

3779131
disk	ram
as part of the performance tuning you re going to uncover not only how the queries need to be restructured but also exactly what parts of the machine might need to be replaced ie disk more ram cpu etc based on the lock and wait types

3779147
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql as well as mysql can easily handle 500 million rows

3779164
ubuntu	linux
but these were in linux -- which i love -- but i really want to use nsight to benchmark and tune my code so i need windows -- so i decided to purchase a development box which i dual boot ubuntu x64 for production runs and win 7 with vs 2010 a battle which i m presently fighting and nsight 1.5 for development

3779172
firefox	safari
this is an extjs single-page application which works fine in firefox ie and safari

3779211
mp3	wav
the requirements have grown to include output to a file wav or mp3

3779294
int	chars
chr function in php takes an int and returns a string with one chars which is the ascii chars equivalent of the input

3779298
pyzmq	gevent
you could also have a look at the source in pyzmq and gevent - they use cython for their core code

3779316
opends	apacheds
these days i would use a virtual machine with any linux and openldap or and fedora directory server or a local instance s of apacheds or opends

3779319
post	get
this happends usually if my http post playload is large or if i m downloading a file via get request takes some time to complete

3779326
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m testing ie7 ie8 safari google-chrome and firefox

3779337
x86	64bit
this is generated by running objdump --disassemble usr lib64 libc.a on a 64bit linux x86 system and then searching through the output

3779355
draggable	droppable
i don t have this working using sortable but i did using draggable droppable

3779376
kerberos	ntlm
there are some differences to do with security in particular what varieties of windows authentication ntlm and kerberos over http are acceptable

3779409
helpers	actioncontroller
if you talk about controllers and actions in the controller you can take advantage of any helpers method and with helpers i mean a convenient method to access a feature defined in the actioncontroller base class

3779439
put	get
if i put a break point on my mvc controller it will only sometimes get triggered

3779472
button	checkbox
when i click on button or checkbox drop down keeps opened but when i click on other part of grid drop down i closed

3779484
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
in interactiveuiimageview i have iplemented methods for touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended to handle their movement and behaviour on screen

3779485
onchange	onkeyup
add javascript to the textbox onchange or onkeyup event there do your check and enable the button

3779514
for-loop	arrays
apparently this is a for-loop that cycles through the arrays of object and checks whether such book exist

3779524
width	height
this would resize the view and everything that is inside dividing the view width and height by 2

3779558
pop-up	dialog
the problem is instead of going to this screen and leaving my main window i want my target screen to pop-up into a modal dialog

3779577
google-chrome	safari
when using google-chrome or safari an active text box or text area will display a blue orange border around the box

3779596
mouse	keyboard
it s worth remembering that the outline is a useful visual feedback for the ui focus for those users not using a mouse keyboard navigation for example and it s worth substituting another visual cue to replace the loss of the outline

3779604
int	double
i ve tried double and int

3779610
google-chrome	firefox
the fact is all my forms are working nicely in firefox and google-chrome

3779646
firefox	safari
i m curious how does microsoft plan to embed silverlight into safari and firefox

3779709
getter	setter
i d now like to add some getter and setter to hold some information

3779719
stdout	stderr
sometimes you will see stderr redirected to the same location as stdout using so that all output can be captured at once

3779769
inherited	properties
if you mean that you d like to add a properties to the routedeventargs object that the handlers receive then all you d have to do is declare a class that inherited from routedeventargs and has the properties -y -ies you d like to add

3779888
width	height
another way is to set a div with a background image of your image and then a link inside there make the link display block and make it the entire width and height of the div and the whole thing will be clickable

3779889
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
i would suggest that you adopt a php framework like symfony kohana codeigniter cakephp etc

3779889
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
play around with any one of these i find symfony is pretty powerful and kohana codeigniter are easy to set up haven t used cakephp and once you get comfortable with one of these have a look at some of the cmses that were done using these frameworks

3779893
range	min	range	percentile
first is to compute the range by finding the highest and lowest values project each element to a percentile x - min range and throw out any that evaluate to lower than .05 or higher than .95

3779893
subtract	add
then subtract 2 sigmas from the mean and add 2 sigmas to the mean and you ve got your outlier limits

3779911
button	checkbox
currently pressing the tab button on they keyboard results in the checkbox gaining focus i would like to override this so that tab key would bring the password field into focus

3779916
unsigned	short
short answer the division first promotes x to unsigned

3779923
unsigned	short
x is converted to unsigned int divided by 3 and then that result is down-converted to signed short

3779926
win64	windows
because of a com4j problem with win64 the active directory plugin uses the unix implementation on 64-bit windows

3780005
int	chars
i am trying to develope a routine in c# that will take a given input int and return a 6 chars alpha numeric string based on a predefined possible set of chars

3780029
gridview	detailsview
there are many drag and drop controls gridview detailsview bundled with web forms that are great for creating report based web apps quickly that don t exist with the mvc framework

3780066
checkstyle	jdepend
run a tool like jdepend checkstyle or pmd on the source

3780134
client-side	server-side
if it does and each of its methods throw remoteexception then when it is passed to the server through the manager proxy everything is wired up automatically and method invocations on the server-side proxy to this listener are remote invocations of methods on the real client-side object

3780134
client-side	server-side
this means we can use one of these objects on the client-side as a parameter to an rmi method call on an rmi server-side object and when the deserialised stub on the server-side has methods invoked those methods will execute on the client-side

3780157
integer	unsigned
so presumably it represents a 64-bit integer which might be signed or unsigned and no it isn t zero

3780176
facebook	fbconnect
fbconnect should ignore your username pass in your database you need to store the facebook tokens which will be returned from a facebook connect login

3780185
hide	show
your best bet is probably turn off the real window title as you detail in your question then define a titlebar-like element of your own in your layout file...which you can then show hide at will

3780189
datediff	difference
i don t get what you are doing there but if you want to calculate the difference between 2 dates you could use the datediff function in classic asp

3780191
post	get
if they re not sufficient and you get stuck then post your code and explain what you re seeing

3780308
typedef	struct
coincidentally declares the type struct complex_z but doesn t give a name for the typedef

3780324
hide	show
alternatively if it s giving you a hard time just put two gridviews in a viewswitcher or framelayout with each set to one of the adapters you want and show hide one or the other when you need to rather than swapping out sources on one gridview

3780363
gif	png
without doing any deeper research never had this particular issue i d guess using transparent png instead of gif would be a good fix

3780373
inherited	properties
i believe what you may want to do is create a project properties sheet with the vs project manager that all the projects could inherited from

3780391
jobs	cron
otherwise you can use the cron jobs or windows schedular

3780409
pop-up	dialog
you will need to add a context menu strip to the datagridview with a insert menu item and when that is clicked have your insert dialog pop-up

3780428
ironruby	ironpython
you can use vb or any of the dlr languages like ironruby or ironpython or even that weird but oddly attractive beast f#.

3780441
fadein	fadeout
at first the text should fadein then stand for 3 sec. then fadeout again then a the textlink should fadein for 3 sec

3780477
rss	feed
i have an iphone app which streams in a website blogs rss feed

3780492
portrait	landscape
if i do a reverse pinch gesture move two touch locations apart while a video is playing landscape the video switches to portrait mode broadcasts a mpmovieplayerwillenterfullscreennotification and a mpmovieplayerdidenterfullscreennotification and is then stuck

3780509
integer	fractions
so this is roughly equivalent to a+b 2 in integer math which has no remainders or fractions parts

3780537
bmp	png
i don t really understand why a 24-bit png has the problem while the 24-bit bmp doesn t

3780613
implements	extends
car is not an interface so you must extends it rather than implements it

3780616
width	height
but since the width changes and the height doesn t i end up having sort of 2 images with different proportion

3780616
portrait	landscape
i thought about having a real big image that will fit for both landscape and portrait orientation

3780663
int	double
is equivalent to just evaluate all the double float int temporaries with comma operator

3780670
x86	64bit
if you need even more speed there is a x86 32 and 64bit jit version luajit

3780686
int	double
the comma operator s return value is its right-side argument so double float int boils down to just int although it creates and discards a double and a float value along the way

3780725
put	get
i donâ t like the first because i have to put stuff in my model just to get the gui right

3780767
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview that in the layoutsubviews method repositions its subviews based on the orientation of the ipad

3780779
put	get
i was also trying to make a wpf control with grid grid background and control background was set to transparent and place it on normal windows form but when i put this control on normal windows form not wpf i don t get the proper transparency

3780831
google-chrome	firefox
for the record this is done on firefox 3.6.10 on ubuntu 10.04 64-bit and google-chrome does not have this issue

3780860
coalesce	isnull
the title element below is working as an isnull or coalesce would in sql as to prevent nulls being returned

3780864
post	get
this application has one template presented by the get and post

3780879
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome just happen to also implement a console object refers to webkit js console

3780882
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome when i click on the button i m redirected to pag.php

3780896
width	height
images are stretched to fit by default and because of that you see lots of images which are badly distorted online most likely due to a simple mistake in specifying the height and width

3780898
cout	cin
iostream objects cin cout cerr and clog are objects declared in the iostream header

3780916
google-chrome	firefox
in addition all the buttons are are working well in mozilla firefox and google-chrome

3780918
solaris	aix
i have a c program in aix 5.3 i ve been asked to run it on a sparc solaris 10 machine but when i did it i noticed there was a buffer overflow with one of the many reckless strcat uses

3780918
solaris	aix
my goal is not to sanitize the code but to provide a concrete and well founded answer of why does this overflow happens on solaris and not on aix being the exact same bad coded program

3780918
solaris	aix
endianess diffs between aix and solaris

3780918
solaris	aix
execution of the strcat function aix copies right to left and solaris left to right but i haven t been able to find any documentation on this

3780920
capitalization	uppercase
absolutely weird capitalization irregularities you have in your schema btw -- would drive me absolutely bonkers if anybody used lowercase vs uppercase at random spots of column names that are so obviously meant to be identical

3780925
google-chrome	firefox
for a more precise description of the functionality i need please see the firefox google-chrome etc and how they do their ctrl-pgdn and ctrl-pgup keyboard shortcuts

3780930
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested the below on google-chrome firefox and opera for linux as well as ie6 yes really and ie8 for windows

3780942
width	height
then you can update like this assuming the new width height

3780951
post	get
alternatively inside of the log object s logging methods you could get the calling method like the accepted answer in this post

3781031
client-side	server-side
the only solution i found to this challenge was to create a server-side proxy service that relays the responses from the google maps geocode api to my client-side script

3781073
post	put
my idea would be to transfer the file using http put post from client most of the coding on client side to the server

3781073
put	get	post	put	post	get
my aim is to send the server a form like as given below with a http post put request and get the file main.cpp uploaded to the server

3781152
solaris	aix
luck or perhaps an artefact of slightly different memory management systems with more space being allocated on aix than on solaris

3781152
solaris	aix
if they are a couple of bytes out of bounds and if aix habitually allocates say 32 byte minimum blocks where solaris allocates 16 byte minimum blocks then there is more room for error without damage on aix than on solaris

3781152
solaris	aix
even so if you get it wrong in the wrong context aix should also have the problem - you can regard yourself as unlucky not to have observed the problem on aix for as you say it surely occurs there just as much as it does on solaris if the source code you re compiling is the same

3781152
solaris	aix
for 32-bit compilations aix 5.3 allocates a multiple of 16 bytes per allocation just like solaris

3781152
solaris	aix
however if you changed between 32-bit and 64-bit builds between aix and solaris this might still be the source of your problem

3781158
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
works with any format supported by gdi+ bmp gif jpeg png tiff exif wmf and emf

3781161
unix	bsd
the iso language definition does not specify anything about sockets or network programming so in order to do this you need to rely on another system-specific library standard such as the bsd socket api on unix linux

3781180
google-chrome	firefox
note both firefox and google-chrome will default most plugins to click-to-play soon with google-chrome planning to phase out npapi entirely

3781192
portrait	landscape
the camera is actually landscape native so you get up or down when you take a picture in landscape and left or right when you take a picture in portrait depending on how you hold the device .

3781253
wmi	managementeventwatcher
in the view model s constructor i set up a wmi managementeventwatcher and start it

3781280
super	self
original class has the super call when its got replaced - it causes self inheritance and causes maximum recursion depth exceed exception

3781280
super	self
class orm is calling super orm self ..

3781313
range	max	range	min	min	max
as far as i am aware there is no internal difference between integer int or int xx where xx is some number they are all the same datatype with the same byte storage allocation and min max range

3781336
getter	setter
if library had only public members books and bookcount or getter setter then the client wouldn t be getting any advantages because the client would still have to do all the heavy lifting

3781344
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
the code for this can get a bit complex but essentially you will need to capture the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events on your form

3781358
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
in winforms you can handle the mousedown mousemove and mouseup events of a control

3781367
hide	show
if you just want to simulate it you could make the screen into a component screen and use visual states to hide show it

3781413
g++	gcc
and to answer your other question i compiled a simple test program with such an assignment inside main with the -pedantic and -wall flags using gcc and g++ and received no warnings in either.

3781413
g++	gcc
and as josh points out the flag -wshadow will warn about this in gcc g++ in this specialized case

3781456
rss	feed
i m trying to simply display an rss feed as part of my site

3781459
rss	feed
it appears that the link is added to the content in place of the break tag but i see no option to disable this substitution for rss feed only

3781473
firefox	safari
it looks perfect in firefox safari ie8 but in ie7 and ie8 comparability mode it adds about 4000px of width to the div.team elements nested within the list item

3781691
int	chars
here is nearly identical code the only difference being it is using an array of chars rather than int

3781713
width	height
from a quick view i guessing that you ve set the width height to 50 and then you re adding 1px borders

3781713
width	height
the css box model uses the width height values to set the width height of the content area not the entire box

3781713
width	height
changing the width and height values should do the trick

3781736
rss	feed
if your site contains the regular google analytics implementation no the rss feed will not track views for you

3781736
rss	feed
the default installation does not insert any tracking code into the rss feed

3781736
rss	feed
you ll need to look into some sort of rss feed analytics solution to track that

3781736
rss	feed
you could also implement the iphone ios sdk for google analytics and track from within your application but that s likely not possible if you re using a cookie cutter rss feed to application tool

3781737
ssms	sqlcmd
connect to dac sqlcmd -e -a -s . express or from ssms use admin . express

3781788
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
you can use this site to test ie6-9 ff2-4 google-chrome 5-6 safari 3-5 and opera 9-10

3781789
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

3781790
width	height
i m very surprised setting max width height didn t do anything

3781802
pylons	cherrypy
and would like to use one of those well known web frameworks django cherrypy pylons etc

3781803
octal	decimal	octal	binary
it is not converting it from 10011 binary to 23 octal 19 decimal as you want it to

3781806
octal	binary
in this example we convert the binary string representation to an integer and from an integer to the octal string representation

3781821
actionscript	mxml
you can give everything an initial position easily within mxml a simple xml based language for defining your ui and then program interaction with actionscript basically same as javascript

3781829
int	double
what might be happening is that one of those other values coming back is an int type and that s causing the double to get converted when you concatenate them

3781829
int	double
unlike most other programming languages when combining floating point and int types matlab will narrow the floating point double values to the int types instead of widening the int

3781829
int	double
if this is what s going on you should explicitly convert all the int values in arg.tick to double

3781831
mouse	keyboard
only keyboard events influence the processing no mouse etc.

3781838
post	put
but this problem really put me on edge and i kept this post under hourly watch for days in hope of some reply

3781840
pylons	cherrypy
if you want to keep it simple look at cherrypy pylons and other lightweight frameworks

3781854
gif	png
there is a variety of utilities for rendering latex into gif or png or similar formats

3781867
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
when i use pushviewcontroller on a navigationcontroller to push another uiviewcontroller onto the navigationcontroller the toolbar is overwritten by the navigation bar

3781868
put	get
now the part i am not getting when a thread calls yield i get the current context and save it in a threadcontrolblock and put in the queue

3781896
public	protected
is a completely valid statement provided text is declared public and not private or protected

3781896
public	protected
is the function text public or private or protected

3781901
stdout	stderr
with this you can also redirect stdin stdout and stderr

3781908
post	get
i want to learn the methods on how to get it to work and finally decided to post here

3781952
getter	setter
having getter and setter only makes sense if you have to do extra calculations or checks when assigning the value

3781955
put	get
i implemented following methods options propfind mkcol delete move put get

3781983
google-chrome	firefox
edit the following code now works in firefox and google-chrome but does not work in ie8

3781986
udp	tcp
personally i learned this stuff by writing my own udp and tcp stacks in a well known embedded environment called dos maybe you have heard of it

3781988
mouse	keyboard
pyhook seems to have done some of the work necessary as it s hooked keyboard and mouse events

3781991
int	chars
in function â int main int chars â

3781992
ant	maven
i personally prefer maven as a packaging and building tool although others prefer ant

3782000
min	max
i think you need to compute both the max and min computable value using each subsequence

3782011
getter	setter
in python you don t have private attributes but you can implement something similar by using getter and setter to a variable which starts with underscore - python s convention for private methods and attributes

short	base
in short the problem is that while i can access the decorator defined in the base class from the inherited class by specifiying it as subsystem.updategui i ultimately get this typeerror when trying to use it

3782067
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i made the following changes to the floating footer element and it works now in safari opera firefox and google-chrome

3782075
inherited	subclassing
if they can have distinct interfaces you need to decide if you want to represent the distinctness with inherited in which case you would also use classmethod and call the decorator on the subclassing of subsystem or if it is better represented as distinct instances

3782078
jboss	glassfish
i am trying to deploy my war to glassfish works fine in jboss

3782080
width	height
the order for cgrectmake is origin x origin y width height

3782087
postgresql	mysql
connect objects to databases can have postgresql or mysql as the engine so you are free to choose the fastest one i think that other frameworks use sqlalchemy s orm which is also super cool and fast

3782096
post	get
if your using asp.net mvc 2.0 then try using a post versus get on the method something like

3782122
joomla	phpbb	wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla
wordpress joomla phpbb and others are made to be portable

3782125
jboss	glassfish
i would install glassfish or jboss

3782127
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome and of course not ie

3782134
debian	linux
debian is a fairly common linux distribution and will work on almost every pc

3782134
ubuntu	linux
if you do mind using linux you can use ubuntu which is more user-friendly but not really recommended as a server at least for the default version

3782137
postgresql	mysql
the database may be a mysql but for professional usage with more functionality postgresql will be the best choice

3782151
redhat	fedora
whichever you want - at work for example our linux servers run redhat enterprise linux which is loosely based on fedora so that might be a good distribution to use that might be similar to what you would experience in the real world

3782151
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are both widely-used open source database servers

3782165
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
1 as you want but i suggest you a red-hat centos for example or debian ubuntu for example based distribution

3782165
jboss	weblogic
it is much easier to install configure it than other webservers jboss websphere weblogic etc. and you won t need them in a first time ejb etc.

3782165
postgresql	mysql
3 as a database you can use mysql very easy to install or postgresql or oracle express edition not open source but free.

3782202

sorting	grouping
the sorting worked now i want to grouping

3782258
typedef	struct
make typedef of struct particularly incomplete struct not pointers to those struct

3782258
typedef	struct
if the definition of the underlying struct is not to be publicly available which is often laudable then that encapsulation should be supplied by the struct being incomplete rather than by inconvenient typedef

3782440
subtraction	add
add b to result representing subtraction of b -1 s

3782466
firefox	safari
here is the code all alone it works on firefox safari and chrome.

3782508
xslt	xquery
there are no rules about the order in which different expressions are executed which means that the little yellow triangle that shows the current execution point in the stylus studio xquery debugger and xslt debugger can sometimes behave in surprising ways and this means that constructs whose result would depend on order of execution like variable assignment are banned

3782519
hash	salt
i can easily generate a pseudo random salt for each new user and append that salt to their pw before applying the hash function

3782519
hash	salt
but i still need to store the salt so presumably anyone who gets access to the hash passwords also gets the salt

3782519
hash	salt
store in the db a value which concatenates the hash pw and the salt in a non obvious manner the salt is 10 random keys and they are injected inside the hash pw between letter numbers 1 2 4 5 8 9 etc

when you add or subtract content from this page the weird line remains but just in different spots of the text

3782539
octal	binary
first pad the binary string to be divisable by 3 3 bits 1 octal digit

iboutlet	ibaction
ok if you added the object in ib the object was already instantiated for you when you loaded the nib and the ibaction and iboutlet connections have already been made

3782602
hash	salt
yes the salt is just there to prevent rainbow attacks on the hash passwords

3782612
gif	png
just have a big image png or gif with a transparent mask area absolutely positioned over a bunch of lines of text

3782613
folder	directory
tried the same thing with my ubuntu setup creating the .vim after ftplugin directory in my home folder and updating the vimrc with the correct path of the pydiction dictionary but i fail every time

3782625
google-chrome	safari
i m only interested in the most common browsers in use today ie6+ ff3+ google-chrome latest safari latest

3782625
google-chrome	safari
what that question doesn t answer however is whether this rfc-compliant approach will work on existing popular browsers especially ie6 7 8 which are the usual standards-compliance culprits but also ie9 ff4+ latest google-chrome and latest safari which our application also must support

3782631
aim	instant
my aim is that i want one and only one of the alternative to be visible at any given instant of time

3782647
hash	salt
hash are salt to avoid dictionary attacks

3782647
hash	md5
before one jumps to condemn the use of md5 instead of sha1 as required by the http digest scheme hash but providing on-demand md5 hash collision for the digest scheme is still far from being actionable in the foreseeable future and the added benefit of automated access think webrequest curl etc is not to be neglected

3782653
put	get	post	put	post	get
it s also about the get put delete and post http verbs and of course the edit new etc default actions

3782682
min	max
id _txtspinner .spinner max 60 min 0

3782688
getter	setter
i have been coding in php and using codeigniter as well never got the concept of getter and setter

3782689
post	get
but it would really help me if i could submit it via get or post something which i switch on my pages due to design criteria

3782726
getter	setter
the getter and setter here are the methods that allow access to the protected property

3782726
getter	setter
some people criticize getter and setter as boilerplate code especially if they do not do anything than directly setting getting the property they provide access to

3782726
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
getter setter aka accessor mutators methods in wikipedia

3782746
folder	directory
from the tutorials i read i ve developed a habit of taking my application folder and moving it up one directory to be in the same folder as my system and user guide which i ll probably delete user guide before going live of course

3782765
put	get
the way i normally get around the 3-4 concurrent requests for such situations is to put the settimeout call inside the function i want to run repeatedly

3782780
int	chars
a year column as an int or chars 4 depending upon your needs

3782792
inherited	properties
for each of these it can call getcustomattributes to look for those that inherited from validationattribute and for each of these call isvalid passing the value of the properties or field

3782826
recvfrom	datagram
if the datagram or message is larger than the buffer specified the buffer is filled with the first part of the datagram and recvfrom generates the error wsaemsgsize

3782845
superclass	subclassing
often the subclassing has extra parameters which can t be passed to the superclass

3782864
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
it appears that for sql server i can t use those objects but rather i would need to use the objects sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader to do essentially the same things

3782877
superclass	subclassing
while constructing all superclass and no doubt doing so before you continue constructing downwards is obviously part of saying you re constructing a subclassing s instance that is clearly not the case for initializing since there are many use cases in which superclass initialization needs to be skipped altered controlled -- happening if at all in the middle of the subclassing initialization and so forth

3782901
google-chrome	safari
what would this rule s syntax look like for google-chrome safari and .

3782905

vsto	add-in
when i save the documents as stand alone docs and do not open them using the vsto add-in it is able to open them with minimal memory

3782909
integer	unsigned
you should be able to just read the value from the binary file into an unsigned 32 bit integer

3782921
google-chrome	safari
what you re looking for is already available here css3 gradient generator - that works for mozilla and webkit-based safari google-chrome browsers

3782935
ssl	https
http can be tunneled over ssl tls to be secure https

3782944
width	height
i noticed that jquery ui is setting the width and height on that div dynamically

3782944
width	height
set the width height of the overlay to be the width height of the document then bind a function on the window resize event to adjust the overlay width height to match the new document width height

3782946
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
-moz-border-radius is for firefox -webkit-border-radius is for safari and google-chrome

3782974
maven	pom.xml
all seems fine until i run a clean followed by an install - then maven complains it cant find my top level pom.xml to install

3782974
jar	war
to add to things - there are 2 general types of components a jar component makes a single jar file and a j2ee component which produces ear war jar rar and config files

3782978
try-catch	exception-handling
inside tags or in handlers such as onclick in try-catch blocks and when an exception-handling occurs it gains control and does whatever it s supposed to do eg

3782987
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this page in firefox 3.6.8 google-chrome 6 and ie 9 beta

cpython	ironpython
jython ironpython cpython ctypes pyrex etc are excellent tools making python limitless with its capabilities let you code in all those diffirent languages frameworks runtimes always with python syntax

3783029
mouseover	mousedown
you could possibly circumvent this issue by changing the z-index of the object on a mouseover for an x-windows follow focus type affair or mousedown event so that it fires just before the draggable z-index kicks in that is bound to the .elementsiwanttodrag

3783034
post	get
into your function that you are attaching to the submit event of the form to ensure that the form doesn t just post or get the information to it s action url

i ve tried what is below but i can t get it to do put

3783154
apache	nginx
passenger and apache or nginx are great starting points

3783163
ant	maven
alternatively think about using ant or maven which supports this much more easily

3783186
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been editing css using firebug in firefox but recently noticed that google-chrome is rendering my pages much quicker with scrolling interactive elements etc and wanted to switch to it

3783188
pop-up	dialog
the problem i am having is that when i click anywhere in the dialog a new dialog pop-up and it seems to produce several of these in a row

imacros for ie firefox google-chrome is a very flexible web scraper and can be controlled from perl

3783237
button	checkbox
it refuses to draw anything other than the button checkbox and decorative frame the moment the manifest is in place

3783246
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t get a popup use the firefox or google-chrome network monitor to see what is happening when the request is made

3783278
children	parent
assume traversal begins at the root and halts when it finds node x which means the parent is linked to its children

3783295
post	get
read my blog post for a tutorial on how you get around this by registering callbacks

3783301
children	parent
so for occasions where i think the number of children will be very large i have used service methods with paging like getchildren parent parent int offset int count instead

3783306
getter	setter
a one-line getter setter or initializing constructor which will not slow a reader down is probably permissible

3783318
pop-up	dialog
when the pop-up is displayed the activities view stays dimmed in the background like with an alert dialog

3783333
jsf	seam	richfaces	tomahawk
in jsf 1.x which lacks the view scope you could achieve the desired behaviour by placing the bean in the request scope and using either tomahawk or richfaces or seam s conversation scope or myfaces orchestra

3783358
int	chars
int value zero sometimes referred to as the ascii nul chars

3783358
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from 1 through 31 except for alternate streams where these chars are allowed

3783394
post	get
when the params are included as an argument to urlopen a post request will be used instead of a get

you enable avro support by including the avro jar in your classpath then extends avro provided classes to implements your map and reduce tasks

3783441
sudoers	passwd
the user is setup in sudoers so as not to require a passwd so no prompt is needed

3783496
put	get	post	put	post	get
i m trying to see how i could apply get put post delete to the respective crud operations on my repository find insert update remove

3783496
post	get
with html.beginform you can specify a formmethod enumeration - but it only has get and post

3783496
post	get
he indicates a html form only supports get and post because i m new to rest-style web development i did not even know this to which i am partially ashamed

3783543
graphael	protovis
i ve seen graphael suggested and the single piece example code i ve seen on the website for a piechart makes it look much easier to use than protovis

3783577
folder	directory
a little further down there is a scriptalias and a directory telling apache where the cgi folder is... home dgnorton prj dfi build src ...which is the build output folder for my project

3783605
inherited	properties
assuming you mean parent as in the class that your child inherited from you can use the basetype properties of the type class

3783636
put	get	uiview	calayer
if you want a button that actually works on top of a calayer put that calayer into a uiview which is a subclass of uiresponder and add a uibutton to that view so it can get added to the event response chain

3783664
post	get
you could use post instead of get with index.php

3783686
folder	directory
it is typically the my documents folder on windows and the user s home directory on unix

3783702
ubuntu	linux
while learning perl i am also learning linux ubuntu so it is kinda fire-hose sipping time around here

3783708
int	boolean
but some models will have nodes that take on int values in some range while others will be boolean

3783762
for-loop	loops
another way of asking this same question if i compile with the c89 standard will the i of both for loops be accessible to the entire function and if i compile with the c99 standard will the i of the first for-loop be accessible to the entire function while the i of the second for-loop will be accessible by only the for-loop

3783816
metaclass	abc
since you don t have abc available you can do this with a simple metaclass

3783827
ubuntu	opensuse
not cogent to opensuse but under ubuntu 10 i found that the solution was

3783832
folder	directory
you should be able to use lib folder in your root directory unless it s changed in rails 3

3783883
firefox	safari
it turns out the above code works with safari displays but doesn t work with firefox 4 beta and doesn t even display in firefox 3.6

3783902
subtract	add
if x_1 is positive add all positive terms and subtract all negative terms

3783902
subtract	add
if x_1 is negative subtract all positive terms and add all negative terms

3783904
width	height
i ve ruled out the javascript that resizes the background because i can disable all javascript on the page except for the animation and manually add a large width and height attribute to the image and i get the same effect

3784004
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown
public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

3784015
tax	shipping
i could check total amount against his cart by accessing the database pulling his cart items and re-totaling their prices plus shipping and tax

3784015
tax	shipping
but that is a lot of heavy lifting just to check for tampering multiple db queries plus 2 web service calls per item to get shipping and tax

3784057
children	parent
you could then write the following jquery code to check the parent checkbox when either of the children are checked

3784067
uiview	subviews
probably the reason you see all the buttons despite the container being too small is that uiview do not clip their subviews by default

3784117
phpstorm	webstorm
it s a known limitation idea doesn t support creating project without any module type like phpstorm webstorm products since it supports many languages and technologies

3784117
phpstorm	webstorm
this may change in the future idea versions as we plan to support opening phpstorm webstorm projects in idea and vice versa

3784149
google-chrome	safari
webkit s 3d transitions for css3 are hardware rendered on some browsers google-chrome newer releases of mobile safari for the ios thus making 3d canvas animations also hardware accelerated this is i think how google gets it s scaling to work on the ios

3784222
post	get
collection select_for_payroll get post

3784226
onmouseover	onclick
all the hacks - expand the div onmouseover onclick etc do not look great might still break your design and depending on the amount of data the user can enter would still not be effective

3784263
int	chars
hey i m looking to convert a int that is inputed by the user into 4 bytes that i am assigning to a chars array

3784274
getter	setter
in the normal circumstances i ll just declare getter setter synchronized and will be happy with it

3784292
pop-up	dialog
the idea is if the togglebutton is turned on it pop-up a single-choice listview dialog that s the list of tags

3784299
puts	gets
i am looking for the most performant way to arrange usage of the datacache and datacache factory for appfabric caching calls for between 400 and 700 cache gets per page load and barely any puts

3784299
puts	gets
but once you have the factory object and the cache that you want to work with you can simply reuse those objects to do puts and gets into the cache and you should see much faster performance.

3784299
put	get
so if the put get volume is very high these tcp connections might be bottlenecked

3784321
post	get
the reason that you re mostly familiar with get and post is because a regular old browser can only get or post a url especially when submitting a form

3784321
post	get
if you want to do crud without ajax then you can always post a product or use get for a delete method with the id in the url caveat to that make sure the delete method is protected behind authorization or a web crawler will gladly consume your gets and delete all your data...

3784321
put	get	post	put	post	get
if you don t want to build a rest api then don t sweat the fact that you re not using delete just use get with the id in the url or you re not using put just use post with the product entity in the post body

3784322
put	get
no backslash if you put a backslash before a character that has no special meaning you just get the same character but without the backslash

3784341

width	height
textblocks that have no height or width specified will expand automatically until they

3784362
google-chrome	firefox
right now i have this get request which works in google-chrome but not in ie or firefox

3784367
super	extends
without having done this exact thing in practice myself it seems to me that it s advantageous to denormalize in batches at the database level reason being that the search server is good at finding info super fast but the database server is better at getting the matching data assuming it extends out to related columns which are not in the search index

3784437
post	get
now the question is i want to get the following http post please notice the xml part before the file attachments to also create a post with 2 attachments with no additional changes to posts_controller or routes.rb

3784457
postorder	inorder
use one of the tree traversal techniques inorder pre-order postorder to visit each node and store the sum in a variable

3784459
rss	feed
first i m sure your in your view its style rss feed

3784496
rss	feed
since wordpress blogger and pretty much all other blogging sites have an rss feed that should make it pretty easy to import posts because the data is just xml

3784496
rss	feed
the only problem i can think of is that if a user s rss feed has some kind of excerpt mode enabled

3784508
implements	extends
can we make any class to behave as interface and so that we can write implements in place of extends while creating any child class of that class .what is the actual difference between implements and extends internally

3784516
google-chrome	firefox
i am using the javascript to open a child window using window.showmodaldialog i have retuen a value from the child page is working fine in ie and firefox but is not working in google-chrome browser is there any work around or alternative for it to work in google-chrome as well

3784745
implements	extends
the java language specification makes it clear that you can only extends classes and implements interfaces

3784745
implements	extends
what is the actual difference between implements and extends internally

3784745
implements	extends
implements registers an interface extends registers a parent class

3784749
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
you could override onstart onpause onresume onstop oncreate ondestroy etc functions by adding toasts to see the sequence

3784869
screens	hdpi
use a combination of dpi hdpi etc and orientation land port to make the resources as customized as possible on different screens

3784968
google-chrome	safari
no problem in google-chrome ie and safari

3785057
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout then with the combination of clearinterval

3785065
width	height
this is by design you must set the width and height of each image

3785184
udp	tcp
the source port number which identifies the process that sent the data and the destination port number which identifies the process that is to receive the data are contained in the first header word of each tcp segment and udp packet

3785279
serializable	deserialization
the only things i can change are mydate class and serializable deserialization code

3785333
hide	show
you need to make a show hide function the proper javascript way

3785333
hide	show
what you are doing at first with the i assume jquery is beyond me - just declare a simple function containing the code you already have to show hide and attach it to the onload-event

3785359
versioning	upgrade
in the updater that runs schemaupdate start adding upgrade methods for each versioning

3785407
drawrect	layoutsubviews
then your custom layoutsubviews method will be called immediately instead of when it would normally be called in the regular uikit run loop event sequence after event handling but before drawrect

3785431
min	max
this min and max applies to all ids in that section

3785482
width	height
the skateboarder image should have a width and height which you should have available

3785491
width	height
to get the image to appear correctly that is to scale in the pdf file you need to divide the width x cm height y cm in the svg header by 1.33 96 72

3785558
public	protected
as far as i know there re only 3 access-specifiers in c++ private public protected

3785599
hash	md5
if you store passwords in a file or anywhere really you should hash them using md5 or sha1

3785604
innodb	myisam
you will need to be using innodb tables to support transactions and other data integrity features that myisam can t provide

3785688
sorting	filtering
actually i have a table in which i fetch the data from sqlite database i have done the paging and filtering for the grid using perl now i need to do the sorting

you may either use server-side validation if it s an option or write your own client-side customvalidator

3786121
client-side	server-side
the simplest solution is to turn off client-side validation as you are working with asp.net so the server-side validator which uses the .net implementation will validate accordingly

if an attacker somehow gets to read your database records he still cannot effectively crack your password hash until he knows the system-wide salt

3787414
pbkdf2	salt
considering the rise of multi-purpose multi-core systems graphics cards programmable micro-controllers etc. it may be worth using algorithms with high computation effort along with salt to counter brute-force cracking using multiple hashing like pbkdf2

3787443

3787488
wxpython	pyqt
i came to the conclusion that pyqt is currently the best choice for a modern powerful well-maintained and portable gui mainly because of some of the shortcomings of its main contender wxpython see below

3787488
wxpython	pyqt
two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter

3787522

3788053
implements	extends
especially the paragraphs how to extends the default user profile and implements a custom user profile should answer the question you ask

3788061
getter	setter
you could add the getter setter to the interface then let the compiler tell you where your implementers are and it should be a simple copy paste to place the field getter and setter into every class after the first

3788068
folder	dir
looks first into resources if nothing found it then looks in the lproj dir folder

3788091
lan	intranet

3788674
svg	vml
if you know a thing or two about svg you ll know that ie doesn t support it but it does support vml

3788688
getter	setter
you re violating the single responsibility principle by having one function be both a getter and a setter

3788688
getter	setter
in c# it s just syntactic sugar and is converted into a getter and setter just like you should write it in php

3788688
getter	setter
and the compiler will generate a private backing field and your getter and setter functions for you

3788692
dictionary	map
if you insist on using regex this would work taking zoltan balazs dictionary map approach

3788884
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the uinavigationcontroller will already contain a uinavigationbar so there isn t much you have to worry about

3788919
outputstream	inputstream
you can just map a local disk file system folder on the given url or register a servlet to listen on that url which in turn gets the image as inputstream from disk and writes it to outputstream of the response you can find here a basic example

3788933
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
from those you can build subtraction multiplication long division and longer shifts

3788933
multiplying	division	128bit	64bit
keep in mind that multiplying two 64bit numbers gives you a 128bit number and long division may need to be able to take a 128bit dividend

3788934
children	parent
when you refresh the parent all references to the children are lost

3788934
children	parent
children get all the resources the parent left behind.

3788934
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox but does not work in ie

3789019
postgresql	mysql
when i was using mysql it wasn t a problem but now that i use postgresql i see the following issue

3789039
realloc	malloc
your original version may occasionally accidently work if the realloc occurs immedaitely after the malloc so there is space to expand the memory block in place

3789039
memcpy	memmove
now to answer your actual question since we are dealing with simple data items ints you can use memmove or memcpy to copy them memmove is safe if the memory blocks overlap

3789039
memcpy	memmove
as for the efficency of memmove memcpy that s pretty much an unknown area

3789039
memcpy	memmove
memmove does a bit more range checking then memcpy so it ll be a hair slower the memcpy

3789043
put	get
you can look at the system stored procedures code in ssms and see where things get put

3789050
memcpy	memmove
you can use the memmove memcpy function which is likely to be highly optimized

3789070
width	height
if you want to make sure that the images completely cover each other up you could also set the height and width with the css or you can just make sure that the images are all the same size or that the ones on top are bigger than the ones below top and below dependent on order in the html or z-index

3789140
division	multiplication
if not you have to use some clever multiplication division

3789140

3789140
multiplying	modulo
multiplying the second index for 16 modulo 255

3789140
multiplying	modulo
multiplying the third index for 16 modulo 255

3789171
public	protected
this class of course would not be able to override any members of tbase unless perhaps if a constraint was applied and would have to repeat all of tbase s public + protected constructors untouched - automatically forwarding the calls to the base

3789197
swt	swing
you are trying to use a swing class buttongroup with swt

3789211
apache	nginx
it would help a lot to see some of your former apache configuration and current nginx configuration to see how they re set up to put expiration headers on outbound files

hide	show	width	height
hide the scrollbar get the width height in the next line of code and show the scrollbar again

3789308
gridview	repeater
what you ll want to do is use a repeater or possibly a gridview

3789358
gridview	repeater
given your question description though i d say you d be better off using a gridview or repeater as mentioned by kirk woll

3789367
postgresql	mysql
i can see mysql mysqli and postgresql but no mssql

3789379
inherited	properties
this won t work for properties inherited from the prototype chain however

3789415
implements	extends
edit the other thing you can do if you want to have different editor display formats as i do is extends the dataannotationsmodelmetadataprovider implements a new editformatattribute that provides the format when in edit mode this overrides the dataannotations setting the supply both a display format and edit format via the two attributes

3789450
hash	md5
change tracking keep md5 crc hash of the source files on record last modified date correlate the two to determine if the files have changed

3789484
ienumerable	ilist
this solution makes use of the fact that when an itemscontrol is bound to an ilist implementation rather than an ienumerable implementation it will not enumerate the entire list and instead only accesses the items required for display

3789542
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this should never happen for a view controller that is currently visible only for controllers that are somewhere in the navigation stack part of uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller but not currently visible

3789553
int	chars
otherwise your linker would be looking for functions with names like _z1hic when you were looking for void h int chars

3789584
width	height
2 x 1920 y 0 width 1280 height 1080

3789616
width	height
you can still use linearlayout but make the width height in dip units

3789621
codeigniter	kohana
usable for me being simplistic in the codeigniter and kohana sense i.e more minimalist

3789621
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter feels a little verbose especially when compared to dingo but both dingo and kohana and underdocumented which is a majour turnoff

3789624
stdout	fflush
copies error n into stdout s buffer which is now buf and then fflush that to the screen

you have to show it onmouseover of the span element and hide it when the use clicks somewhere else on the page other than the popup or probably when he hits the close option on the popup

3789801
portrait	landscape
for such complex views that need to be presented differently in portrait and landscape this is recommended way of implementing it by apple

3789898
helpers	actioncontroller
create a helpers in javascript where you provide an actioncontroller and id to create a link

3789935
onkeyup	onkeydown
you shouldn t exclusively use onkeyup or onkeydown for detecting user input

3789935
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you should use the html 5 event oninput where available firefox 2+ google-chrome safari 4+ opera 10 and internet explorer s onpropertychange event

3789935
onkeyup	onkeydown
for browsers that don t support either event you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check which is a little better than onkeyup

3790019
division	modulo
it is pretty straightforward to implement and allows you calculate primes without using division or modulo

3790132
client-side	server-side
use httputility.urlencode server-side or ecodeuricomponent client-side

3790580
jboss	weblogic

it should be easy to translate to actionscript c# you should try this and post follow-up questions with your code if you get stuck this way you ll have the best learning effect

3790615
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s also important understand that one of the features of the incognito window google-chrome or private window safari firefox is that they have a separate cookie space that gets removed when all private windows are closed

3790632
folder	directory
i am not sure how to give the complete details of this particular library mygui but i can point you to the website where you can download it to try and see if it is able to find the header files that are included in the project if it doesn t compile that is fine and it is probably because of additional dependencies but it should at least be able to find files in the common folder especially when i put absolute paths in additional include directory

3790667
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately vb.net implemented an anachronism from vb6 where that was legal

3790689

ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
because you are supposed to use the maven maven-antrun-plugin if you want to execute ant tasks not the maven ant plugin which is used to generate build files for ant 1.6.2 or above from the pom.xml

3790941
ant	maven
echo hello ant from maven

3791004

3791155
asterisk	pbx
php can be used using agi to programm asterisk pbx

when a user mouses over the link for that thread the threadpreview div should unroll to it s original height to show the content and onmouseout it should roll back up to 19px to hide the content

3791170
vb.net	vb6
basically vb.net has support for the err.number property and it works pretty much the same as in vb6 however when upgrading to c# the microsoft.visualbasic.information.err .number is not populated correctly and you should not rely on it

3791180
caliburn	prism
my recomandation if the app is not too big better use mvvm light and after that deppending of your requirements prism last version nroute or caliburn

3791196
stdout	stderr
this is a little tricky if stdout or stderr is the console we need to output with writeconsole

3791196
stdout	stderr
also it really should be using _get_osfhandle to get the handle to stdout and stderr rather than assuming they re assigned to the standard handles but that api doesn t seem to have any pywin binding

3791221
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is not supported in many browsers only firefox 4 google-chrome 4 and safari 5 currently support it but it allows the connection to the server to remain open and then the server can send a message to the client

3791353
calloc	malloc
the reason that malloc is normally used instead of calloc is because there is a run-time cost for setting the memory to all-zeros and if you re planning to immediately fill the memory with useful data as is common there s no point in zeroing it out first

3791361
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is generated with html css and jquery and works amazingly on firefox safari and google-chrome as you can guess it has major quirks on ie8

3791384

the application works correct on firefox and google-chrome but on safari 5 it says that safari does not support geolocation

3791463
getter	setter
your metadata class is ill-designed javabean it does not conform to the spec the setter uses a parameter of type metadatatypeenum but the return type of the getter is string

3791471
realloc	malloc
since you can pass realloc a null pointer as the previous pointer but malloc is most likely not implemented like that because it would slow down all mallocs and because realloc probably uses malloc

3791475
alloca	stackframe
on some systems you even have an alloca call that lets you allocate variable length chunks in the stackframe

3791499
objectdatasource	detailsview
and this is the code for the objectdatasource and the detailsview

3791520
post	get
if i send via winhttp using get or post with a null body or through an html form using post with a body everything works as expected

3791525
for-loop	arrays
a straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays using a for-loop or list comprehension or use a higher dimensional arrays where each of these 1d arrays is a row in your 2d arrays which is generally faster

3791562
printf	strtod
since you asked about scanf one thing you should note is that posix requires printf and a subsequent scanf or strtod to reconstruct the original value exactly as long as sufficiently significant digits at least decimal_dig i believe were printed

3791570
mongoid	cancan
i ve managed to get cancan and mongoid version 2 to work together pretty well on a rails 3 app

i want to take an bitmap of a glyph that is smaller than 32x32 width and height are not necessarily powers of 2 and put it into a texture so i can render it

3791671
put	get
watir should not be used unless you are willing to put in the long development required to get flash component working for internet explorer and the extra coding needed for testing flash

3791699

you would also like to use f ajax here to improve user experience by partial submit instead of submission the whole page by javascript s submit

3791739
google-chrome	safari
or google-chrome or safari comes with web page inspector tool

3791751
maven	pom.xml
what you re describing here is definitely doable with the maven assembly plugin and one good way to implement this would be to create a dedicated distribution project module to declare dependencies on other modules in its pom.xml and to use dependencysets in a custom assembly descriptor

3791752
filtering	grouping
it supports lots of form elements grouping forms filtering inputs validation built-in validations and custom ones input escaping and element ordering

3791767
super	self
make them log a message nslog s self sel_getname _cmd and super -call

3791812
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works beautifully in firefox google-chrome and safari but when run in ie it prompts you to save a file and does not execute the js

3791814
cube	skybox
when drawing the cube map you also want to remove translation from the modelview matrix but keep the rotation this causes the skybox to follow the camera but allows you to look around at different parts of the sky

3791823
swrl	owl
for swi-prolog you could look to thea2 which has support for swrl in prolog and can also be attached to external reasoners via jpl such as hermit for owl swrl reasoning or pellet etc

3791826
hide	show
while developing though i found almost all my code goes into 1 .js file and 1 .html file where i have a lot of div s which i show and hide when appropriate

3791830
onresume	onpause
i implement onpause and onresume for every tab to remove and start listening for location accordingly

true in those days lisp tended towards dynamic scoping â scheme and common lisp hadn t really taken on yet

3791900
pull	push
you should also read the article linked to by jmohr on the subtle differences between push and fetch pull git push not send changes to remote git repository

3791917
width	height
i tried specifying width and height both as attributes themselves and within a style attribute and find it frustrating that the images will not take up space if they don t load

3791919
int	chars
there s really no difference between an array of int and an array of int which have each been assigned to chars representations if a subsequence is what you re looking for

3791922
wav	ogg
i m wondering if there s a way to transmit a sound such as a wav or ogg during a call such that the person on the other end can hear it

3791926
width	height
also the reason specifying the width and height within the attribute didn t work is because images are by default in-line elements

3791926
width	height
had you specified display block the image would ve accepted the width and height values

3791926
width	height
i m not sure why firefox doesn t respect the width height attributes but still

3791979
phpunit	simpletest
until cake 2.0 comes out and they move to phpunit i d like to figure out how to run simpletest with hudson

3792019
public	protected
the most efficient way is if you do not use private protected but public members you accees those public members from outside like instance- member

3792041
sorting	filtering
if you can load up all the data at once then you can use the sorting functionality of an arraycollection to filtering data as the user types

3792106
public	protected
edit perhaps it is because you property is protected not public

3792119
set	bag
each bag contains a set of marbles

3792123
hash	md5
if they are expected to be the same byte-by-bye like nulluserexception mentioned the easiest solution is to use a hash like md5

3792174
execvp	posix
posix says that a program run with execvp which is what subprocess.popen uses should inherit the signal mask of the calling process

3792245
folder	dir

3792253
opera	safari
i tried in ie6.0 opera safari all are ok

3792379
folder	directory
add a folder to your visual studio projects called deployment and set the copy to output directory attribute accordingly

3792411
children	parent
in this case if it makes sense for parent to have a map of children then by all means model it this way

3792431
hide	show
if you only want it to show in edit mode you can selectively show hide it based on that too

3792451

looking in the logfiles on my appserver both android browsers are sending a post followed immediately by a get for the same page

3792494
matplotlib	scipy
scipy numpy and matplotlib

3792524
cxxtest	cppunit
i ve used cxxtest and cppunit and found cxxtest to be easier to use it automates generating some of the skeleton code - on the downside it needs python installed and lightweight no libraries entirely header based

3792578
width	height
the zero alert will show an origin of 0 0 and an appropriate width and height 284 141 on 3 gs

3792578
width	height
all other alerts will show 0 0 for width height

3792578
width	height
if you comment out the zero alert line first then firstalert and secondalert will show the correct width and height but third and fourth alerts will show 0 0

3792578
width	height
i have a workaround right now that involves grabbing the width and height the first time i create the alert with an image and placing them in some class variables i ve retained so i can use them later but that s less than ideal assumes all text and images will be same sized and i also need to make sure i call an alert with an image first

3792583
folder	directory
the issue with this code is that it works if the process is launched from the same directory but if i try to load from a folder within this directory like say .. shell then the path is actually wrong it will include this directory

3792601
execvp	execl
you d then have to decide what to do if execl returns - you can either give up or search for the program via but in that case why not use execvp in the first place to save yourself the pain

3792619
swt	swing
if you still insist on cross-platform desktop gui application your best bet is still swing or maybe swt

3792639
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to install wordpress...the install script will not run in firefox or google-chrome

3792677
pull	push
they both pull changeset 1 and work on it then they both commit their changes and push the changes back to bitbucket

3792681
folder	directory
you could instead of copying the debug files to the obj folder in your app tree add the other build directory obj folder to gdb s symbol search path

3792699
post	get
if you are using php make your post or get variables safe and sql validate by using mysql_real_escape_string

xna	slimdx
also insted of using xna it might be better to use slimdx if your just making this for the pc

3792747
fileinputstream	filechannel
it s missing some fundamental imo features and it has lots of ways to do the same thing to read primitives from a file you can either use randomaccessfile datainputstream + fileinputstream fileimageinputstream filechannel + bytebuffer and maybe even more

3792767
integer	unsigned
using size_t for counts and as a generic unsigned integer type is almost always a design error

3792796

now i ll warn you i m not equipped to check all this since i avoid svn and cvs like i avoid ms-dos -- and for much the same reason

3792818

3792915
int	double
for 32-bit int double can represent every value precisely

3792915
int	double
when you compare a double to a 64-bit int however there will be potential roundoff error if the int is greater than 2 52

3792925
g++	gcc
even if gcc now can compile c++ code it is advised to use g++

3792946
google-chrome	firefox
works great with firefox google-chrome ie8 but in ie7 the sub navigation doesn t sit below the parent instead it sits below parent to the right

3792988
post	get
and change post method to get

3792990
int	double
the int gets converted to a double

3792990
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers can be represented exactly as floating point numbers as long as they fit into the mantissa + 1 bit for signed integers it is mantissa + 2 bits except for the most negative integer 2 -31 for 32 bit ints

3792995
put	get
if you want pass data you can put it in link as query string and get it again with get or put it in session or cookie

i am abit confused with gvim as the instructions said to create .vim directory but i have also found a vimfiles directory in a etc folder

3793012
subtract	add
then increase is where we decide how much to add or subtract to the variable

3793012
for-loop	loops
i noticed that with the for-loop i can move the increase part to the statement if i want to but i can t in a while loops put an increase in parenthesis or declare a variable in the parenthesis that initialization thing in a for-loop

3793045
for-loop	loops
for example a for-loop can easily be expanded into a while loops

3793103
button	checkbox
i would like to customize ccnet web dashboard to add a checkbox next to force build button to indicate that particular build is for release or not

3793247
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mousemove	mousedown
mouseover mousemove mousedown

3793247
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is currently supported in firefox 3.6+ safari 4 and google-chrome - so if you re happy for it to only work on these browsers then this is a much simpler option with the added advantage that it works for hover events too not just click events

3793322
pop-up	dialog
you may not count this as the answer you wanted but i have used css dialog pop-up with great effect in some of my web apps

3793338
post	get
then it will be sent both ways get and post so then

3793354
codeigniter	cakephp
if you insist on php then i would strongly suggest learning it in conjunction with an established framework such as cakephp or codeigniter i would not suggest the zend framework as it s rather complex for a beginner but ymmv on that

3793358
put	get
moreover if you defines the partial class with the right name but you put it in a different namespace you ll get in trouble as well

3793460
client-side	server-side
whatever user submits from client-side is not controlled by server-side but you can

3793475
getter	setter
this is an unnecessary step as a synthesized property already generates getter and setter

3793483
for-loop	arrays
yes it requires nested for-loop because you are merging small arrays elements to large arrays recursively

3793528

children	parent
one option is to expose getchildren on the parent object add the child to the returned collection of children and allow hibernate to cascade delete automatically

codeigniter	cakephp
i second the idea of using cakephp or codeigniter

3794813
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp

3794834
width	height
the problem is the textblock doesn t have a height width actual height actual width or desired size since i set the height and width to double.nan so the textblock would auto size

3794843
post	get
when binding they will first look at the value in the get post request to see if the value is present and after that in the model

3794850
accessor	properties
i know it s often advisable to use the properties accessor and i know it s important to use instead of but

int	boolean
by the way i often saw conversions from a boolean to an int for the sole purpose of doing a comparison of the two values generally in implementations of compareto method

qpushbutton	qwidget
in qt this is done by creating your own little reusable component subclass of qpushbutton which reimplements qwidget keypressevent

haskell	scheme
there are a number of curry implementations for scheme -- none can be as elegant as haskell since there functions are always unary functions so everything can be curried

3794995
scheme	racket
but this can of course be implemented in a sufficiently powerful scheme like racket .

3795026
superclass	subclassing
i thought that in a situation whatever method is called on sc will be searched for in subclassing at runtime although they ll be searched in superclass at compile-time

3795026
superclass	subclassing
it turns out as i now think i understand that whatever method is called on sc will be searched for in superclass at both compile-time and run-time unless subclassing has provided a better version of the method

3795061
preferenceactivity	listpreference
i am aware of listpreference but i want to use it outside the context of a preferenceactivity and inside arbitrary views

3795066

keydown	keyup
windows media center must have lower level key hooks and you must implement a keyup keydown sending solution to exploited the hooks

3795246
oncreate	onstart
another way to handle orientation changes is instead of overriding onconfigurationchanged overriding oncreate onstart or onresume such that

3795246
portrait	landscape
and then specifying two layouts - one for portrait one for landscape

3795246
portrait	landscape
the portrait version of the layout would remain at res layout whatever.xml and the landscape version would live in res layout-land whatever.xml

integer	unsigned
every enum type is just an integer which can be 8- 16- 32- or 64-bit and signed or unsigned

3795281
post	get
additionally restricting access methods to http get and post makes your life easier because php has and variables but not and the like

3795281
post	put
however you could send post requests with a special variable specifying the method so to emulate put delete head or options operations

3795281
post	get
when supporting other methods than get and post use to determine the method used and read the data sent along with the request from the special file php input with file_get_contents php input

3795305

got it fixed i had to add iusr user and iis_iusrs group for iis 7 only as my security settings to my virtual directory folder that propagates to the sub folder

3795334

my question is this is there a java library of some sort that can create html files based on xsl-fo documents or can i do this with throwing xslt at it

3795366
onclientclick	datalist	updatepanel	onclientclick
i have a datalist that has a collection of people bound to it with each person having a button that when clicked needs to cause an asynchronous postback so the onclientclick event handler can change the details shown in an updatepanel the datalist is outside of the updatepanel

3795366
updatepanel	scriptmanager
one assigns an asyncpostbacktrigger to the updatepanel and the other was to registerasyncpostbackcontrol to the scriptmanager

3795366

3795448
outputstream	inputstream
use inputstream outputstream for it

3795468
serializable	deserialization
if it s too slow then you can look at alternatives - using a different kind of serializable method partially deserializing the objects at startup to get the ui up and running and then continuing the deserialization in the background or whatever

3795496
getter	setter
to get values inside progressbar you can subclass it add data function getter and setter and set properties from there - this class will be item renderer

3795513
folder	directory
i have a folder full of ruby files and when i try and require one file in another that is in the same directory using require file i get a loaderror but when i use require . file everything works fine

3795606
put	get
i m thinking that i have to convert the form data into a get string put that on the end of the url to open and then send that to colorbox

3795631
put	get
depending on where you put that it makes sense that you d get an error

3795667
post	get
then submit the data using get post or ajax

3795667
post	get
change get to post or ajax

3795667
put	get

when you attempt to pass the ostream by value you attempt to make a copy of the stream which is not valid because stream objects are noncopyable that is they do not define a copy constructor

3795756
spaces	delimiter
that is the application will have as input a data file spaces delimiter text file - with the items encoded as integers and a percentage given as an integer input 2 represents 2

3795776
int	chars
as already said in the comments the main trick here is to convert the ascii chars 0 and 1 to the int 0 and 1 which is done by subtracting the value of 0

3795809
treeviewitem	listboxitem
i created a style for treeviewitem that makes the treeviewitem look and behave just like listboxitem this is really not mandatory - but i preferred it like this beside the fact that the basic style has stretching issues which i had to fix with styling

3795829
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

gif	png
just to recap in ie7 and ie 8 transparent png and gif images in links sometimes have a black border or shadow around them

3795945
ant	maven
if this is not an option and if you can t configure hibernate in your spring configuration file then you ll have to handle that at build time using some filtering features from your build tool ant maven etc

3795960
getter	setter
instead of a getter and setter method use an accessor method

3795964
int	chars
escape.cpp in function â int main int chars â

3795985
postgresql	mysql
but when it is mysql postgresql or mongodb there will be a layer which when the data is thought to be saved already it is actually in the memory cache of the dbms.

3795990
interpolation	splines
i have a set of points which are interpolation with an unknown method or to be more precise the method is known but it can be one of the several - it can be polynomial interpolation splines simple linear .

3796031
width	height
note that if a rule applies height or width to the body element and thusly the gadget itself that style isn t applied when the stylesheet is switched - you have to set body width and height separately

3796081
int	chars
you can t just treat a memory buffer of int as chars - a string is made up of one byte chars typically int are 4 bytes typically

3796081
int	chars
casting a chars to an int int 0 does not intelligently convert - the int that comes out of that is a decimal 48 not a decimal 0 there is a function atoi that will do that as well as other better ones or the other suggestion to use subtraction

3796089
put	get
you could put that functionality into a user-defined function and then call the function instead of using that code but other than that it s not going to get an awful lot terser

3796101
hash	md5
you can use md5 hash or sha1

3796105
floating-point	fractions
assuming x is a floating-point number x - floor x will get you the fractions part

3796138
pop-up	dialog
one way is to have dialog boxes that pop-up and say things like â œmagic to happen hereâ

3796171
ssl	https
it is overridden in the net https package which is probably what you should be using if you want to do any ssl stuff

3796243
width	height
your change handlers are using the width and height of the mytestcircle usercontrol which haven t been set you should either set them or access size values that have been set

3796248
gif	png
however because no similar function exists for gif files all i can do is covert the gif to either jpeg or png but then i lose the animation

3796346
oncreate	setcontentview
first off you re calling setcontentview tv so you re not actually seeing any views from the xml only the textview you initialized in oncreate

3796374
pop-up	dialog
on stackoverflow when you click stackexchange in the top left it opens a pop-up like dialog

3796405

3796414
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation tools like valgrind and higher end thread profiling are unavailable

3796450
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews
a faster way to display an updated bitmap may be to just assign the bitmap context to the calayer of a uiview a subviews sized and or transformed to your desired destination rect if required

3796469
width	height
i tried using a textbox inside a viewbox like below but the text-wrapping doesn t work if i don t specify the textblock width and height

3796469
width	height
if i do specify the width and height to the same size as the viewbox obviously zooming doesn t happen

3796516
inherited	properties
but i am not going to use inherited i prefer to use navigation properties instead

3796548
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve written non-plugin extensions for firefox but not safari or google-chrome

3796548
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari and google-chrome both restrict extensions much more than firefox does and only allow extensions written in javascript

3796548
google-chrome	safari
i don t know if it s possible to have an extension in safari or google-chrome interact with a browser plugin written in npapi

3796598
yacc	bison
i have a generated scanner from flex which the output from is not consumed by yacc or bison

3796612
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for example doesn t work at all in google-chrome only modifies the actual drop down in safari and stretches the graphic in a very ugly way in firefox

3796629
jobs	cron
it is possible that certain web hosts are not allowing wordpress cron jobs

3796629
jobs	cron
plus you have to specify paths not urls in cron jobs

3796630
portrait	landscape
what i m trying to do is manipulate the photo if it s in portrait as opposed to landscape

3796630
width	height
the problem i m experiencing is that when i use javascript to grab a portrait photo s properties when it s loading the height is significantly lower than what it should be and the width is bigger than it should be

3796630
portrait	landscape
so when the function runs through this image the image is considered landscape not portrait and skips over

3796650
put	get
you d have to put some logic into it such that if the filesize gets smaller you would assume it s being replaced and then wait for it to get bigger until it stops growing and stays the same size for some duration

3796708
backslash	double-quotes
in double-quotes backslash-punctuation puts a backslash into the output outside of a certain list of punctuation

3796708
single-quotes	backslash
and in single-quotes everything is literal and backslash doesn t even protect you against a closing single-quote

3796741
jettison	jax-rs
use jackson jax-rs provider instead of alternatives badgerfish jettison which does not do xml-to-json conversion

3796887
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
all browsers i tested this code over years in ie5-ie8 firefox opera google-chrome safari ... are sending mynewvalue to the server

3796936
min	max
i d appreciate it if someone can fix my code or show me.another problem i m having is getting the loop to terminate and do max min calculation within the while loop when the input is equal to 0

3796936
min	max
i put the min max checking outside the master while loop this allowed the input of 0 to be entered in the array

3796974
min	max
you should also make a decision about calculating the min and max as you accumulate the data or in a pass through the data when done

3796987
min	max
you are asking two questions about the strategy for the min max computation and for the loop

3796987
min	max
then wrap your min max detection in the appropriate loop instruction

3796990
post	get
am i obliged to use string type in this method if i want to authorize both post and get

3797072
post	get
i know that both index and create share the same url using get and post respectively but i m not sure how to specify which to use from a url

3797116
put	get
all you need to do differently is put that text in a file and get it s contents before deleting it

3797146
chgrp	chmod
you can use chgrp to add the group and chmod g+w to give write permission

3797160
portrait	landscape
in the orientationchanged method i specified that i want the space to be 50 in portrait and 100 in landscape but when i run the application and switch to landscape mode what happens is that the cells that were already loaded in portrait mode still have a space of 50 between them while those which haven t been loaded in portrait mode and are loaded in landscape mode have a space of 100

3797193
button	checkbox
i ve got a page that has a simple one checkbox form with a submit button for users to mark that item as want to play.

3797193
button	checkbox
given the simplicity i d like to replace it with a single div and graphic of a toggle button or switch or something so that users can click it to mark but not have to bother with the silly single checkbox and submit button which is rather ugly

3797199
ubuntu	debian
if you re running lamp off of debian ubuntu you do want dotdeb in your sources in general and not just for this specific issue

3797217

maven	pom.xml
however to be run the maven command must be run in the directory where the pom.xml file is located

3797320
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml file describes your project and it is the basis of maven 2

3797320
maven	pom.xml
this plugin is the only case of maven usage without a pom.xml file

3797326
portrait	landscape
if the ipad is in landscape mode the splitviewcontroller still thinks it s in portrait mode for some reason and the frame for the root and detail view controller are wrong

3797326
portrait	landscape
during the first call the frame rect is 320 x 980 for the root controller if the ipad is rotated to portrait and then back to landscape mode the frame rect becomes 320 x 724

3797326
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i have tried to change the frame size in viewdidload and viewwillappear of the root controller but it didn t change anything

3797395
width	height
they resize the image width to 20 of the container but the height stays relative to the image size. im trying to make squares

3797445
width	height
once you use a for width or height i think the browser tries to preserve the aspect ratio regardless of the value for the other dimension

3797453
folder	directory
it s found in your the bin folder of your jre installation directory

3797512
width	height
the percentages in height and width attributes of an image works with the container it is contained in

3797512
width	height
so to achieve the fluid effect just trying putting in a container around the img and give image height and width 100

3797512
width	height
and now you should be changing the height and width of the container in percentages

3797512
width	height
with this your image will achieve a height and width of 500 100

3797531

sqldatasource	formview
i have simple application with formview and sqldatasource

3797612
udp	tcp
i suggest using tcp for transferring files it solves all the trouble you will have to solve yourself when using udp

3797624
post	get
you could change your code so that the post returned a redirect to a get for the pdf

3797637
google-chrome	firefox
the image upload works perfect in google-chrome and firefox however when it comes to ie 8

3797708
profiling	benchmarking
i do not really wish to profiling because i was wanting to do many different small benchmarking on different simple functions

3797736
client-side	server-side
since javascript is client-side it runs on the browser and c# asp.net is server-side it runs on the server inside iis it will always be triggered prior to any javascript function runs

3797747
ant	pom.xml
the ant build.xml has references to a few pom.xml files

3797749
nswindow	nsresponder
for example nswindow and nsview both inherit from nsresponder so are they siblings

3797770
onresume	onpause
i imagine it would be sufficient to update the timer flag in oncreate onpause and onresume

3797784
hide	show
then there should be the other part with read less to swap links back again and to hide readmore_holder but since i cannot even get the alert to show up i m kinda lost

3797805
hide	show
that way you can just show it when you hide the text instead of recreating it

3797839
integer	unsigned
is way too large for an unsigned integer

3797843
super	self
if self super init

3797871
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox 3.6.10 it works really nice but in google-chrome 6.0.472.63 opera 10.62 when i tried to scroll down the selectbox list in this case the div with an overflow it disappears

3797871
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
view example here and please try it on firefox and google-chrome opera

3797893
debian	linux
take a debian gnu linux minimal install

3797894
int	double
c++ doesn t have such kind of automatic casting facilities even if you could build a class that mimics such behavior by having an int and a float a double would be even better iirc it lets you get up to 170

3797900
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
as for using manualresetevent or autoresetevent instead - you could but personally i prefer using the monitor methods unless i need some of the other features of wait handles such as atomically waiting for any all of multiple handles

3797910
textview	imageview
let s assume i got a list of imageview and textview with linearlayout

3797930
accessor	properties
if you are just using straight accessor then stick to properties unless you come from python and are turned off by the sigil hehe otherwise

3797931
bluecloth	rdiscount
afaik not bluecloth nor rdiscount offers built-in support for extensions

3797955
macbook	isight
i d like to grab a frame from my macbook pro isight in c++ and do some elaborations on it

3797991
strlen	strcmp
recently i attended an interview where they asked me to write a c program to concatenate two strings without using strcat strlen and strcmp and that function should not exceed two 2 lines

3797997
int	chars
it seems that gcc considers chars and number literals as int by default

3798043
udp	tcp
boost.asio is a very good c++ portable socket library which provides both tcp and udp sockets

3798070
super	abstract	super	implements
as implements currently abstract classes are a convenient mechanism for abstracting common attributes of classes out to super classes

3798081
int	chars
you can specify chars literals of type chars int chars in c++ with specific numbers using octal or hexadecimal notation

3798081
octal	decimal
for example 012 is octal 12 or decimal 10

3798084
mouseleave	mouseenter
the strange thing is that there are two mouseenter events on sibling elements without a mouseleave event in between

3798084
mouseleave	mouseenter
one idea is to register the mouseenter and mouseleave event instead of using hover

3798144
public	protected
by not using public protected or private the grade enum has the default access level - meaning only other classes in the same package can use it

3798147
maven	pom.xml
i am relatively new to maven i actually wanted to know how to build the renamed pom.xml

3798165
maven	pom.xml
maven looks for the pom.xml file so you should rename it that for it to work

3798171
google-chrome	firefox
it appears to work in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8

3798178
integer	unsigned
so i m looking for a good way to map an unsigned integer x to a bucket y for example

3798275
int	boolean
and there are 3 types of preferences they re string int and boolean

3798297
serializable	deserialization
in order to serializable an object you should implement the serializable interface or provide the implementation for the following methods if a special handling during the serializable and deserialization process is required

3798308
gif	png
this is a completely lossless process too and also works for some other already compressed filetypes as zip jpg png gif

3798317
put	get
if you put in x as the scheme you ll get x www.python.org

3798343
children	parent
in theory if you know for a fact that deleting a parent object will automatically also mean deleting all its children objects then cascading delete on the link between child and parent table might make sense

3798375
superclass	subclassing
when a subclassing does not need to override anything in its superclass s implementation of a method it s totally useless for the subclassing to look like it s overriding that method.

3798375
superclass	subclassing
so to summarize a subclassing should define __init__ if and only if it needs to do something else before or after or both before and after the superclass s own initializer very rarely it may want to do something instead not delegate to the superclass initializer at all but that s hardly ever good practice

3798375
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing s __init__ body has just a call to the superclass s __init__ with exactly the same parameters in the same order expunge the subclassing s __init__ from your code just as you would do for any other similarly-redundant method

3798380
kerberos	ntlm
if your kerberos fail it will automatically default to ntlm you don t have to do anything special

3798393
firefox	safari
slower prettier in safari and firefox

3798423
sorting	filtering
filtering requires some kind of code-behind but here s a xaml-only demo that does sorting

3798425
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up under login name click the button to search and find the aspnet user on computer malik

3798435
gtk	cairo
.. gtk include cairo

3798450
int	double
if so then will return an nsnumber instance and not an int or double

3798451
udp	tcp
ns-3 has an application class as part of its object model that is meant to be used to model everything above tcp udp

3798453
getter	setter
ison could be a public var or a pair of getter setter if you want to perform some logic when reading writting it

3798461
persistent	transient
it is only possible to mark certain properties on the domain object as transient so that they are not persistent to the database

3798475
hash	salt
also the userdata from the ticket is moved to the server if present and replaced with a salt sha-512 hash of the other properties in the ticket along with a guid that serves as a key into the server-side store of the ticket

3798484
direct3d	directx
it s not hard to search for directx tutorials or direct3d tutorials in google or your favourite search engine to find these contents

3798485
inherited	subclassing
i would consider moving away from either an abstract inherited pattern or the concrete base pattern if you re looking to tie distinct subclassing behaviors to the objects based on their respective child class

3798504
unix	aix
or you could use the native nfs services on your aix box to share the directory that the files are saved in then use windows services for unix to mount the share on your windows machine and scan with kapersky

3798513
lambda	first-class-functions
common lisp lambda are invoked with a funcall as well and i do not recall anyone claiming common lisp does not have first-class-functions

3798542
free	malloc
in java memory management is taken care of by the garbage collector but in other languages such as c one needs to perform memory management on their own using functions such as malloc and free

3798544
mdpi	hdpi
if you aim for 1.5 compatibility you also need a default drawable folder as of the official documentation ldpi mdpi hdpi and nodpi modes were added with api level 4 android 1.6

3798638
innodb	myisam
proviso the above is true for both commonly-used mysql storage engines myisam and innodb

3798652
put	get
you could get and use the user s ip address to determine that however proxy servers from various isps will put a wrinkle in that method

3798697
csv	tsv
i agree with other posters avoid files with .xls or convert single sheet workbooks into tsv csv

3798708
post	put
then put above code from index action to bookmarklet action in post controller

3798734
uiview	calayer
i don t think you can specify the blend mode used for compositing a calayer or uiview in particular i suspect the old graphics hardware of the iphone 3g doesn t support it

3798745
many-to-one	one-to-many
one-to-one one-to-many many-to-one

3798774
put	get
my task is to create a file server which accepts certain commands like file get file put and file delete from multiple clients using threading

3798797
width	height
adjust the width and height according to your image then reference it from the path like this

3798859
width	height
the loader will have zero width height until the complete event fires so wait until then to set the size

3798906
bit-shift	xor
my first idea was to xor the numbers together then bit-shift right until the number equaled zero

3798913
width	height
set the form height and width to 0

3798919
google-chrome	safari
but i still want an iframe to look like textarea so i need a border around it similar to that which appears in google-chrome and safari when textarea is active

3798933
google-chrome	safari
this will add a yellow outline to the element i m not sure what colour google-chrome and safari uses but just add your preferred colour-to-taste

3798933
google-chrome	safari
well unfortunately this kind of border is different in google-chrome and safari and perhaps in other browsers which support or will support it

3798975
ati	nvidia
and opencl is industry standard now supported by ati and nvidia

3798987
bmp	png
i would consider using png instead of bmp

3799046
ati	nvidia
and via declared about creating via trinity both of which can be use in future for gpgpu and can be as competitor for nvidia cuda and ati stream

3799084
translation	localization
facebook has this unique and clever approach to localization of their site translators in their case users that help to translation the site voluntarily can simply click on the not-yet-translated strings â which are marked with a green bottom border â in their natural context on the site

3799110
spaces	delimiter
i changed the delimiter to include r and n in addition to spaces

the following line works fine in mysql but in postgresql i get a rails error stating can t convert fixnum to string

3799204
mouseover	mouseleave
the effect makes a div grow in length by 2 on mouseover and shrink back on mouseleave

3799242
put	get
i want to put this inside a loop because i have to send these get requests to about 5 different php files at once but when i try to add it to a loop the function makes the loop wait until the file returns the response before it will go on to the next one

3799310
children	parent
in other words after you ve fetched some entity you should be able to fetch all children attached to it as simple list of the same objects as parent is

3799322
int	double
i want to have a method which calculates the mean of a linkedlist of type int double and float

3799324
int	double
that is the common superclass for int float double and other numeric types

3799337
gif	png	gif	bmp	flac	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	wav	flac	wav	ogg	bmp	png

3799352
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
perfect job for nsoperation or nsinvocationoperation

3799414
rvm	bundler
well you could use rvm and gemsets or bundler

3799430
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning and the limit should be removed

3799479
int	chars
only for primitive types that aren t a referenece like int chars etc. does it compare the value

3799536
pull	push
i know i can use adb to push and pull data and therefore the database files to and from the device

3799557
rss	feed
i wanted to put an rss feed for a web app im creating in php

3799593

3799599
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was able to do this in firefox google-chrome and safari but i ve no luck getting this to work in ie 7 or 8

3799638
opera	firefox
however due to an improperly terminated newline this script cannot be parsed by firefox or opera in conjunction with any xhtml 1.1 or xml documents

3799700
onclick	onmousedown
edit i just found out that text selection is done before onclick is fired a better option is onmousedown

3799707
mp3	wav
for instance it works for mp3 files but it will not work for wav files

3799710
cpu	processors
unless you have a massively parallel system with hundreds of processors then these threads will just compete for cpu time and other resources

3799717
mouse	keyboard
plus i probably don t care about keyboard events just mouse movement.

3799726
drawrect	layoutsubviews
what you probably want to override is layoutsubviews rather than drawrect as you re changing the layout not implementing custom drawing

3799740
geocoding	geocode
i am trying to geocode a batch of around 400 addresses using the google geocoding api through my rails app

3799747
int	boolean
boolean you can because it is simpler than existing types and can easily be represented by any int type as it is commonly #define d to anyway

3799754
put	get
but i am not sure how to get all project and put them in tables according to customers

3799763
cvs	svn
using svn as a backup only tips for using cvs or subversion as a backup framework for office documents

3799765
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this will work and i tested it in ie 7 8 9 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 6 and opera 10.6

3799773
int	boolean
tried with setselection int pos boolean animate and it s not working

3799788
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you can get the height and width of the rectangle through the actualheight and actualwidth properties

3799834
int	boolean
gallery.setselection int position boolean animate

3799842
inherited	subclassing
though i m still not sure if it s the right way to solve this problem i ve decided on using single-table inherited so that i can easily get a list of all the services that another model has_many of since each subclassing of service is also a service i can call model_instance.services to get them all

3799899
min	max
the sliders render on the page but on first click they go to either min or max

3799958
bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	printwriter	filewriter	printwriter
the api i am using for add record is filewriter for search operation it is bufferedreader and for deleting a record is bufferedreader and printwriter

3799959
graphviz	gephi
i previously recommended graphviz but thought i should add another recommendation now that i have used gephi a newer tool than a lot of the stuff here

3799969
min	max
but what i really want is not the max and min price but the price_id associated with the price

3800000
pthreads	fork
pthreads fork openmp mpi

3800000
crossover	mutation
various crossover mutation function

3800021
min	max
instead if you want the price_id of the max and min prices what you want are two rows the row such that no other row exists with the same cust_id and a higher price and the row such that no other row exists with the same cust_id and a lower price

3800028
for-loop	loops
this can be done in one line there s no need for a loops be it a for-loop or an apply

3800052
jar	.war
the .war or .ear you are packaging should contain both module jar files and their dependencies

3800056
ubuntu	linux
im on linux platform ubuntu so dont have any flash developer tools

3800057
udp	tcp
i can make udp connections easily learned via udpecho but i can t find as good sample as udpecho for tcp

3800061
getter	setter
the reason for this is because when new core tables are added to a framework they could be used with a generic data access object for accessing the corresponding fields getter setter via __call in the parent add insert and update delete without writing a class for each without requiring the coder to write a class and then having to inspect it or writing custom code generators for the various types of tables

3800086
int	chars
my goal is to find and replace some chinese chars across all files they are csv in a directory with int as per a csv file i have

3800086
int	chars
the dictionary i will be using will have about 300 elements and i will be changing unicode chinese chars to int

3800092
int	boolean
i m trying to override the add object method but i want it to return an int instead of a boolean the location of the object that was added

3800092
superclass	subclassing
can you have a method in a subclassing return something different than the superclass method

3800126
keydown	keyup
i am wondering why i am not able to find any help regarding the keyboard keyup keydown events i actually want to detect which key is been pressed by the user via keyboard on iphone while inputting the text in the uitextfield

3800160
octal	decimal	ostringstream	std
try to convert the unsigned int to std string into a decimal hexadecimal octal etc form and then concatenate you can do that using std ostringstream or boost lexical_cast or fix the bug in other ways you see fit

3800174
folder	directory
for example say you ve got iis pointed at the root of some directory but inside that directory is a folder with another app in it and you have a vdir pointed to that app - well you may indeed run in to this problem as asp.net will parse the web.config at the root first and then the web.config for the application the vdir points to

3800184
width	height
when you resize the browser window the width and height change thus your relative positions change and break your layout

3800186
for-loop	loops
another btw you can pass the collection to fields_for like so and it will automatically loops over it and you can skip the for-loop

3800190
cpu	processors
i don t know if you re i o bound or cpu bound but if your cpu utilization is very high you may want to use threading with each thread operating on a different file so with a quad core processors you d be reading writing 4 different files simultaneously

3800198
for-loop	loops
it has a for-loop that prints output each time it executes loops

3800211
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	memmove	strcpy	memmove
to copy the contents of one array to another you would have to use a library function like memcpy memmove strcpy etc

3800232
traceroute	packets
i want to write a simple ping traceroute dns troubleshooting app but am simply not finding any documentation or examples on sending icmp echo packets with set ttls and interpreting their responses

3800267
portrait	landscape
i m not sure specifically what the problem is but it looks like openfeint is trying to display in landscape but is somehow being rotated as if it was in portrait mode

3800277
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works for firefox safari and google-chrome

3800286
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
here s a simple python program that generates all possible inorder listings based on preorder and postorder listings

3800289
mousemove	mousedown

3800296
udp	tcp
list of tcp and udp port numbers

3800300
udp	tcp
bonjour is just a way to announce services â not a replacement for tcp udp

3800300
udp	tcp
the services still use tcp or udp

3800308
client-side	server-side
if for some reason option a is unacceptable then you d have do do b procedurally either server-side in a stored procedure or client-side in your client program

3800320
post	get
it is possible to get set the applicationame property at run time however according to the below msdn post it is not recommended as the property is not thread safe if multiple users are creating accounts for different applications at the same time it may not correctly allocate the applicationname per user

3800326
children	parent
so each row has a parent except for the root row and each row has children except for leaf rows

3800331
portrait	landscape
you can use 44 if you know you re in portrait not landscape in which the height of the navbar is less than 44

3800334
postgresql	mysql
you can also use recursive sql queries with other brands of database postgresql but mysql does not currently support this feature

3800394
console.readline	gets
if you press enter which is actually combination of 2 characters - carriage return and line feed on console.read it only gets carriage return character and line feed gets to your next console reading method - console.readline in getinput method

3800405
int	chars
if they are int being generated you can utilize itoa and simply append that result to a chars array of sufficient size with strcat

3800429
subtract	add
i personally try to avoid playing directly with the time value for reasons when trying to add or subtract days weeks etc

3800494
google-chrome	safari
safari 5 google-chrome 6 webkit browsers seem to allow sizes up to but not including 1 000 000 pixels after which the text does not render at all

3800497
children	parent
one advantage in doing so is that geometry managers such as grid and pack default to managing children in their parent

3800526
setinterval	clearinterval
for repeated events you can use setinterval and you can set setinterval to a variable and use the variable to stop the interval with clearinterval

3800549
udp	tcp
yes you should plan for the likelihood that any activity over ports udp and tcp is being monitor and potentially blocked depending on settings

3800552
hash	salt
send a link to the user with a query string that contains their email or better email id if you generate them and a salt hash of their email

3800568

3800581
accelerometer	gyroscope
i have gyroscope + accelerometer data at each time period t

3800588
width	height
this will not change the height width of the sprite so i m not sure it will help you

3800588
width	height
but in case you control the code that does the scrolling you could calculate the size of your object considering its origin is always 0 0 by getting it bounds and adding x + width and y + height

3800604
put	get
i m trying to make a program using the bfs algorithm so i put every node in a queue and once every level is in the queue i start comparing it to another node to see if they are equal or not however the problem i m having is that elements in my queue are being modified so when i do the dequeue i never get to an answer and i m getting a stack overflow

3800617
dictionary	map
to me it looks like a list of tuples but at the same time it feels like a map dictionary

3800676
width	height
so imagine the height of the cell row is 50px and width 100px i would like the line to be width 100px and it to be at 25px height in the row cell

3800681
yacc	bison
the yacc and bison implementations from what i hear are pretty good

3800689
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream oss

3800689
unsigned	short	int	double
you might reasonably wonder why c++ doesn t provide for x in short int long long long float double unsigned short etc

3800689
int	chars
currently it doesn t handle any int so treating it as a single ascii chars isn t confusing

3800689
ostream	ostringstream
it s also good practice to minimise dependencies some small but perhaps significant percentage of translation units using string may not currently have to include and hence spend time parsing and hence ostream etc and in general cyclic dependencies are a code smell and frustrate testability string depends on ostringstream depends on string...

3800773
treeviewitem	menuitem
treeviewitem tvi sender as menuitem .parent as contextmenu .parent as popup .placementtarget as treeviewitem

3800774
i2c	spi
i2c spi etc

3800784
nunit	moles
unfortunately i am having a problem with nunit integrating with the latest version of microsoft moles and also nunit is conflicting with a third party library appears log4net related

3800784
nunit	mstest
all of the version issues and compatibility problems with nunit at least for me is steering me towards choosing mstest as the framework for the project though i may keep the dual mode option

3800784
nunit	mstest
another plus for mstest is that i can still use most of nunit asserts with

3800823
textarea	pre
the simplest tips i can give you is to set a css attribute for your textarea white-space pre so that when it gets submitted all line breaks get sent as well

3800851
width	height
your mileage with the css may vary depending on the css for the rest of the site but 100 width height should do it on a basic page

3800854
scheme	racket
i am trying to develop an editor in scheme racket passing lists into the structures

3800857
folder	directory
you are testing whether is a file but you apparently want to rename directory unless you have non-directory files named folder

3800883
nunit	mstest
i have used both mstest and nunit the first more than the latter and i can t say i noticed any big differences between the two of them regarding speed don t get me wrong the difference might be there i just haven t noticed it

3800915
unix	bsd
historically there were two possible signal delivery behaviors the bsd behavior syscalls are automatically restarted when interrupted by a signal and the unix system v behavior syscalls return -1 with errno set to eintr when interrupted by a signal

3800919
uitableview	uisearchbar
for example the uisearchbar within uitableview like of the iphone address book app scrolls with the the names

3800945
post	get
the solution is to use the post redirect get pattern

3801003
move	drag
i have not been able to find an obvious way to do this in a way that causes the rows to move while the drag is in progress

3801037
melt	reshape

3801729
udp	tcp
all you are doing is very poorly re-implementing tcp the only reason to use udp should be for 1-to-many transfers or a constantly running enterprise service bus middleware

3801729
http	spdy	udp	tcp
i would recommend investigating existing file transfer technologies such as fsp udp http tcp spdy optimised http or for integration with other communications rolling your own above an existing message-orientated-middleware system such as jboss or 0mq

what i need is if my anchor tag is near to end of the browser window and there s not enough space for the ui dialog window to appear the ie shows it down bringing the vertical bar the user has to scroll a lil bit to see the ui dialog this works fine in firefox and google-chrome as mentioned earlier

3802209
getter	setter
the reason you might want to use a getter setter is because it conceals the implementation

3802209
getter	setter
you won t have to rewrite all of your code if you are using getter setter in case the implementation does change because those members can continue to work

3802209
getter	setter
as for a class using setter and getter on itself that may depend on the particulars

3802209
getter	setter
in the cases where a class is normally instantiated the class should use the member values directly for its own members private or otherwise and its parent classes if they are protected and only use getter setter in the case that those members are private to the parent class

3802209
getter	setter
in the case of an abstract type which will usually not contain any implementation at all it should provide pure virtual getter and setter and use only those in the methods it does implement

3802215
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome it appears as a horizontal range with no styles in opera as vertical range with no styles

3802218
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to achieve a gradient + text shadow effect in google-chrome safari using css text-shadow and a combination of text-shadow and background-image -webkit-gradient see example blw

3802226
getter	setter
and it seems you do i also prefer to avoid the uglyness and weightyness of getter setter

3802226
getter	setter
as you speak about a class using its own getter setter in its own implementation functions then you should consider writing non-friend non-member functions where possible

3802272
put	get
i have previously asked how to put a datepicker in a grid and i did not get a response

3802297
getter	setter
willingness to use getter setter within class member implementation is the canary in the mine telling that your class is growing unreasonably

3802322
hide	show
assuming that you want to show hide certain item based upon the id

3802369
inherited	properties
jaxb will actually handle the overriden method when properties xmlaccessortype is used in parent but as a result in output xml data jaxb probably will also generate additionally in the root tag attributes such as xsi type b and xmlns xsi because we defined a new type b inherited from a

3802369
inherited	subclassing
to produce xml from derived subclassing but w o the xsi and xmlns attributes added by jaxb i used temporary trick which i am trying to exchange for something nicer i did override of method in child in parent overriden method i had to use xmlelement but i did not added inherited class type to the jaxb.newinstance call

3802376
listadapter	simpleadapter
arrayadapter does but listadapter or simpleadapter don t

3802386
int	chars
i want to put validations on int and chars textboxes

3802392
getter	setter
it seems most people didn t read your question properly the question is concerning whether or not class methods accessing its own class members should use getter and setter

3802392
getter	setter
i wouldn t bother using getter and setter for accessing a class own members

3802392
getter	setter
i only use getter and setter for accessing my own class members when i am expecting to change the implementation in the near future if i m writing a suboptimal code that can be written quickly but plans to optimize it in the future that might involve radically changing the data structure used

3802392
getter	setter
conversely i don t use getter and setter before i already have the plan

3802392
getter	setter
in particular i don t use getter and setter in expectation of changing things i m very likely never going to change anyway

3802392
public	protected
i use protected members conservatively and they are considered a public interface

3802392
getter	setter
however even for public interface i usually still avoid having direct getter and setter methods as they are often indicative of bad oo design every oo programmers in any language should read why getter and setter methods are evil

3802402
ant	pom.xml
i have to add a lazy true to a property i have add a ant task to intrument the class to enable hibernate to make it lazy in my pom.xml

3802414
getter	setter
getter and setter for protected members makes as much sense as for public.

3802414
getter	setter
getter and setter for private members is rarely a net benefit though

3802414
public	protected
in enterprise environments and for public protected member data those benefits can be substantial enough to justify get set methods a logging function may end up having millions of lines of code depedent on it and hundreds or thousands of libraries and apps for which a change to a header may trigger recompilation

3802417

i wouldn t use yield at all in lisp scheme

.htaccess	httpd.conf
this module operates on the full urls including the path-info part both in per-server context httpd.conf and per-directory context .htaccess â

3802853
post	get
so i get all the records from the objects table with type post and join it with postmeta to get the post metadata

3802853
post	get
then i query postobject to get all the objects attached to this post and comments to get all the comments

3802853
post	get
i would need to join these tables at least post postmeta postobject and not to mention an users table to get all post by a specific user for example

3802872
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
what you seem to be looking for is a database frontend like phpmyadmin or sqlbuddy not a php framework

3802904
comparator	comparable
comparator allows to implement external comparison logic which can be applied to objects that are not comparable or that require different logic from their default comparison logic

3802904
comparator	comparable
for example you have collections.sort list which can sort only lists of objects that implement comparable while there is another method - collections.sort list comparator by which you can sort any list

3802912
public	protected
depends on the visibility of the ivar public private protected

3802951

gif	png	gif	ico	png	ico
ya it can be gif or png too but standard is ico

3803051

google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it sends more than one requests to servlet and finally there is exception in servlet and it doesn t work

3803395
google-chrome	firefox
it displays correctly in firefox and ie but in google-chrome it displays correctly on page load and when accessing other links that have the scroller on

3803416
folder	dir
another trick to reduce the first 5 minutes of cleaning could be to move the old build dir to a temp folder on the same disk and then use another background task to delete the old build dir when the main build completes could be a nightly cleanup task

3803420
subtract	add
just subtract 1 and add 1 afterwards

google-chrome	safari
as can be seen in the settings tab class abaa and class abaf i am not able to put the height 90 . it works in mozilla and internet explorer but in google-chrome and safari - both important to my project - it does not work

3803695
post	put
you can quickly develop small integrations on mule to accept a message on activemq and post it to a webservice and put the webservice response on a different activemq response queue

3803725
width	height
but the span elements do not expand to the width and height that i set

3803749
folder	directory
but i can t figure out why the actual result adds com masatosan conf directory to the destination folder so it looks like

3803761
button	checkbox
click a few checkbox and press a button and they were done without having to rekey a lot of information

3803768
onresize	onload
i would recommend using a library like prototype or jquery and handle the onload and onresize events

3803768
width	height
then by by screen width and height you can calculate how many divs you need

3803768
width	height
this will probably be something like width 60 height 60 or something..

3803771
width	height
that should make the span elements expand to your desired width height

3803814
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in the touchesbegan and touchesmoved method check for the touch and accordingly change the images of the imageviews

3803908
mouseover	mouseout
this is still a problem because mouseover and mouseout fire when entering leaving a child

3803908
mouseleave	mouseenter
however .hover uses mouseenter and mouseleave which don t suffer the same problem and will eliminate your vibration problem

3803915
hide	show
if you do not want to depend on ajax complete to show or hide your loader you can put your results on a div layer which covers the loader

3803972
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
the default charset for htmlspecialchars is iso-8859-1 as of php v5.4 the default charset was turned to utf-8 which might explain why things go haywire when it meets multibyte characters

3803978
folder	directory
try writing the file to another directory outside of the debug folder

3804012
versioning	upgrade
so if the purpose is indeed to upgrade non-well-formed xml to a well-formed versioning i d suggest to look for other tools such as perl awk or any other simple search replace solution that operates on plain text and could just add the missing namespace declaration to the document element

3804023
super	implements
it looks like the startup function which is implements in datagrid s super class _grid grid.js calls a function called render which i believe is what actually render s the contents of the grid

you could roll your own essentially with nested jsplitpane and jtabbedpane and a lot of time

3804117
kde	gnome
you don t have to install gnome or kde

3804167
textarea	pre
using the css white-space property with a value set to pre any white-space in the element should appear exactly as it does in the textarea

3804237
move	drag
i have a custom canvas control which sits inside a scrollviewer - i have implemented drag drop and move for items on the canvas and overridden measureoverride so that when i move an item around on the canvas its size reflects the changes so if i move the item beyond the visible portion of the canvas it will resize to accommodate the move item and scrollbars will show appropriately

3804268
selecteditem	selectedindex
not sure about this but it could be that the selecteditem gets updated after selectedindex

folder	directory
i d like to exclude the contents of several folder from the build but keep the blank directory itself

3804443

for-loop	arrays
after that all you need to do is load the unique arrays phone numbers into a for-loop and inside it load array#1 lines into a for-loop

3804656
opencv	emgucv
we are working in a project involving the use of emgucv and in particoular the svm functions of opencv and we have a problem using mono on a ubuntu platform and we don t have this problem on windows

3804674
width	height
in this case i have a div tag which needs to have 100 height but a width of only 980px

3804674
width	height
when you apply a width to it the 100 height fails when you remove the postion fixed and top + right lines the container sits in the right place but has no height at all and the app won t work if the height is fixed

3804700
super	self
basically python never injects names into a namespace eg some languages inject a magic this variable into methods while python forces you to explicitly define the equivalent â self â as the first argument of methods and since a class is just another namespace nothing like eg values in its super classes gets injected into it

3804700
inherited	properties
when you ve got a class b which inherited from another class a and you try to look up a properties on b â b.foo â it first checks to see if foo is in b s namespace and if it isn t it goes on to check a s namespace and so on

3804704
put	get
you put the new values and you get the others value by querying the table you re updating

3804729

3804854
width	height
on the site i m working on i have a fancybox that triggers when the page loads that displays the contents of a hidden but for some reason any options such as height width etc are getting ignored

3804857
hash	md5
using a md5 hash as a key you could eventually get two queries that result in the same md5 hash

3804909
ienumerable	iqueryable
the type iqueryable inherits from the non-generic ienumerable so this extension method doesn t seem to serve any purpose

3804940
gif	png
maybe gif or png is not supported by your php version

3804998
ienumerable	iqueryable
since the interface iqueryable inherits from ienumerable why not

3804998
ienumerable	iqueryable
so casting an iqueryable as an ienumerable will cause the second extension method to be called where it will be treated as an ienumerable

3805029
min	max
the variables have different min and max values

3805038
strlen	strcpy
all string support depends on functions in the c standard library such as strlen strcpy and so on

3805042
folder	directory
note i m uncertain if adding subfolders separately will maintain the folder subtree of the parent directory in the ctf archive in the same way as option #1 would

3805048
public	protected
guideline #4 a base class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

3805050
textarea	textbox
some textbox where plain old textbox but my textarea were enhanced with tinymce

3805122
suppressfinalize	finalizer
when done that way the suppressfinalize call removes the object from the finalizer queue turning it into a regular managed object that can easily be garbage collected

3805130
width	height
is it when it can read the width and height

3805158
switching	screens
you cannot switching back to another desktop like the screens saver one until you login

3805164
moq	moles
one can still use moq alongside moles

3805164
moq	moles
it s actually preferred to use a framework like moq for stubbing and mocking when the code can allow for it leaving only moles for the stuff moq can t isolate sealed classes non-virtual methods private members etc

3805167
cgpoint	cgsize
ios uses core graphics for drawing so instead of nspoint and nssize you should be using cgpoint and cgsize

3805167
cgpoint	cgsize
basically try solving your problems by using cgpoint and cgsize

3805170
client-side	server-side
take note of ck s comment that for efficiency this type of piecemeal client-side operation is not as good as doing the heavy lifting server-side

3805199
integer	unsigned
so the value of x a 4-bit unsigned integer is 8 while the values of y z and w are 0

3805253
width	height
getimagesize dosent get the kb size just width and height which is not what im looking for

3805258
portrait	landscape
if i switch the figures around so that some are portrait and some are landscape all kinds of weird things happen

3805258
width	height
i ve tried every combination of figures i can think of systematically swapping width and height between paired values one at a time and none of these combinations work

3805395
superclass	subclassing
in the database i think that the problem is solved one table per class person client provider and agent table and a foreign key from the primary key of the subclassing table to the primary key of the superclass table

3805435
post	get
the client app communicates with the server through post and get

3805480
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you have to use a combination of the mousemove mousedown and mouseup events

3805480
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown and mouseup will set and clear a flag telling you the user is holding down the button

3805488
glassfish	resin
i faced with problem during migration web-application from resin to glassfish v3.0.1

3805625
google-chrome	firefox
the one built-in to google-chrome is ok but not great and firebug for firefox is excellent

3805671
disk	ram
it seems that the only limitation to how many records you can have per table is the available size on disk and probably ram if you re going to want to run certain reports on that data

3805702
post	get
whenever i get a new client i simply copy all of the code over change 3 lines in a config file and then all of their styles data is taken out of the database or from uploads they post to the server from their own admin area

3805736
hide	show
i have an image in a page and in the onmouseover event of that image i will call a javascript function to show a tooltip and in the onmouseout of the image i will call a method to hide the tooltip.now i found that when i place the cursor on the image its calling the method to show the tooltip div.and if i move the mouse within the image its calling the onmouseout event even if i am not out of the image .how can i stop this

3805746
gridex	janus
i ve been using janus gridex control in hierarchical mode and i want all rows to be expanded

3805782
config	ini
within each set of directories i can have symbolic links pointing to common code and actual php ini files for client-specific code or config

3805785
ubuntu	debian
both machines are debian based old ubuntu 8.10 new debian 5.0.3 and both machines are running python 2.5.2

3805815

would be better to load the image as hidden and then just show hide when needed

3805907
textarea	pre
there is a pre element over the textarea

3805907
textarea	pre
yourregex would be a method to match the regex and return some parsed content to the pre allowing you to customize the appearance of the textarea that is actually an element over it

superclass	subclassing
you can t use a superclass to call a function defined in a subclassing

3805950

3805970
sorting	filtering
i must render all data and write all possible actions such as sorting by columns filtering deletion edit etc for each of this i need

3806004
google-chrome	safari
the timer is there for google-chrome and safari because in those browsers the native browser behaviour that selects the whole element seems to trigger after the focus event thereby overriding the effect of the selection code unless postponed until after the focus event

3806027
google-chrome	firefox
i got most things working with firefox google-chrome and ie apart from the fact that fancybox isn t validating all the ie-fixes as green but that s an issue for another time

3806079
sudo	passwd
for ordinary users to run a command as a different user without reentering a passwd even from a script use the sudo 8 command

3806116
hash	salt
otherwise you could hash the username + salt and hand it to user as a session id in a cookie and store that session id into the datastore

3806148
put	get	post	put	post	get
to put it this way you can do a subselect to get the specific day of the week but in your code you would have to check the day again to group post per day

3806170
folder	directory
the file in the resources folder is not moving to the test results out directory and is not being found by the test code

3806194

3806451
getter	setter
control the enabled disabled property by binding to getter and setter on the data you re working with

3806463
folder	directory
there is one caveat make sure you set up your web server to not allow serving of the contents of the .svn folder in each directory or the equivalent for your vcs of choice if there is one

3806491
int	chars	int	boolean
the reason std vector bool is nonconforming is that it pulls tricks under the covers in an attempt to optimize for space instead of storing a full chars or int for every bool 1 taking up at least 8 times the space on platforms with 8-bit chars it packs the boolean and stores them as individual bits inside say chars in its internal representation

3806533
serializable	deserialization
in .net you can create strongly-typed configuration sections using build-in base classes that do a lot of the mundane heavy lifting with respect to xml serializable deserialization schema validation type-casting etc.

3806633
webclient	webrequest
the answer would be to craft a custom webrequest that looks like it comes from ie 8 instead of the .net webclient

3806659
put	get
but if i put the line #import pfletsmove pfmoveapplication.h in the app delegate i get the following error pfletsmove pfmoveapplication.h file not found

3806862
stdout	stderr
stdin stderr and stdout are named parameters for the popen method

3806884
x86	64bit
to fix this problem either get a 64bit version of that library or what is easier set the target platform to x86 for all your executables

3806884
x86	64bit
using x86 on a 64bit platform usually should not have any noticeable performance hit

3806898
cassini	iis
i don t want to get into iis and i d like to avoid something like cassini if possible

3806930

3806939
sorting	grouping
and if i can brings them grouping after sorting on other fields

3806954
folder	directory

3806957
filesystems	ntfs
to improve performance of ntfs or any other filesystems you choose don t put all files into single folder but group files by first n characters of their file names or also by extension

3807163
put	get
i am trying to get the input of a user from std cin and put it to an array

3807186

3807255
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m developing an iphone app where i have a uitabbarcontroller that has a uinavigationcontroller for each tabbaritem

3807259
width	height
you could try leaving it at 100 x 100 but add a wrapper tag with a width of 980 and a 100 height

3807259
width	height
important after your width height it helps override other css that is interfering including inline css

3807263
int	boolean

3807518
width	height
really i need to fetch url width height in a single get request

3807546
inline	inlining
if however the callee cannot be inline if it s third-party api code for example then the compiler cannot perform this kind of inlining and indeed passing a pointer might be more efficient though it s unlikely you ll find library that functions that take an integer pass by reference unless it s so that the callee can modify the caller s value which introduces a whole different set of issues

3807563
getter	setter
of course the problem with this is you have to re-write all the getter and setter you want for the entity an issue that i ve had to deal with that is annoying unfortunately that is a bit of a java language issue

3807587
width	height
you can set the loader s width and height after load but you ll have to mask it if you have things hanging off the stage in the loaded swf

3807593
actualheight	actualwidth
you can data-bind some labels to actualwidth and actualheight to verify what s happening

3807618
free	malloc
though how malloc free are linked to the os in the two static libs may be problematic

3807635
int	chars
c++ convert int and string to chars

3807635
int	chars
the score is stored in an int variable but the library im using for the game needs an array of chars for its text outputting for my scoreboard

3807656
int	chars	ostringstream	std
you can use an std ostringstream to convert the int to an std string then use std string c_str to pass the string as a chars array to your function

3807663
memcpy	malloc
you can build your own version of the visual c++ c runtime library crt which contains memcpy and malloc functions among others from the source code that can be usually found in program files microsoft visual studio 9.0 vc crt

3807677
post	get
i get the following error i cant post the image

3807678
serializable	deserialization
because they may point to references other than the current object reference and because the deserialized object is a new reference in what is probably a different runtime event handler references from the serializable object are useless on deserialization because the reference will no longer point to the expected object in the new runtime s heap

3807688
min	max
y axis has 3 fields - min max avg values for time frame and x axis has task type

uilabel	uitextview
and can i get rid of all those controls so the uiwebview works like an advanced uilabel or uitextview

3807968
superclass	subclassing
an exception is if your class subclassing or implements a protocol you need to actually #import the header file that defines the protocol or superclass

3807968
superclass	subclassing
this is because when a third class imports the subclassing s header file it needs the declaration for the superclass prototype and you don t want to have to import all the superclass prototypes header files

3807996
client-side	server-side
no it s not possible as the client-side code can never know about that kind of server-side implementation detail

3808075
accessor	properties
however this also sometimes forces me to provide accessor for properties i wouldn t need normally and i think most people on so agree that accessor are usually a sign of bad design

3808075
accessor	properties
however i had to expose the internal state of the entity namely the accessor for all of its properties so that the renderer could read it

3808075
getter	setter
even great object-oriented programmers use objects with getter setter sometimes especially for something like an entity object

3808075
getter	setter
maybe getter setter are not all evil

3808116
nofollow	noindex
i also have a noindex nofollow meta tag on all my website s pages

3808143

3808156
super	abstract
for better maintainability i would like to have the shared attributes in an abstract super type or something like that

3808161

pull	push
or at least i don t see how you could do it without conversion which changes the repo which means you can t push pull between them.

3808219
prepare	execute
build up the query string in a variable then use a prepare statement to execute it

however even when i point the directory to the openssl directory within the xampp folder for me at c xampp apache bin the operation fails

3808348
portrait	landscape
everything looks great in landscape mode ipad but no so much when i rotate to portrait

3808360
getter	setter
this can then be made public using a property with critical sections in the getter and setter ensuring access is threadsafe

3808360
post	get
i will post some example code when i get to my computer as i m using my iphone at the moment

3808403

i downloaded powermockito 1.4.5 with mockito and junit including dependencies and used the android.jar from the sdk 2.2

3808485
mxmlc	compc
mxmlc compc are two compilers used to compile flex projects

3808523
for-loop	arrays
the purpose of the variation is to deallocate an entire arrays and hence avoid the need to have a for-loop like you do

3808532
portrait	landscape
edit brian s method seems to work when the phone in landscape but not in portrait

3808539
free	malloc
point being if you malloc d or new d your object then you need to free or delete it

in order to define a method you need a valid return type such as int or double and you need to provide the proper types for the individual arguments

3808632
many-to-many	many-to-one
many-to-many or many-to-one

3808634
int	double
while the int will get auto-converted to a double your code will be better if it is consistent with the use of types

3808645
haskell	scheme
other language in this class functional not meta-programming includes haskell scheme clojure f# etc

3808670
passenger	thin
besides running mongrel thin or passenger

i also need to call post as opposed to get on the page that users are redirected to

3809058
integer	unsigned
if it s an unsigned integer you will have

you have to use the qt.framelesswindowhint for that and then create your own max min close buttons as widgets and add them there

3809136
uiview	calayer
every uiview is backed by a calayer

3809136
uiview	calayer
you can get at the uiview s calayer with the .layer property

3809186
children	parent
when you need to split the node you could create new nodes with each one receiving a segment of the vector of children pointers and the newly created nodes would be inserted into the node vector of the parent node

3809209
hide	show
presumably when your user clicks the hide application button you re going to want to show something - at the very least a show button so the user isn t stuck without input options

3809209

hide app calls another activity with only the ui show that you want

3809229
google-chrome	safari
the app works fine on desktop safari google-chrome iphone ios4 ...but on the ipad ios 3.2 it doesn t

ibatis	mybatis
we used oracle then switched to postgresql using the mybatis formerly ibatis sql mapper to shield our code from the details of the database

3809595
realloc	malloc
you could use a linked list but the more usual approach is to allocate a block of memory with malloc and dynamically resize that block with realloc if the user input exceeds the bounds of the array

3809595
realloc	malloc
if ptr is null realloc is identical to a call to malloc for size bytes

3809612
realloc	malloc
if it is impossible to precalculate how long an array should be then you can malloc a fixed amount of array read from the user then realloc if the allocated size isn t big enough

3809617
put	get
if i put each of my few external files in a separate file event though there will be multiple http requests most users don t activate a non-cache behavior on their browsers like us developers and they will cache the files resulting in a faster user experience but now with the different combination available on my css it will never be cached because each page is slightly different in the get parameters it sends the css file

3809650
cpu	processors
its role is to grant access to a cpu if the chip is free and to delay it if the chip is busy servicing a request by another processors

from my understanding all np-complete problems are np-hard but some np-hard problems are known not to be np-complete and np-hard problems are at least as hard as np-complete problems

3809959
np-hard	np-complete
there are also decision problems that are np-hard but not np-complete for example the halting problem

3809959
np-hard	np-complete
it is easy to prove that the halting problem is np-hard but not np-complete

i use jquery to put a checkbox along with a dropdownlistfor in the box that appears when the user lets go of the mouse button this is towards the bottom of the javascript in the jsfiddle

3810130
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i do have some click checking code in the _mousestart _mousedrag and _mousestop events to stop another box from being created when you click in an existing box but i don t think this is causing the problem because the dropdownlistfor that is created can be clicked and furthermore if you remove the click checking code the checkbox remains unclickable

3810434
super	self
then super c self .foo refers to a.foo

3810455

3810465
super	self
if you call super c self .foo after making this change b.foo will get called

since you are not using a uinavigationcontroller the navigationcontroller property of the your uiviewcontroller will remain nil

3810649
put	get	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you want to get your code up running you ll need to put the root uiviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller

treemap	linkedhashmap
jared levy you can also copy a treemap or linkedhashmap that have the desired order

3810932
linefeed	delimiter
linefeed for setting the desired row delimiter

3810960
width	height
the reason i say it doesn t work is that inside that content td there is a div set to 100 width and height and unless the td its in has a defined height it doesn t seem to be able to see what 100 is and simply adjusts the the minimum size it can be according to its content

getter	setter
going forward you ll be able to do this with getter and setter on a property part of the new ecmascript 5 specification but that s still not widely-implemented

3814626
unix	bsd
but since mac is basically bsd unix it should be identical or with little trouble to get it up and running on linux

3814633
client-side	server-side

i don t know exactly how is this is jboss application server but in weblogic one should start serving requests after successful application deployment

3816034
nunit	moles
you can t run ms moles with nunit from within visual studio

3816034

you must either use mstest visual studio unit tests to do that or you can run your nunit tests with moles from the command line.see the reference manual

3816034
nunit	mstest
a possible alternative if it fits your needs you may use the gallio automation platform to run all kinds of test frameworks in your case nunit and mstest side by side.

3816341
jnetpcap	libpcap
use libpcap and the java interface jnetpcap

3816346
accessor	properties
a far easier and more elegant method would be to have myclass contain a dictionary of the properties you want to iterate through and tie the properties accessor and the indexer to the dictionary

3816352
google-chrome	firefox
i ve extensively tested the jquery plugin roundabout and got it working nicely in internet explorer 6 through 8 google-chrome and firefox

3816360
dictionary	map
a dynamic class supports the object behavior of -- to get the arbitrary map you need to extend dictionary instead again making the class dynamic

3816435
unix	bsd
personally i would recommend using either a bsd or unix socket instead

3816446
integer	unsigned
using integer math alone i d like to safely average two unsigned ints in c++

3816451
hide	show
the best way would be store a flag in the model that s set by the controller whether to show the link or not and show hide it that way

3816475
accessor	ivar
however when i set things with direct ivar access i try to only do it via that makes it a lot simpler to find them all and change them if i ever find the need to use kvo or to make it public or to make a more complex accessor

3816478
post	get
when i did a get after my post and returned the result as json email was null but if i post my xml as

3816524

additionally if your data logically belongs together such that you can grouping them into objects and manage them as such implement a validate method in the classes of these objects that checks the object s properties by utilizing the filtering functions and or your validator class

3816566
portrait	landscape
alert views appear in portrait even though the rest is in landscape

3816566
portrait	landscape
rotating the ipad from landscape to portrait does not trigger a rotation nor does it trigger any of the shouldautorotate style methods

3816566
portrait	landscape
rotating the ipad 180 degrees to other landscape does trigger rotation and after this the ipad behaves like normal rotates correctly to portrait and landscape when rotated

3816566
portrait	landscape
it only happens when loading in landscape -- loading in portrait and then rotating to landscape works just fine

3816566
portrait	landscape
if i had removed the other vc which is in landscape i would have realized that my main view controller was stuck in portrait

3816566
portrait	landscape
so i had a portrait view on top of which there was a landscape view

3816590
post	get
if you can post a representative code for your logic you will get responses which indicate how do process the same in sets

3816603
charindex	substr
substr is positional but you can use the charindex function to find the position of each delimiter and grab the substr between each comma

3816791
opencv	emgucv
i ve been using the great emgucv c# wrapper for opencv to collect images from a home built stereo rig

3816792
int	double
note enabling the reflection warnings which is essential when optimizing for performance and the repeated type hint on y the one on the def didn t seem to help for the aset and casting everything to primitive double values the dotimes makes sure that i is a primitive int

3816912
int	double
i ve created a class to represent this data type called class fixedpoint and in it there are ways to typecast from fixedpoint to int or double or unsigned int etc

3816925
uiview	calayer
a uiview is its layer s delegate instead of -drawrect for efficiency if you use -drawrect calayer creates a second context and thus a second copy of the bitmap

3817063
lisp	scheme
i just want to learn to do something substantial in lisp that i haven t been able to do with scheme

3817070
rss	feed
i have a rss feed generated by my server for example

3817078
affinity	processors
that being said some operating systems allow you to specify processors affinity for a specific thread which allows you to place a thread onto a specific processors and leave it there

3817081
folder	directory
will turn up foobar.cpp if it exists under a src folder somewhere around my current directory recursing up to find it until c work is hit and then check the scripts hierarchy

3817087
memcpy	memmove
however if memmove is additionally implemented as a macro via 7.1.4 1 that is written in terms of memcpy then you re going to be in trouble

3817108
folder	directory
ideally temporary folder and files get installed in the windows temp directory but you can also install them in your application directory

if any further information is required please let me know as i will be checking back on this post frequently until i can get past this little bump in the road

3817200
voip	sip
there is a project that adds sip voip to android

3817201
filtering	grouping
ibuffer with its filtering and grouping is the best way for managing large numbers of buffers that i ve tried

3817222
int	double
i am pretty sure int is not going to be 3 it is going to whatever the memory chunk of the double is that the int bytes share with it

3817225
int	double
i think it uses nvs perl s equivalent of a c double instead of uvs normally an unsigned int because depending on os and compilation options some of the values in a struct statfs might be 64-bit even though perl is using 32-bit int

3817225
int	double
newsvnv works because the c compiler knows how to cast any int type to a double

3817240
uipangesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
your best bet is to use one of the uigesturerecognizer subclasses probably uipangesturerecognizer as it includes velocity

3817266
oncreate	onnewintent
depending on the flags in your intent and the settings in your manifest your activity will be called with either oncreate or onnewintent

3817288
min	max
unfortunately the getscrollinfo method just returns zeros for the scrollbar position min max page size etc and the setscrollinfo doesn t appear to update the scrollbar although both calls to setscrollinfo and setscrollinfo do return success.

3817303
pycrypto	m2crypto
python 2.4 s sha module doesn t support 256 so i started using pycrypto only to find out that pycrypto doesn t support pkcs#5 needed elsewhere in my project. i switched to m2crypto as a result and now i would like to replace my pycrypto sha-256 call with an m2crypto equivalent.

3817337
subtract	add
once you get the data back from usps you can simply add subtract agument it as you need prior to stuffing back into the db

3817393
implements	extends	inotifycollectionchanged	ilist
instead of extends observablecollection implements the interfaces you need probably inotifycollectionchanged and ilist and keep an observablecollection as a private field

3817469
decoder	encoder
you ll need to either use openssl s bio api to do the job or use a third-party framework or library that wraps that or a separate encoder decoder in an easy cocoa api

3817478
post	get
that is when i was trying to push back to the repo but they are get commands and no post

3817478
post	get
i think reading around there might be some sort of rewrite going on that is changing the post to a get and killing it or something

3817485
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to create nested arrays s dynamically from a string that has been parsed parameter expansion using a for-loop in bash and i am failing

3817516
pascal	delphi
turbo pascal to delphi object oriented pascal would seem like the natural choice progression

3817520
pascal	delphi
turbo pascal evolved into delphi which is still used today but might be hard to find

3817553
width	height
i m trying to figure out how to map the points appropriately to the texture and how it differs if it has a specific width height

3817646
fflush	gets
readfile will incrementally pop out the data as it goes but your output buffer is catching it all until it gets to the fflush

3817656
put	get
i am trying to put a navigation div below the image but i cannot do so because the image is absolutely positioned and the scale of the image changes so i cannot just specify a padding-top value for the navigation to get it to show up under the photo

3817671
put	get
i have managed to get this working perfectly but want to put images in some of them - like a calendar icon for the events option

3817675
mouse	trackpad
an other option which would require only another physical mouse device to work with and should get you at least 95 of the way there is the multi-touch vista project which can emulate up to 256 touch points using physical devices - thus the need for an extra mouse or two since it can be awkward to simultaneously work with a mouse in one hand and trackpad with another

3817694
rss	feed
i am looking into adding rss feed to one of my django apps and i would like to be able to have them be authenticated

3817711
put	get
i think your best option is to get rid of the underline text-decoration property for the a element put the link text in a span with common class and apply text-decoration underline to that class

3817783
cruisecontrol	luntbuild
for scheduling maybe you should look at a free build management tool like cruisecontrol or luntbuild

3817833
put	get
then get nums is given the line length of the line and an empty array to put numbers in

3817835
width	height
if the change is less than both the width and height of the map the transition will be smoothly animated

3817835
width	height
therefore as long as you are zoomed out such that your viewport is 20 miles in height and width you should be guaranteed smooth panning for distances under 20 miles

3817847
rss	feed
rss feed should normally be fetched over http so this should work

3817855
for-loop	loops
i don t think you want a while loops in your for-loop

3817868
int	chars	int	double
third you re mismatching types passing an int and a double to printf but using the c chars conversion for both

3817882
rss	feed
actually one low-touch option would be to use something like feedburner to take the existing rss category feed and send emails

3817882
rss	feed
when you plug the feed into feedburner it will give you a link that users can click to subscribe to the email version of rss

3817888
swrl	owl
however if you couple your owl ontology with swrl rules for example you have a chance of capturing much of the types of rules you ve outlined

3817888
swrl	owl
note that individual implementations of owl swrl reasoners such as these may implement more or less of the w3c specification so you ll need to inspect each to determine their applicability

3817945
crypt	salt
i know the salt used to encrypt and as crypt is a one-way algorithm i must use brute-force method and i know that passwords only consist of lower-case letters

3817959
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and other browsers don t do it if the element is empty if the table element has at least one tr or th they will create the tbody implicitly

3817968
width	height
define max width and max height

3817975
hash	salt
an easy way to beat a rainbow table for hash passowrds is to use a salt

3817976
crypt	hash
crypt will return a hash string using the standard unix

3817976
salt	md5
salt or a twelve character md5

3818010
portrait	landscape
page would scale correctly when going from portrait to landscape until i used the pop up keyboard to enter a value in a field - then it would stop scaling

3818010
portrait	landscape
which would mean if i used the keyboard in landscape it would be too large when i went to portrait or vice versa

3818027
hide	show
the standard solution to this problem is to add all your fields in design view up to the max available and hide all of them and show only the ones you need

3818034
pop-up	dialog
however when the application first attempts this windows firewall pop-up a dialog that allows an administrator to make an exception for the application giving it the privileges it needs

3818043
multiplying	add
i believe that multiplying two n-bit ints via shift add is an o n operation but i can t see why squaring an n-bit int would be any different

3818047
openssh	jail
if you can find a jail broken device the guys answer below me talks about how to do it with openssh

3818072
folder	directory
i ended up going with opt local nginx since due to the macports folder structure there was no single top level directory like opt local that i could specify to simply replace the existing install

3818072
folder	dir
one tip on rvm don t use sudo to install gems since it puts them in a local folder off of your home dir

3818090
int	chars
in c and c++ a chars holds a single byte and the types chars is used to mean an 8-bit int as well as a single chars of text

3818107
int	boolean
alldata is a large dataset of mixed data - say 150 000 rows by 25 columns int boolean and string

3818107
int	boolean
i then convert 2 type int cols into type boolean

3818120
post	get
using this method here works well enough when you are doing simple get requests but utterly fails when doing post for the mere fact that it is doing a get after it is posted

3818120
post	get
get requests work wonders but any post just don t work

3818120
post	get
using a sniffer i am able to see the three-way handshake occur without any problems on both get and post requests

3818132
hash	salt
how can i add a salt to my current hash password when a user registers

3818135
width	height
some browsers are smart enough to recognize when an image is inside of a hidden object or in an object of 0 width height and not load it since it s essentially invisible anyway

3818143
hash	salt
andre salt don t make hash harder to crack at all

3818143
hash	salt
since the salt is stored in plaintext right next to the hash it s easy to just take that part out of the cracked hash.

3818143
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to make sure that identical plaintexts still have different hash

3818149
hash	salt
or it s up to you how the salt is generated as long as its being stored alongside with the password hash in the database

3818150
hash	salt
alternatively create a random salt for each password and save it alongside the hash password in the database

3818158
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i m using .net 3.5 sp1 there is a scriptmanager on the master page but no updatepanel on this page

3818200
width	height
i m not sure where _largeur and _hauteur come from but it looks like these are width and height

3818200
width	height
i think you should use the _colorselector height and width but i could be wrong

3818224
mktime	strtotime
some functions that may help along the way explode mktime strtotime date

3818268
merb	ruby-on-rails
i am porting a merb app to ruby-on-rails 3

3818268
merb	ruby-on-rails
in ruby-on-rails as in merb you can override to_param to provide an alternative id value for routes but for a case where one time you want to use an id and another time you want to use a different method on the same object as above identify is convenient

3818281
post	get
to help you get started this this post shows you how to create an entityconnection at runtime

profiling	instrumentation
i have tried the time profiling from xcode instrumentation

3818397

3818416
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
create a class that implements the idictionary inotifycollectionchanged inotifypropertychanged interfaces

3818416
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you must implement the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces for binding to work however.blockquote

3818476
email	dkim
perhaps if you use domainkeys and dkim in each email it will make the message appear less spammy

3818483
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
this is far better than writing python scripts in a standard text editor like gedit emacs vim or notepad especially since you can simply press f5 to run the script

3818520
uitableview	reloaddata
so you should explicitly call uitableview s reloaddata method to refresh table

3818524
hash	salt
i like to store the salt with the password hash in the database and compute it like this

3818540
org-mode	dired

goodquery is better than bad query since badquery will requery the database by grouping key for each grouping and worse it is highly unlikely there is an index to help with filtering customers by c.orders.count

3818613
daemon	cron
i think i read somewhere that this can be done using a cron job and that the index does not need to be entirely rebuilt so no stopping the daemon

i ve seen it happen with phpbb joomla especially joomla phpmyadmin and wordpress

3818738
for-loop	arrays

it doesn t matter if its protected private or public

3818927
cpu	processors
the bit shifting is cool but the multiplication may be free if your cpu can pipeline the multiplication on some otherwise unused multiplication unit - modern processors are a thing of beauty

3818967
width	height
the parameters of a rectf are left top right and bottom not x y width and height

3819338
toolbar	tabs
quite frankly you ll find better editors than emacs when speaking of tabs menus and toolbar

3819338
mouse	keyboard
emacs clearly encourages you to use your keyboard and leave your mouse asleep

3819338
mouse	keyboard
having to remove your hand from the keyboard to grasp the mouse and click on a tab and then remove your hand from the mouse and put it onto the keyboard is clearly a waste of time when a simple keystroke could be used instead

if you want the html content to be hidden after an ajax postback it will need to be in an updatepanel either the same one your formview is in or a separate one

3819590

puts	gets
the controller gets all of the data required for the request and puts it into the model

3819683
ready	each
for example if you write an application that has a plugin architecture you might create a project template for a plugin which has the code all laid out ready to be implemented so each time you write a plugin you start writing code straight away - rather than spending time laying out the structure of the plugin

3819692
put	get
in theory that should work and it works for other things that you put there but it seems that if specifying the charset in an included file tomcat doesn t get it defaults to iso-8859-1

3820453
client-side	server-side
if you really need to detect that the closest you would be able to get would be to have to have the server-side store the progress of the download by a unique id and provide an ajax interface for the client-side script to query whether the server had finished sending the file yet

3820473
inherited	base-class
inside any constructor the entire object might be only partially formed â you can know only that the base-class objects have been initialized but you cannot know which classes are inherited from you

3820977
crypt	salt
i m using blowfish and two salt to crypt a password and store it in the database

3820977
hash	salt
before i would store the salt and the encrypted password like a salt hash but realized its redundant because the salt is part of the encrypted password string

3820979

the better idea would be to use hashtable std map for your dictionary or to sort that vector and than count distinct words runs in o logn n your solution is o n 2

3820986
google-chrome	firefox
it will work correctly in firefox and google-chrome it means that the values that you set using javascript will be the same values that you have set

hide	show
now using jquery you can hide and show the 2nd div with the remaining results as you please

3821063
hash	salt
instead of hashing every word in a dictionary the attacker would now have to hash every word with every salt

3821063
hash	salt
with a long enough salt this gives enough combinations to make it unfeasible to compute all these hash

3821063
hash	salt
so a salt is not meant to be an extra password known only to the application it is meant to change the hash function so that it is non-standard

3821076
lwuit	lcdui
there is no direct support in lcdui classes for your requirement i would suggest try exploring lwuit

3821078
mouseover	mousemove
the simplest way would be to call the mouseover subroutine from the mousemove subroutine as such

3821078

queue	fifo
but i have to manually rotate them using fifo queue and rotatelogs to create a new log for each day

3822097
queue	fifo
edit the solution with fifo queue is not good enough because if the process that reads from this queue rotatelogs reads to slow it will slow down the entire jvm apparently sun oracle does gc logging synchronously

3822124
for-loop	loops
if inside the for-loop you write break loops

3822146

when you mouse over an object the tween starts i would consider removing the mouseover listener at that point let the rotation complete then add your mouseout listener

3827284
mouseover	mouseout
same logic with the mouseout as soon as the mouseout is triggered remove the listener and when the tween is complete add the mouseover

google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox javascript consoles confirm

3827573
int	chars
what is most interesting is the code from the folks like me that learned that going from 16 to 32 bit int changed size but unsigned chars and unsigned long did not so you adapted and rarely used int so that your programs would compile and work for both 16 and 32 bit

3827592
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you must explicitly call the close method when you are through using the sqldatareader to use the associated sqlconnection for any other purpose.

only need to change method get instead of post in form attribute

3827619
ffmpeg	libavformat
by default the search path is set to cdir cwd but if you have it set to something like path to ffmpeg cdir cwd and you try to set a breakpoint in the utils.c of libavformat it might find the one in libavutil-- in which case if you re lucky it will complain that the line where you want to set a breakpoint does not exist because the one in libavutil is shorter or it might set a breakpoint on the line you want but in the wrong utils.c

3827727
capitalization	uppercase
use of all uppercase characters is generally required and reserved for preprocessor defines an important guideline for enterprise scale preprocessor usage to remain manageable and which 3rd party libraries can be expected to follow observation of which implies migration of existing consts or enums to defines involves a change in capitalization and hence affects client code

when you are used to a powerful text editor be it vim or emacs no flamewars here it can be at time very difficult to use a lesser text editor like the ones provided by default by the various ides

3827975
vim	emacs
problem is as amphetachine pointed out using only vim or emacs to do java development feels like living in the stone age

3827975
vim	emacs
in the best of both world the text editor at the center of my ide would be emacs or vim and yet feature all the shiny real-time errors warning code-completion code traversal and whatnots that good java ides have

3827993
websphere	ibm
unfortunately you can get hold of the jdk only as part of another ibm product say websphere or any rational product that you purchased

3828120
free	malloc
but you should prefer the use of new and delete over malloc and free because these handle construction and destruction properly

3828120
free	malloc
if you want to keep using malloc and free you have to use the placement-new to properly construct the object and invoke the destructor manually to destroy it before you free it

3828137
hide	show
i have this code to show hide toggle a div when clicking a link

3828155
maven	buildr

3828265
datamapper	activerecord
i ve come across a couple of orms that recently announced they are planning to move their implementation from activerecord to datamapper

3828283
int	chars
every language i ve ever used will convert chars values to int using either unicode like java or the native chars encoding which is usually ascii-compatible

3828283
int	chars
note that i ve changed the type of the array from chars to int because each element should be a count not a chars

3828283
int	chars
alternatively you could leave it as an array of size 27 preferably still using int though and then have some sort of mapping function from chars to int

3828308
implements	extends
i use public class xxx extends xxx implements onitemselected listener and add two methods

3828330
int	chars
you could possibly do what pascal did and put the length of the string in the first chars but this is a bit of a pain and will limit your string length to the size of the int that can fit in the space of the first chars

3828361
memcpy	memmove
or using memcpy or memmove or bcopy but in this case there is no benefit to do that

3828361

3828701
portrait	landscape
when i run it in simulator it runs properly in portrait mode.but when i run my app in ipod it opens a blank video and in landscape mode .but in simulator when i click on play my video directly plays in portrait mode and in ipod it opens a blank video in landscape mode which i want in portrait mode

plugins should only use the swt library or use the swt-swing bridge to show swing based content

3829070
free	malloc
the difference between std malloc std free and new delete is that the latter will call constructors destructors while the former won t

3829092
inline	inlining
in c++ you can hint to the compiler that a function might be worth inlining using the inline but it ll still perform a performance analysis with its own heuristics

3829272
public	protected
proving is simply a matter of going through every single externally-accessible public protected internal or protected internal member and seeing if they can mutate the object

3829338

my guess is that executescalar was returning a different type long double etc rather than int

3829380
put	get
but when i copy that url and put it into the browser url i get a dialog that asks if i want to download sound.mp3

3829385

typedef is very useful for portable names tag names typedef struct foo foo

3829568
jcolorchooser	jfilechooser
i want to show the dialogs jcolorchooser and jfilechooser programmatically from

3829592
inherited	subclassing
an interface in java is an uninstatiable abstract class it has no constructors that provides public methods that all subclassing that inherited them must implement

3829647
typedef	struct
without typedef you have to use the keyword struct everytime if you use a struct in declarations

3829715
hide	show
i ve managed to get the hide show functions to work but what i m struggling with is getting the price to display in the label

3829721
children	parent
qwarning qobject cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread.

3829724
equals	gethashcode
if id truly identifies the objects that is to say when the ids are the equals the objects should be considered equals then implementing to compare based on id overriding equals to call into that type-specific equality method and overriding gethashcode to return the value of id if it is int or a smaller integeral type or cast to int if it s uint or id s hashcode if it s a different type will mean that this becomes the default concept of identity meaning that hashset won t need a special comparator and contains will do the work for you note that contains is essentially a loop too

3829731
hide	show
this issue simply resolved using the putting all the html content in the updatepanels and on updatepanel_prerender event of updatepanels check that if gridview has data then show html content otherwise hide

3829745
typedef	struct
the former does not contain the keyword typedef but inlining the struct definition is not possible either

3829829
asterisk	pbx
programming an asterisk pbx is quite easy using php agi

3829871
hide	show
obviously when the link contains the text show it reveals the hidden div and when clicked again it will not find show and will therefore hide the div

3830096
jsf	seam
i am not sure what seam is doing about this but in normal jsf this is unnecessary

3830137
n-gram	words
first you have to find all words using stringtokenizer in the text and than generate n-gram you need

3830138
put	get
the separation between controller and service means we have one place to put webapp-specific functionality like getting request parameters doing validation and choosing where to forward or redirect to and a separate place to put the business logic stuff that doesn t depend on webapp apis and is about what objects get updated with what values and get persisted using which data access objects

3830162
subobject	instances
this must be a subobject of an instances t of type t

3830256

3830334
macvim	textmate	vim	textmate
i m attempting to move from textmate to vim macvim to be exact as my primary editor

3830441
webclient	webrequest
i guess you will have to use webrequest webresponse rather than webclient

3830517
rss	feed
i have made the decision to use monotouch to develop an application that browses an rss feed and displays a grid of images much like browsing the picture library actually on the device

3830555
post	get
as you can see ajaxsetup assigns type to be post by default but i had to override it with get in my two calls below as i was getting 405 method not allowed probably because the contract uses webget attribute on both methods

3830607
realloc	malloc
i suspect that since you re calling realloc for every element obviously not wise in production the realloc malloc call itself is the biggest bottleneck for both tests even though realloc often doesn t provide a new pointer

3830610
realloc	malloc
expect performance to change where you mix up malloc and realloc calls

3830631
scons	autotools
it derives from the concepts of other build tools such as scons autotools cmake or ant

3830639
jquery	curvycorners
there are also jquery solutions such as the curvycorners script which does support ie

3830643
gridview	entitydatasource
using the gridview and the entitydatasource

3830657
yourkit	jprofiler
i have used both jprofiler and yourkit

my qwebview size is width 342 and height 501

3830735
put	get
i have put a calculate button on the main interface itself but i can t get the keyboard to go again once it is opened

3830737
public	protected
in your class code check the conditional define and switch between public or protected and private accordingly

3830753
realloc	malloc
others have also pointed out that the vast majority of your program s time is probably spent in malloc realloc which both implementations call once per addition

3830758
mouse	keyboard
i disagree with this entirely sure multi-threaded programs are non-deterministic but then so are single-threaded ones considering user input message pumps mouse keyboard handling and many other factors

3830770
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly with google-chrome but refuses to work with firefox

3830785
datagridview	xtragrid
paging as well as filtering in turn is supported at least by xtragrid not sure about microsoft s datagridview

i have created a row layout with width fill_parent with textview on left most side and an imageview on right most side

3830825
vb.net	vb6
your pinvoke declaration dates from the vb6 era it is quite wrong for vb.net

3830851
public	protected
i tried also by setting the same property as private on b but php does not allow to change the access level from public to private or protected

3830859
min	max
i would recommend that you should try to specify the max and min values of your numericstepper based on elements of your data object not based on the position of the row

3830893
getter	setter
the only idea that comes to mind is making private from the start and using magic getter and setter functions to control access

3830895
setinterval	settimeout
i m not sure what the rest of your code looks like but you might be better off using setinterval instead of settimeout

3830982
setinterval	settimeout
using a string for settimeout or setinterval is bad as it then calls eval which is slow and has other issues

3830983
gitignore	hgignore
svn has the svn ignore property mercurial has the hgignore file and git has the gitignore file for example

3830992
post	get
your fields have the default value if the user isn t in the field so naturally when you post the form that s what will get posted

3830996
disk	ram
there should not be a significant difference in ram usage or in time to read from write to disk

3831026
xts	quantmod
i m trying to read time series from csv file and save them as xts to be able to process them with quantmod

3831080
zoo	xts
the internal data structure of both zoo and xts is matrix so you cannot mix data types

3831102
width	height
the solution for my problem was to use even sizes for the width and height of my uiview

3831129
int	double
clarify - count - int price - double date - date

3831141
width	height
for example state belongs grouped with height width top left window position + state

3831143
mbunit	nunit
justcode has a unit test runner that can run tests written using xunit nunit mbunit or visual studio unit testing framework

3831147

3831233
getter	setter
i would use the individual getter setter inside of the sethouse method which is your second option

3831258

chuck forsberg looked at the xmodem and decided it was inefficient so he begat the ymodem but it s implementations were buggy and both x and ymodem were replaced with zmodem

3831279
macbook	bootcamp
having a macbook pro with windows installed thanks to bootcamp i have several questions

3831305
getter	setter
jon s answer to that question taken from another question about using getter setter which is not a duplicate to this one

3831305
getter	setter
you don t always need getter setter but if you have some there s usually a good reason why you ve implemented them and in that case use them

3831321
interpolation	splines
it is possible to display the parametric equation starting from the splines interpolation

3831407
curb	libcurl
the most direct approach might be to use the ruby curb library which is the most straightforward wrapper for libcurl

3831474
getter	setter
perhaps if you are getting and setting in two different places you might consider factoring out your getter and setter to a common interface

3831484
16-bit	64bit
some types have sizes that are platform-dependent which means an int might be 64bit or 32 bits or even 16-bit

3831489
submit	submission
use ajax to submit the form contents to abc.com while submission the form to xyz.com i m not comfortable enough with javascript to provide the source for this

a malloc that is one chunk or less in size take any free chunk in memory use an mmu table entry to point at it and give the caller the virtual address tied to that mmu entry

3831695
google-chrome	firefox
but it works in google-chrome firefox

3831731

wpf autocomplete textbox combobox doesn t work for me because it inherited from usercontrol and thus doesn t support the datatemplates i need for showing selecting the value of one properties for an object with multiple properties

3831752
maven	cargo
i am trying to deploy a webapplication using maven cargo plugin into tomcat server

3831761
strtol	strtod

3831874
vaadin	wicket
wicket and vaadin are my favorites

3831901
getter	setter
we are using a custom runtimedatabuilder class that dynamically constructs a .net type in-memory using reflection.emit to create simple property getter setter for the information that we receive from a generic wcf dataservice

3831901
getter	setter
when the information is received client side we generate the type with its property setter getter to improve the performance and facilitate binding on our silverlight client

3831901
getter	setter
my concern is for the type with all its property getter setter that is now not required anymore

3831908
kde	gnome
and archlinux awesome wm without kde and gnome installed

3831942
outputstream	inputstream
i tried to simply copy the data from this inputstream to a new outputstream using a byte buffer but i also tried just getting a string from the data to see what s happening in a debugger

return-value-optimization	nrvo
if named return-value-optimization nrvo is available the compiler may elide the copy

3832022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
returning an unnamed temporary variable here means compilers without named return-value-optimization nrvo will have a better chance to elide the copy of the local object - instead working directly on the callers stack

min	max
equal to min max seed1 max seed2 max seed 3 etc

3832844
int	chars
please look at the following code that just convert an unsigned int to a string there may be some unhandled cases but it s not my question allocating a chars array in the heap and returning it leaving the user the responsibility to free it after the use

3833190
dbf	dbase
anyone knows a component or driver to generate de dbf file in dbase ii or iii

3833202
udp	tcp
i would expect that a custom tcp or udp server running a custom protocol that is ideally tailored for your particular needs would be the most efficient solution but since you re not really telling us much about what you need to communicate it s rather difficult to answer

3833234
opera	firefox
i once did a test where opera an firefox where finished after a few seconds but msie hadn t finished after 20 minutes

3833445

augmenting the object.prototype object in that way is never recommended because those properties will be inherited by a great number of objects -even also by some host objects- and as you know the primary concern is that they will be enumerated by the for-in statement

3833507
minimum	max
i have set a minimum pool size of 5 and max of 50

children	parent
the closest i ve come is by using the preloadchildren attribute on the treeloader but this still only loads when the parent node containing children is loaded

3834475
equals	gethashcode
i suspect by duplicate you mean an object with equals field values to another object - you need to override equals gethashcode for that to work and or implement .

3834475
multiplying	add
the add and multiplying approach to combining several hash codes into one is the standard one recommended by josh bloch

3834475
multiplying	add
we really don t care if the repeated multiplying add leads to an overflow because we re not looking for a magnitude as such.

3834559
spaces	linefeed
then you need to read the file in and use spaces and linefeed whitespace as separators

3834581

rss	feed
multiple rss feed

3834673
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi

the problem relies in the inability for py.test to be pointed at the right ini config file so that i can get the app loaded with the variables i need

3835253
folder	directory
i was trying to change root directory to separate the root from programfiles like inetpub so i change php server root and localhost 81 still works but not run the under the folder i created instead it points at the same old default folder but the problem is zendcore is not working and it says no input file specified

3835270

the position is serializable correctly but it is not recovered during deserialization

3835296

the guy who implemented some of the code before used drawellipse int x int y int width int height and this converts float to int

3835469
mouseover	mouseout
so what should i do except using mouseover and mouseout method....that is last option

3835490
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
the solution is not obvious you need to use a uisearchdisplaycontroller in order to get a matching uisearchbar and uisegmentedcontrol

3835517
kerberos	ntlm
what this means is that if kerberos negotiation between the server and client fails then the server automatically falls back to ntlm

3835628
setinterval	settimeout
you could also use setinterval instead of settimeout but that s just a cosmetic change

3835640
pthreads	fork
fork and exec work the same on mac os x as on linux and other pthreads environments with one catch in a cocoa app you can t just fork and not exec because core foundation will not allow you to use any cf- or cocoa-based apis in the new process

3835657
setinterval	settimeout
btw i think you want to use setinterval instead of settimeout

3835658

3835753

3835783
post	get
i followed several pages and blog post like this but i can t get it working

3835799

a youtube demo if you re not on safari google-chrome or another browser the above works on

3836153
ado	unidac
others mentioned using a combination of datasetprovider and clientdataset to have a batch update but in case of using ado or unidac components you do not need the extra layer of datasetprovider + clientdataset because both ado and unidac support batch updates

3836153
