the problem is that stdout is buffered and stderr is not meaning that the errors will always show first in this case

12960344
post	get
i decided to re-implement the server as a get with arguments instead of a get and a post

12960413

12961045
mouse	trackpad
i know it is possible with apple magic mouse or magic trackpad but i dont have them

you need to set the width and height of this div otherwise the plot library doesn t know how to scale the graph

12961167
queue	fifo
what i want to do is have 4 queue running each queue has a priority to it so each one runs for its predetermined amount of time in a round robin format and was thinking of using the priority queue for each queue then i found in the java api that a linked list is also a queue if im reading that right which is a fifo queue

12961194

the grouping by filtering out the duplicate results

12961196
spaces	delimiter

although a queue is traditionally fifo the linkedlist has a removefirst and a removelast function even a remove at -- remove int index

12961218
integer	unsigned
i am treating the argument as an unsigned integer in 32bit this acts as a sort of equivalence to what a single precision floating point number would look like

12961218
integer	unsigned
apparently i should be able to do it with just bitwise operations and integer unsigned operations if while ||

12961238
folder	directory
when the doctor uploads a file a new directory is created inside the user s folder and the item is uploaded into that folder

i can put a breakpoint on populatetolastrun and it will never get there

12961267
for-loop	arrays
this is contrary to other popular languages where out-of-bouns access to arrays causes some kind of error and does not guarantee the correct condition for terminating for-loop

12961278
width	height
then a rectangle of width height 50 will be painted whenever you click on the canvas depending on your x y location you could change the fixed width height by using a variable based on user input

12961282
for-loop	arrays
in the arrays above you ll break out of the for-loop when item is assigned to false

12961303

associativity	operator-precedence
the c++ operator-precedence table from i know it s not normative but the standard doesn t talk about precedence or associativity marks unary operators as right left associativity

12961355
operands	scalar
in the comparison the left operands is non-scalar returns 0 while the right operands is scalar

12961355
operands	scalar
so scalar expansion rules apply and the scalar operands is expanded to the dimensions of the non-scalar operands in this case 0x0 and the result is an empty matrix

12961378

add-on	xpcom
you could try using c-types with ff which is a regular dll being called by javascript in your add-on this is way better approach that using xpcom because if the interfaces you use in there can change in each ff version indeed you will have to do multiple dlls each for your add-on supported ff versions

button	checkbox
so assuming you want one and exactly one category to be selected i would consider changing the inout types from checkbox to radio button

12966429
button	checkbox
now as far as your actual script goes alex had a good start but you should take it a step further and actually change the input types to radio button so you inherit their natural behaviour rather than force a checkbox to act like a radio button

12966482

also note that the accelerometers on phones are clamped to certain max sensitivity usually - + 2 4 8 g range

12966787
range	max
while normal walking running might operate under these range a sudden impulse in acceleration for example on a bike will definitely be clamped to the max and you will lose sync in dead-reckoning

even if i make the negative 11 a positive int of 11 and add 65 i get 76 which is ascii chars l but the right answer is o

12967119
width	height
so for example if their columns are 200px wide and the original image is 600px height and 400px width they would scale the image by half to get it to fit the column width

12967119
width	height
so 600px 0.5 300px height and 400px 0.5 200px width

it s as matt said you could use css s active pseudo class to change the background or alternatively you could use javascript to add an eventhandler onclick listener to the button that changes the image

12967236
width	height
one must check width and height of the imageview if height width then at the time of rotation width must be equal to height and same with height

12967236

getter	setter	tostring	getter
as for methods you can skip the normal setter and getter if you write a single constructor that has parameters for all data and override the tostring method

12967395
superclass	subclassing
constructors of subclassing should use the superclass constructor

12967395
superclass	subclassing
the tostring methods of subclassing should use the tostring method of their superclass

12967395
getter	setter
the part that throws me for a loop is the idea that a single constructor can be written that will cover all the necessary parameters for the setter and getter instead of writing them in each sub-class

12967406
children	parent
there is parent child relation consumer producer etc are children of session which in turn is a child of connection

12967406

when yes with ajax at client-side or with php at server-side

12971665
post	get
for get access token you need to use form post method instead of get.so you use this code

you can also use the nosuchmethod method on a class to intercept setter getter and store the received value in a map

12971747

i have been trying some sql queries without any succesful result because my return only show the products that have the attribute and hide the others

width	height
and finally image top and left margins set - height 2 and - width 2 respectively

12971852
width	height
get height and width

12971852
width	height
then you can scale it with the required height and width of the image as per your requirement

12971890
pop-up	dialog
however you should be able to get this behaviour if you invest the time to write a plugin for that should be under an hour depening on your wxwidgets skill the gui bit to pop-up the dialog will probably be the hardest thing

12971890
pop-up	dialog
in your event handler pop-up the dialog read out the textbox and modify any settings you want

12971937
entities	entitymanager
i would love to know how to do this by just creating entities dynamically adding them to the entitymanager and creating the tables but i don t think this is something that the doctrine team had in mind so i think i d have to do a lot of it myself

after this i open the previously closed container now the ocx calculates the proper width and height of itself according to previously set property and the fires the change to the container

12972132
width	height
but still in ondraw i m not getting the newly calculated height and width of the ocx

12972263
put	get
etc with the standard put request and get should return its current state

12972286
httpcookie	cookiemanager
up to now only add uri httpcookie and get uri are used by cookiemanager

12972317
min	max
maybe you do not need the logic to temporary undefine the min and max macros

12972390
getter	setter
global variables are accessible from any place of the code but instance variables are accessible inside class unless of course you have defined setter getter

12972416

versioning	upgrade
i recommend you upgrade to a recent lazarus which is based on a current versioning of the same free pascal compiler

12972800
int	chars
however +x is an int while x is a chars in your case

12972800
int	chars
so the effect it has in this case is that println int is called as opposed to println chars effectively printing the numeric value of your chars instead of the chars represented by it

12972800
int	double
the reason why +x is an int is that the unary operator + performs a so-called unary numeric promotion which normalizes numeric values to the types int long float and double as appropriate

12972804
short	base
my short answer to this is treat your test suite with the same respect you treat the rest of your code base

you could try to redirect stderr 2 to stdout 1 perhaps that will capture the missing output

12972880
put	get	post	get	post	put
edit must be a get all methods are get except create post update put and destroy delete

12972884

12973345
maven	pom.xml
then re-run maven which re-reads the pom.xml to run the real build

12973345
versioning	upgrade
this works better if you use particular versioning instead of snapshot dependencies and let the pre-build step upgrade them if necessary

12973345
maven	pom.xml
trying to do all this in one step usually fails because maven only reads the pom.xml once string substitution doesn t work in a few places and the deployed installed pom.xml doesn t generally doesn t contain the results of string substituion or changes made during the build

the dialog box is instatiated once but the code that displays hide show in the dialog box is contained within a function that can be called many times depending on the user actions

12973569
hide	show
closing the dialog box and displaying the dialog box again the extra information is show hide show hide immediately etc....

12973569
hide	show
i m at loss on how to get the expected behaviour where a user can click and display the dialog box many times and the hide show of the extra information stays displayed until the dialog box is closed or please click here is clicked many times or just once and then the dialog box is closed

12973616
int	double
because youâ re trying to put a double into an int array regardless of being accessed through a number reference

12973902
children	parent
then use an outer join query from the parent to child to retrieve instances where there are parent with and without children

12974209
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you want to replicate the pre-ios 6 behaviour where all the views in the navigation stack tab bar have to agree on an allowable set of orientations put this in your subclass of uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller

12974244
hide	show
the reason i need the show hide buttons is because the output is displayed in a full-screen overlay it is too big for the normal content area

12974422
width	height
as soon as itext knows the width of the table you can calculate the height of all the rows

12974438
min	max
since you only care about the max here it might be faster than a set although they both have the same theoretical complexities a heap can retrieve the min max in o 1 but removing it which you must do for this problem is o log n in this case and either one should work just fine

12974477
getter	setter
are there any getter or setter for javascript

12974485
opera	firefox
it happens that in firefox and opera the ad is in front of the video embed by the plugin so it s cool

if you still get an issue then there could be a problem with width padding margin of td or input or span

12974547
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear

configobj	configparser
depending on your python version it may be contentious whether this answers your question but after a short look at configparser and configobj i settled for configparser the python 3 version of configparser

12975190
configobj	configparser
configparser seemed cumbersome to me maybe evenâ dare i say itâ unpythonic and with configobj i encountered an esoteric problem with lists iâ d prefer to be able to align them vertically since mine get really long and it didnâ t help that the latest version was published more than two years ago

12975190
configobj	configparser
the api of configparser however looked as spiffy as that of configobj albeit not as feature-rich and when we move to python 3 i can probably switch to the built-in version easily

12975265
isotope	masonry
you need to set the masonry first item width so that once re-sized isotope will remember this settings instead of the new first item width keeping the grid consistent

in your case that you are using a module and your files are inside protected folders your need to publish them to be public accessible

12975585
freemarker	velocity
if you need auto-removal of irrelevant html elements you should be using a templating-capable view technology such as jsp s successor facelets or some 3rd party library like velocity freemarker and so on

12975632

you can also wrap the element in some other element like div and then use the click of that div to show or hide the inner content

12975674

put	get
if you want to get a random value from the array you ll need to actually put some randomness into getrandomvalue .

post	get
so if you know the source of the error or can somehow get it from the nvidia forums please post it here

12975787
hide	show
also keep in mind that calling show and hide directly is more expensive than callind .css display and .css display none

12975797
free	malloc
each implementation needs to keep track of the sizes of the malloc ed memory of course somehow to be able to correctly free it so it may offer a means to get at that information

maven	pom.xml
pom.xml for maven

12976036

getter	setter
your set.notify could work with some reflection but i donâ t think this would be good solution and you will still need to implement getter and setter

12976845
getter	setter
the getter and setter on automatic properties are converted into methods with backing variables by the compiler so there is no way to put an extension method on them

12976861

i tried making my class inherited from listviewitem like public classname listviewitem this worked

12977050
multiplying	division
from back then i remember that multiplying two values can be achieved with comparably simple logical gates but division is not a native operation and requires a sum register that is in a loop increased by the divisor and compared to the dividend

12977067
floating-point	fractions
finally bear in mind that most programming languages represent fractions values using binary floating-point types so even if your database stores values in another format they ll probably get converted with all the ensuing issues that entails at the interface with your application code

12977075
getter	setter
so you should use getter and setter only if you want to return or set the property of your class

12977084
getter	setter
getter setter are for the purpose of setting value to particular attribute in object and getting same from the object this way you can define attributes as private and enforce encapsulation one of the oo principles

12978347
division	modulo
this algorithm must use whole number division and modulo in some way

12978387
datediff	difference
for firebird you need to use datediff to obtain a difference between two timestamps datetimes

12978387
min	max
if you then want to cast it to char you can use cast eg cast datediff day max p.end_time min p.start_time as char 8 should do the trick or you can simply do cast max p.end_time - min p.start_time as char 8 as timestamps are subtractable

12978402
maven	pom.xml
maven pom.xml

12978419
division	multiplication
note if you do the multiplication by 100 before the division it means you don t need to mess about with casts to floats doubles however it does mean that all of your percentages are rounded down

12978424
vim	emacs
i understand using a local emacs or vim one can edit remote files

12978466
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

children	parent
it is made up of a single parent t with children that may have children and so on

12978834
children	parent
i made an assumption that the size of a parent object would be larger than the sum of the sizes of the children

12978834
children	parent
in some cases this appeared to make sense but in others the sum of the children far exceeded the size determined for the parent

12978839
width	height
all the boxes will be images i need to cover 50 of the div s width and 100 of it s height white box

well you could determine the size of your pictures in pixels that way you can make sure the the 25 images are of same width and height

12978977
width	height
without overriding the get width or get height i haven t been able to fill the whole screen

12978977
width	height
this approach is flawed however because it overrides everything that asks for width and height

12978979
children	parent
it s possible that it s not serializing the children elements which is one reason why you d see the parent size smaller than the sum of the children possibly even smaller than each individual child

however on ics and jb devices i haven t tested gb or hc but the issue doesn t exist with froyo if the activity is started while the screen is off the lockscreen is not disabled and the activity is not shown when the phone is unlocked either through unlocking it manually or with the code i put in for post froyo devices

12979743
hide	show
in every odd onprogressupdate it would hide the mole if it hasn t been whacked. by handling the show hide in onprogressupdate you are automatically on the main ui thread so no worries there and having a separate thread for each hole will allow you to have a more dynamic playing field of holes moles

dictionary	map
finds a mapping in an association listâ a list of pairs used to represent a map or dictionary

12980565

12980579
post	get
we keep all parameters in params that is in the url and we submit a form with method get not post as usual so we can have all this params in the url

12980594
width	margin
alternately if you know the sum of the widths of the logo and the flash banner which i think you do you can create a div with width equal to the sum and apply a margin auto property to it

12980637
put	get
i d rather get my .htaccess working than put php to do the 301 redirects in all the files that aren t redirecting i have tried and verified that using one file

zoo	xts
for additional awesomeness the zoo and xts packages have many more functions which are great for various aggregations past the day level of detail

12980680
post	get
you ll get better answers if you post concise code

12980695
filtering	grouping
if you also want to actual grouping of people who conform to those predicates use filtering

12980700
maven	pom.xml
my maven pom.xml is so configured that it creates a total new source-base refactor package name change androidmanifest replace icons replace properties file build and sign with the right key the apk all with a single command-line

12980700
maven	pom.xml
i think this is a good solution the only drawback is that requires some work to configure your pom.xml right especially if you don t know maven well

12980734
hash	md5
and then compare the md5 hash of the uploaded files using the md5_file function php manual with the ones stored

12980734
hash	md5
if they are stored in a database it might be a performance increase to directly store the md5 of each file in a field for itself so you can easily query the database for existing md5 hash

12980750
pull	push
scrubs also can not pull or push to any non master branch nor push newly created branches

12980777
post	get
this is some basic guidance feel free to post back if u get stuck on this

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome firefox and safarie and a workaround with svg for ie and opera

12980899
uiview	subviews
it s impossible to say for sure since we don t see the locations of your buttons but if you give a background color to your uiview that contains your buttons or set it to clip subviews you may find that the resizing is causing your buttons to be outside the frame thereby making them unclickable

12980910
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome window.opener.socket.on ... function successfully start from popup window code but ie9 wont

12980919

sorting	filtering
the issues i am having are with sorting and filtering columns within access

12980961
sorting	filtering
my users require similar functionality that access provides - filtering sorting editing data and they do not want to write any sql to do this

12980973
openacc	pgi
edit unfortunately only the pgi compiler really supports openacc right now for nvidia gpu cards

12980997
min	max
as a word of advice min and max are names of built-in matlab functions

12981046
post	get
i know there re post build scripts that will do this but really if unit test breaks i rather that it doesn t get into source control at all

12981050
for-loop	arrays
you should use a regular for-loop for arrays because for-in will also return all the other property keys in the arrays object

12981050
for-loop	loops
here is your code with the for-in loops replaced with a for-loop and it works as expected

12981059
squash	branch
i find out that after i squash master when i checkout branch one or two they still show the old history when i run git log

12981106
onclick	onsubmit
you ll still need to strip inline event handlers onclick onsubmit and re-bind them using jquery

12981112

it hide everything but it doesn t show the paragraphs afterwards

12981287
jar	war
can i just include the domain source in my gwt project so i can debug all at once without having to manually build a jar and have everything in my war folder ready to go for deployment

12981295
int	chars
e.g. if you want to access an int s storage as an array of chars

12981297
listactivity	expandablelistview
this is an example of how you might set it up if you re using an expandable listactivity vs regular activity with expandablelistview

12981313
children	parent
you can t show children of a hidden parent

12981322
hide	show
if you want to show all p but hide others you can append all p to body as

12981328
floating-point	integer
8 integer floating-point or enumeration type can be converted to

12981349
ssl	https
if you enable ssl then you can redirect any url from http to https in your .htaccess

12981352
firefox	safari
alternatively if something fails the first attempt i might always try firefox safari on the second request or implement a random timeout between subsequent attempts

12981392
pubnub	pusher
another similar solution could use a third party service like pusher or pubnub which allow browsers to maintain persistent connection and then allow your rails server to notify the clients once an event is fired

12981417
ubuntu	linux
i m using dav_svn apache2 linux ubuntu server 11.04

12981426
hide	show
to work around this i figure that doing a hide show mechanism like the art of asking is the path of least resistance but while i can figure out how to hide an element i haven t a clue how to show it after it s been hidden

12981427
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i faced this issue all the time while developing silverlight applications you need to place the clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml on your server

12981431
accessor	properties
if you still want other pieces of code to be able to read the properties then use an accessor

12981480
for-loop	loops
my only solution to this is to have a for-loop after the filter statements where i loops through and i eliminate any object that doesn t have the proper active field

12981484
google-chrome	safari
they work fine in google-chrome safari and in ie 7 8 9

12981484
google-chrome	safari
in ie google-chrome and safari the path looks like this correct

12981523
hazelcast	terracotta
guava cache is not enough you ll need something more sophisticated like rmi clustered ehcache terracotta or hazelcast

12981534
free	malloc
boost.interprocess seems to have a neat implementation of managed memory-mapped files with provisions similar to malloc free but for mapped files you have a handle to a suitably-large memory-mapped file and you can ask the library to sub-allocate an unused part of the file for something like an array

12981554
versioning	upgrade
you may want to upgrade spreadsheetgear to the latest versioning

12981561
google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly fine in all browsers and even in google-chrome on ios but it doesn t always work in safari on ios

12981569
google-chrome	safari
my gut tells me that ie google-chrome and safari are converting the backward slashes to forward slashes

12981589
for-loop	loops
it now doesn t contain any indentation problems but now it only loops for one random number despite this random number generator in the range of 2-12 being in the for-loop and as a result doesn t exit the if and while conditions

12981692
for-loop	loops
however if i change the parallel.for loops to a simple for-loop it runs in about 200 miliseconds

12981788
setcontentview	findviewbyid
quite simply you can t call findviewbyid before setcontentview because there is no layout set to find a view in

12981788
setcontentview	findviewbyid
call setcontentview with your layout resource id or actual view first then find your linearlayout with findviewbyid

12981833
free	malloc
prog 10346 malloc error for object 0x7faf13c03920 pointer being free was not allocated set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

12981836
onstart	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
in other words to troubleshoot i would override acitivity lifecycle methods onpause onresume onstart onstop and ondestroy as well as onbackpressed simply adding the db close and test your application then

12981862
inherited	subclassing
inherited subclassing generalization hierarchy etc.

12981874
barrier	scheduling
here the tasks that you re doing are so simple take so little time and there are few enough of them that the overhead of creating threads breaking up the tasks scheduling them dealing with context switches memory barrier and all of that is significant in comparison to the amount of productive work that you re doing

12981876
min	max
set the min and max sizes to the desired size

12982047
ienumerable	ienumerator
this pattern is particularly horrible because it prevents us from simply doing foreach var item in mylist because ienumerator doesn t implement ienumerable

12982049
temp	tmp
in both cases the solution is to set mcr_cache_root to a local folder tmp or temp

12982049
folder	directory	temp	tmp
this can be avoided by setting mcr_cache_root to a non-existent directory or to a folder in which there is global access permissions tmp or temp are usually such writable folder â see related posts here and here

12982055
free	malloc
first must be free using and malloc ... must be free using free

12982055
free	malloc
second if you use a type with a constructor then malloc will not call the constructor and free will not call the destructor

12982110
free	malloc
when you run the code you should see on the standard error the pointer addresses being malloc d and free

12982137
min	max
use struts glues and min max prefererd sizes to adjust spacing resizing behaviour

12982143
typedef	struct
typedef on the other hand are used to say if i talk about type understand that i meant struct more_complex_type it is used at compile time and will stay the same before and after the cpp pass

12982167
versioning	upgrade
this typically won t cause conflicts after a versioning upgrade since the default schema search path has pg_catalog implicitly before public so the user-defined function is out of business as soon as the system function exits - unless schema-qualified explicitly

12982167
versioning	upgrade
but you should remove it after a versioning upgrade anyway

12982201
google-chrome	firefox
here s the kicker - seems to work fine in firefox not in google-chrome

12982211
children	parent
each of the children elements should have a top and left value positive or negative which describes its offset from standard positioning within the parent element

12982239
google-chrome	firefox
window.event is a non-standard property and only works in some browsers ie - it will evaluate to undefined elsewhere firefox google-chrome

12982250
ienumerable	ienumerator
note that ienumerator is implemented explicitly while is implemented implicitly so it will encourage using it as an ienumerable while still make using it as an ienumerator possible

12982253
for-loop	arrays
convert changesothersresult to an arrays and use a for-loop to output something like this

12982308
hide	show
is there any tutorials on how to show hide a form or textbox based on if a value is selected

12982323
google-chrome	firefox
fully tested and works for me google-chrome 22.0.1229.94 m and firefox 13.01

12982344
emacs	sublimetext
there s a sublimetext emacs rocks

12982352
cruisecontrol	teamcity
as for hooking with teamcity it is probably just a setting in the build step definition to check for a certain string in the output for example presence of testfailed in the output indicates failure i ve done it with cruisecontrol and also created an nunit wrapper around it

12982397
sorting	grouping
how i get each grouping to have a unique id in a second column after sorting for example

12982410
hide	show
add a callback to your next action that hide the vimeo and show a static image or something

12982428
implements	extends
it doesn t require implements create on each of the extends classes

12982435
pdfsharp	itextsharp
not sure what the advantages of itextsharp are but i found a solution that is working perfectly so far using pdfsharp

12982445
width	height
the width and height values have to change with different screen sizes

12982445
width	height
i am specifying a static width and height for the view in the xml

12982446
config	ini
read the comments in there above the session config statement and it mentions how to specify required ini setting

12982450
firefox	safari
i have tested on firefox and safari and the chart appears only after i refresh the page

12982454
hash	salt
the two primary things i would focus on are secure salt 20+ bytes and to iterate the hash at least 64 000 times to increase the attack time

12982466
children	parent
children in andengine gles2 cannot be drawn behind their parent

12982480
put	get
if i put a binding.pry and jump in just before the assert_equal this is what i get

12982487
packets	multicast
so i basically have the ability to capture some packets from a multicast environment and i save them to file and then i multicast them out to applications which expect multicast data

12982487
packets	multicast
busy chew because i don t want to yield to other processes and thus take longer than expected but a very small amount not even a millisecond because that would entail 200 seconds of waiting to multicast out the packets

12982495
google-chrome	firefox
no ie browser support ofcourse works in google-chrome firefox and

12982506
uninstall	upgrade
if i had to download a new 80mb file for each incremental upgrade i d probably just uninstall instead

12982516
post	get
the second case works better from a read perspective it makes it easier to get post if you have the user id but you have the index write ops when you write your post

12982553
daemon	cron
in general robustness favours cron and performance favours a daemon

12982576
put	get
i put that into my ios app using uicolor and i get a color that looks right but when i look at it using the digitalcolor meter the value is 228 228 228

12982586
pull	push
this is a simple distributed structure that makes each service responsible for acquiring its settings in order to operate pull model and is easier to manage than notifications out to each service instance push model

12982588
min	max
how to select min and max date values in linq query

12982619
width	height
first of all yes you should avoid setting static width and height in xml let them be wrap_content

12982649
rss	feed
i m parsing a reddit rss feed with nokogiri for a certain subreddit

12982649
rss	feed
there is one attribute called description however generated by the reddit rss feed which does include an html string that includes two links

12982684
width	height
b set the width and height of the object to be 100

12982703
width	height
alternatively if you want pin point accurate calculations you can ask appcelerator for the platform width and height and resize things proportionately yourself

12982738
portrait	landscape
it works well in portrait mode but when in landscape the footer takes up such a large percentage of the available space that it really affects the user experience

12982751
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox safari and google-chrome

12982786
min	max
the second cte counted2 groups the previous result set by client_id and column containing the row count called timestested and again counts the rows and finds the max and min dates per group

12982896
int	chars
the reason is here is not a chars vector but an int vector

12982923
text-align	height
add height to #bottombanner at least it was necessary for my fiddle and add text-align center to

12982924
getter	setter
but the xmlserializer also needs public getter and setter on properties in order to serialize deserialize

12982924
serializable	deserialization
i think of the datacontractserializer binaryformatter behavior like suspending the state of an instance during serializable and resuming during deserialization

12982942
floating-point	integer
floating-point arithmetics is by far more complicated than integer arithmetics

12982978
post	get
since i spent some time figuring out how to get the plugin running i will post here to save anyone else the time and in order for myself to find it back if i need to do it again...

12982996
move	drag
i get errors because the child element is the this in the move part of a drag

12983030
datamapper	activerecord
if your using rails 3+ you might want to consider datamapper instead of activerecord

12983067
int	boolean
in some special cases it can be done by collapsing the n-vectors into scalars and using numpy.unique on the 1d result if you had boolean you could use a vectorized dot with the vector to convert boolean vectors to int but i m looking for a fairly general solution

12983070
width	margin
you have to use width some_value and margin auto to center the entire form

12983129
installshield	dtf
i have a .net custom action dtf executing from installshield

12983133
portrait	landscape
say for example you are using an iphone to view this site and you turn the phone 45 degrees to landscape instead of portrait

12983171
getter	setter
5 i hope you have getter and setter instead of just those comments

12983177
d3.js	raphael
he uses d3.js to do the heavy lifting of handling the scales generating path data for areas and lines and formatting dates and he uses raphael for the rendering

12983322
min	max
you ll need to make good use of max min widths and heights

12983334
public	protected
you can have few types of variables in an object static and non-static but also public private protected

12983348
int	boolean
indeed there is no reason to use an int here a boolean or enum would obviously be a better choice but i wouldn t bother over such a small thing

12983373
width	margin
centering by usual means using margin 0 auto won t work in this case since there is no width attached to your form but you can get it to center regardless of width by declaring that container div inside your form inline-block and then text-centering your form like so

12983407
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i guess google-chrome ie and safari converted them properly but firefox is a bit more strict in that regards

12983421
pop-up	dialog
but when the app exits and they come back later i want same dialog notification to pop-up prompting user to login

12983508
google-chrome	safari
an updated version of google-chrome webkit 537.4 or safari webkit 534.57.2 on a desktop produces a gradient more-similar to ios5 so it s probably not directly a webkit issue

12983508
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome reports 32-bit depth but has more banding than desktop safari which only reports 24-bit color depth

12983538
for-loop	loops
a while loops makes more sense in this situation or a for-loop without initialization

12983561
int	chars
here s the code i had before which worked until i tried a different chars and received a cannot convert int to string error

12983589
for-loop	loops
the code is executed sequentially and the for-loop initialization will make you lose the boundaries of loops consider this code instead

12983608
for-loop	loops
1 your for-loop needs curly brackets around the code that is supposed to loops

12983608
cout	cin
2 your loop is above your cout and cin statements so it runs before the user ever enters any numbers

12983609
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for some reason in firefox once div reaches the bottom of parent element div disappears while in google-chrome ie and safari it stays visible

12983627
move	drag
what you are after is to make the pickers move drag only when the mouse is down

12983717
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the scene labelled as 2 is deep within the app it s embedded in a uinavigationcontroller which itself is accessed via a uitabbarcontroller

i need one of the pages to be in landscape orientation and the rest to be in portrait orientation so that when the pdf is viewed on screen all of the content will be oriented correctly

12983797
google-chrome	firefox
this link might be a great starting point for google-chrome + firefox

12983839
width	height
i have also tried setting the width and height attributes of the instead of inline css but that does not solve the slowness issue

12983853
ubuntu	linux
invoking this code on both linux ubuntu 12.04 and windows 7 you get very different results

12983855
min	max
2. determine max and min

12983864
rss	feed
this might fix your problem as i ve seen similar issues when rendering xml or rss feed direct from a macro out to the http response

12983901
onresume	onpause
the normal or intended way to manage this issue is itself rather complicated with the duality of onpause onresume and onsaveinstancestate onrestoreinstancestate

12983901
onresume	onpause
so if you have a scenario where there is meaningful user progress or state that should be persisted between launches of your application the guidance is to use onpause and onresume

12983904
rss	feed
currently i have an rss feed reader in a uitableview within a navigation control

12983906

this link might be a great starting point for google-chrome + firefox

12984028
put	get
you generally don t want to open up the machine- you just want to put the inputs in and get the output

12984123
move	drag
this still isn t doing exactly what i would like since if the user keeps holding the mouse down it attempts to call my drag move function even after the element has been removed it isn t actually forcing the drag event to stop it is just calling the up event and then giving a lot of non-fatal errors since the element doesn t exist any more when trying to call the move function.

12984123
move	drag
if anybody can provide an answer in the next few days as to how to force the drag to end so no more calls are made to the move function even if the user continues to hold the mouse down i will accept that answer

12984193
folder	directory
i m trying to use scandir to list all folder in a directory into a menu structure i am making

12984193
for-loop	loops
to do some testing i replaced the foreach loops with a for-loop

12984193
folder	directory
still doesn t work won t pull a folder within the directory

12984193
folder	directory
it lists all the files as well as the single folder in the directory

12984254
division	modulo
you can use modulo to find out the even and odd as it give you remainder after division

12984268
width	height
i have a for-loop that is meant to set the src height and width of elements in a table

12984268
width	height
if not then it sets an s style.cursor to pointer it sets the src of the sets the image s src to imgtodotimes2 then once that loads it sets the width and then the height with a proportion

12984315
shadowing	named
this isn t a circular definition because the inner ex is just shadowing the outer one and it s clearer if you use a different variable named

12984332
awt	swing
i would also read through painting in awt and swing to understand how painting works in java

12984354
google-chrome	firefox
most modern browsers ie9+ firefox google-chrome etc use the content-box box model for all inputs except submit which uses border-box if im not mistaken

12984361
mouseover	mouseout
i wanted to implement a swapimage on my site that would swap one image on mouseover and another image on mouseout

12984361
mouseup	mousedown
essentially with the solution i found i could also probably swap different images for mousedown and mouseup even

12984376
put	get
you can t just put a random job next to someone you use a join to get the correct relationship

12984383
innodb	myisam
these constraints should be enforced automatically assuming you are using innodb storage i reserve judgement on myisam but i think it does not enforce pk-fk constraints

12984416
javassist	cglib
if they are pojo s you should be able to use a library like javassist or cglib to create an enhanced version where your setters are stubbed to throw an exception

12984420
octal	decimal
and since 000000035 in octal is 29 in decimal its remainder with 10 is 9

12984420
octal	decimal
if you have your octal literal in a string simply use integer.parseint and you ll get it parsed as a decimal

12984426
width	height
this works fine but i want to resize the image if it exceeds a certain size width and height

12984429
ubuntu	linux
i have been working on this project in linux ubuntu 10.10 for the past several months and recently decided to port the code over to a windows 7 environment

on the other page it works as it should without shifting to right on scroll div and it works the same way without issues in firefox google-chrome ie

12984695
nsstring	nsnumberformatter
1 of the labels is used to feed your nsnumberformatter object by using nsstring stringbyappendingstring digit

12984706
google-chrome	safari
in the answer above google-chrome 21 and safari 6 did not have a filesize member but does have size

12984729
memcpy	strncpy
if this is the case use strncpy or memcpy as others have suggested

12984784
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for some reason in firefox once div reaches the top of parent element it disappears while in google-chrome ie and safari it stays visible

12984828
hide	show
my selector works fine i ve tested it in the console with other methods hide and show and various ways of selecting the same field either its id #j_username or #fields input first

min	max
edit just by looking at the min and max of y and x doesn t guarantee because im looking for the rectangular area that are free of point objects

12984868
int	double
also the answer for how many numbers would you like to process will be a int value cannot be in double

12984869
recv	epoll
and if you don t want to sit there waiting for data you should look into select or epoll to determine when data is ready to be read or not and the o_nonblock flag for sockets is very handy if you want to ensure you never block on a recv

12984916
getter	setter
i have tried autogenerating getter and setter and refactoring everything

12984948
memcpy	malloc
i ve used it without any guilty feelings and can see no reason why it is worse than using malloc memcpy

12984948
free	malloc
but then malloc ed strings are not free from the possibility of misuse either

12984985
stdout	stderr
if the programs are sending their output to stderr you would need to redirect stderr to stdout in order to capture it in your log file

12984988

12985176
ssl	https
curlopt_ssl_verifypeer this field is required if your third party server is https over ssl

12985179
width	height
if you want to use the css3 ui resize feature then your browser decides whether you can make it smaller or bigger than declared width or height

12985179
width	height
in firefox for example you can resize it smaller than your declared width or height

12985193
free	strdup
the other functions and most other standard functions require no free afterwards so strdup looks innocuous enough and you can forget to clean up after it

12985193
strcpy	malloc
vlas you have yet another reason to just use strcpy you don t even need malloc

12985231

12985679
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
note that applications throw the argumentnullexception exception rather than the nullreferenceexception exception discussed here

12985701
hide	show
instead of using attach try using show hide

12985701
hide	show
you will need references to all of your fragments but if you add them all then show the right one and hide the rest that might fix it

12985710
google-chrome	firefox
i just pulled up the site in google-chrome for mac and firefox for mac versions 22.0.1229.94 and 14.0.1 respectively and aside from a couple spacing differences which are minor the look the same

12985716
integer	unsigned
in this case as large as possible to avoid overflowing a 32-bit unsigned integer and

12985716
integer	unsigned
also for this case from the original formula would have overflowed a 32-bit unsigned integer

subtract	add
it said in the book i just need to subtract 32 from uppercase and add 32 to lowercase

12985937
int	chars
the result of arithmetic between a chars and an int is an int and you cannot store an int in a chars without explicit typecasting - by which you tell to compiler that i know what i m doing now do it for me

12985947
int	chars
the reason this is necessary is because 32 is an int literal and the addition of a chars and an int is performed using int arithmetic and gives an int result

12985947
int	chars
assigning an int to a chars potentially results in truncation

12985971
google-chrome	safari
note google-chrome and safari might change the css3 resize feature in future versions

remove the width and height attributes and it looks fine

12986293
realloc	malloc
also pointers initialized with malloc can be resized using realloc method

12986372
uilabel	nsstring
because uilabel and iboutlet elements only display the nsstring values

12986376
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if the object s closure consists of objects that implement serializable or externalizable you can use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to create a deep copy .

12986387
stdout	stderr
now there is a possibility that the external program is requesting stdout and stderr which your program is blocking

12986412
profiling	benchmarking
these data structures are api-compatible just benchmarking profiling your code with both

for-loop	loops
before this i was using a for-loop with ++dateitr in loops as follows

12986490
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout and than redirect stdout to tty

12986490
stdout	stderr
so now both stdout and stderr redirects output to terminal

12986490
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to stdout and than redirect stdout to dev null

12986490
stdout	stderr
although i don t understand the point of doing this because now both stderr and stdout are discarded

12986498
width	height
then renderadd adds a renderimage which has renderdimension which is the x and y of the object and the image width and height

12986540
stdout	stderr
the file descriptors for stdin stdout and stderr are 0 1 and 2 respectively

12986544
stdout	stderr
in both those cases stderr will be redirected to whatever stdout was linked to before stdout is redirected

12986544
stdout	stderr
in both those cases output will store whatever command printed to stderr and stdout is redirected to dev tty and dev null respectively

12986588
width	height
this sets my screen to the width and height of my largest panel

12986596
pygtk	pygobject
pygobject is what is called a dynamic binding and pygtk is a static one

12986596
pygtk	pygobject
pygobject is new and the future and pygtk is the past mature and some day will be deprecated

12986596
pygtk	pygobject
pygobject documentation and examples are very very limited and pygtk one are very very complete

12986596
pygtk	pygobject
pygobject is in active development no new features will be introduced for pygtk

12986608
mouseup	mousedown
track the mousedown x offet and then the mouseup x offset and the result shows the direction using jquery

12986657
google-chrome	firefox

12986691
postgresql	mysql
i get the following error when inserting data from mysql into postgresql

12986813
uiview	subviews
it s hard to understand exactly what you re saying but it sounds like you re trying to access a subviews of a uiview instance outside of that uiview

12986813
uiview	subviews	ivar	subclassing
if it is not a uiview subclassing where you have an ivar property reference to that subviews you can try giving it a tag and accessing it that way

12986828
post	get
to get the post loop through the result and use get_posts

12986836
getter	setter
effectively the class is a getter and setter

12986842
jtable	jtextpane
i need a jtextpane which has a header on top just like the one in a jtable

12986842
jlabel	jtextpane	jtable	jlabel	jtable	jtextpane
i tried adding a jlabel and jtextpane in a jpanel but jlabel just isn t the same as a jtable header and there is a gap between them

12986843

my issue is when image is rotated in portrait view under a landscape window it become distorted pinched

12986856
width	height
i have modified the function so that i have the width and height but i don t manage to get the memory block data points to

12986900
stdout	fflush
stdout won t be fflush while main is blocked waiting to join your threads

12986900
stdout	fflush
when you explicitly cancel the program again stdout won t be fflush

packets	pcap
i have written a program where i am reading a pcap file packets by packets and i need the flowid for each packets read

12987013
jtextfield	jlabel
for jtextfield you create a jlabel and set the mnemonic to jlabel

12987061
int	double
if you need to store an int or float in a variable you can use a double to store all possible values

12987089
stdout	stderr
means you are duplicating stdout on stderr you re redirecting stderr to where stdout is currently pointing at let s simplify this by calling it stdout s location

12987089
stdout	stderr
so when you redirect stdout later stderr does not get redirect too

12987089
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to stdout s location

12987089
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout to dev tty whereas stderr remains unchanged

12987089
stdout	stderr
in case 3 fd3 is used to temporarily store stderr s location while stderr s location and stdout s location are being switched

12987096
google-chrome	safari
it works in safari and google-chrome fine

12987132
width	height
maxwidth for textbox width of column fixed max height and using scrollviewer for large text

when i change the lib s output log to stderr or stdout everything works fine

12987183
google-chrome	firefox
i finally came up with a solution with was a bit long-winded but worked - at least in ie and google-chrome - however it doesn t work in firefox which suggests my code is a bit sloppy

12987206
gtk	pygobject	gtk	cairo	pygobject	cairo	pygtk	pygobject
i installed python pygtk and the gtk all-in-one bundle cairo pygobject ect on windows and tried to run it

queue	fifo
et voila your notepad is a fifo queue of nodes which you keep pass around as an accumulator but also consume to pick a subtree to visit

12987294
google-chrome	firefox
however you could look into a google-chrome extension or a firefox addon

12987295
width	height
the real problem that i found was java is interpreting each component with their x y location and width height

12987297
udp	tcp
if your mfc app is going to receieve lots of ad-hoc commands from different clients then udp may be appropriate but you have to weigh up whether saving the slight cost of a tcp handshake is worth the possibility that a command may never happen at all due to udp throwing it away

12987367
mockups	balsamiq
common tools are pen and paper things like balsamiq mockups powerpoint visio photoshop and whatever you can think of

12987377

this controller returns a hash salt to the user and he uses that for auth requests henceforth

12989101
stdout	stderr
by default stdout is line-buffered while stderr is unbuffered

12989101
stdout	fflush
edit by default stdout will be fflush d at the end of each line or when the buffer is full

12989101
stdout	stderr
then if stdout and stderr both have the same underlying file descriptor the output fprintf stderr .

12989101
stdout	stderr
often you wish to redirect both stderr and stdout to a file or pipe

12989101
stdout	stderr
so in this case stdout becomes block -buffered and in practice it seems that almost every output to stderr is interleaved with that of stdout

12989107
getter	setter
all other classes and all related setter and getter of this class are implemented also the encryptable interface is as follow

12989128

free	malloc
there is absolutely no guarantee that malloc returns an increasing sequence of results in time especially in real programs where millions of calls to malloc are mixed with millions of calls to free

12989846
free	malloc
on linux these syscalls are often mmap 2 perhaps with sbrk 2 and since linux systems are mostly free software you could actually study and improve the implementation of malloc musl libc implementation of malloc the more common gnu libc malloc implementation is perhaps more complex to understand

12989846
free	malloc
of course most implementations care about free and re-use recently free -d memory zone without any syscalls if possible in their malloc implementation

12989846
free	malloc
how to organize the heap to be able make malloc and free efficient is difficult and may be still a research subject if you want it to be very good

in your ondraw just get the current height and width of the canvas and draw your rectangles based on those dimensions rather than hardcoding fixed dimensions for your rectangles

12989939
salt	md5
should i use md5 + salt

12989965
put	get
i m not sure why you want a weak reference in a case class but presumably you want to be able to get your hands on the value and otherwise want it to be transparent that it s actually weak--otherwise you can just put a weakreference in the case class

12989975
for-loop	loops
you can use it in foreach loops or return list and use it in for-loop

width	height
afaik there is no standard way to preserve aspect ratio for images with width height and max-width specified together

12991496
width	height
so we are forced either to specify width and height to prevent page â œjumpsâ during loading images or to use max-width and not specify dimensions for images

12991496
width	height
specifying just width without height typically makes not much sense but you can try to override height html-attribute by adding a rule like into your stylesheet

i don t think this is exactly what it will look like but you get the idea just put the class in the prepend string and apply the necessary rules to where you want the div to go by default it will not go out side of the parent with a negative left value

12995523

12995582
hash	md5
i ask this because i want to include a variation of the python script for hashing the password in case the end user is on windows or another operating system that can t generate a md5 hash

12995619
hash	md5
md5 is a type of one-way hash function which mean there should be no way to decrypt once hash

12995619
hash	md5
however with rainbow table and possibly other ways you can recover some common strings from a md5 hash which makes the idea of using md5 to encrypt password even worse

12995619
hash	md5
alternatively you can simply use md5sum -s robots or md5 -s robots to generate the hash without using echo

12995761

as ancurio pointer it out you re incorrectly freeing the memory behind the previous pointer returned by malloc which is at that time invalid as realloc has been used on it

12995786
atomic	interlocked
you need either an atomic interlocked operation eg

12995789
int	chars
for example if you had a variable mychar that was a chars 1 byte but used a format specifier of d that would tell printf to go to the address of mychar and grab the next 4 bytes to treat it like an int

12995825
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu that user is www-data on redhat it s called apache

ubuntu	linux
i m following ubuntu s guide to get rails running on my newly installed ubuntu i m very new to linux in general

12995938
inherited	subclassing
it is therefore multi-table inherited and each subclassing does have a table

12995938
inherited	properties
though dog table alone will not contain the properties it inherited from the base class animal

12995938
inherited	properties
to get those inherited properties i think a join is unavoidable unless i missed something obvious

hash	hmac
you could use an hmac approach whereby you hash the first couple of bits of the post payload using a hashing algorithm secured by a secret key known only between your php library and your backend

12996036
int	chars	int	double
the compiler casts the int chars shorts to the native width of the architecture or in the case of a double or long long at 32 architecture it allocates two slots from the stack

12996060
cdr	cons
the exact set of primitives varies but includes cons car cdr and a most primitive version of apply that executes one of these real functions rather than the interpreted version of itself

it seems to me if our class is the immediate children of nsobject then isequal will simply call it s parent s isequal and that simply compare pointers

12996215
hide	show
just put it as main.cpp to build application and click show and hide button to test

12996233
mdpi	hdpi
one quick way to fix such issues can be that you copy all drawable files to drawable-ldpi mdpi hdpi folders

12996575
setinterval	settimeout
perhaps you can combine both the setinterval and settimeout and once the src is filled clear the interval

12996651
mouseout	mouseleave
use jquery s mouseleave instead of mouseout

12996657
int	chars
the problem is the original number is stored as a 4-byte int while the buffer is stored chars by chars so what is going to be sent through the socket is not 4 bytes but 10s of one byte chars

12996663
tunnel	vpn
this has its own problems proxy vpn tunnel being one of them

12996664

12996692
getter	setter
i m trying to understand the usage for getter setter methods in a class

12996692
getter	setter
however if we wanted to have those instance variables updated changed indirectly or under some specific condition or perhaps just letting the person have access to the instance variable we would create a getter setter pair for this purpose

12996718
width	height
alternatively you may want to resize using image#getscaledinstance int width int height int hints but this has its perils the main problem being

12996820
google-chrome	firefox
in the current versions of google-chrome and firefox these selectors appear to be ignored and simply don t work on img elements

12996823
ember.js	backbone.js
i already know that ember.js is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to backbone.js

12996840
getter	setter
for instance in python you don t need write everytime getter or setter because you can override behavior of member variables

12996842
awt	swing
i m using awt s filedialog instead of swing s jfilechooser because it simply looks better on mac as seen in apple s official recommendation .

12996865
ember.js	backbone.js
so i would start with backbone.js and then give a try to ember.js if you are not totally satisfied

12996865
ember.js	backbone.js
you can also listen to this podcast where jeremy ashkenas creator of backbone.js and yehuda katz member of ember.js have a nice discussion

12996870

width	height
cutelittlewindow window.open calendar view.html littlewindow location no width 320 height 200

12997028
subtract	add	min	max
my first guess would be to use the naive min max estimator but subtract and add the average distance between the observations in your dataset ie

12997037
expressionengine	joomla	wordpress	expressionengine	wordpress	joomla
some of the systems i ve tried wordpress joomla expressionengine drupal textpattern refinerycms radiantcms

a good rule of thumb is to have a free for every malloc

12997465
children	parent
at the left sidebar you can see the categories that are children of the parent category apparel

12997476
free	malloc
you should have a free per malloc

12997488
free	malloc
you have a memory leak you have lost the pointer to some memory previously allocated by malloc and no longer have that pointer to pass to free

12997501
apache	nginx
in production you should configure apache nginx whatever to serve files directly from the public -directory

12997501
apache	nginx
if you can t configure apache nginx in heroku you can write a custom config.ru like this

12997521
versioning	upgrade
firstly you should upgrade jquery and jqueryui versioning

12997530
fadein	fadeout
the problem is that i can t seem to find a way of doing this by using a class fadein - adds a css class fadeout - removes the class

i also want that please enter an int instead of double value.

12997618
multiplication	modulo
if you are interested in coefficients modulo a small n read word-size number and you don t mind external dependencies then go for numpy and use numpy.convolve or scipy.fftconvolve for the multiplication

12997621
typedef	typename
you can and you should use typename some_container size_type for this even most stl compilers typedef size_type as size_t but as you say using this technique you can support custom containers

12997688
put	get
either get a new version of the faces api implementation you re using one that supports generics or put suppresswarnings unchecked just before the start of the function right before where public or private would go

12997703

vbscript	jscript
it is very simple to write jscript or vbscript that performs wmi query and prints the output so you can run it from either java or scala process and parse the output

12997986
folder	directory
instead a windows program should use an appdata folder you get the path to the appdata directory with environment.getfolderpath

12997986
folder	directory
if these folder and files are truly temporary in nature in other words you only need them for the life of the process or can do without them when you startup again then you should use system.io.path.gettemppath to get the full path name of the user s temporary directory

12998030

post	get
my first thought was that i could get all the users favorites when he logs in and save them to the cache and use it when he browses post on the site

12998188
for-loop	arrays
because i have used passing arrays to function like that where i updated the arrays indexes inside a for-loop not manually

12998204
calloc	malloc
avoid using calloc and malloc better use standard c++ containers like std string etc.

12998214
int	chars
the main function by convention takes an int as first parameter this is ok in your code but the second parameter has to be a pointer on an array of chars

12998223

i think the architecture has been designed to work on a read-only based level without changing its underlying datasources as that is what grouping filtering and navigating a data collection s is mainly focused on

12998272
getter	setter
or from personal experience i created an api where the accessors followed the pattern of getter attributename and setter attributename newvalue which i implemented by creating a higher order function to create the getter and an internal data object

it positions images of various sizes in een fixed width and height div

12998362
width	height
it positions images of various sizes in een fixed width and height div

12998371
width	height
this will scale the image while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio if any to the smallest size such that both its width and its height can completely cover the background positioning area

12998383
for-loop	loops
your loops is formatted incorrectly a for-loop should be

12998392

width	height
1 width 81 2 height 40 3 align center y to superview and 4 trailing space to superview 20

12998723
queue	fifo
what that means is that there is a data area in ram called the stack which is a fifo queue that grows down

12998723
subtract	add
so to add something to the stack you put it where the stack pointer points and then subtract the size of that thing from the stack pointer

12998723
x86	64bit
i ve never heard of the architecture you re programing for but just know that any two registers will do but some architectures like x86 have specific stak registers ebp esp on 32 bit and reb and rsp on 64bit

wt is a very good one but its specialty is in qt like web applications but i personally prefer cppcms and you should now that both wt and cppcms have a built-in web server but it is not wise to use them in actual production and you should use them only for debugging or embedded frameworks instead use a powerful and free web server and try to introduce your app using fastcgi scgi or other techniques

13003047
pop-up	dialog
perhaps design it so a null argument to onpostexecute indicates that it failed so in that case pop-up the dialog

13003057
udp	tcp
reassembly of ip packets is done completely at the ip layer before udp or tcp ever sees the packet so you don t have to deal with defragmentation at the application layer

13003057

ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show and ng-hide simply toggle the display of elements that still exist in the dom

13003222
ng-show	ng-hide

13003441
getter	setter
latlonresult is just getter setter

13003453
mouseout	mouseenter
if so this is the normal behaviour when your mouseenter div 2 triggering the sliding effect it reveals div 1 but at the same time it makes div 2 slide down which brings it away from your pointer and triggers a mouseout event which in turn triggers the slideup again...

13003521
istream	getline

13003542
ddms	adb

int	chars
basically the solution is to convert the int to a chars before constructing a string and putting it into an array

13003570
short	base
and index this with a dense binary fibonacci base encoding with no pairs of zeros for example 11011 8+5+2+1 16 with numbers delimited by 00 then i think we can keep the gap representation short enough but it needs more analysis

13003596

memcached	apc
if you can guarantee that you will have memcached apc or even file write access then you can use any of these methods to cache your css and retrieve it using a key

13004060
int	double
you have to use the wrapper classes for such operations such as int rather than int or double rather than double

13004071
config	ini
so since i don t know beforehand what the ip address is where i m going to deploy the server i d like the endpoint be read from a config or ini file i would rather not have to compile for each endpoint

13004107
width	margin
so if you want a page similar to those twitter bootstrap s docs with a fixed width and equal margin on both sides then only a single .container is necessary to wrap all of the content on the page

13004110
hash	md5
you should note that when placing demo sales the md5 hash returned by 2checkout is intentionally broken by computing the hash with a 1 for the order number so if you are checking against the hash your return script needs to handle this change

13004147
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the numpy.ndenumerate is slow by using normal for-loop and get the value from arrays by item method you can speedup loops by 4x

13004195
int	chars
i m trying to make a chars with the chars representing an int

13004197
swt	swing
the other thought that i am thinking is to just create a desktop application in the server using client based technology such as swt swing that will do the polling and then code the logic there but this will mean that i need to manage two applications

13004511
hide	show
strangely as opposed to show method hide can revert hard-coded visible style with no problem

13004511
hide	show
so to hide show elements as intended you either have to use hide show method combo without no visibility style hard-coding or use css method of jquery and set the visibility style as desire

13004515
firefox	safari
it can be done using css pointer-events in firefox 3.6 and safari 4.0

maven fits itself into the eclipse world by providing two actions update project configuration and update project dependencies that take the information in the pom.xml file and update the contents of the .project and .classpath files

13004632
folder	directory
for the examples provided the directory make it clear why there are duplicates generally different architecture-specific files are separated by folder named for different architectures

13004636

int open const chars pathname int flags .

13004712
put	get
i just put it together very dirty but you will get the idea

13004732
mouseleave	mouseenter
but using the hover pseudo event as a substitute for passing mouseenter mouseleave is deprecated so you should really use mouseenter and mouseleave directly

13004753
outputstream	inputstream
inputstream is filled but outputstream isn t decompressed or gives me the error the magic number is not correct

13004759
min	max
rework the logic to operate line by line quite feasible and efficient though not as brief in code as loading it all into a two-dimensional structure and transposing it and using min and max may be

13004764
folder	directory
by default this image should be located in a directory named img that is at the same level as the folder containing the bootstrap.css file named css in the default download

13004770
google-chrome	firefox
however in the google-chrome and firefox works fine but not internet explorer

13004772
apache	nginx
not really sure what you meant by symlink between site-available and sites-enabled in etc nginx in your question since those are apache named folders but they accomplish similar task as the include directive

13004777
int	double

google-chrome	firefox
this code looks the same on both firefox and google-chrome here

13004871
mp3	ogg
tested by using both a mp3 and an ogg of the same file

originally i tried do this with the selection button but it didn t work so i added a checkbox into the gridview

13004927
invokelater	invokeandwait
interestingly just recently i encountered a similar issue so in order to get over this i used swingutilities.invokeandwait runnable runnable that s what made the sscce i was creating to work as expected though if i change all calls to invokeandwait with invokelater one can clearly see the difference between the two things

13004946
width	height
edit you can check the current device your running on before you look at height and width

13004973

13004973
gunicorn	uwsgi
take your pick between uwsgi and gunicorn - i use uwsgi

13004973
apache	nginx
however if for some reason you are on dhcp or you don t know what the ip address will be for example its a newly provisioned system you can tell nginx apache any other process to bind to 0.0.0.0

13004973
gunicorn	uwsgi
binding gunicorn uwsgi to this address is not recommended in production

13004973
apache	nginx	gunicorn	uwsgi
if you bind your backend process gunicorn uwsgi to 0.0.0.0 it may become accessible directly bypassing your front-end proxy nginx apache etc

13004973
apache	nginx
first thing you should know about nginx is that it is not a webserver like apache or iis

when you write off the end of a malloc d array like this it corrupts the information that malloc uses to keep track of what memory in the heap has been allocated and free with the result that a subsequent call to malloc crashes.

13007973

refer this url for html5 canvas hide and show a shape

13007979
int	chars
for what it is worth here is a snippet showing how you can convert a single chars to a hexadecimal int

13008031
folder	directory
this means that when building under global solution the output directory hierarchy should be the same as it would be in program files after installation so that if for example we have program files myapplication addins folder which contains all the addins developed by different teams we need the global solution to copy the binaries from addins projects and place them in the output directory accordingly

13008031
folder	directory
the thing is the team developing an addin doesn t necessary know that it is an addin and that it should be placed in that folder so they cannot change their relative output directory to be build bin debug addins

13008032
hide	show
i have a simple jquery accordion which toggles css class show hide with sliding effect

13008039
unsigned	short
i know the range of unsigned short int is 0 to 65535

13008039

i know u is used for printing unsigned decimal integer

13008058
cpu	processors
in addition 4 quad-core processors is equals to 16 cores or cpu s

13008093
implements	extends
in this case it might be preferable as guillaume polet already mentioned to implements your own kind of tablemodel no matter if it is extends a defaulttablemodel or abstracttablemodel and override the method in that class to control the behaviour there

13008113
collabnet	svn
i have checked it out from svn collabnet

13008131
min	max
in the windows form we have three buttons on the top right corner like min max close

13008135

i think you should get a warning for int conversion - or something similar - for this abs may return unpredictable values for float or double parameters

13008148
subtract	add
to add 2 no.s we write a web service to subtract we write a diffrent web service however calculator is an web application that uses add subtract and many other webservices in combine

13008152
affinity	processors
thus when you set affinity of some threads in your application for example you should clearly understand that you do not push this thread to the other processors as this pinning may actually degrade the performance of your process

13008247
min	max
more over - it is not guaranteed that next min max returns value in truly random maner meaning equal chances for number to hit each value

13008247
range	max
now one thing you must never do here is using modulo to get number in prefered range like rand 0 - 2 n - 1 max because by doing so you are actualy increasing chances of geting number in lower range

13008256
width	height
to get the current screen s width and height

13008256
width	height
do not hard code 320 width 480 height

13008258
button	checkbox
i add checkbox to a table whenever a button is clicked as follows

13008266
allocator	stl
yes as with every stl collection one of the templated parameters is an allocator

but i m creating a general javascript library for better looking standard controls like checkbox radio button or selectbox

13008294
fullcalendar	flot
i ve successfully integrated both a flot line graph and an instance of fullcalendar into my site

13008294
fullcalendar	flot
i have tried moving the link to the flot resize plugin into different places above below the fullcalendar js into the template which holds the graph but all to no avail

13008294
fullcalendar	flot
edit it seems that the error is also triggered when loading the line graph flot page after the fullcalendar page even without resizing the window..

13008303
g++	gcc
so most of the times i m testing if every include is correct on a given c c++ code i have a makefile with a gcc g++ call with proper -i option for searching headers on specific directories like every program when i m compiling sources to headers

13008303
g++	gcc
however if the included directory is not correct and an undefined header appears foo.h has #include and was not found the gcc g++ will just spit a bunch of errors for every include i have of that foo.h header for all other sources i m compiling afterwards and i m already using -werror -wfatal-errors to make gcc g++ to stop

13008308

13008318
getter	setter
i would like to use properties but it would be nice if i could decouple the data from the getter setter

13008318
getter	setter
in other words i like the getter setter interface of properties but i would like to define my own internal representation of data

13008318
getter	setter
for instance if i were to define myowntime class i want getter setter for properties like hour date and minute as a consumer i want to be able to set them and get them

13008346
superclass	subclassing
according to my present knowledge overriding a method of superclass means that the jvm will call the subclassing s over-ridden method though the superclass s method is available to the subclassing

13008346
inherited	subclassing
so in any case we are over-ridding the instance if we change the values of the inherited instance variable in the subclassing

13008346
superclass	subclassing
and i still have the superclass instance variables available to the subclassing with the use of the super keyword

13008355
google-chrome	safari
i suspect it s some kind of bug in google-chrome or webkit as safari also exhibits the problem

13008407
uiview	subviews
you could use an uiview with some uibuttons added as subviews

13008408
getter	setter
since the mapping to data is not direct you cannot synthesise the methods you have to write the getter and setter manually

13008411
width	height
adding content to the anchor such as will force the anchor to display but in many instances that would create a vertical space as big as the line-height of the so it is better to set the display to block and the width and height to 0

13008440
put	get
right now i am out of ideas how to put those pieces together to get to a proper matrix

13008447
integer	unsigned
unlike php an unsigned integer is not the same as a varchar

13008448
unsigned	short
when you assign to a short signed unsigned you assign the value to a 2 bytes memory

13008451
unsigned	short
first -1 is converted to unsigned short

13008451
integer	unsigned
but your implementation appears to have reinterpreted the unsigned value 4294967295 which has all bits set as as a signed integer with all-bits-set the two s-complement value -1

13008455
searchview	autocompletetextview
i believe this could be helpful turn autocompletetextview into a searchview in actionbar instead

13008465
button	checkbox
bootstrap has its own javascript version of checkbox radio button collapse etc

13008465
button	checkbox
only solution i have in mind is using standard radio button checkbox etc

tiff	png	tiff	bmp	bmp	png
i would like to show a content of that files pdf word excel txt jpeg bmp png tiff but i don t know how to do that

13008584
getter	setter
or you can also override the setter and getter default methods in my case in the .m file

13008602
superclass	subclassing
it means if you call a method in a superclass it will resolve to the overriden version in a subclassing if your instance is a subclassing

13008628
ami	rds
at the moment postgresql is not available as an amazon rds but you can configure your beanstalk ami to act as a local postgresql server or set up your own postgresql rds

13008680
dbcontext	objectcontext
another solution is to change the type of your context from dbcontext to objectcontext

13008704
qtablewidget	qslider	qitemdelegate	qtablewidget	qitemdelegate	qslider
you can use qitemdelegate then you ll could to rule your qslider into qtablewidget

13008704
qspinbox	qslider

13008756
client-side	server-side

13008880
google-chrome	safari
there is a startrendering function in google-chrome at least haven t checked safari

13008885
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the simulator is case-insensitive - the device is case-sensitive on file access remember that

13008887
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
it doesn t work in google-chrome safari and opera without throwing errors

13008891
getter	setter
a simple approach that i follow to pass custom objects between andriod activities is by defining a singleton class in my project that contains all the objects variables that i need to pass around between activities suppose you want to pass a custom object from activity a-- b you define a singleton class containing the object template you want to pass you simply call a setter method in activity a and a getter in activity b

13008932

getter	setter
this essentially makes get out to be a setter as well as a getter

13009173
try-catch	exception-handling
because of above exception-handling that may occur in calls triggered by setcurrent may and most likely will slip through your try-catch

13009173
try-catch	exception-handling
to be able to catch and report such exception-handling one should study what calls are triggered by setcurrent in your case these are explained in api javadocs for canvas event delivery section cover these by try-catch blocks where appropriate and design the appropriate way to report exception-handling if these occur

13009173
try-catch	exception-handling
in your case try-catch could likely surround code in mcanvas.paint this is where npe likely occurs and exception-handling could be reported for example by showing appropriate screen with error message eg alert by invoking setcurrent for that screen from catch block

13009237
charindex	substr
select startdate substr string charindex

13009238
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
requestfactory uses reflection a whole lot much more than gwt-rpc for instance so i m not really surprised that it causes some perf issues in some cases

13009238
serializable	deserialization
it would also be interesting to know the time spent on deserialization of the request applying changes and then serializable of the response

13009248
onresume	onpause
do not put this type of code or expect sleeps timeouts or lock acquisitions on the ui thread that s any lifecycle method oncreate onresume onpause ...

13009271
portrait	landscape
the navigation bar will automatically resize the default title label s font size to fit either in portrait or landscape orientation

13009302

13009459
postgresql	mysql
i m coming from an opensource background so i m fairly comfortable with discussing the plus points of mongodb mysql postgresql redis et all and where you would use them but i have a huge gap in my knowledge when it comes to comparing them to proprietary databases like oracle s offerings or microsoft s sql server

armadillo	lapack
armadillo will happily use multi-threaded lapack libraries

13033230
maven	pom.xml
if you want to stick with maven which i haven t used much you should probably look at the documentation for the clojure-maven-plugin which is already in your pom.xml but maybe not set up right

13033249
inherited	properties
first when using this scope properties it creates an isolated scope. all this means is that it won t inherited any properties from parent scopes and so you don t have to worry about any collisions within the scope

13033372
put	get
put in your viewdidload or somewhere where the object get s initialized

13033398
width	height
i find if you re using these measurements for layout they re not perfect if you re scaling a textfield to the textual content it s normally best to add 10-20 to each dimension or you get the odd character cut off - but these will return a realistic value width height won t reflect the dimensions

13033415
textview	imageview
by arranging the textview s to be relative to the imageview instead of the other way around the imageview takes priority for the space and the text works with the remainder

13033426

13034193
inherited	subclassing
it doesn t sound like are trying to subclassing anything which would be why people are mentioning inherited

13034235
put	get	getter	setter	post	get	post	put
instead of having randomly named setter and getter urls and using get for all the getter and post for all the setter we try to have the urls identify resources and then use the http actions get post put and delete to do stuff to them

13034235
post	put
and then post and put correspond to create and update operations but nobody agrees which way round

13034235
post	get
in that case get means something without side-effects and post means something that changes data on the server

13034235
post	put
i think this is perhaps a bit clearer and easier especially as you can avoid the whole put -vs- post thing

13034235
post	put
confusion as to which way round put and post are

13034235
post	put
in english they mean similar things i m going to put post a notice on the wall.

the css-rule here selects their parent as they can be alternating and sets the style for the children accordingly

13034398
google-chrome	safari
right now google-chrome shows footer social icons fine but in safari 5.1.7 there are no icons at all

13034420
hide	show
without being able to see your code i know i probably sound like a broken record at this point but you re still new to stack overflow so this is me teaching you the most compatible solution that i can think of would be to create the navigation bar and leave enough space on the left and right sides for the slider buttons we will manipulate the visibility property to show hide them not the display property - this will also keep the navigation bar from jumping on load in slower browsers

13034528
nexus	artifactory
you should install a maven repository manager mrm like sonatype nexus jfrog artifactory or apache archiva and the downloads will be local to your network and very fast

13034543
uilabel	uibutton
but i have a bunch of uilabel uibutton in there too and they aren t highlighted at all

13034750
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
you can test this with a simple single view project with a uibutton and a uisegmentedcontrol

13034784
children	parent
my preferred would be to just serialise child relationships and use an after-deserialization callback that then loops over the children and sets their parent property

13034792
children	parent
to position the child relative to its parent just add position relative to the parent s style - then all children with position absolute will be absolute relative to the parent

13034831
nsorderedset	nsset
once for the unordered relationship nsset and once each for the ordered relationships nsorderedset

13034847

13034978
strtol	atoi
note that it s impossible to detect errors with atoi since it returns 0 on error in some implementations and doesn t set errno afaik so it s probably better to use strtol

13034987
websphere	ibm
i have an application which is configured on ibm websphere 6.0 version

13034991
interpreted-language	compiled-language
i found that when i ask something more to python python doesn t use my machine resource at 100 and it s not really fast it s fast if compared to many other interpreted-language but when compared to compiled-language i think that the difference is really remarkable

rss	feed
now the problem is even when i make changes to the php script that outputs the rss feed it takes forever for those changes to propogate and be seen in the rss reader

13035075
stdout	fflush
now i found that i can use fflush stdout after the first printf but i don t think that this solution is elegant and even necessary

13035103
portrait	landscape	width	height
for example i know that the maximum width of the ipad in portrait is 768 pts and landscape is 1024 pts discoverable via the width and height of a view s window

13035115
width	height
both the new size width + height of the image and the x and y attributes are computed as seen bellow

13035115
width	height
the init javascript object contains the size width height of the wrapper and the size of the image after the image is rotated their dimensions will differ but also the values of the x and y attributes before the resize operation

13035152
spaces	delimiter
delimiter by spaces

13035163
cpython	pypy
you can try the pypy py3 branch which is more or less python compatible but the official cpython implementation has no jit

13035178

this code segment is to change the colour of the two buttons on click event works fine in google-chrome and firefox but the onclick functions does not work in ie9

13035238
jython	pypy
some other python implementations pypy natively jython and ironpython by re-using jit compilers for the virtual machines they build on do have a jit compiler

13035241
rss	feed
get the rss feed stick it into yql consol get the jsonp url then use jquery to parse it like so

13035305
put	get
you should consider expanding your custom-binding to account for all of this such as get the value from the when the popover closes and put it back in the observable

13035313
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
their api documentation says they support readdirectorychangesw which is what filesystemwatcher is using below the covers but i m concerned that it might not be a full implementation

13035320
mef	prism
i m using silverlight 5 prism and mef

13035330
post	get
for hosting in a windows service this old byte form post has enough to get you going

13035344
stdout	fflush
stdout is line-buffered by default which means that n is supposed to fflush the buffer

13035344
stdout	fflush
this will force stdout to be unbuffered so you won t need to use fflush

13035346
direct3d	gdi
some are layers built on top of others gdi+ on top of gdi and others are completely independent stacks like the direct3d family

13035412
post	get
my get works fine though the problem is only with the post

13035457
ssl	https
this caused us a problem with our rails 3.2.8 application forcing ssl - it redirects every decrypted request back to it s https equivalent which sends a decrypted request from the load balancer to the application server again causing an infinite loop condition

13035474
for-loop	loops
i prefer to do it like this see code below use two for loops and inside the second use conditional if to add the third for-loop to set to 0

13035504
do.call	rep
if n is not fixed then the fastest is do.call rbind rep list a n

13035504
do.call	rep
if you include the explicit rbind version it is slightly faster than the do.call rbind rep list a n version but not by much and slower than either the apply or matrix versions

13035531

for instance simics sunfire can run on a linux x86 system thus simulating a 64bit big-endian system on a 32-bit little endian host

13035666
draggable	droppable
i needed that because i couldn t change the options of my draggable so i had to work only with droppable i needed it inside the awesome fullcalendar plugin

13035666
draggable	droppable
actually it was more of an example to explain how to loop through all the draggable droppable but i actually forgot to remove the alert messages so it was pretty confusing

13035694
xna	spritebatch
i got all of that to work and i m starting the user interface and the moment i start using spritebatch to draw a cursor texture i have i discovered that xna doesn t layer all the models correctly some of the models that are further away will be drawn first instead of behind a model

13035695
unsigned	short
since you say check i assume you want to determine if a given value is the maximal value of a signed short or an unsigned short

13035700
width	height
then pass bmpdata.scan0 as a pointer to bitmap data and some other parameters like width height stride or whatever you want to figure out data format in the c function

13035821
google-chrome	firefox
right now it s logging the data to the console if you re using google-chrome or firefox you can use the developer tools to see the console log

13035965
margin	height
since your footer is a fixed height you can use a margin to get what you want

13036031
min	max
i m trying to find the right code that will sift through the years and give me the average max and min values for the value column c by decade

13036031
min	max
where for each decade it will give me the average max and min values

13036031
min	max
anyways i will be displaying the decade information that i sort out in a simple table in a new worksheet where average max min will be the three row titles and the decades will be the column titles for the table.

13036052
tunnel	vpn
first they launch the vpn tool which establishes the vpn tunnel to remotedomain this is all tested and works great

13036120
post	get
yes using get instead of post will work but the ultimate goal is to use this for updating a database so i would prefer to get post to work

13036148
versioning	upgrade
i did upgrade to 3.8 which i believe is the most recent versioning and still no joy

13036153
windows	wow64
basically the syswow64 folder is the 32 bit versions for use under wow64 which is windows 32-bit on windows 64-bit - basically you use the wow64 dlls when you run 32bit and the normal dlls when you run 64bit

13036167
flask	webapp2
used both webapp2 and flask in tests

most swing components including jtextfield are not heavyweight while awt controls are

13036343
jstl	taglib
you need to include the jstl functions taglib in your project and add this to the

13036359
datarow	dataview
i think assigning those after setting the datasource means that the combobox is trying to use the default iterator of a datatable which is a datarow or datarowview on a dataview in this case

13036363
int	chars
chars s are 16-bit unsigned int in java while int s are 32-bit signed 2-s complement

13036363
int	chars
you can t fit all 32-bit values into 16-bits so the compiler warns about loss of precision due to the 16 bits that would be lost by an implicit cast that just shoehorns the 16 least-significant bits from the int into the chars losing the 16 most-significant bits

13036363
int	chars
you have an int that can only fit in 17-bits and so c is chars 0

13036367
range	max	range	min	min	max
change the data range accordingly and the max min formulas as well

13036402

tcplistener	tcpclient
i have tcplistener on port 21 waiting for incoming connections.when tcplistener receives an incoming request i establish a control connection through instantiating a new tcpclient the ftp command and response are done on control channel

13036590
tcplistener	tcpclient
if there is any request for data transfer like list retr stor commands on tcplistener i will establish a new tcpclient on output ipaddress and port provide by port command.the second tcpclient will handle the requested data transfer

13036590
tcplistener	tcpclient
workaround to attach a thread to tcpclient while will keep on sending the keep alive command noop to tcplistener with thread.sleep for few seconds untill data transfer is complete

actions are simple pojos they don t need to extends or implements something

13037087
entities	entitymanager
i know the entitymanager has a mechanism to track state change for the entities it is managing

13037094
width	height
it s sufficient to calculate the overlapping width in dimension x and the overlapping height in dimension y and multiply those

13037104
int	chars
the 2d arrays to be passed could be as big as 5000x4 int or 5000x15 chars

two other terms are superclass and subclassing

13037176
hide	show
what i m trying to do is to create a navigation bar all the elements have to be animated the porblem is with the background slidedivb is behind show_hideb the animation works but the problems is that when i m trying to move around the bar and over the elements slidingdivb starts to show and hide like crazy i need for it to stay still and showing while i navigate trough the elements..

13037186
public	protected
an instance of derived has access to all of the public and protected non-static members

13037236
post	get
once you have that you can pass that to your thread and then when you need access to anything on the httpcontextbase associated with the request and this includes the session you can call the post method on the synchronizationcontext that you passed to your thread to get values or set them

13037266
ssl	https
i have ssl installed over my domain but still all of the url s are http and not https

13037271
hash	salt
so you can clearly see where the salt ends and if someone gets the database there s not point with the salt since they just can remove the salt-part and search for just the hash password

13037271
hash	salt
the static salt was just to show where it appears in my hash or is there a reason with this

13037320
hash	md5
second is there a better hash algorithm than md5 for this purpose

13037320
hash	md5
my concern is that i may wind up with 2 files creating the same md5 hash

13037375
hash	salt
in that scenario an eavesdropper could capture the hash but without a knowledge of the salt value would never be able to reverse the hash regardless of technique

13037422
udp	tcp
protocol support tcp ip udp smtp ntp dhcp ddns

13037464
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
add a uiview to the uiviewcontroller now you will have a uinavigationcontroller uiview uiview

13037484
mouseleave	mouseenter
in my opinion it gives a nicer solution than the mouseenter and mouseleave event

13037491
qspinbox	qslider
there s a reason qlabel qslider qspinbox and qhboxlayout don t have copy constructors themselves

13037502
hash	salt
the idea behind a salt is that even if two inputs are the same the hash will not be identical as long as a different salt is used every time

13037502
hash	salt
however if the password is hash with a different salt value for each user the attacker will have to crack each and every hash stored in the store

13037502
hash	salt
but it s ok if it prepends the salt value to the actual hash as long as the hash itself is also calculated using the salt

13037502
hash	salt
you re going to need to store the original salt anyway to verify that a new input password matches the stored hash

13037502
hash	salt
however as long as you change the salt values between every hash usage there s no easy way to glean information about the original input

13037533
hide	show
have that tab hide show the div you want hidden

13037547
oncreate	setcontentview
since you can call setcontentview method at any time not only in oncreate method just define all the views you want in separate xml files and pass the relevant id to setcontentview when it s time to switch

13037595
put	get
when you try to do put on null reference you will get nullpointerexception

13037615

13037765
integer	fractions
i want the cell to be formatted as number if the variable is an integer and formatted as a fractions if not

13037773
rss	feed
you shouldn t rely on the rss feed feature

13037808
slideup	slidedown
because the slideup and slidedown methods are asynchronous as soon as you call one the next line of code is executed...aka once you slide up you re now sliding down before the animation even finishes

13037855
width	height
instead it has a width attribute and a height attribute and they don t work the same way the css parameters would work

13037875
integer	fractions
however if you format an integer as a fractions it ll still show as an integer 1 as a fractions is still 1

13038245
serializable	deserialization
you might need a different view on deserialization and not just on serializable and that would be a jackson 2.0 feature - supported by spring 3.2 and backported into spring 3.1

13038286
comparator	comparable
seems to be ide is forcing you make you class abstract or define comparator method as you implement comparable interface

13038295
oncreate	setcontentview
however you do not set the content view setcontentview r.layout.rutas until the oncreate lifecycle event

13038295

13038470
puma	unicorn
it s like a merge between unicorn rainbows and puma but it offers easy configuration options to seamlessly switch mode

13038474
implements	extends
this could possibly mean that c really shouldn t extends a it might make sense for both a and c to implements a common interface. or just that configure really shouldn t be a public method of that type

13038476
portrait	landscape
this is a reduplication of work normally done to get a so-called booklet an a5 portrait book printed 2 pages for sheet on an a4 landscape paper obviously as in our case the same can be done for an a6 book intended to be printed on a4 to get 2 copies of whole same book modifying some thing but with the same logic

13038553
listview	gridview
the zoomed in and zoomed out views only support a gridview or listview as their child element so if you have 6 groups you can achieve that with a single grid view

13038565
udp	tcp
i met some problems when i did some research in improving the tcp udp performance of virtual machine vm if anybody can offer me some help or suggestion to handle my problem i will be very appreciated

13038565
cpu	irq
for example rfs aims to send irq to the cpu running the corresponding receiving process

13038565
udp	tcp
theoretically sending nic irq to the running vcpu of vm will shrink the nic irq handling latency and improve the tcp udp performance

13038565
udp	tcp
in my experiment it works well for udp but does not work for tcp

see canvas width and height in html5

13039194
stdout	stderr
here is the output of interpreterinfo.py stdout and stderr

13039213
dbcontext	objectcontext
the only nuance is that for codefirst applications or in general applications using dbcontext this file is generated on the fly from your classes and you don t deal with it directly while in case of model first database first where you use the objectcontext the file is on your disk and usually is split and embedded in your assembly

13039215
maven	m2e
anyway if you want to build the project with the dependencies not only your other project but also the spring dependencies you really want to take a look into maven and the m2e plugin

13039273
equals	gethashcode
then you can just iterate over each group which will contain equals values according to equals and gethashcode but which can still be distinct

13039283
typedef	struct
here i have defined a typedef struct and then create an mpi_datatype from it

13039305
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome ie opera it returns the current offset minus the px part so in this case 20

13039317

it appears that wc has some logic with respect to punctuation characters not being words that this code does not handle

13039324
rvm	bundler
it also appears you aren t using bundler so make sure to switch to the gemset you are currently using for your project looks like it s dmstaffing with the command rvm 1.9.3-p194 dmstaffing then run gem install jasmine -v 1.2.1

13039348
width	height
they can be scaled to match text size if desired by setting the height of img elements in em units and not setting width so that they get scaled so that width height ratio is preserved

13039382
width	height
in theory i should now have a display with a width of 320 and a height of 480

13039434
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
i am going by this example and trying to have it use a sqldatasource instead of linqdatasource

13039489
filtering	grouping
just add yourself to the access_bpf grouping so your user account can access the packet filtering devices

13039518

when the browser window is smaller than the min-width the child elements are the correct width but the parent keeps getting smaller causing the children to overflow

13039575
filtering	grouping
i would like to apply a filtering to a grouping of controllers actions based off of some arbitrary criteria

other machines probably send icmp port unreachable messages but since you can t really connect to broadcast address you get nothing at the udp level

13039614
qiodevice	qfile	qiodevice	qdatastream	qfile	qdatastream
say i have a function that creates a qiodevice a qfile then returns a pointer to a qdatastream constructed from the qiodevice

13039614
qiodevice	qdatastream
clearly the qiodevice must be heap allocated to stay available to the qdatastream upon function termination however the destruction of a qdatastream does not destroy or close the device

13039629
postgresql	mysql
its not mysql i so i think thats my first issue as postgresql doesn t appear to have an autoincriment in the way i am used to working with it atleast

getter	setter
this means technically you are declaring two variables named locally as _st and st _st is managed by the generated getter setter for the property

13039676
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns a number that you can use with clearinterval

13039677
children	parent
your issue in this situation is that you re using a relative width for the parent and a fixed min width for the children

13039692
google-chrome	firefox
this method works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome

13039824
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome use different conversions from em s to pixels and vice versa

13039829
inherited	properties
you can either set a definite height properties for both elements or you can simply tell sbutton to inherited the styles from sfield

13039839
kerberos	ldap

building on c69 s answer if there is a range for each set of numbers then add min max values to the three numbers loop through array do an inclusion check stop on row where number is in range

13040027
floating-point	fractions
actually you have to get used to the fact that most fractions decimal numbers you will encounter in everyday life will not be representable precisely in binary floating-point types regardless of how large these floating-point types are

13040038
superclass	subclassing
if the icminorworkspart1 class s superclass iccertificatecomponent is not a subclassing of uiviewcontroller then the error is true as dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated is a method of the uiviewcontroller class

13040060
put	get
whenever i put single quotes in a textarea i always get the error

13040128
concave	convex
you might have an easier time constructing your floor out of several convex shapes instead of a single concave shape and using hittestobject on each of them

13040163
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you need to wrap the uiviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller and then present the navigation controller

13040172
prepare	execute
htmlentities will convert the and to and and the execute prepare statement will escape the and characters with a

13040204

i am interested in opening either google-chrome or firefox via a separate android application and also having that application initiate a tab sync assume the user has already set up tag syncing in their browser

13040567
width	height
fills the whole window but it width height is unaffected by padding so it overflows the containing

13040680
width	height
the main problem is identifying what to change when resizing you have two options 1 to change location and size properties or to change x y width and 2 height properties of the rectangle

13040697
put	get
my other idea was to try and get all of the data from the div put it all into a string and try to parse this and then replace all the data back into the dropzone

13040697
firefox	safari
also as you will notice sorting works but only seems to in firefox not safari

13040708
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and ie 9 when called as

udp	tcp
i m new to heroku and i was thinking about building a java restful web service that spins up tcp udp servers clients to handle streams of data based on the restful calls

13040742
udp	tcp
aka the restful calls are the triggers of tcp udp server creation for streaming data

13040779
implements	modifiers
with that in mind we re not trying to imitate private modifiers in javascript we re just implements a concept how we implements it is not that relevant and is dependant on the tool language

13040788

13040991
put	get
then put k back into the equation to get my ultimate answer

13041035
width	height
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used

13041036
loops	while-loop
after all the whole point is that it works like a while-loop and thus can be transformed into a loops

13041044
portrait	landscape	onresume	onpause
notice that after onpause my surface view is redone as portrait and after onresume it is changed back to landscape

13041044
onresume	onpause
now notice that after onpause surfacechanged reflects the fixed size that i had specified however upon onresume the surface view is in portrait orientation somewhat unexpected

13041053
onresume	onpause
for my implementation remove the code in onresume and onpause except for the super calls

13041057
slideup	slidedown
generally you should wait the shown page to slidedown and after that to slideup the new page

13041103

13041214
hex	binary
but what i receive in the file is different when looking at the binary file with a hex editor

13041242
inherited	properties
all its properties are inherited from its associated seccertificateref the certificate and seckeyref the private key

13041247
width	margin
if you remove the padding value the width is properly applied but when you add in the padding it causes the entire page to grow and it treats the padding almost as margin

13041309
rss	feed
now if you are having issues with rss feed in google chrome that s probably due to the unfortunate fact that chrome can t display xml or rss atom feed without add-ons

13041309
rss	feed
sometimes chrome will try to hijack and open the feed the google rss reader

13041356
accessor	properties

at the public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event method there is

13041384
min	max
the macro would use a vlookup min array to find the start and a vlookup max array to find the finish

13041418
min	max
you could loop through all values in a line and store the smallest and largest values you can keep max and min so you only need one loop

13041418
min	max
you will want to set max jan 1 and min dec 31 and then if the value you are currently inspecting is greater than max you set max equal to the value and likewise for min

13041418
min	max
after looping through that row you will have the max and min values in that row

13041418
min	max
you can then write these values into some other column reset max and min and move to the next row

13041421
min	max
you re using php s rand which is inclusive if you specify a min and max so you need to use as the max

13041424

union	distinct
in the case that table2 may have an id not held in table1 or table3 for example where table1.id can t be considered authoritative you can get the total set of distinct id from all 3 tables via a union and use that to join against

13041528
union	distinct
if you need to limit them individually you must do so in subqueries which are then joined together using the same union subquery to get the distinct set of id

13041575

it seems that org.eclipse.m2e lifecycle-mapping is a maven plugin designed to hold meta data to communicate with eclipse m2e plugin when it processes a maven pom.xml and this information is used to tell eclipse what do with maven plugins that are defined in pom.xml when eclipse runs the pom.xml as part of the eclipse ui

min	max
you have to use group by clause and aggregate functions min max as below

13045959
int	boolean
number is most generic number type and can fit boolean values int with and without sign and numbers that should be floating point

13045977
puts	gets	int	chars
so what this does is puts this int into a string splits it apart then iterates through each chars and gets a string out of that chars

13045999
int	double
columns 1 and 2 are int and column 3 is a double

13046008

integer	unsigned
the arithmetic extractors for unsigned integer types are defined in 27.7.2.2.2p1 as depending on

13046160
int	chars
stage 3 the sequence of chars s accumulated in stage 2 the field is converted to a numeric value by the rules of ... â for an unsigned int value the function strtoull

13046160
unsigned	short
so strtoull returns a value too large to be representable in unsigned short and num_get is required to store ushort_max and set the fail bit

13046160
integer	unsigned
â the most negative representable value or zero for an unsigned integer type if the field represents a value too large negative to be represented in val

13046170
unsigned	short
assigned with implicit conversion to your unsigned short

13046170
unsigned	short
as ectamur points out this should be an error in c++11 because unsigned long long -10 will be too large to be represented in an unsigned short

13046201

13046508
width	height
the answer would be width 784 height 562

13046516
ceil	floor
an improvement on this strategy is that we don t explore from the startcell outwards to the endcell but that we explore from both the startcell and endcell outwards in parallel using floor maxdistance 2 and ceil maxdistance 2 as the respective maximum distances

13046520
super	extends
if mycomponent would extends a component the super scope would no longer refer to the extended component

it does that only with the tiff image if i take png it works fine

13046806
put	get
now i thought no problem i just put an thread.sleep x at point 1 respectively at point 2 to get that effect but in both cases the start of the activity itself is delayed it seems for x fetchedentries.size millis and the buttons still are pushed together

13046810
children	parent
i have a self-referencing one-to-many association on an entity user mapped by parent and inversed by children

13046882
width	height
i have a div and its width and height depend of browser window size

13046900
inherited	subclassing
i tend to lean towards interfaces if i want inherited behaviour and subclassing if i want inherited structure

13046909
public	protected
the main disadvantage of providing only static factory methods is that classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed

13046932

13047138
width	height
you can extend raphael.el with helper methods if you are careful that provide the width and height directly if this helps you

13047138
width	height
you could just use the bounding box method and return the portion that you re interested in but to be a bit more efficient i have calculated only the requested property using the matrix property on the elements and the position width height from attributes

13047138
width	height
note that it only works for elements with a width height x and y attributes which is suitable for images

13047138
min	max
raphael actually computes the bounding box from the path data which transforms all of the points in the path and gets the min max x y values after transforming them

13047150

so yes https does use ssl tls

13047536

13047549
superclass	subclassing
coordinate float is neither a subclassing nor a superclass of coordinate double

13047576

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have tried changing my source uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller but the view then just displays as a black screen

13049703
ivar	subclassing
add a new uiimageview ivar to your view controller subclassing and use that

13049715
asterisk	ivr
people have turned asterisk into ivr s but there is a huge learning curve there it is somewhat limited in ivr capabilities hard to maintain your voice application and it does not support open standards for ivr s like voicexml

13049740
ng-init	ngmodel
you can do this by adding a simple ng-init that sets the model from ngmodel to the first element in the items your repeating in ng-options

13049753
portrait	landscape
also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape

13049794
width	height
setting the width and height to 1in is your best shot but itâ s not a particularly good shot as you can see if you measure the dimensions on different devices

13049822
getter	setter
then you can do whatever you think will work in the getter and setter before mapping back to the domain model for persisting

13049822
getter	setter
for readability and easier debugging you could do your cleaning in the controller instead of in the getter and setter but that s up to you

13049834
width	margin
what i m trying to accomplish is to have a header that continues on both left and right both headers use different backgrounds in this case it does work on the left because im using a negative margin since i use 50 width and exactly the half of the wrapper -512px this works but if i would try to use a negative margin on the right margin-right -512px this will extend the page on the right with an extra 512px which is not my intention

13049835
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you actually have to set your uiviewcontroller as the root controller of a uinavigationcontroller or pushed through from a view controller w a navcontroller

13049839
google-chrome	firefox
which worked for me in both google-chrome 22 and firefox 16.0.1

13049861
libxml2	libxslt
i don t have the same problems with openssl or libxslt where i can either tell configure about the compiled version using --with-xxx path-to-dir or just omit path bit in which case it seems to find mingw s own versions but that doesn t work with libxml2

13049916
width	height
for what it s worth you can do rotation with css and you can resize images just with an the height and width attributes or with css s height and width properties

13049938
profiling	debugging
it might be possible to identify these addresses using a suitable tool otool or similar but a better strategy in the long run would be to implement a test harness which calls your callback code in a loop with dummy data - this will most likely repay itself when you use it for future debugging and profiling activities

13049938
profiling	debugging
note that for convenience you could just build the test harness as a mac os x executable for profiling debugging as bugs and performance bottlenecks will most likely be similar on both platforms at least to a first approximation

13049952
postgresql	mysql
migrations are currently supported in mysql postgresql sqlite sql server sybase and oracle all supported databases except db2

end-to-end testing with rspec integration tests and capybara

13050175
put	get
you can get of course as specific as you want with this conversation but you would sooner or later come to a point where you would need to put information on the structure of your currently parsed message into the converter since it is not trivial to know which segments are nested into other segments grouping them

13050191
google-chrome	firefox
css not working in google-chrome and not in firefox

13050238

13050671
scalamock	scalatest
you re importing the scalamock support classes for scalatest and junit but you re not using scalatest at all you re using junit with a custom runner with which i m not familiar and seem to be using the wrong set of traits as per stefan s comment on yoru question

13050893
post	get
also to simplify your code you may want to use url.openstream instead of a full featured httpclient and switch to a simple get since you don t send any parameter i wonder why your server requires a post

13050910
int	chars
i want to parse each chars of a string to an int array

google-chrome	firefox
this happens on firefox ie and google-chrome

13051278
width	height
if you set both width and height it will stretch the image to fit those bounds and thus maybe screw up the aspect ratio

13051282
boost	allocator
i want to use my custom classes that inherits by std allocator and boost interprocess allocator respectively and i want to use them instead of the base allocator

13051282
boost	allocator
when i create a class myboostallocator which inherits by boost interprocess allocator and use it instead of boost interprocess allocator see variables y1 and y2 it does not work and gives me compilation errors listed on the bottom of this question

13051306
background-position	background-size
i think you re better to put this image as a background image of the div and then using css to change background-size to cover and then background-position to center.

13051354
width	height
you could use css to define a height width for the div and set the image as a background image with a background size of cover.

13051372
folder	directory
specifically there should be a jquery.ui.dialog.css file under the base folder in the themes directory

13051404
voip	sip
many ivr systems accept voip input using standards like sip

13051404
voip	sip
however i believe skype does not use voip standards like sip without extra costs -

13051410
google-chrome	firefox
my test project is a simple maven project where i try to launch a new ie v8 - 64bit firefox and google-chrome browser and see if it will successfully navigate to some arbitrary url

13051437
fuzzy	stemming
the other direction is to not stemming but use a fuzzy match like a levenstein distance

13051440
portrait	landscape
the app always runs in portrait i decided to show the augmented reality when rotating the iphone in landscape right or left and of course if i go back in portrait the original view controller is shown

google-chrome	firefox
i have a google-chrome extension that i want to port to firefox

13051578
google-chrome	firefox
firefox development seems to be a bit complicated coming from google-chrome so ich picked the jetpack sdk or addon-sdk to take a first look

13051616
children	parent
so this parent procedure with calls these children procedures uses a cursor

13051618
google-chrome	firefox
this worked in ie 9 mozilla firefox but not in google-chrome 21

13051668
put	get
but why not using a single handler with get and put and a method _create which can be called self._create instead of a redirect by get and put to render the template with the form

13051699
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
if you have some complex tables in the widget you should use qt mvc system qtableview and model based on qabstracttablemodel

13051767
namedtuple	dictionary
as an example ordered dictionary counters and namedtuple were all added to the collections package since 2.5

13051771
udp	tcp
as oberstet correctly notes websocket average latencies are basically equivalent to raw tcp or udp especially on a local network so it should be fine for you development phase

13051771
udp	tcp
you may be aware of this already since you are writing a game but for those that aren t here is a quick primer on tcp vs udp for real-time games

13051771
udp	tcp
tcp is an in-order reliable transport mechanism and udp is best-effort

13051771
udp	tcp
udp packets are sent as they arrive may be out of order and may have gaps on a congested network udp packets are dropped before tcp packets

13051771
udp	tcp
real-time games generally can t tolerate the type of delays that can result from tcp sockets so they use udp for most of the game traffic and have mechanisms to deal with dropped and out-of-order data adding sequence numbers to the payload data

13051784
post	get
if i manage to get it done i ll post again

13051797
profiling	instrumentation
so after spending a great deal of time researching this issue and trying out different approaches and spending a good while with the time profiling in instrumentation i found that the lag was from the image decoding on the main thread when the image was displayed

13051802
portrait	landscape
one thing i can t test however is an orientation change from portrait to landscape and vice versa

13051827
client-side	server-side
the first is used to define a javascript string to be executed client-side the second is used to define an event handler method an asp function to be executed server-side after a postback

13051833
folder	directory
to change that i want to create an exe that will recursively go through all of the files on the drive that are not in system folder move them to a temp directory and move them back in order to force the 8.3 file name removal on them

13051852
post	get
obviously this will not get the post i m looking for

13051860
put	get
i know i can get this to work if i just put the whole between condition as a string

13051898
box-sizing	border-box
add box-sizing border-box to buttons

13051945
put	get	post	get	post	put
all the get requests are working fine but when we try to use put delete post etc client is thrown out with 403 forbidden error and apache error.log shows client denied by server configuration

13051950
width	height
that image needs to be scaled down so that the user chosen center point indicated by the red dot visually and data-center- attributes these are percentages based on the image width height is in the middle of the containing div x y of 50 50 in the example

13051950
margin	height
the ideal positioning within a 100 x 100 div would have a height of 138px with a left margin of -72px

13051971
richfaces	tomahawk
first of all i m under jsf 1.2 richfaces 3.3.0 and tomahawk 1.1.9

i ve tried it in firefox and google-chrome and the debugger outputs this

13052053
uicollectionview	uitableview
i have a problem in populating a uitableview created programmatically as a subview of uicollectionview

13052055
for-loop	arrays
you should not have an arrays surrounding a for-loop

13052058
min	max
for example besides showing the min max and mean values would you look at quantiles

13052103
int	chars
all of the chars in the string are int but trying to convert them to an int would cause overflow

13052106
post	get
second thing i observed is it makes 2 calls to flow one is post which gets failed and the other one is get which returns me the response

13052167
bayesian	naivebayes
i am trying to figure out how to use the accord.net framework to make a bayesian prediction using the machine learning naivebayes class

13052211
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have tested this on ubuntu linux mint and windows 7

13052258
folder	directory
when adding a font wix picks up on the .ttf extension and requires you to install it to the local font folder when using a directory id fontsfolder and truetype yes

13052259
width	height
an nsrect is just a c struct describe size width and height and origin x and y

13052325
int	chars
you make at least some progress as long as there is input to be read from the stream since whatever a contains you read at least one chars from the input stream before attempting the next parsing of an int

13052346
rss	feed
i want to know whether it is possible to export my ga data automatically to a public url like a rss feed

13052350
slideup	slidedown
what i am trying to achieve is to get the corresponding to slidedown once the input checkbox is checked label is clicked and then slideup when the input is unchecked label is clicked again

13052360
hide	show
setting a limit using works great but i can t seem to show hide pagination using

13052369
post	get
similar to this post - jquery datetimepicker not displaying with css but i don t even get the blue background

13052416
next	except
my activities code they are the same except obviously for the intent to start the next activity

13052416
oncreate	setcontentview
on your oncreate method and before setcontentview use the following

13052424
hash	salt
to bypass this problem i could send a sha-256 hash of the password with the username as salt so the password is never sent in plain text

13052424
hash	salt
in my database i will be storing the following hash sha256 password + salt and i ll compare if both of the hash match

13052424
hash	salt
the problem with this option is that i ll have a hash computed with a fast hash algorithm and the salt is not random

13052424
hash	salt
i use sha256 and send the hash where the salt is the username still using ssl the hash in the db are less secure

13052424
hash	salt
i use bcrypt and i have a two step process i ask for the saltfor a given user and then send the hash of this user still using ssl by trying to log in with an other username i can obtain his salt not awesome

13052450
crypt	hash
if python used it s own crypt then the hash would be the same -- but it would work on osx and not ubuntu or vice versa

13052450
ubuntu	freebsd	unix	bsd
you would be hardcoding your app to work on ubuntu which might use different crypts not just from osx but from other unix and bsd flavors like redhat freebsd etc

13052528
put	get
i ve put the driver jar and all of the jars that it depends on in the glassfish-domain lib ext folder but i get the following error when i try to ping

13052559
google-chrome	firefox
i ve run into an issue though since links to clickonce installation files can only be run from internet explorer though firefox and google-chrome can do it but only with plug-ins pre-installed

13052571
put	get
my question is why am i getting this compile time error when i put both the constructor in code and why i dont get any error when i remove parameterized constructor

13052584
nexus	artifactory	ant	maven
build ci in java is pretty straightforward with a variety of tools available - build scripting ant maven gradle etc continuous builds jenkins go anthill etc and repositories nexus artifactory etc

13052630

width	height
scrollview.contentsize cgsizemake width height

13052683
soundpool	audiotrack
the soundpool will try to create an audiotrack whenever it starts playback of one of the channels i guess this corresponds to a sample belonging to the pool

13052692
folder	directory
3. check your system logs they should be in a folder in your root directory

13052696
persistent	transient
this can be avoided - you can have a separate transient list to hold the filtered pubs in addition to the original persistent one

13052716
hash	salt
the correct use of hashing+salting is 1 server stores tuples of salt hash password + salt

13052716
hash	salt
3 server computes hash claimed password + salt

13052716
hash	salt
4 if hash claimed password + salt hash password + salt then they re authentic

13052716
hash	salt
in this way even if an attacker gets access to the database they can t produce a claimed password that such that hash claimed password + salt is valid

13052728
put	get
update also i just tried adding a new phone number while my phone was in airplane mode while my region settings were set to italian while my timezone was set to rome italy and it still knew i put a us number so it can t possibly be connecting to a server to get this info

13052735
int	boolean
type set int boolean

13052753
post	get
im just wondering how i could get the post id of the blog post i am currently reading while in another loop the recent post loop in the sidebar

13052753
post	get
regarding highlighting the current post that ll be easy once i get this working

13052783
getter	setter
obj-c has built in functionality for generating getter and setter with the property keyword

13052795
hash	salt
make the salt constant let s say make it a hash of the username

13052796
portrait	landscape
the problem i m having is that it loads fine or i can load the page with a smaller width but in a scenario where i m using a tablet and i change orientation between portrait and landscape it might work once but eventually the sidebar won t follow the scroll

13052810
rss	feed
i have a system where various rss feed are added

13052833
listview	gridview
i assume that i would be able to find it as we do in gridview or listview templated controls

13052837
onclick	preventdefault
i resolved it by adding preventdefault to the onclick event handler in addition to the existing return false like so

13052860
box-sizing	border-box
i m using box-sizing border-box to everything on my page

13052874
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you should be using either uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller to move back and forth and never create loops

13052885
ppm	pgm
if you just need an image format then the easiest is probably ppm or pgm for greyscale

13052950
versioning	upgrade
i created a new versioning of the wix_bundle with v2.0.0.0 and both the wix bundles have the same upgrade code

13052950
versioning	upgrade
i want the uninstallation of the 4 previous msi s to happen regardless if they have an upgrade or not and then install the new versioning in the new wix_bundle v2.0.0.0

13052960
jobs	cron
cron jobs are unix stuff

13052985
google-chrome	safari
i wanted to see if anyone else had ever had an issue with mobile safari or google-chrome causing web pages to suddenly spit out a ton of garbage

13052999
hash	salt
this is because linux s glibc handles passwords differently - the salt of the password on linux corresponds to the type of hash that it generates

13052999
hash	md5
glibc supports a variety of hash algorithms md5 blowfish sha-256 etc

13053003
post	get
i read this post in dynamic generic types but can t get it to work

13053017
setinterval	clearinterval
you are using setinterval so to cancel you need clearinterval not cleartimeout

13053068
crypt	salt
you re passing specialized salt strings to the function which invoke glibc-specific crypt behaviors that aren t available on mac os x

13053068
crypt	md5
in your python examples you re telling crypt to use an id of 1 which causes md5 to be used instead of des-based hashing

13053068
crypt	salt
mac os x s crypt has its own extension--the salt can be a 9-character array beginning with an underscore followed by 4 bytes of iteration count and 4 bytes of salt--that has no analog in glibc s implementation.

13053068
crypt	salt
if you avoid the crypt extensions on both platforms and use traditional crypt in which salt can only be two bytes you ll get the same results from the function on both platforms

width	height
for example placing a textview where the coordination are right left up bottom as 0.8 width 0.2 width 0.1 height 0.3 height

13057402
hash	salt
when the user logs in fetch the salt and hash from the database compute the hash of the password they typed using the original salt and make sure the hash matches

hash	salt
so what you do is pick a predefined salt take the user s desired password and encrypt it using the salt and a hash

13057467
hash	salt
the salt is some extra random characters you add on to make the hash password even more secure. you should keep track of this

13057467
hash	salt
the hash then takes the salt + password and generates a random string based on it such that you will always get that unique hash if you give it the same salt+password

basically you put a 2d geo index on a field containing the two points in an array like start_ip end_ip and give it a high enough min max value so that it won t hit the limits which are by default just -180 180

13057610

upgrade the geb and selenium versioning in the test app to latest and greatest

13057862
children	parent
so my theory would be that jquery first does the id request using document.getelementbyid and then if there is a context set - scans through the parent of each element to tell if any of them exist as children of the context - thereby slowing the process down

13057863
hash	salt
the client hash their password with the salt first then hash the result with the key and sends it

now if you click on the span it ll make the checkbox check itself properly but then if you click on the span again it will not set the radio button as unchecked even though evidently it performs a click event and theoretically it should uncheck the radio button accordingly due to the click event this event works if you actually click on the radio button

13058050
superclass	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass

13058841
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox you don t need to install a driver but for google-chrome and ie you do

m2e	pom.xml
by either configure the lifecycle mapping in your project s pom.xml or use specific m2e configurator eclipse plugin if somebody has kindly created it for the community

13059289

what this script does is- it gzip the data from a particular folder data ds real export_v1x0 for a particular date 20121017 and move it back to hdfs hdfs ares-nn apps tech ds new directory

13060270
getter	setter
i have the payment class with only one local private variable - totalcost as such totalcost also has a getter and setter methods

13060282
getter	setter
so before writing a getter setter think of your requirements

13060283
getter	setter
since you only have one field which you already have getter and setter for

13060292
django-haystack	sphinx
you could try django-haystack or sphinx for that

13060298
getter	setter
first not necessarily all private data should be exposed via getter and setter since some of them may be for internal use only

13060298
getter	setter
second the getter and setter should provide an object view not an implementation view

13060315
hash	md5
first one must use crypto.createdecipheriv otherwise the key is - i believe - md5 hash instead of used raw

13060320
put	get
i know the call is correct because i can put it in a browser and get the required output in json format

13060336
getter	setter
hibernate requires the getter and setter of the models that reflect the tables to be of a specific format

13060351
getter	setter
getter and setter are the elements leading to thight coupling between classes

13060351
getter	setter
because getter and setter informs you about the implementation of a class its field especially and its design

13060351
getter	setter
developer who always code with creation of getter setter systematically have misunderstood totally the notion of object-oriented programming

13060351
getter	setter
to put in a nutshell in an application 80 of getter and setter are unnecessary

13060354
apache	nginx
apache thread vs nginx non-blocking

13060458
min	max
i have tried using a loop and i know i can use the min and max functions with subtraction

13060466
int	chars
your next int only returns the int until it gets to the n chars

13060483
min	max
you re unlikely to find anything faster than the min and max functions

13060483
min	max
if requesting min and max from a clean array return themin and themax

public class questionsqlrepository extends abstractsqlrepository implements questionrepository

13074894
put	get
the client should get these data and put in the appsrc

13074918
apache	nginx
what you should do to drastically free apache to process php is to install nginx as a front to the public

13074918
apache	nginx
so set nginx on port 80 put apache on say 8080 and only allow nginx to connect but don t worry if you leave it public for a little time as it was already public and great for debugging to bypass nginx so no security issues should rise - but i recommend you don t leave it public for to long

13074918
apache	nginx
then make nginx reverse proxy to apache cache all static files which offloads that from apache because nginx serves them instead meaning apache can do more php requests and also get nginx to perform output compression

13074918
apache	nginx
as an added benefit nginx can also serve static files much faster than apache and nginx also uses much less ram and can handle much more connections

13074918
apache	nginx
remember to keep output buffering on however for php to apache but turn zlib compression off on php and enable it instead on nginx

13074926
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome as the browser but the same thing happens in firefox

use strlen on each resulting cstring produced by strtok to count the size of each word

children	parent
if on the other hand you want the numbers so that the children of the parent randomamount element will be named randomamount_1 randomamount_2 randomamount_3 etc. then my advice would still be the same just give all the children the same name and let your data be for example

13075411

so i ll have column of button datagridviewbuttoncolumn a column of checkbox datagridviewcheckboxcolumn and then a button otuside the dgv that references the checkbox columns

13075667

i have made the underlying code skip the code in cellcontentclick by recognizing it s not the correct column to click for the button but the checkbox never gets selected because the cellcontentclick fires before it recognizes the box has been checked

13075672
integer	unsigned
accepting and operating on an unsigned integer is a way to make the function most portable

13075716

you could separate the string into substrings using the spaces as the delimiter

13077006
hide	show
see how it is implemented for example to show hide the disclosure when there are no children

13077034
int	chars
you pass a chars into your int function which convert the number into a chars variable gives you garbage

chown	sudo
note too that that you could in addition do a sudo chown root root ...

13077255
getter	setter
writing the same in f# 2.0 would be pretty annoying because you d have to define getter and setter by hand

13077279
sorting	filtering
so you need to do the sorting and or filtering somewhere else probably best on the server side if the results are comming from a database then put them in a list then call the quick sand plugin to replace the current list with the one you just created

13077308

but when i do this the window appears to have a height and width of 0

13077555

hide	show
i set a conditional compilation symbol found in the build tab of project properties is_vis value being true if you want certain members to show false if your want to hide them and then

13077894
pull	push
that s really important because the history editing happens only in the local repository they don t propagate with pull push operations

13077894
pull	push
for example the only thing that happens when moving from public to draft or secret is that the protection of history editing is dropped nothing else pull and push will still work normally mercurial could never be confused about the changesets because they have unique identifiers

13077912
maven	pom.xml
here s a sample of what you would include in your pom.xml to include the dependencies via maven

13077912

13078243
width	height
until now i used a plane fragment for view plane which is located between -width 2 height 2 200 and width 2 -height 2 200 200 is just a fixed number of z can be changed

13078536
libs	buildpath
my first thoughts were that your buildpath had some issues in your project properties that it is not finding the appropriate libs

13078571
children	parent
this will work provided you call it on the parent with sufficient space to accommodate the children which now need more space calling it on the top level parent will always work but will result in controls visibly shifting which may be not what you want

13078621
tiff	png
this operation works only for such images which already have a desired resolution stored in their metadata not all image formats do support the concept of an image resolution -- jpeg png and tiff do

if the data is the pre-defined data type like int double string ...just put it directly to intent

13079343
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload is called when the class is loaded however no ui elements have been initialised and therefore any attempt to reference them will be overwritten or unavaliable during the initialisation process which happens between the viewdidload and viewdidappear calls

13079882
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
this works by binding the height and width properties of the textbox to the actualheight and actualwidth values of the grid

13079898
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval return a number

13079916
openni	kinect
i think the gesture recognition is not depended on whether you use kinect official sdk or openni if you can get the skeleton data or depeth image from the kinect then you can extract the gesture or postion from the relations between skeltons with times

13079929
client-side	server-side
the event handler is executed when the value has changed but if the value is changed via script using jquery on the client-side and a post back is subsequently triggered when the user changes the value and the drop-down s onchange event fires then the server-side code detects that the value hasn t changed since the server last saw its state and therefore the event handler isn t run on the server side

singleton	facade
this low-level library is wrapped in a facade a singleton to shield clients from knowledge of it and the facade methods can take a delegate that effectively wraps the low-level library s delegates so clients can assign themselves as delegates when the facade itself a delegate gets data back from web service calls

13080470
singleton	facade
the facade is a singleton for a few reasons

13080470
singleton	facade
i was thinking that perhaps i could assign a unique key to each call to makecallwithdelegate and the facade singleton instance would store a dictionary of the call keys and the delegate passed in for that call

13080478
width	height
i can set the height and width of the the popup note.

winpcap	libpcap
it s exposed in libpcap winpcap but opening the file for output is a bit awkward - you need a pcap_t for a capture device a pcap_t for a capture file or a dummy pcap_t for the link-layer header type and snapshot length of the file you re writing if the packets you re writing aren t coming from a live capture or an existing capture file

13082119
winpcap	pcap.net	winpcap	libpcap	libpcap	pcap.net
i couldn t find any reference documentation for pcap.net just tutorial documentation but there didn t seem to be anything that let you open a dummy handle - you can open a capture device or a offline capture file but i didn t see anything about creating a dummy handle from which you can t read packets but that you can use when opening a capture file for writing - so all the functionality available in libpcap winpcap is not exposed in pcap.net as far as i can tell

width	height
every page is a div with 100 height and width so if i change the page i set the next div right to the currently active and slide both to the left side

13083659
memcpy	realloc
so you don t need to call memcpy after realloc

13083659
free	realloc
in fact doing so is wrong because your previous heap cell may have been free inside the realloc call

13083662
free	realloc
if realloc has free d your previous memory then you are accessing memory that is not yours

13083662
memcpy	realloc
if realloc has just enlarged your previous memory you are giving memcpy two pointers that point to the same area

13083667
for-loop	arrays
you d also be better off using a for-loop and not hard coding the length of the arrays

int	double
you can create an intermediate class that manages data internally as int but inputs and outputs as double

13085606
int	double
this class will actually be quite fast since you are operating with int instead of double and you will never lose precision

13085627
inject	interceptor
you can inject the same instance of that abstraction in all interceptor that need to communicate

google-chrome	safari
you seem only to have used -webkit prefixes which are specific to webkit based browsers such as safari and google-chrome either use the other prefixes -moz -o or use compass which is very useful for maintaining prefixes as the code always reflects the latest browser support

13086190
implements	extends
what you need to do is extends the imageview class and implements touches on the image to find out which image was clicked

13086209
mediarecorder	audiorecord
you might try using the mediarecorder class instead of audiorecord which offers a few extra methods including the ability to register an error callback method

13086226
post	get
from the example you post it seems that you want to return a json answer as a result from a get request which would make more sense

13086280
google-chrome	safari
the -webkit- bit is a vendor prefix which will only apply to browsers which use the webkit rendering engine the most popular of which are google-chrome and safari

13086291

13086771
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
something which while can be done would only support the browsers you choose it to firefox google-chrome ie safari opera etc etc but it requires directly interfacing with the native c libraries something outside of the scope of this and certainly overkill for such a trivial feature

13086780
hash	md5
basically what i m looking to do in python 2.x is read the file and if within the filename column any files exist with a specified file extension from a list the data from the md5 hash column is parsed out into a text document

redmine	gitolite
add a repository on redmine with the original repo of gitolite s repository

13086803
redmine	gitolite
initially redmine doesn t have any permissions to read the repository so we fix the problem by adding the redmine user usually www-data or apache to the git group by running usermod -a -g git www-data be aware of your server s configuration because that can be a little different according to how you configurated gitolite

setthreadaffinitymask function sets a processors affinity mask for the specified thread

13086880
submit	submission
lots of things a bit specific to my larger system there but what this does is allow students in my classes to submit assignment info which is dumped into a place in the spreadsheet that corresponds with their google login and when they refresh the page the html interface updates to indicate receipt of submission

13086880
submit	submission
just having got this to work i am popping the champagne since it will hugely simplify managing student submission but at the moment the interface would be much more intuitive if when the user hit the submit button that there would be an immediate update removing the form and switching from the red cross to the green tick

13086933
google-chrome	firefox
this works file on google-chrome firefox

13086973
gtk	clutter
unfortunately qt and gtk lacks the flexibility that the browser svg canvas or flash platform offer but there were some scene graph integration into qt and gtk with clutter library can well be a viable option

thus using direct3d 9 d3d9.h directly should be fine assuming the user has some version of directx 9 installed

13087412
width	height
the height and width of the parent container is 600px and 500px respectively

13087431

13087571
accessor	properties
i noticed when i reflect into an assembly calls to properties accessor sometimes look like methods

13087661
accessor	properties
in the case of a properties x it is compiled as a bunch of accessor methods get_x and or set_x and for each of these the usual method metadata is emitted

13087661
accessor	properties
then additional metadata is emitted which specifies that all of these accessor methods actually belong together as one logical entity the properties

13087758
width	height
there is an option that i m pretty sure is already enabled in the dyantree ui that contains the tree in the div you put it in and creates scroll bars only when needed as long as you put a fixed height and width

13087879

when you need to reorder the fragments then call the method of the interface which you implemented with proper arguments as per requirement and then use popbackstack string arg1 string arg2 to get the fragment with the tag you put it in the backstack

13087918
mutators	getter
i can achieve proper functionality using a very large number of getter mutators that the packet class uses to create decode transmitted received packets

13087918
mutators	getter
ideally the classes that handle the actual application would not know anything about the packet class and not have to provide getter mutators exclusively for it and they simply would have new data if a packet came in between updates

13087956
width	height
by the way i ve typed your item parameter to displayobject so you are sure that it has width height and stage properties

13088401
stdout	stderr
i wrote a simple script called out-and-err.py that writes a line of output to stdout and another line to stderr

13088401

if i run just the python script stdout and stderr are separate

13088445
implements	extends
2 imho it s preferable to implements runnable rather than extends thread

13088452
post	get
remember you will need to add a method to your form either post or get

13088470
min	max
i know the alternatives are to use min and max

13088470
min	max
i have even tried setting the chart with min and max values and using the above code to evenly space out dates but i have no luck

13088470
min	max
the min and max values are resetted on chart.resetaxesscale

13088470
min	max
even if i put an option of using the existing min max in the resetaxesscale method the graph doesn t honor these values

13088492
int	double
therefore you end up multiplying a truncated int by a normal double and type inference turns var into double

13088492
int	double
in the second case it would assign the truncated int to a double variable

13088513
pull	push
i can push pull tag everything else just cannot seem to list stashes and stuff

13088592
hide	show
elements jump when they are show hidden using the .show hide slide and fade methods because as soon as the animation completes they are removed from the flow in most browsers - not chrome - the show hide methods do not cause the element to shrink all the way to nothing so there is still choppiness

13088592
hide	show
if you simply try to call a show hide slide or fade method on the collection to be show they will all animate at the same time and the same thing happens when trying to make them run on callback

13088592
hide	show
the show hide methods worked in some browsers as they actually do reduce the size of the element but they are choppy in others so they were out effectively their animations don t complete in all browsers - see above

when you want to learn about vba look for references on vb6

13088641
vb6	vba
even the newest version of vba vba7 is esentially a subset of vb6

13088641
vb6	vba
most of what you can learn about vb6 is completely applicable to vba particularly in regards to classes and udts which are kind of like structs in the .net world

13088641
vb6	vba
when you search use vb6 rather than vba if you re not finding what you need for example

13088641
vbscript	vba
most vbscript can be pasted directly in to a vba project and it will run with small exceptions like not having access to the wscript object

13088641
vbscript	vba
many of the documentation examples such as for msxml for interacting with both xml files and the internet show vbscript and all of this code can be readily used in vba

13088753
post	get
the asynchronous process request method just calls the correct method whether it s a post or get to one of the following then calls completerequest to end the request

13088822
capitalize	capitalization
the rule of thumb with capitalization is that all attributes should be capitalize except if you want igraph to recognize and treat your attribute specially

13088829
accessor	properties
using custom event accessor i was able to avoid clunky in my opinion methods like loggingon_subscribe eventhandler or adding name properties for each event

13088894
width	height
if we set width height on mdichild we end up losing resize functionality

13088894
width	height
this solves the primary width height issue

for-loop	loops
thread2 the background thread is using a parallel.for loops which reduces the image processing saving time by 70 over a normal for-loop

13089272
folder	directory
it does take more than 5 seconds to install but it s worth the trouble and as far as i can tell it doesn t modify your system registry folder etc. except copying files to the directory you specify

13089272
folder	directory
it will create a getgnuwin32 directory there in which you will run download.bat then install.bat without parameters after which there will be a c bin getgnuwin32 gnuwin32 bin directory that is the most useful folder that has ever existed on a windows machine

13089293

13089335
folder	directory
resource methods but can t identify a folder in my source directory and list it s contents.

13089344
onkeyup	onkeydown
i personally recommend onkeyup instead of onkeydown because it makes it easier to handle long press that way capture the event and just undo whatever you are doing when an item in the list is clicked

13089375
put	get
i ve a search button in the bottom i put a keyup event listener to get instant searches

13089382
folder	directory
in the same directory there s apparently an app_localresources folder with a resx file in it

13089404
icmp	udp
udp is an osi layer four protocoll so is icmp

13089404

in the end i put a few printfs into ffmpeg source to get the info i needed

13089533
dbcontext	objectcontext
i would suspect since objectcontext has been deprecated in favor of dbcontext

13089533
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext is a much more pleasant api than objectcontext

13089546
google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome safari browsers use

13089563
post	get
originally this post was regarding my attempts to inject zeroclipboard into web pages by and for use by my chrome extension but i ve dumbed the scenario down and down and down in a seemingly futile attempt to identify the issue and i still can t get it to work

13089599
int	boolean
you have an and with a boolean as the left argument and an int as the right argument

13089599
datediff	difference
since this expression is enclosed in a when element that already tests for the date difference you almost certainly don t need to repeat the comparison of datediff to 43200

13089622
screens	tablet
my app has 3 screens and all of them must be portrait-only in smartphones and both orientation for tablet

13089622
portrait	landscape
however if i hold the smartphone in landscape mode and launch the application it will show in landscape for a few seconds then rotate to portrait

13089649
dbcontext	objectcontext
because objectcontext is implemented explicitly in the dbcontext class as shown on the msdn - dbcontext you have to explicitly cast your object to the interface to call the property

13089659
minimum	max
so the arrays have a minimum length of 1 and a max of n

13089669
soundpool	audiotrack
explanation each soundpool reserves one native audiotrack and each mediaplayer also reserves one native audiotrack

soundpool	audiotrack
therefore with 2 soundpool and 4 mediaplayer objects you will have 6 underlying audiotrack objects in use

13089677
mouse	keyboard
i did several pre-passes and dummy passes also to settle the dynarec to verify reliability of 0.1ms precision stayed solid for several seconds then kept my hands off the keyboard mouse while the benchmark occured then did several post-passes to verify reliability of 0.1ms precision stayed solid again

you can set that in the constructor for your class or provide a getter and setter

13089859
for-loop	loops
if you re using a for-loop however this will continue on to the next iteration which is probably not what you want so this works better with a while loops implementation

13089888
entities	entitymanager
that is the jsf views display entities and collections they access on their backing beans managedbean and these collections and entities are in turn fetched by calling stateless ejb3 facade beans that have the entitymanager injected and access the database using jpa backed by hibernate

13089966
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you check the source code of dbcontext class that is available on codeplex the property objectcontext is implemented explicitly

13089966
dbcontext	objectcontext
this is the reason why you won t be able to invoke the property objectcontext using an object of dbcontext without casting it to iobjectcontextadapter type

13090003
hide	show
because then you can use jquery s built-in hide show functions which change display accordingly

13090024
width	height
if you re using match_parent for the width and height and the images to or centercrop -- things like that it should fill whatever screen size that it is run on

this appears to be a jquery bug caused by some confusion as to whether delete data should be attached to the url like a get request or the request body like a post

13090062
int	chars
you should not be using atoi it converts a string to int not a single chars

13090062

13090467
strlen	strcpy	printf	strlen	printf	strtol	printf	strcpy	strtol	strlen	strtol	strcpy

13090472
post	get
the javascript is just doing get or post requests behind the scenes and you can do the very same requests with c#

13090484

this does not satisfy your second requirement of automatically choosing the https protocol on path helpers but that s not achievable with a controller-specified ssl enforcement since the route helpers don t care about what s happening on a controller level

13110705
ssl	https
that is actually mutually exclusive with controller-enforced ssl because if your routes specify https then they won t resolve a non-https url to a controller action which means that your force_ssl filter would never be hit

13110790

even so if you still want to go ahead and use the timeline and profiler tools in firefox or google-chrome then be my guest

13110888
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
but do keep in mind you re optimizing for a particular js engine when you re doing that v8-optimized code might generate cleaner memory in google-chrome and safari but for all you know ie might make a complete hash of things or some of the tricks you ve used cause firefox to slow down more than a fairly large array would have done in the first place

13110959
next	except
i wrote a program to do this and tested it on a copy of the fat that i dumped to a file and it works perfectly except that for a few of the files 17 out of 526 the fat chain is one single cluster too long and thus cross-linked with the next file

accessor	properties
note that he doesn t synthesize the accessor for the properties

13111318
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
he writes the accessor himself and instead of returning the ivar generated by the properties connectedclients he s returning his own ivar _connectedclients

13111318
accessor	ivar
if your ivar was also named name the parameter name would hide the ivar in the accessor implementation so you had to change the name of the parameter

13111318
accessor	ivar
if you renamed your ivar by using the parameter name did no longer hide it and you could use the autocompletion generated code for the accessor

13111335

dictionary	map
you can just create and use a dictionary instead if you need to map arbitrary strings to values

13111378
dictionary	map
i want to re-emphasize that the important thing here as ashwini chaudhary has already pointed out is that there is no reason to refer to variables via strings in this way because if you need to map strings to values you can simply use a dictionary - which is exactly what you re indirectly doing anyway if you use globals or locals since those functions each return dictionary

i have tried using a for-loop and a do-while loops to try solving the problem but it doesn t work

13112017
int	double
also you will get some compiler warnings about loss of precision for casting from long to int - use float instead of double or ignore warnings if your numbers are small

13112025
content-length	content-type
content-length and content-type are headers only sent when a body is present so they are not sent with a get request

13112113

int	chars
reading it into a chars buffer makes it easier to access those four bytes in the int

13112135
int	chars
as a single byte chars is 8 bits there are four bytes to an int

13112135
int	chars
each byte in the int can be accessed by using a chars array or pointer

13112135
int	chars
this int is the same as the four bytes or chars 0x78 0x56 0x34 and 0x12

13112135
int	chars
this int is the same as the four bytes or chars 0x00 0x00 0x00 and 0x01

13112135
int	chars
so now you hopefully can see how reading as an int and printing as chars will display a different result from reading and int and printing it as an int

13112143
min	max
when max min your length is 0 so you shouldn t be going into the loop

13112164

inherited	properties
this question is really interesting i m still thinking why there are two classes which looks pretty same my initial thought was system.web.httpcookie inherited system.net.cookie but this isn t true both directly inherited from object so they are distinct classes but the properties matches a lot so this gives a hope for the solution of part 2

13112397

cos	sin
but you would be able to avoid sin and cos

13121213
put	get	accessor	properties
the former uses the sythesised setlist accessor while the latter doesn t and put the risk of related bugs in your code though its not as bad with arc as you dont get leaks happening for strong properties

13121213
accessor	ivar
what ever style you use keep it consistent and be aware of the effects of using an ivar directly as compared to using its accessor

13121234

i m having problems with the screens view on different tablet and configurations

13121234
screens	tablet
but i have created a virtual machine with the same resolution as my tablet and are the texts more large overflowing the screens

int	chars
try casting the chars to int then test if they are greater than 24 and 60

13121270
gridview	formview
also i m not sure if there s a reason why you re explicitly storing the concurrency flag in viewstate session variables but a better way to do it imo is to add the timestamp to the datakeynames property of the formview gridview ie

13121294
implements	extends
more details i implements a class productcell which extends uicollectionviewcell

13121374
try-catch	exception-handling

13121511
portrait	landscape
i have a phonegap application i want to show some pages at portrait level and some pages at landscape level

13121516
width	height
i used an image as a mask to create the circle and took advantage of the fact that when padding is specified as a percentage it is calculated based on the width of its parent element rather than the height

13121547
portrait	landscape
1. some times it shows landscape screen 1second and back to portrait which refreshes the activity and results in resetting the spinner values

13121570
width	height
i don t know what is the size 3x4 but if you are talking about height and width ratio to be of 3 4 then here is a simple method which will resize the image picked by uiimagepicker in the desired size which may also be in ratio of 3 4

13121588
inherited	properties
typedproperty inherited from the properties class and adds a member called mvalue of type t to it

width	height
and get all your need height and width

13121779
int	chars
first you reinterpret the const chars pointer as an const int pointer then you deference it which means you obtain the value and you cast this value as an state

13121847
int	double
you should try sqlfunctions.stringconvert to convert this there is no overload for int so you should cast your number to a double or a decimal

13121861
folder	directory
kohana 3.3 they didn t take into account case-sensitivity on folder files they capitalized some directory files so this is going to drive some folks nuts when they start switching to the new kohana just like i did

webclient	webrequest
i tried using stuff from in fact i used their webrequest implementation but they don t seem to have something similar for webclient

13122388

13122389
post	get
i am working in php for payment intigration when i am using the authorize.net for card transaction the url must be stuck on the dll page but no response on url by post method or get method

13122399

this way the war will automatically see the jar as well

13122399
jar	war
you should then not need your jar within the war

13122399
jar	war
you can deploy your jar and have the ear and war refer to it

13122556
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer types follow the rules of modulo arithmetic

13122591

in order to get around that you can either bind mouseout to a function that resets mouseisdown or bind mouseup globally as such

13122666

i cant get my android form app to post to google doc s spreadsheet looking for help can someone please look through the coding and tell me if i have missed something what am i doing wrong here s the code

13122717

13122721
queue	fifo
i do realize this is a lifo queue and the next is a fifo but i ve only included the interesting bits so it s quick and easy to read

13122750
client-side	server-side
instead of writing validation manually or balancing some unwieldy server-side framework validity allows you to design client-side validation in a manner that feels natural and straightforward

13122780
post	get
next i was able to get the individual file post based on id which was really the main thing i needed to know how to do and it really was as simple as this

13122782
implements	extends
i think the best would be to implements a custom viewgroup extends a linearlayout in vertical orientation

13122783
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome of course

13122818
slug	permalinks
a good starting point might be checking out wp-includes rewrite.php and see if it is somehow possible to override the permalinks for a given post type via filters and return a slug according to the users language setting

13122819
post	get
a common solution is for the server-side script that handles the post to redirect to itself - the browser will then use a get request to fetch the page which can be reloaded safely

13122827
put	get
but when i put js code in head tag between simple it work fine and i get my value in session i want to know can i keep this code

yes the call is asynchronous except if it s not really a distant call because the image is in cache in this case the image will be loaded before the next line of the script is executed

13122924

i really cant tell what the pros and the cons are both of those mime types require serializable and deserialization of your data

13122948
portrait	landscape
my app is portrait only and i have set up a landscape view which i would like to add to my current view but there is no autorotation the user manually rotates the device

13122957
serializable	deserialization
most of the web services i have used support that and is fairly easy to do as you only need to implement two different deserialization serializable methods for the same object

13122973
width	height
the openlayers.size class constructor should have parameters width and height

13122995

13123145
post	get
look up post redirect get

13123236
hide	show
if you want a more restful approach where your controller doesn t care that the data is coming from a wizard-style view another popular solution is to wrap each step in a div client-side and use javascript to hide show them as the user progresses

13123246
getter	setter
in most of the cases you should either use possibly inlined setter getter functions public static variables at file scope private or incomplete type implementations private instead

13123261
textmate	sublimetext
when pasting text from outside sources into a plain-text editor textmate or sublimetext 2 a common problem is that special characters are often pasted in as well

13123262
hide	show
but that would be massively pointless since really you are just trying to hide the menu and there would be a period where the menu is show then the page shifts which would be terrible

13123309
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
the default layout style as specified by the css standard means that the width and height properties are measured including only the content but not the border margin or padding

13123309

webclient	webrequest
socks is not supported directly by the webrequest webresponse classes and by extension the webclient class it relies on webrequest to do its work

13123733
webclient	webrequest
you can create a specialized derivation of webrequest webresponse that uses proxysocket to handle the low-level handshake and then and then create a specialized webclient class which overrides the getwebrequest and getwebresponse methods

13123746
wxpython	listctrl
i ve written code for listctrl in wxpython

13123776

13124507
getter	setter
so when i am creating the getter and setter for these objects i have been doing this example below

13124507
nsexception	nserror
additional question would it be such a bad idea to use nsexception as the problem with nserror is the app carries on i am considering having it so if they do pass in an array with an invalid object that it does just cause the application to crash and raise an exception

13124525

uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
if you don t have to support ios 5.0 you should try to add the uinavigationbar using uinavigationcontroller s - instancetype initwithnavigationbarclass class navigationbarclass toolbarclass class toolbarclass method instead of doing it manually

13124837
implements	extends
if i understand you correctly you can create an abstract class abstractview that extends view and implements your common init method

13124837
textview	imageview
since you re trying to add behavior to a group of existing subclasses imageview viewgroup textview etc. you probably do need to create a wrapper for each subclass myimageview myviewgroup mytextview etc.

13124837
inherited	subclassing	implements	extends
each of these subclassing would extends abstractview and implements their own a and b methods but inherited the common init method along with all of the methods implements in the view class

13124837

in firefox and google-chrome it appears fine but in ie 8 there is a gap at the top

13126348

13126784

if you want editors to be able to adjust layout or show hide extra parts on the page giving them access to some extra fields in the channel is imo much more manageable and future-proof

13126841

i added a border radius to my users gravatar image and made sure to add the correct css for google-chrome and safari extensions but the image does not fill in the entire circle all the way

13126853

13126866
google-chrome	safari
i.e google-chrome or safari or any social networking app

13126871

con the controller has to register and handle input events keyboard and mouse events as well as contain the business logic

compated to the viewmodel in mvvm and the presenter in mvp this class would be the most bloated and somewhat more difficult to unit test

13127548
children	parent
i have a parent div with a dynamic number of children divs

13127566
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

13127566
google-chrome	firefox
tested and verified in ie 8 firefox and google-chrome

13127566
keydown	keyup
the keydown keypress and keyup events fire when the user presses a key

13127566

13127672
post	get
if this is a simple app a simple method of completing your task is to use post or get

13127672
post	get
this should at least get you started but you should research get as well as look into post and ajax

13127707
folder	directory
on windows sys.prefix is the python folder but linux it points to usr generally which now means a directory hunt by name must occur unless there is another way

13127728
width	height
since you can t read css properties in child documents from a parent document you d have to make the iframe a fixed width and height which is limiting in many scenarios

13127728
google-chrome	firefox
i think the best way to do this is to use google-chrome inspect element or firebug in firefox to look at the css inheritances the div is receiving then

13127759
int	double
you wouldn t typically use mysql_real_escape_string if the value was an int or double

13127769

enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

13127865
subtraction	addition
there is only one instruction of each as subtraction and addition yields the same result regardless of the arguments being signed or unsigned

13127901
subtraction	modulo	subtraction	addition	addition	modulo
more precisely if you already have instructions that do unsigned addition subtraction modulo 2 wordlen then the bit patterns they produce will be correct for every 2 s complement signed addition subtraction whose true result is representable

13127902
spaces	delimiter
you are setting the token delimiter to a spaces

13127930
getter	setter
and you might want to use a local private variable instead of the public property .string which makes your getter and setter quite superfluous

13128010

what i need is a way to get the value from ddlselector and put all values greater than that id into my ddlchangeto control

13128054
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

13128137

13128580

you define a protobuf file that is a specification of the object you want to exchange and then the protobuf tools create client and server-side stubs to handle the serializable and deserialization of the objects over a network connection

13128580
client-side	server-side
if your server-side implementation is in java you can use netbeans mobile client to web application tools to generate server-side and client-side stubs to send java objects over a binary data stream

13128583
ssl	https
my title might be overly specific - i m having trouble formulating the question since i haven t dealt with network administration a lot and especially not ssl https

13128744
division	modulo
this is all based on hundredths at best so just use integer division modulo

13128748
children	parent
if you still want the parent to manage versions of these deps you can use the tag to setup the versions you want without explicitly inheriting them or passing that inheritance along to children

13128778
put	get
i want to iterate over maps and get the values and put them in a treeset

13128816
comparator	comparable
when you implement comparable java looks for the implementation of comparator

13128840

13128851
width	height
in the demo below this div will be lighter than the overlay one and will actually have half the width and half the height of your screen

13128859

the width w and height h of this rectangle can vary

13128859
width	height
the big rectangle has width of r and height of k and i know both values

13128902
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the reason that pop_back doesn t return a copy is that the copy constructor of the return value will be called after the function returns excluding return-value-optimization nrvo

13128917
addition	multiplication
well for one multiplication by zero can be simplified to zero and then remove the addition but i am confident that their the compiler or hotspot will already do that

vmware	virtualbox
the typical alternatives are to install a virtual machine microsoft virtual pc or virtualbox or vmware desktop products with xp or w7 and have a virutal machine for each unique ie version you need

13129009
post	get
i would like to get the content of a file that i upload with post method

13129023
put	get
however if it just a matter of running a number of cp commands to get the various parts of the software into the right locations in the file system when building the package then i d just put those in debian rules

13129024
google-chrome	safari
for now the best is not to use google-chrome and use safari instead

13129051
folder	directory
-copy file not from the stagging directory to the install directory but from the install directory to a backup folder for the customer

13129056
margin	height
there is an apparent space between the html and body element that i cannot seem to eliminate with the css below and dozens of variations upon it. there also seems to be some bonus padding on the overall document height as if some aspect of padding or margin is not being reset to 0

13129077
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
and the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object

13129093
jar	war
the jar file with this taglibrary must be just a jar file included to your war file otherwise taglibraries will not be detected

13129124
inherited	properties
use an inherited panel to turn on the doublebuffer properties to avoid flickering

13129168
google-chrome	firefox
this page wrapper was created last year and it worked fine in ie firefox google-chrome

13129168
google-chrome	firefox
however the top navigation looks correct in ie but is not pulling in the correct code in firefox nor google-chrome

13129177
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m having an issue with jquery mouseenter mouseleave on element hover where stuff continually flickers

13129192
for-loop	loops
i then use a for-loop to iterate through the list and apply a series of if statements to determine whether the current string in loops and the next few ahead match what i am looking for and if so i bind them to an object

13129207
google-chrome	safari
and thatâ s exactly what newer browsers including internet explorer 8 safari 4 and google-chrome 2 have done

13129211
lxml	beautifulsoup
there are many at your disposal beautifulsoup lxml

13129233
queue	fifo
with a fifo queue as the final solution even a basic array structure would be a great hint

13129272
debian	linux
i have to develop my project in text-mode debian linux

13129298
versioning	upgrade
we ve added new framework versioning and used new versioning of vs as time goes on but we ve never upgrade the crystal versioning

13129315
queue	fifo
i have a category for stacks lifo and queue fifo

13129329
hex	binary
i need to compute the logic expression x y + x z + yz where x y and z are hex constants and the result is displayed in binary

13129354
express	node.js
i have a node.js app using express and mongodb mongoose

13129411
short	base
in short you would be converting the random integers to a number of base 36

13129549
google-chrome	firefox
with googles api when a call to firefox or google-chrome is made the local attribute is used calling the os s version of that font if it is available

13129554
cloudant	couchdb
use cloudant as your couchdb provider

13129581
ssl	https
the redirectionport actually implies if https is needed send here and i have to change it to match the ssl port i configured at 8009

13129623
junit	jmock	googletest	gmock	googletest	qtestlib	gmock	qtestlib
i ve had a lot of success with transplanting the basic principles in growing object oriented software guided by tests - which targets java + junit + jmock + windowlicker and contains a running example which while slighty toy-ish still encompasses all the topics mentioned in your post - into c++ + googletest + gmock + qtestlib

13129651
popover	tooltip
tb tooltip popover calculates their position based on the associated elements offsetwidth and offsetheight

13129651
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
sucesssfully tested with google-chrome firefox ie and safari on windows

13129651
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and opera on ubuntu

13129651
mouseover	mousemove
the idea is to target the correct on mousemove not mouseover by calculating the index based on the mouseevents clienty height of a option

13129657
hash	md5
i am trying to connect my site to a payment site that requires a certain validation key that is first md5 hash then base64 encoded

13129657
hash	md5
so when i try this sample input i get the same output for the md5 hash

13129669
post	get
following code works for get request but i am wondering how i can get the attributes in post request

13129696
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i can override the behavior of uinavigationcontroller by doing this whenever i instantiate a uiviewcontroller as the root of the uisplitviewcontroller right pane

13129714
hex	binary
you seem to be passing a 40 byte string of ascii representations of hex digits where the table is defined as holding 20 bytes of binary

13129714
hex	binary
try this using a hex literal notation for a binary string

13129730
hex	binary
if you pass a true as the second parameter to md5 it will return the raw binary data instead of a hex string

13129732
post	get
then once you read get post you can continue reading the rest of the header

13129813
memcpy	memmove
looks to me like the answer is that gcc can optimize these particular calls to memmove and memcpy but not std copy

13129813
memcpy	memmove
gcc is aware of the semantics of memmove and memcpy and in this case can take advantage of the fact that the size is known sizeof int to turn the call into a single mov instruction

13129815
button	checkbox
i was thinking about trying to do it via isset but i don t want a looped submit button i can t seem to find how to wrap the checkbox in a form for that but when i tested it quickly that way every value in achievement_locked in my database became 0 when i only want the selected checkbox to change to 0 if checked or 1 if not

13129845
width	height
the int width and height will get your screen width and height and then you set the frame of your window the one that has your webview using those ints

13129873
post	get
you ll want the actual save to be in response to a post request not get

13129873
post	get
there s a long and somewhat complicated explanation on why that is but the simplified version is that you use post whenever you re making changes for the user and get when you re just reading data -- there s a bunch of browser and proxy behavior and whatnot tied to these assumptions so it s a good idea to start doing things the right way early on

13129884
margin	height
also you can tweak the margin property and set it to negative if the line height does not work

13129950
button	checkbox
when the user clicks a button i need to find out which items in the checkbox have been selected

13129955
spock	grails
there are several mocking testing libraries that work with grails - spock is my personal favorite

13130047
min	max
while running the code it is giving error cannot find column max . but i have added the max and min column to the table in the dataset

13130098
min	max
you have set the captions to max and min but the datacolumns s identifier is it s ordinal or columnname

13130106
width	height
you work out the total width and total height of the rectangle

13130106
width	height
you now just need the ratio between the width and height

13130106
width	height
and the scale itself is applied to the original width and height

13130111
google-chrome	firefox
for this i m trying to insert a div right before and right after the column break using my .before-break and .after-break classes but firefox and google-chrome to not mind their column-break-after property

13130140
post	get
then you can perform post or get requests from your app to the webservice which will query the db update it read from it etc

13130171
post	get
i ll try to write up the blog post and get it posted by tonight if you can wait that long

13130171
post	get
i ll update this answer when i get the blog post up

13130188
versioning	upgrade
we have upgrade the application some months ago i d say july and have switched from oracle 10g to oracle 11g in the past month or so also changing the oracle jdbc driver to match the database versioning

13130216
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this issue occurs in google-chrome 22.0.1229.94 firefox 16.0.2 and safari 6.0.1

13130234
hide	show
if you re absolutely attached to animations or need to trigger fallback functionality hide show reposition elements without css for some reason you could try a modernizr workaround

13130362
ready	each
so instead you have to stick the output in a write buffer for each socket and they ll get it in some future run through the event loop when thye re ready

13130376
g++	gcc
i mean the same effect as gcc g++ -s command in linux

13130432
google-chrome	firefox
the browsers that i ve tested on and both have this problem are google-chrome and firefox

13130437
phpmyadmin	adminer
you could try adminer instead of phpmyadmin as it claims to be faster i never had a problem with phpmyadmin and is very easy to set up as a drop in replacement

13130463
google-chrome	firefox
my problem i just coded a website that is styled just fine in google-chrome and firefox

13130505
width	height
i had to place the mapview inside a relativelayout to adjust the height and width as i want for some reason mapview doesn t behave the normal viewish way

13130560
websphere	ibm
i have checked my garbage collection settings and i am using gencon ibm websphere which many resources online have indicated is very good as well

13130561
width	height
then i would change your css so that the elements are have display block have the width and height attributes and take the background images

13130561
width	height
your elements should retain the float right and the width and height attributes and nothing else

13130584
namedtuple	dictionary
newest_files is a dictionary having file names without extensions as keys with values of namedtuple which hold file full file name and modification date

13130593
r-tree	quadtree
depending on your needs you might want to use a grid a quadtree a k-d tree or an r-tree to accelerate your spatial queries

13130594
firefox	safari
in dfp i have changed from gam tags google ad manager tag to asynchronous google publisher tag the banners are now showed up under firefox but not in safari and chrome.

13130596
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works just fine in safari firefox and google-chrome

13130604
int	double
what it does when you pass in a scalar value like a double int whatever is different from what happens if you pass in something that is not a scalar value in all expected cases a user-defined type

13130604
int	double
the compiler prefers the template over the call to bar double and i am assuming this is because the parameter is an int which it would rather cast to int const since a const can reference an r-value

13130630
vmware	virtualbox
install it into a vm virtualbox or vmware on your box

13130631
hex	binary
you basically need to conver the hex string to binary 40 hex - 20 binary for it to work

13130634
folder	directory
through much trial and error i ve figured out how to make lzma compressed files through pylzma but i d like to replicate the seemingly simple task of compressing a folder and all of its files directory recursively to a 7z file

13130636
put	get
note that when i put trace within the second two functions nothing happens but the addeventlistener in the first snippet does get called or so i think

13130662
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
this happens with glassfish 3.1 but doesn t happen with tomcat weblogic and jboss

13130667
rss	feed
i m starting to learn node.js and to aggregate multiple rss feed in a single one i m fectching the feed and then recreate a unique feed from the data i fecthed

13130667
rss	feed
but i can t figure how to return a value the rss xml feed in my case

13130667
rss	feed
with console.log rssfeed i can see the rss feed so i think i m missing something obvious

13130690
shadowing	named
the syntax problem is shadowing method and variable named

13130849
switching	screens
however today with this simple app when i switching back and forth between the first and second screens the buttons and textview on page 2 keep shrinking

13130849
portrait	landscape
update i noticed if i rotate my phone from portrait to landscape or vice versa after the buttons have shrunk they revert to normal default size

13130858
postgresql	mysql
our class is learning with postgresql instead of mysql as you can see in the tags

13130867
ssl	https
following the guidance here updated for rails 3.2.x i expected to be able to configure rack ssl to use the ssl filters only if an https prefix is included

13130881
move	drag
whenever i start drag and drop on any entity and the placeholder move from it s original location and the onchange event is triggered from jquery the entity becomes unbound from the meteor events

13130901
put	get
essentially there is a massive built-in list of files that will get put in a certain order before any file that isn t in the list - but these options let you take control

13130928
post	get
i have created a basic restful service in .net that allows me to make basic get and post calls to a uri that is specified by the calling method

13130928
post	get
in my post method i am attempting to call getrequeststream with my httpwebrequest however i get a protocolviolationexception with the message cannot send a content-body with this verb-type. i know that this can be caused by having the httpwebrequest method set to get however i have debugged and made sure that the method is post when the getrequeststream call is made

13130966
jar	manifest.mf
if that doesn t work then you do not have an executable jar with a manifest.mf that specifies the main-class

13130983
x86	64bit
gcc compiles on several platforms and each of these platforms have a different native pointer size 32-bit on x86 64bit on x64

13130983
x86	64bit
and on 64bit platforms you can even pass it an mx32 flag to make it cross compile to x86

13130989
email-ext	jenkins
you could also use a jenkins plugin email-ext to perform more advanced tasks

13131025
folder	directory
one thing you should make sure is that the normalized parent directory ends with a trailing slash or backslash if on windows otherwise users could get access to folder on the same level as parentdir that start with the same characters as parentdir

13131031
width	height
set all 6 resize options flexible height width top bottom left right

13131044
folder	directory
for example let s say the directory is foo and there s a non-readable folder foo folder with a file foo folder file1.txt and another non-readable file foo file2.txt

13131047
put	get
if you have access to ftp or some other way to get files onto the server just serve your .css file without passing it through the cms and put a to that file in the headers

13131080
put	get	post	get	post	put
there s two things this could be backbone by default tried to do restful api calls to your backend this means get post put and delete

13131080
post	get
many backends weren t built with real rest support and only support get and post

13131097
jstl	taglib
i don t think that s general jstl error because i included the taglib

13131129
centos	linux
centos linux 6.3

13131138
apache	nginx
basically you need some rewrite rules in your apache or nginx

13131189
versioning	upgrade
recently i ve been trying to upgrade webistrano from a versioning that did not use bundler to manage the application gems to one that does

13131189
capistrano	bundler
in order to deploy rails applications we would use require bundler capistrano in the recipe to have the bundler loaded for the application and other related steps like precompiling assets etc.

13131189
capistrano	bundler
however once bundler is used with a gemfile to specify and load the appropriate gem environment having require bundler capistrano throws the following error

13131189
capistrano	rvm
i also have similar issues with require rvm capistrano when attempting to use rvm to manage the ruby environment

13131191
getter	setter
ecmascript 262 edition 5 introduced the option for having getter and setter on objects officially defined by spec

13131247
ilist	icollection
as a counter-example the ilist t interface is probably not suitable because unlike icollection t it assumes that the collection is a list where the elements can be added at specific positions which doesn t make sense if the collection itself determines the position of each element

13131247
ilist	icollection	sortedlist	sorteddictionary
the sorted collection types in the .net framework the sortedlist tkey tvalue class sorteddictionary tkey tvalue class and sortedset t class all implement icollection t but not ilist t

13131253
memcpy	memmove
i agree with rici s comment about developing a more meaningful benchmark so i rewrote your test to benchmark copying of two vectors using memcpy memmove std copy and the std vector assignment operator

13131264
hide	show
when the media query returns a smaller size i hide the modal window link and show a standard link to the desired page

13131265
min	max
that is calculate min max daily averages hourly peaks and lows etc

13131271
memcached	apc
another option would be to use apc or memcached to store a lock which can then be checked from other php processes

13131279
quad	shading
it is drawn using a single quad over the entire screen the shader uses gl_fragcoord and determines if each point is inside or outside the circles - it calculates an alpha of 1.0 inside the circles smoothly shading down to 0.0 outside radius + edgesmoothing then it applies a mirror-style clamp to alpha triangle wave to get an even-odd fill-rule effect and sets

13131279
quad	uniform
now i think it will be much more efficient to draw the quad just once and pass in the parameters for all 10 circles into uniform arrays etc. looping through them in the glsl and adding up the colours they produce in the shader

13131298
cubic-spline	interpolation
here s a fiddle of cubic-spline interpolation for the time

13131312
margin	height
if you ll use this last technique please be sure to remove your margin-top and just add that margin value to your container s height

13131351
sum	floor
if you think about the sum it sums up every 2 i two times because of the floor

13131371
submit	submission
when the submit button for the overall form is clicked it adds a new element to the ko.observablearray instead of submission the form to our server

13131438
uploadify	plupload
i m familiar with plupload and have found uploadify but do not see in their documentation how to accomplish what i m after

13131461
folder	directory
copy page and page_template folder under ttwbd widgets toolbox into your project s widget directory

13131473
put	get
as far as .h vs main.cpp the typical approach is to put the header in a button.h and the implementation code in a button.cpp but you could just put this at the top of main.cpp to get started - it has all the logic right in the class definition

13131478
rubygems	rvm
when you run rails the first time it s finding a global rubygems installation before your local rvm copy

13131494
jobs	cron
crontab is the program used to manage cron jobs

13131550
google-chrome	firefox
i did this quite easily and got the exact height i wanted in google-chrome i then opened it in firefox and the horizontal line was about 10px shorter the same thing happened with ie9

13131561
hide	show
what i would do is in your doinbackground method is use swingutilities.invokelater to show the dialog and in your done method hide the dialog

13131592
superclass	subclassing
and couple of subclassing which extend the superclass a

13131592
implements	extends
class c extends a implements i is this possible

13131592
abstract-class	superclass
let s say i don t provide the implementation of method r from the interface i then i will have to make the superclass a and abstract-class

13131597
hide	show
i would like to know how to hide show os desktop icons like this in windows using a java swing app for instance clicking a button

13131609
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux core i7

13131625
for-loop	arrays
when i use a for-loop to display the arrays elements i get and

13131636
appdata	uninstaller
fyi one of the implications of using sharedpreferences is that if the user uninstaller your app or clears the appdata the stored list will be deleted

13131643
superclass	subclassing
1 no you do not need to implement the methods in the subclassing because they are already defined in the superclass

13131643
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing will inherited those method definitons

13131643
superclass	subclassing
the only exception is if the superclass is abstract and doesn t implement the interface then you will need to implement it in the subclassing if the subclassing is not abstract

13131656
strdup	malloc
but you could also do it by dynamic memory allocation with malloc et al or using strdup

13131658
printf	strcpy
to actually store a string you d have to copy it using strcpy or printf

13131661
inherited	subclassing
then the subclassing of a will just inherited those implementation from a

13131664
children	parent
if you do not provide an action such as cascade to your foreign key sqlite will deny deletion of a parent entry if the parent has children due to the foreign key constraint

13131665
superclass	subclassing
1 no if you implemnt them in your superclass its not required to implement them in your subclassing

13131665
superclass	subclassing
2 if you dontimplement the methods in your superclass then you havetomake it abstract and then make your concrete subclassing implement those methods

13131665
implements	extends
4 yep and you should implements those methods in the class when extends your superclass

13131675
inherited	subclassing
implementing the method - in this case your subclassing has already inherited that method and doesn t need to implement anything

13131675
implements	extends
declaring itself abstract - in this case your subclass must either implements the abstract method or declare itself abstract too and pass the buck down to any class extends the subclass

13131675
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	implements	extends
3 all the subclassing of the superclass a already implements i because they inherited the promise so class c extends a implements i is redundant

13131712
pull	push
my current setup is i have a prime repo working directory hub repo bare developers push and pull from clones for developers

13131726
post	get
what i need through the facebook api is to get for a specific logged user all the youtube videos links to youtube pages she liked on facebook meaning all the post she liked that contained a link to a youtube video

13131779
submit	submission
the docs mention that ajaxform only prepares the form for submission but does not submit it

13131781
post	put
i am unable to post images for representing combobox values so has put in above examples

13131841
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
as to your other questions there actually used to be a cabal upgrade command for installing the latest versioning of all currently installed packages but it was removed since it could break your installation again having support for multiple instances of the same package versioning would fix this

13131842
put	get
note that i couldn t use cssclass - i had to put my own attribute ishidden to get to this to work

13131857
put	get
you can put the element inside another element to get the html code

13131894
submit	submission
from what i can tell itunes connect explicitly warns you that new iap items that are meant for future versions of the app will be always rejected and that you need to submit those for review in parallel to submission the next app version

13131912
implements	extends
i have a class that extends the iretryanalyzer and have implements a simple retry logic overriding the following method

13131926
hide	show
the problem i see with this approach is assuming you have both options and just show hide the correct one based on css media queries that you are repeating content in the code which is not very good for accessibility

13131946
width	height
the svg should always be 100 of the browser width and it s height should be proportionately sized

13131949
button	checkbox
everything submits fine in each form except the radio button and checkbox

13131979
google-chrome	safari
one more important thing - look at this issue - google-chrome safari setsrc - play

13132006
hide	show
then you can use jquery to show and hide the drop down

13132009
put	get
suppose we had two arrays some values and some indices let s say our output is expected to be the values put into a bigger array addressed by the indices so we would get

13132045
vcard	mime
my first steps are focused on the tag reading write mode currently i cannot see plenty of information on how to work with the vcard vcal mime types and ndef records messages

13132115
mouseleave	mouseenter
i just trap the mouseleave and mouseenter events and show the underline there

13132140
folder	directory
one solution for attempting to open a program on windows is to just search all folder starting from the base directory of c program files and c program files x86

13132140
x86	64bit
as a quick side note if you are creating an application that can be run on both 32bit and 64bit versions of windows you will want some kind of check for the existence of the program files x86 directory or some kind of check for 32 vs 64bit windows

13132215
fasta	biopython
ok so i need to extract part of a sequence from a fasta file using python biopython

13132215
put	get
i need to get the first 10 bases from each sequence and put them in one file preserving the sequence info from the fasta format

13132262
punctuation	words
or if the words were punctuation

13132291
google-chrome	firefox
this would not show up in the view source but in some browsers would show up in the inspect element google-chrome firefox as these tend to show the updated code

13132303
button	checkbox
checkbox are for multiple selection while radio button only allow a single selection

13132303
button	checkbox
it is really by design of html and before that standard user interfaces that checkbox and radio button behave this way

13132359
mouseleave	mouseenter
i just trap the mouseleave and mouseenter events and show the underline there

13132429
pull	push
this is fine as long as the others are just a mirror of your prime and changes don t travel the other way unless you specifically pull from others into prime or others can push to it

13132486
exponent	modulo
the modulo and exponent can be base 64 decoded into a buffer and then passed straight into the bn_bin2bn function as is

13132490
partcover	opencover
open source code coverage tools for .net such as partcover and opencover also exist

13132511
width	height
and it works great in the sense that it gets me the total width and height of the screen with great accuracy and reliability which is what i have asked it to do

in other words drawing on a canvas 3 times the width and height of the window centered allowing a full drag in any direction and having it re-draw each time the user finishes a drag

13143871
division	modulo
if a page can have 27 items printed on it and number of items can be any positive number then how can i find number of pages if i have number of items i tried modulo and division but didn t helped

13143884
octal	decimal
since your method accepts an integer commonly represented in a string representation as decimal and what you re outputting is also an integer you ve not really turned into an octal integer you ve changed it into some other integer completely

13143884
octal	decimal
you re trying to correctly convert your integer into an octal and then incorrectly interpreting that octal as a decimal

13143884
octal	decimal
and if you truly want to return an int that represents that octal string parsed as if it was decimal you could simply do this

13143947

pthreads	ucontext
i m trying to port a library that uses ucontext over to a platform which supports pthreads but not ucontext

13144044
pthreads	ucontext
the code is pretty well written so it should be relatively easy to replace all the calls to the ucontext api with a call to pthreads routines

13144061
google-chrome	safari
viewed in webkit safari google-chrome ios safari it looks like the version on the right

13144093

the problem i am having though is that when i minimize the internalframe the icon in the bottom left corner automatically hides behind the jpanel that is also added to the jdesktoppane

13144340
width	margin
i d like to have a 10px margin between the left and right 50 divs but i need the whole assembly to fit within the 80 body width container

13144340
width	margin
i understand that reducing the width of the left and right divs will work to give me room for the 10px center margin but it would also mean the whole left div right div 10px margin assembly would often not be 80 of the body width

13144407
cypher	gremlin
it s built on top of py2neo using cypher and rest api calls under hood i.e no dependency on gremlin

13144420

jtable.rowatpoint and jtable.columnatpoint returns coordinated for getvalueat int row int column from unknow mouseevent not sure if is there mouselistener or mousemotionlistener

13144438
rvm	bundler
it probably comes from a specific gem you had installed so check for recent changes in your gemfile or maybe you switched to bundler or rvm losing some globally installed gem

13144442
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i figured out that i was supposed to implement shoulautorotate in the uinavigationcontroller not in uiviewcontroller

google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome

13144500
button	checkbox
i need to make pre-populated pdf xfa forms read-only as in no inputs such as text checkbox radio button etc

13144509

you are getting the width and the height of the image every time you hover over it even while the image is animating so the current values aren t really the ones you want

13144519
hide	show
use that to hide and show your div

13144520
openmpi	mpich
i am using intel mpi but could switch to openmpi or mpich if needed

13144561

the problem ended up being in the serializable deserialization of the custom key intermediarykey

13144565
box-sizing	border-box
or you can use the box-sizing border-box

13144620
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
what can i say i go out of my way to get something perfect also am new around here so that bounty would really help to be very honest to also note that it works natively in ie7 ie8 and ie9 ff3.6 opera 10 and should work in safari with no problem google-chrome didn t get mentioned as it s my default browser and it works no doubt about it

13144633

this will have an image control with height and width set appropriately

13144733
children	parent
given c is children of b i want to select all cs which have a parent b that is sibling of a

13144771
textview	imageview
notice that i combined the last textview and imageview you may need to adjust this.

13144818
n-gram	words
when you say n-gram i m going to assume you re talking about letters in a words rather than words in a sentence which probably is the most common usage

13144941
jpanel	jdesktoppane
my personal opinion is that the idea of adding jpanel on jdesktoppane is bad

13144950
equals	compareto
you should define your compareto consistent with equals

13144950
comparator	comparable
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equals

13144951
put	get
i was thinking about parsing through the source text to get the pixel data and then put them into an array of integers

13144979
mouse	keyboard
to best of my knowledge you can hook all the mouse and keyboard events to detect the source of input

13144979
mouse	keyboard
you should have a look at this codeproject article processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c#

13144992
firefox	safari
so this works well in firefox and safari

13144992
opera	google-chrome
but not in google-chrome nor opera unless we remove the transforms property and adjust margins

13144999
hide	show
i ve got three elements with ids albums about and contact and three links to show hide them via the toggle function with ids togglealbums toggleabout and togglecontact

13145003
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
we ll soon move to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk and are therefore preparing the transfer

this of course assumes that student has a suitable definition of equals and gethashcode

13145066
profiling	debugging
anyway i am able to run compute visual profiling profiling this project by pointing the debugging directory but then i got the error

13145114
hex	binary
honestly i would first just compile a huge string resource in the exe something that can be easily identified very specific hex combinations open the exe as binary file search for this location and put any data in there

13145117
mouseup	mousedown
in general if intercepting click doesn t work try intercepting mousedown and mouseup as well as some pages trigger off of those instead

13145153

13145211
cpu	affinity
the following code shows an example on how to save the cpu affinity mask before the openmp part alter it to allow all cpus for the duration of the parallel region and then restore the previous cpu affinity mask

13145234
stdout	stderr
if you say then you are redirecting stderr to wherever stdout is currently redirected to

13145234
stdout	stderr
if stdout is going to the console then stderr is too

13145234
stdout	stderr
if stdout is going to a file then stderr is as well

13145238
postgresql	mysql
your sql will not work in postgresql mysql will allow you to do that but not any other dbms

13145247
int	boolean
once you have this you can simply copy it into a 4x4 int or boolean array

13145316
fileoutputstream	filewriter	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileinputstream	filewriter
if you want to run in-jvm and be portable you ll have to introduce a factory for your file references replace all new fileinputstream new fileoutputstream new randomaccessfile new filereader and new filewriter calls with methods on that factory object

13145375
width	font-size	width	height
you can set the font-size and or line-height of the text in ems or exs and you can use that same measure for the image height width

13145414
post	put
when i put the recipe post in wordpress looks like the picture

13145414

13145583
ubuntu	linux
it s not for ubuntu specifically but it shows how to unintall node on linux

13145588
int	double
edit a bad think that i see myself with this approach is that the params might be int string double or whatever

13145653
hide	show
i have recently been diving into jquery and loved how you could show hide elements when an event is triggered

13145653
hide	show
i tried adding a simple feature to my test website that will show login form when the login button is clicked and then hide the form if the button is clicked again however

13145674
children	parent
instead create a in the parent pom and then declare the use of com.sim log4j in the children that needs it here it is web and ejb

13145680
children	parent
when your use is done editing the parent children you will have to resolve the changed to your viewstate session based objects to those stored on disk

13145688
rtp	rtsp
maybe some sort of rtp rtsp setup would be possibel

13145708
folder	directory
this will assign the directory object to locationxml where folder name in rptdir matches yyyy_mm_dd

13145752
integer	unsigned
hresult is simply an unsigned 32bit integer value

button	checkbox
i am using asp.net for a program with a number of checkbox and a submit button which initiates an action depending on the selected checkbox

13145812
button	checkbox
however one of my checkbox should behave as this submit button i.e upon selecting deselecting this check box the same action as the button must be triggered

13145832
onclick	onchange	button	checkbox
note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange

13145832
onclick	onchange
if you use jquery to bind the events just make sure you take out the onchange onclick inline event handler in the html

13145835
post	put
but the post and put are not much more difficult to understand

13145836
rss	feed
i have an app where you tap a button to take you to a table view that lists articles in an rss feed

for example when i edit a record and click the save button ext js sends an array with true false values corresponding to the checkbox checked state

13145912
button	checkbox
when i create an entirely new record and click the add button ext js sends an array with the names of the checkbox that were checked

put	get
if i see a full-javascript application for google i just have to view the source get the client key and put on my own website an edited version of the code

libstdc++	libc++
obviously i can work around this by making foocomparator operator const but i d like to understand whether this is a problem with libc++ being too strict or whether the standard both c++03 and c++11 does in fact require that the comparator s operator be const in which case the fact that it works with libstdc++ is a happy accident

maybe you can use a function that get the length of the wanted string and cuts the last 3 letters of it then put them in a new string into a new tag span or something with a wanted class

13149224
width	height
but when a div has bigger height and width it ll become under another divs while those divs should be beside under it

13149238
for-loop	loops
your for-loop effectively loops over the big tuple with 4 elements in it

13149269

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this may seem easy - problem is that in both firefox safari and google-chrome these vertical borders bleed into the horizontal border below which doesn t look very nice

13149306
google-chrome	safari
the obvious solution would be to use for example solid on the vertical borders and double on the horizonal borders below - and this does indeed work in safari and google-chrome

13149322

13149442
width	height
for example changes to an iframe s width or height can be made from inside or outside the iframe and can be seen from both sides

13149442
width	height
one solution might be to add some javascript code to the html page you re loading into the iframe from the intranet site to set the width or height of the iframe to a special value

13149442
width	height
if the iframe is not visible on the host page then you can set the width and height to any integer value you want

13149442
width	height
if the iframe does need to be visible you can pass boolean information across the boundary by setting the width or height to even or odd values

13149462
dictionary	map
what is the best way to store this information nodes and nodelinkages when read lists map dictionary and how do i use something like pointers to refer to a particular node nodename from a link

g++	gcc
i do have gcc g++ installed as well as zlib

13149567
int	chars
a is an int value for any chars value function taking r as an argument is a functor for any type r

13149567
int	chars
with r as chars is the type constructor which is a functor which applied to int becomes or in infix notation

13149567
int	chars
with the functor fmap +1 is the function that adds 1 to an int which depends on a chars when i feed a chars to the return value i get 1 higher than what i would have got by feeding the same chars to the original value

13149631
free	malloc
my rule of thumb always use the stack if possible instead of malloc free or new delete

13149663
post	get
the other possible way though far less efficient is to store each comment as a separate entity but that would require several several reads to get all comments instead of just 1 read to get the blog post and its comments if they were in the same entity

13149688
width	height
so let s assume your display renders a at the pixel coordinates px py and every tile is rendered with a width of pwidth and a height of pheight

13149927
serializable	deserialization
i suspect this nodelinkage is really just a way of dealing with the relationship between objects during serializable deserialization in case those words haven t been explained to you yet serializable is the process of taking a set of objects in memory and persisting them to files and or databases

13149987
folder	dir	folder	directory
do a dir in the parent directory indicating the folder name you are looking for

you should use mysql or postgresql for your production database

13150266

13151385
octal	decimal
the file permissions code in unix 777 for example are octal not decimal

13151385
octal	decimal
as in when you do something like chmod -r 777 the digits are interpreted as octal input instead of decimal input

13151385
octal	decimal
back to your problem with jsch the decimal integer 775 s octal representation is 0o1407 my suspicion is that the decimal 775 is actually sent instead of the octal 775 and filezilla may very well be truncating the stuff to the left of the 3rd least significant digit of 0o1407 because it s not unreasonable for it to assume there s nothing past the 3rd least significant bit

13151385
octal	decimal
now 509 is the decimal representation of octal 775 try using that with jsch instead

13151439
textview	imageview
why don t you make use of relativelayout and using various property of it you can align your textview and imageview according to your other views.if u want to set a - to the left then make use and for you to set it to the right of the layout

13151465

13151532
hash	md5
you aren t doing the md5 hash on it

13151564

13153888
getter	setter
it seems that you want to avoid the re-writing the getter setter method which typically have similar code inside

13153888
getter	setter
if you want to automate the code generation for using getter setter then use editor which has facility to generate getter setter such as eclipse or you can resort to macros in this case

13153899
for-loop	loops
one more thing you have to past the rand value so that the for-loop for retrieve the data will loops until the last data that you have

13153909

13154250
onchange	onkeyup
you could use onkeyup onchange event and check the val of the input element and use replace to change the abbreviation to the intended string

13154284
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in django admin but i assume it s a browser s behavior though it happens at least in google-chrome and firefox

13154320
apache	nginx
if ssl is important for your entire application if you re dealing with sensitive data the best solution would be to have your web server apache nginx whatever you use to force ssl on all requests and redirect any non-ssl ones to their ssl alternative

i want my x axis to have a max say 100 and scale the actual x values accordingly so that the chart always has the same proportions rather than the proportions being relative to the min and max value supplied in graphael horizontal barchart

13154686
min	max
now for each difference we need its max position occurrence and min position occurrence

13154686
min	max
now for each difference di the difference between max - min is an i-j section of equal sum

13154701
folder	directory
if you want to use actionbarsherlock you can also download actionbarsherlock and look at the samples folder in the samples directory

postgresql	mysql
mysql has some performance features that postgresql does not but it seems that postgresql scales better with have concurrent read and writes scenarios

13155314
postgresql	mysql
the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

13155314
postgresql	mysql	innodb	myisam
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

13155314
postgresql	mysql
problems with corruption seem to be more frequent with mysql than with postgresql

13155314
postgresql	mysql
in terms of modern sql features mysql is far behind of postgresql think check constraints recursive queries windowing functions transactional ddl ...

13155314

also if you enter a directory name somethig that doesnt exist but some files and folder exist the second by ghostdog74 will never execute because its never 0 as overridden by f in for-loop so i used num variable instead of f and voila the goodness follows.

13155609
subtract	add
because if i have row number than i can easily subtract 4 and add 4 in row number and return rows

13155639

the cause for it unable to commit changes is because of the .git folder residing in the working directory

13155763
wsimport	jaxws-maven-plugin
the jaxws-maven-plugin is bound to the generate-sources phase so adding the maven-dependency-plugin before the jaxws-maven-plugin and to the same phase makes sure that it unpacks everything before applying the wsimport goal

13155805
unsigned	short
h which signifies 2-byte unsigned short works just as well

13155854
folder	directory
after testing add the directory in your xcode project as the blue folder reference

13155899
jax-ws	jax-rs
both jax-ws and jax-rs are part of java ee 6

13155899
jax-ws	jax-rs
so you can build an application that exports both jax-ws and jax-rs interfaces without using spring

13155899
jax-ws	jax-rs
note jax-ws and jax-rs implement very different concepts

13156151
put	get
get the ones with equal conditions and put them in order of cardinality greater cardinality goes first

13156151
tinyint	boolean
indexes on nullable columns and null values are less effective than not null columns and as i saw according to the key_length these columns are boolean or tinyint which are the same by the way

13156155
pop-up	dialog
when i install my app a dialog pop-up that asks for user permission to access radio information

13156155
pop-up	dialog
i added applicationpermissions.permission_location_data but it still pop-up the same dialog

google-chrome	firefox
this worked in google-chrome but the button does nothing in firefox current versions of both browsers

13156709
google-chrome	firefox
but in google-chrome the popup persists so it s not a good workaround and the behaviour in firefox is weird which tells me i m doing-it-wrong

13156805
google-chrome	firefox
the same goes for firefox running on android and arguably on google-chrome and the default browser on android too except that here the translatex offset of -100 somehow refers to the space occupied by all three tabs so the wrapper slides just enough such that none of the tabs are visible

13156814
rsa	aes
ios rsa encrypt decrypt aes key

13156832

13157803
subtraction	addition
note that for non-saturating addition and subtraction of binary values without carry borrow flags it really is irrelevant whether the values are signed or unsigned - hence the same instruction can be used for adding both signed and unsigned shorts - the only difference is how you subsequently interpret or display the result

upgrade structure of your old database to structure matching current versioning requirements like adding droping columns converting row contents or even dropping old db completely and create it from scratch - for android it does not matter what you do here - it s just a sort of emergency callback for your code to do the necessary job if any

13159239
versioning	upgrade
you need to be aware that users may not update frequently so you have to always handle upgrade from versioning x to y knowing that x may not be equal to y-1

width	height
i believe this is because the 100 height width is adhering specifically to the window size and doesn t expand beyond the window when a user zooms in

13161354
width	height
i was able to fix it by removing the 100 s and replacing them with pixels but this becomes an issue because if the screen isn t the correct height or width then you have scrollbars and the user doesn t immediately see everything on the page

13162867
accessor	properties
what are the pros cons of properties and accessor methods

13162924
pull	push
the command file that you get with sql source control was only really designed to sync your local repo and not to do a push pull

13162941
accessor	properties
that is properties accessor are executed at unpredictable times and should thus not cause any discernable side-effects

13162945
inherited	properties
the derived class still inherited the properties

13162946
hash	md5
so yes using a hash or md5 or sha1 on a variety of unique attributes would most likely be sufficient

13163000
setinterval	settimeout
my two cents you should not use setinterval but rather recursively call getupdates using settimeout

13163021
getter	setter
normally however you would want not to have public fields but instead make them private and provide getter setter methods as this will provide encapsulation

13163144

also you shouldn t add the listener within the for-loop but instead add it outside of the for loops since you are just adding the listener to _tiledimg and that doesn t change in the for loops

13163176
isotope	masonry
search on so for isotope + gaps and masonry + gaps

i d like to be able to hide height and width and use a custom property called radiussize to set the size of the control

13163945
width	height
there s no visible change to the height or width property when setting up the xaml for a given radius control and passing it a radiussize unfortunately

13163980
pthreads	epoll	recv	epoll
most particular platforms restrict the list of calls that can be interrupted to a smaller set than pthreads allows so you d have to look at the linux docs to be sure exactly what is and isn t eintr-safe but the epoll family of methods along with read recv write send and friends are almost certain to be unsafe

prepare	execute
this will prepare your statement and then loop through the data stored in data taking each of the values putting it into your prepare parameters and then execute the statement with the new parameters

13164110
width	height
its a bit hard to tell how you re setting width height on the circle but the obvious newbie error you have in your code is that you re doing stuff within the setter of a dependencyproperty

13164110
getter	setter
dp binding s are not accessed through the getter setter of your property

13164110
getter	setter
the binding system works behind the scenes so if you bind to a dp on your class the getter setter won t be called when the bindings are updated

13164113
width	height
as another poster pointed out you won t be able to set height and width using the property system

13164113
width	height
instead if what you want is to automatically set the height and width of the control you will want to define a callback for your radiussizeproperty dependencyproperty

13164113
width	height
something like this will set height and width for you when you set radiussize

13164121

i m trying to make a lightbox-like window which has a known-height titlebar and a content area of unknown height

13165525

titlebar	window
but i would like a titlebar and i would like the scrollbar to only appear in the content area of the window as in this image

put	get
don t get me wrong it s not a problem to use strcat to put the original string together but that s additional work

children	parent
doing it this way is great in many ways but it does not allow you to limit parent results based on conditions against it s children

13165709
superclass	subclassing
i solved this by the understanding that via polymorphism when returning a tostring method of a superclass java will look out yonder to the subclassing to see if there is a better verion of the tostring method...since my object was a subclassing object when i call the superclass tostring it sees the subclassing object and then looks to the subclassing to see if there is an identical method...in this case tostring and when it finds it it uses that medhod instead

if you re looking to implements some other pattern perhaps looking at the docs on java access modifiers should be your first stop

13166267
hide	show
i m veering towards the idea of having a developer create a new magento page template in which somehow there are instructions for a different configuration to be used as soon as the navigation state has changed but that seems like a pretty sizable project and i want to exercise the options of things that might be able to be put in the custom layout box where you can place references in the head of the category or in the cms block with which i m trying to show hardcoded content and hide dynamic

13166269
submit	submission
what i could have done on this circumstances is to use plugin like block ui or disable the form submit button the reason is you need to be interactive in your design you may well able to lock the form submission but its better to give a message or have a modal gray out

13166314
docx	xlsx
i open office files docx xlsx by using runtime.getruntime .exec string cmd function

13166367
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
recently when i had to upgrade 7gb database it took whole weekend on local server - the reason of such long process is that versioning 1.6 has new indexers and the database structure was rebuild - installation scripts which are meant to be fired upon first load of updated code are droping lot of foreign keys and creating new ones with lot of constraints

13166369

13166387
hide	show
i tried using jquery modal as well as jquery show hide as follows

13166398
getter	setter
usually you want setter getter to be public because that s what they are for giving access to data you don t want to give others direct access to because you don t want them to mess with your implementation dependent details - that s what encapsulation is about

13166398
getter	setter
however there might be some cases where you want to restrict access to your data just to instances of the same class but you still want to retain some control over the access to the data for whatever reason bookkeeping locking etc. - in that case having private or protected setter getter makes sense from both code reuse and safety pov

13166406
hash	md5
after squinting at this php i m pretty sure you need to do an md5 hash of your api signature

13166414

p.s im using cancan and devise

13166777
post	get
if you really really need a single identity for each user - one that cannot be circumvented or accidentally trodden on via multiple simultaneous requests etc - then your only solution is to require the user to explicitly identify themselves on their first request via a value embedded in the post or get query or a cookie created during a previous visit

13166779
youtube	vimeo
i ve used the youtube and vimeo javascript api s for controlling videos in the past

13166816
memcpy	strcpy
for instance strcpy is really just memcpy

13166846

13167434
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my assumption is that i will need to make a custom class which inherits uinavigationcontroller and implement certain methods but since uinavigationcontroller isnt seen i dont think viewdidload or viewwillappear are the right methods

13167435
width	height
above left drawing shows a browser window with the unscaled images the second is where the div covers about 60 of the window width with the images showing in equal height and regardless of the browser window width these percentages should remain unaltered as i tried to show in the third and fourth diagram

so avoiding further explanations see getter setter for an eventually better design an approach could be the following

13167766
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then get the uiviewcontroller by calling topviewcontroller on that uinavigationcontroller

13167768

rpc serializable and deserializes pojos every time and you have very limited ways to customize this serializable deserialization

13167797
multiplying	add
this allows you to determine if your ray line passes through a triangle at 6 multiplying add s per edge

13167797
multiplying	add
you will still need to compare your ray start and end points with the triangle plane at 4 multiplying add s per point to make sure it actually hits the triangle

13167797
multiplying	add
worst case runtime expense is 26 multiplying add s total

13167799

as owl files are rdf any rdf triplestore will do for storing them - though not every triple store will support owl reasoning but then again you might not even need that

13168005
redland	dotnetrdf	redland	jena	jena	dotnetrdf
some popular open source choices for rdf storage querying are openrdf sesame jena openlink virtuoso redland 4store and dotnetrdf

13168005
jena	dotnetrdf
it s probably worth pointing out that several of these sesame jena dotnetrdf are storage-neutral apis which means that several other open source commercial triplestores can be accessed via them

this is based on the facts that a value in the postorder traversal will always appear after its children have appeared and that a value in the inorder traversal will appear between its children values

13168153
put	get
and i made a function to return the right size for gridarr however i cant manage to declare it without having to put the array inside a class without getting an error and if gridarr is inside a class i have no clue how i should manage to get the new users edited values into arrx arry and arrz

13168177

width	height
however when i change the the image resource from the image used by the demo to one of my choosing the app crashes and says illegalargumentexception width and height must be 0

13168242
ienumerable	icollection
obviously it will if the underlying type is a collection but if you know it is you should use icollection instead of ienumerable to express this

13168285
width	height
this seems to have some thing to do with the width and height of the parent li element if i change the width and height to 1em instead of 0.5em then they get correctly placed

andreiy s query performs about the same as my simplified version aggregate-functions in outer select min max sum makes no measurable difference just two rows per group

13168977
put	get
i also need the score to update after every roll which is what i was trying to do in the comments but i m not sure if i would need to tryparse the wagertextbox.text to get a value and prevent format exceptions or if it would be fine without it or where i would put the tryparse

multiplying	addition
if you have an array of base 10 digits 1 you only need to implement base 10 addition with carry to be able to multiplying by 2 by adding the number to itself

13170432
multiplication	exponent
if you wish to support higher exponent you can also look into implementing exponentiation by squaring but that s harder since you ll need general multiplication not just by 2 for that

i believe there is something in the css file that is causing google-chrome and safari to create extra large mouse over areas on all the text links

13181112
yslow	pagespeed
yslow pagespeed and firebug are great tools you should definitely use but the fact that you re only seeing the issue in the development environment seems to imply it s not the site that s the problem but something with the development environment

disk	ram
generally i find most slowness in these cases is related to disk and or ram issues

13181142
super	implements
in mysecondviewcontroller do i need to only implements those methods that are different to myfirsttableviewcontroller maybe making a slight change and then calling the super version

13181574
hide	show
you can show or hide it you don t have to worry about where it is positioned it won t take focus away from the parent form and so on

to provide the test data in the quickest simplest way possible i wanted to implements a simple mock data set by extends the resultset interface

13181779

while you don t get the whole post you do still have to query the database for the id of post with mood grumpy so unless you have lots of post it s probably easier to just go with the answer dorel gave

13181781
folder	dir
on submit a batch process will run using gd on the whole dir chosen creating thumbs in a thumbs folder on the same server

13181807
implements	modifiers
to implements this the lone multiplicity modifiers for the assigned field in the person signature is sufficient

sudo	passwd
another option if your linux has the usermod command as root or via sudo you can explicitly set the encrypted passwd using the -p option

13181847

post	get
with you re going to be making get post delete type calls manually and processing the objects they return on your own

13182076
put	get	post	get	post	put
speaking very generally a restful web service will be a service with one endpoint for a data type that does different things with that data type based on http methods like get post put delete etc

13182076
post	get
so with a you can call a get to get the resource as a javascript object then alter it and send it back with a post or even delete it with delete

13182089
post	get
setting the assets.debug to false just seems to hide the get requests in the webrick log although i saw a post saying that solved the problem sic

13182089
passenger	webrick
assets are consistently and correctly served from a path whether run in passenger or webrick deployed or local

13182092
portrait	landscape
this almost works perfectly our image gallery viewcontroller does respond to both landscape modes - as it should - but it still initially opens in portrait - which is bad

13182092
portrait	landscape
we need it to open up right in landscape - and not ever be able to be displayed in portrait

13182100
waitpid	execvp	waitpid	fork	execvp	fork
the following helper function creates a process fork uses execvp to run the desired external process and then the parent uses waitpid to get the return code

so printf tries to interpret your double variable as an int type

13182119
width	margin
set your width to 23 and your margin to 1

13182119
width	margin
left margin 1 plus width 23 plus right margin 1 25

13182179
int	chars	int	double
so nevertheless a is float double int chars ..

13182179
int	chars
if a is chars because chars is a type of int so c will print value of chars in ascii

13182186
int	chars
you need a chars map of int to allow the inputs

13182239
box-sizing	border-box
use box-sizing border-box

13182276
atomic	interlocked
review all of the interlocked methods to see the various atomic operations available and to find those that suit your needs

13182280
qfiledialog	qdir
when you set the qdir system bit in the qfiledialog filter using qfiledialog setfilter qdir system you would expect that all the files in dev would show up but they do not

13182280
qfiledialog	qdir
this trick provides identical functionality to qfiledialog with the additional features provided by accessing the qdir object directly

13182358
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
everything works great in firefox - images are cached when loaded - but the images are not cached in google-chrome or safari for some reason

13182358
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
you can see that in firefox google-chrome and safari the images load into the document to the left of the slideshow but they don t cache

13182365
box-sizing	border-box
use box sizing as box-sizing border-box

13182388
getter	setter
this becomes really sloppy with a dependencyproperty because you re going to call your getter multiple times in your setter

13182423
appdynamics	metrics
with appdynamics it s easy to setup metrics that aggregate data from different nodes

13182452
inherited	properties
attributes are not inherited on overriden properties

13182502

13182591
uiview	subviews
try setting on your subviews of your uiview

13182604
typedef	struct
i guess there is something wrong with the struct type and the typedef of it in something.h but i can t figure out what.

13182654
folder	directory
it is easier to manage folder if the root directory has been changed compared to if i keep the full path

13182710
mef	prism
i agree with chrisf i think that prism or mef can resolve you problem

13182711
stdout	stderr
the dspmqver command should return something to stderr or stdout and the grep is filtering it out if it doesn t exactly match the search string

13182741
typedef	struct
in the header the function whereispoint is declare as returning a the typedef p but the definition returns a struct point not a pointer

13182753
typedef	struct
typedef a nameless struct to the type point

13182753
typedef	struct
in something.h you then typedef struct point an undefined struct type reference to p

13182775
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you can use these methods just about anywhere in your uiviewcontroller s .m file probably in viewdidload viewwillappear animated or initwithstyle style

13182798
hide	show
i get the idea of using the activate event ui or beforeactivate event ui to achieve this but i have no idea of how to iterate over the accordion panels in order to use something like slidedown in order to hide the unactive panels and their counterparts to show all the collapsed panels again in case the active panel is collapsed

13182854
int	chars
chars is assigned to 0 but words is left unintialized so it could contain any int value

13182889
for-loop	arrays
well 2-dimensional arrays is good solution but instead of using for-loop you can use predicates to add objects in lowand

13182931
width	height
if you have a width and height specified or inherited on the container element the map will take it

13182931
width	height
the code you posted show nothing about the actual width and height of prdmap

13182931
width	height
there could be css styles regarding width and height defined for the id prdmap the class map or for a under class span12 etc.

13182931
width	height
also try defining an explicit width and height inline if possible

13182942

13183145
super	self
shortcut for super type self self

13183145
super	self
every example i ve seen of using super in python 2.x looks like this super classname self

google-chrome	firefox
the correct encoding for em-dash is supposedly however when the semi-colon is left off it still displays correctly in my browers google-chrome and firefox

13183203
ssms	sqlcmd
i m running this from ssms 2008r2 with sqlcmd mode enabled

13183214
portrait	landscape

13183322
put	get
now we have a pretty decently sized database of candidates we ve previously worked with and i used oracle text to make the attached resumes searchable which works out great the only issue is that we often send the same candidate to multiple jobs in order to put them to work faster which means i may get the same candidate s resume turning up 6 or 7 times in the search results i m looking to have it filter out duplicates based on candidate s name and recruiter name since i don t want to only filter out candidate names since some people have the same name but usually 1 recruiter works with 1 candidate i know it s not perfect but could help to narrow things down

13183323
width	height
i m developing a website with a big slider that uses 100 width and height slides

13183346
put	get
so i had to put this down and get back to another project but one of my colleagues has managed to find a solution

13183420
serializable	deserialization
you need to first test the serializable deserialization in the same application

13183424
rar	zip
so just read the 10 first bytes of a file and you can tell if it is zip or rar archive

13183434
stdout	stderr
per geoff_montee s advice there was a bug in my redirect of stderr but this was not responsible for the problem as execvp does not store the return value in stderr or even stdout but rather in the kernel object associated with the parent process the zombie record

13183446
uiview	uiwindow
the uiwindow is just a uiview subclass so there s no nice shouldrotate delegate method

13183484

they have a whole api for dealing with get and post requests

13183496

hide	show
after initialization of the layout you can use your own hide and show methods

13183509
folder	directory
your projects might be in the same eclipse workspace but not necessarily under the same folder so keep in mind the following directory structure assumes you are free to move them around

13183539
post	get
when i try to ajax post to that url in order to validate the user input and login i get this error

13183563
lzo	snappy
if you have cpu to spare use compression start with lzo or snappy but if you still have more cpu to burn consider gzip or even stronger stuff

13183563
spaces	delimiter
you can really become disk bound and disk spaces bound so i ve found it helpful to change the path to be a comma delimiter list of directories one for each drive

13183563
disk	ram
emr s one advantage is that you tend to get massive amounts of ram per node so you should spend some time making sure you use your ram optimally to minimize disk i o

13183563
disk	ram
there s a massive distributed sort going on for all the data you produce in each job and hadoop tries by default to do it while leaving the bulk of the ram and disk space available for your tasks

getter	setter
i created my own entity class and made zfcuser working with it to be more specific i added some protected variables getter and setter methods

13183640
prepare	execute

13183693
implements	extends
i implements it in a class which extends jpanel

13183724
post	get
unfortunately any pictures included in the post do not get exported

13183737

the problem for me is that the answers to those post often give long complicated code on creating the bcrtpt - but then no example as to how to put it use ie to respond to the first answer --

13183747
daemons	systemd
perhaps when run from a daemons the systemd command is using a different shell than the one used when you are running as yourself

13183785
postgresql	mysql
i have a great hosting provider webfaction with access to all sorts of frameworks like drupal django rails node etc. as well as mysql and postgresql servers so the language and back-end aren t that important although .net is out

13183795
hide	show
i have two functions in jquery to hide and then show a header and also swap the buttons out so that when the header is hidden the show header button appears and vice versa

13183803

hash	salt
being a newbie take it with a pinch of salt oh and a hash if you will...

13183965
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
when you hash with blowfish crypt you need a salt a strength and a password

13183965
crypt	salt
you combine the salt and strength as the specs requires you to and you create a crypt compatible salt

13183965
crypt	salt
this salt is translated by crypt and the sale and strength is extracted plus the hashing algorithm based on character 2 and 3

13183965
hash	salt
you don t store the salt you used to hash the password as you will defeat the purpose

13184101
put	get	post	get	post	put
the request object will be nil inside your test case until you make an http request using one of the methods get post delete put etc

13184118

children	parent
keep in mind this assumes all your text fields are children of the same parent and is in the scope of that parent so on a frame in the timeline that holds all your text fields

13184815
post	get
this does not matter because you can easily get the number of post in the thread from the size of the recordset you get back from the query and you can easily number the post in the html output separately from the actual post numbers

13184858
children	parent
it seems it all the children and parent elements and their children and parent and so on are analysed in this moment and this raises the recursion error

13184860

13184986
width	height
the problem also seemed to be that since the data was not appended before the .css call the modal would not have any substantial width height

13185040
width	height
the only caveat is that this requires you to define margin-top margin-bottom padding-top and padding-bottom on other elements since margins and paddings will be added on top of the height which is not what you normally want when defining height or width for that matter in

13185043
width	height

13185493
versioning	upgrade
if you have versioning 10 and need to upgrade to versioning 15 the same method should be applied

13185493

maven	pom.xml
if you don t specify the plugin versions in your pom.xml files maven will use the latest release of each used plugin

for instance i have a combobox and when a selection is changed i would like the selectedindexchanged event to be called before the textchanged event is called

13185948
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
my honest opinion is that it is pretty stupid to call the textchanged event before the selectedindexchanged event because it prevents me from knowing if the textchanged event was called because a new item was selected

13186015
width	height
if the change in the map s position is less than both the width and height of the map the transition will be smoothly animated

mergesort	timsort	quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	timsort
algorithms like timsort quicksort mergesort dominate the real world sorting methods ruby python and many implementations of stl sort are all instances of the perennial algorithm

13186150

you can keep the common properties in a common class and inherited those 2 view models from that common class

13186663
margin	text-align
you also need to remember that text-align works from container-to-content this means it is normally applied to a container to affect its content applied to a p to affect its inline content such as the text within and margin 0 auto works from content-to-container meaning that it s normally applied to a block element and affects its position related to its container applied to a div to center it to its parent

13186694
min	max
you can also speed things up by setting the max and most importantly the min size for detectmultiscale

13186748

obviously a fix is to return a list of adminrole in my datacenter implemetation but i thought by extending the abstract-class i could pass the subclass

13186816

13186938
free	realloc
note that realloc can fail in which case a still exists and must later be free

13186938

by defining routes with get put etc

13187048
put	get	post	get	post	put

fast-forward	merge
there is no merge unless you are counting a fast-forward merge which is really just a reference update

i also took my ad-hoc signed ipa and used xcode organizer to install it on my device and it runs just fine so there is no problem with the ipa other than the testflight desktop app cannot find the dsym in it

13209524
dsym	ipa
i unpacked the ipa and it does seem that the dsym is missing

13209524
dsym	ipa
i extracted the dsym from the xcarchive and attempted to upload it with my ipa to testflight

apache	nginx
i would however recommend you to use either apache with mod_mono or nginx with fastcgi since these are the most used combinations of running asp.net based web applications with mono

13209588
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
if you stick with asp.net web forms you could use a gridview a listview a repeater etc

13209588
gridview	repeater
it combines many of the best features of the gridview and the repeater

13209588
listview	gridview
here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview

webkit google-chrome safari does not support transitions on pseudo elements

13209776
getter	setter
if you re building a data object whose sole purpose is to have fields to get and set then getter and setter are a good idea

13209776
getter	setter
in most if not all other cases though getter and setter are a bad idea

13209776
getter	setter
the problem is that outside of those aforementioned data objects getter and setter break encapsulation almost as badly as exposing the underlying variables themselves directly

13209776
getter	setter
exposing a member variable at all whether via a getter setter or just by making the field public should only be considered if that field is data

13209832

then check is there is any buggy code in your viewcontroller s viewdidload viewwillappear or in viewdidappear methods

13210481
width	height
the problem is that the width needs to be known before the height can be calculated

13210481
width	height
that width is then taken and the height is calculated

13210481
width	height
if the actual frame rectangle width was discovered to be different than the stored width after layout then i knew that height needed calculated and another layout needed to be executed in the event that the width change caused a height change

while setting up streaming on the server you can specify the type of stream whether it be over http udp rtp or video on demand via rtsp

13211171
google-chrome	firefox
i want to make a new extension for firefox my idea is to use javascript i already made the thing for google-chrome

gunicorn	uwsgi
first gunicorn and uwsgi are both appservers

getter	setter
nsuserdefaults updates its data periodically only not each and every time a setter or getter is called

13211285

then you use normal dom functions not copy paste functions to get the data from a field or to put the data into a field

13211653
unsigned	short
when using batched particles this is also the highest amount of particles which can be used because the gl draw function uses an unsigned short value which is reached with 16450 particles

13211658
children	parent
one way to fix that would be to have the parent fork again and have the original pid do nothing except wait 2 in a loop until all children have finished

13211855
switching	screens
admittedly the routine to switching between screens was no yet

13211868
width	height
alternatively if you really want to use display none then give #items .item or your outer a a set width and height and place the hover on that element

13211868
width	height
if you want the correct width and height you can use javascript jquery to get the width height of a visible .info hide .info and then set the height width of #items to those values gotten from .info

13211869
slideup	slidedown
it makes use of jquery s slideup and slidedown functions

13213087
button	checkbox
however as you can see the checkbox and the text are upper than the send button

13213087
button	checkbox
the demo is here not aligned checkbox with send button

13213107
rss	feed
the feed are designed for use by rss readers and not for consumption by scripts

13213113
atomic	compare-and-swap
it turns out that the atomic load is implemented as a compare-and-swap loop which i suspect is not the fastest possible implementation

13213113
atomic	compare-and-swap
background i believe that msvc++ 2012 is doing a compare-and-swap loop on atomic load of a pointer based on this test program

13213113
atomic	compare-and-swap	int	chars
the instruction lock cmpxchg is atomic compare-and-swap and we see here that the code for atomically loading a chars an int or an is a compare-and-swap loop

13213114
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
because they throw console warnings in firefox safari google-chrome due

if i put it as the first line in my auth controller action i get wsod

13213159
google-chrome	firefox
when i view my page source in google-chrome firefox i get the following source

13213167
textview	imageview
i have an imageview named imageview1 and a textview to debug named textview1 in which i display the id which one is good when checking in r.java...

13213175
post	get
to get the public post of a page you should be using its corresponding connection which is the feed connection with any valid access_token

13213178
udp	tcp
enotconn is an error that should terminate use of socket if you were udp there would be a case to continue to keep the fd open but not with tcp the socket will never recover is you see that

13213197
children	parent
i would use the last-child pseudo-selector but the number of children can vary so i want it to remove the border-bottom of the last-child only if the parent div is being overflown

13213229
int	boolean
because you have to check the return value of strpos as it could be zero because it s at index zero and zero evaluates to false that s why it wouldn t enter your if block so check that the return value it s false and type boolean not just int zero like this

13213251
pull	push
so at work you can copy or clone whole repo to usb pull new changes from it at home and after your home working is done push it to repo on flash then pull it to repo at work i use even temporary commits for undone work which i revert to working directory and strip so i can continue where i ended

13213252
folder	directory
magento is located in a folder on the server named magento one directory down as in

13213260
hash	md5
the method to do an md5 hash in php is

13213260
hash	md5
please note that md5 is a one way hash so you cannot decrypt it afterwords.

13213284
getter	setter
i have a hunch that java is all about being private and using getter and setter but i m not sure

13213321
getter	setter
i would expose the via accessors getter setter

13213327
google-chrome	firefox
however using google-chrome or firefox the data will also get inserted to the database and linq code will be executed successfully but a message box with an empty string error and a 0 xhr status will be displayed

13213349
rss	feed
it is not so bad rendering rss feed from an index.php page i have seen a lot of examples of it

13213372
subtract	add
in other words you are subtract the 3 characters from the string value of the array but add the 1 because there is no comma character for the first array element

13213372
addition	multiplication
edit for php you would probably use the array_slice function instead of new string test with the multiplication and addition constants adjusted as necessary

13213375
getter	setter
if you would like in the future when you will change something to the internals of the channel class other code that is using channel api to still work without modifications then you will use getter and setter and use private fields

13213387
getter	setter
don t just provide getter and setter

13213394
post	get
at the begin of the form there is usually some code that decides if the form was called with post after pressing a button or if it was called with get

13213472
width	height
i want the table not to grow past the bounds of the div neither width nor height but take up the maximum area while keeping each table cell the same height and width as all other table cells

13213472
width	height
basically all table cells need to be forced to an exact square same width height but that size could grow or shrink depending on how big the display size is

13213493
put	get
i thought that get is a natural choice but i have to put the serialized xml in the body of the request which works but feels incorrect

13213518
jms	jta
i m not very experienced with java and don t have a great deal of knowledge about xa jta or jms

13213529
powerpc	i386
since it sounds like you want to do things the hard way here is an example of how to build a fat static library for i386 and powerpc architectures

13213529
powerpc	i386
this was done on a powerpc os x box you will have to adjust if you want to compile for arm and i386

13213534
cos	sin
after you rotate the cylinder around the z axis by angle alpha the top is at 2f sin alpha cos alpha 0

13213534
cos	sin
if you now rotate the cylinder by angle beta around the x axis the top goes to 2f sin alpha cos alpha cos beta cos alpha sin beta

13213537

13213547
mouse	keyboard
the moment you touch the keyboard or mouse or touchscreen

13213581
min	max
this code might be strange for generating random characters i just looked ascii table and searched for numbers letters and i ve put them into random min and max number

13213605
cdr	cons
i m doing a homework assignment in which i have to program a few very basic functions using some primitives operations such as car cdr cons append reverse atom eq equal and null

13213617
button	checkbox
the trouble starts i m afraid with the label text size being not 100 of the checkbox element and probably also with the border padding and font size in the button element - you might be in for some longer tweaking especially if you want it to scale sensibly on zooming

13213631
phpstorm	rubymine	phpstorm	webstorm
edit i d just like to note that this feature request is for the rubymine ide also by jetbrains it s not for phpstorm webstorm

13213675
int	boolean
the test table i created contains an int field called id and a boolean field called controlled same as yours but spelled with 2 ls

13213707
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome stores the history in a sqlite database and i belive so does firefox

13213830
width	height
i tried putting a 100 width and height div over the top of the frame and setting it to .01 opacity but this disallowed users to close ads on the video which is an undesirable effect

13213832
matplotlib	scipy
besides in comparison to numpy scipy the docs of matplotlib seem inscrutable to me for some reason thus if somebody could comment on how to_rgba and figimage exactly work i d be grateful too

13213857
implements	extends
i personally would think about implements my own filter that would extends abstractauthenticationprocessingfilter

13213863
switching	airplane
enable and disable airplane mode my first idea but when i switching to airplane mode and switching back to normal the phone will ask me to enter my pin code.

13213874
typedef	typename
i have experimented with placing the extern c at both ends and between typedef and typename and between type and func_ptr_type but the compiler rejected all

13213926
opengl-es	glreadpixels
if you need to read something back from opengl-es - just use glreadpixels and proceed with these video encoding libraries

13213951
min	max
basically i want to plot it in a tool like matlab or pyplot but knowing that each pixel can t represent the potentially many hundreds of points that map to it i d like to see both the min and the max of all the array entries that map to a pixel so that i can generally understand what s going on

13213970
off-by-one	equivalent
an off-by-one oboe is a logic error involving the discrete equivalent of a boundary condition

13213992

13213995
int	chars	int	double
i m quite newbie in c and now i m trying to implement basic generic linked list with 3 elements each element will contain a different datatype value â int chars and double

13213995
int	chars
why don t i get the same error in case of int or chars

13214000
fadein	fadeout
for example the fadein fadeout functions have an oncomplete callback for when the element has totally been shown hidden -

13214046
int	chars
in your working examples you re calling malloc to get a pointer to some newly-allocated space and then immediately throwing that pointer away and replacing the pointer value with your int or chars value

13214046
int	chars
that works more or less by accident because in most c implementations a pointer cell can hold an int or chars value though you should be getting warnings

13214046
int	chars	int	double
however if you re only storing basic types like int chars and double you don t need to go through a pointer and worry about the attendant memory management

13214048
switching	screens
lot of times full screens switching seems to want to enable vertical sync on monitors and since present can t be threaded the more screens with vertical sync the higher drop you will have since you will wait between 0 and 16 milliseconds for each present call

13214062
width	height
i believe this is only thing that you can do is in layout use relative width height weight and images formatted in ninepath

13214073
int	chars	int	double
so you can t by inspecting an instance of your linked list determine whether it is a chars an int or a double

13214075
int	chars
you are casting the pointer but you need to derefernce it for the assignment the assignment worked for the first two since the int and chars were casted to pointers it should be

13214085
disk	ram
not sure what s more important lots of ram and cpu or a fast disk ebs iops etc

13214137
infobox	infowindow
i tryed infobox witch seem to be the most maleable alternative of the standard infowindow witch cant be styled as i want

portrait	landscape
my ideal scenario - the linked background image + navbar combo or something similar that works well on all popular mobile devices in both portrait and landscape mode

13214276
crypt	md5
i just found out the exact opposite in ubuntu 12.04 and newer it defaults to md5 and you have to use the -d flag to get it to use crypt

13214279
nunit	typemock
i have been trying to find a way to create and run ad-hoc tests with nunit and typemock in linqpad for a while

13214279
nunit	typemock
create a new query in linqpad add reference to nunit and typemock assemblies

13214279
nunit	typemock
at this point i am able to get nunit and typemock to work with some manual step need to copy nunit and typemock dlls to the executing directory appdata local temp 1 linqpad skbidgcw

13214279
nunit	typemock
as a side note i also tried using nunitlite while it runs nunit tests beautifully i can t find a way to make it work with typemock it throws error saying typemock isolator needs to be linked with coverage tool to run

13214287
rtsp	rtmp
i have a rtsp streaming on ip cameras.i need to publish this cams on the web page.i tried with jwplayer but i think jwplayer just supports rtmp not rtsp

13214308
width	height
the width and height of map can change

13214319
yslow	pagespeed
in your particular case my suggestion is use a tool such as yslow or pagespeed to determine how big is the impact of the 404 responses

13214361
width	height
it presumes you know exact width height of the elements

13214490
submit	submission
i want to trigger a function when the submit button is pressed on the form and wait for the javascript function to complete then continue the form submission

13214492
mouseleave	mouseenter
you probably should nt rebind the mouseleave function everytime you mouseenter the element as that will cause the event to be bound multiple times

13214506
for-loop	loops
i m needing to check for equality in a for-loop in c++ however loops needs to work for x equaling multiple possibilities

13214510
mouseout	mouseenter
use the hover method in jquery first function is mouseenter second function is mouseout

13214589
jtable	jtextpane
i figured i ll create a jtable without any rows and place a jtextpane right underneath

13214679
punctuation	words
but this assumes the words are separated by a space and doesn t account for punctuation

13214707
intersect	contains
i am trying to intersect each element in a list contains with one another

13214730
qtimer	qobject
i have a subclass of qobject referred to as myobject which has a qtimer data member allocated on the heap in the constructor

13214737
maya	blender
since you looked at panda3d - if you can convert your model to the egg format which blender maya may do then you could be able to import it

13214764
.htaccess	httpd.conf
another option is not to change server api but .htaccess or httpd.conf

13214810
width	height
because btn_quit has no width or height and therefore you can never be inside it s bounds

13214816
min	max
well that will certainly happen if your max text box has a number smaller than or equal to your min text box

13214818
ubuntu	linux
i wish to share the software with rest of linux ubuntu users

13214851
post	get
any way i ve tried to do it in the posts_controller since in theory i should be able to edit that attribute when the post page is loaded i get an

13214919
jar	war
i realize i can t save an image to the . data folder within a war jar file while it s in use but how do i save them in the jar anyway

13214932
setinterval	settimeout
you need to use something like settimeout setinterval worker

13215054
put	get
i was able to get around this earlier by recalling the stream definition again after a new keyword is added but i have multiple streams searching and i put them in separate threads so they can all run simultaneously

13215055
for-loop	loops
it is not re-computed each time through loops - a for-loop is for iterating from a starting value to an ending value

13215089
hide	show
using zurb s show on and hide on options it s very easy to do

13215094
min	max
for example min and max length

13215100
udp	tcp
it also recomputes the tcp and udp checksums

13215100
puts	gets
the client gets the ip datagram puts it

13215100
tunnel	packets
create a new tunnel with itself then dump the packets raw into the tunnel and route appropriately

13215100
tunnel	vpn
this seems to be the same case with vpn tunnel

13215103
getter	setter
the property must have both a public setter and getter since the update is two-way

13215120
debian	linux
i have debian linux server that i use for a variety of things

13215133
typedef	struct
when possible use typedef to define pointers to struct

13215135
debian	linux
i am using debian linux

13215200
hide	show
but when i try to show the hidden files and hide the show files i m out of luck with

13215257
jquery	touchswipe
i searched for jquery swipe events and found touchswipe

13215291
put	get
more specifically the concurrenthashmap only guarantees that the link between a key and its associated value is handled taking multiple threads into account - ie put and get are atomic

13215355
button	checkbox
don t use checkbox use radio button and give them all the same name

13215369
int	boolean
return a boolean true valid int or a value that s out of range perhaps -1 depending on your program

13215376
button	checkbox
if you only want one to be checked at a time then radio button would seem a better choice although if you want one or zero at a time then checkbox are fine

13215415
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to really handle the exception-handling in the switch statement you need to expand the scope of the try-catch block

13215422
entity-relationship	diagram
the same ambiguity exists with regard to entity-relationship diagram

13215422
entity-relationship	diagram
some people including myself use entity-relationship models and entity-relationship diagram only to represent the data requirements inherent in the problem itself

13215422
entity-relationship	diagram
but there are plenty of other people perhaps a majority who use entity-relationship diagram to pictorialize the design of a schema of tables

13215438
spaces	delimiter
i ve also played around with the placement of the delimiter having no spaces between end and having one spaces and trying it on a different line

13215487
put	get
or to get pma to execute it properly you may have to put it in a file and send it

13215518
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full --track-origins yes --undef-value-errors yes --read-var-info yes --num-callers 50

13215543
children	parent
in this case a parent element s children

13215572
asterisk	pbx
i think best option is get some virtual pbx asterisk based and setup your spa to that pbx

13215580
cpython	ironpython
it s said that scipy packages make use of cpython s stack frame inspection capabilities and by default these are not enabled in ironpython so we have to use

13215580
put	get
but in the visual studio i always get the error assertion failed i put the link of the images in below which forces vs to be closed

13215588
public	protected
your class b shall protected private inherited from a instead of public inherite

13215728
width	height
i want to extend this to work with rectangles for example a user gives an x and a y coordinate a width and a height i then want to be able to do a range query and nearest neighbour searches on this structure

13215807
addition	multiplication
use multiplication instead of addition

13215814
submit	submission
at the bottom of the submit callback prevents the form from submission

13215878
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
i m using bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream

13215955
free	malloc
when you are done instead of using the expression you use operator delete if you used operator new or you use free if you used malloc

13215961
jeditorpane	jfilechooser
the user uses a jfilechooser to find the absolute path of an image on their computer and then that absolute path is embedded into an html tag which is then set in a jeditorpane

13215979
draggable	droppable
in my script i m experimenting with jquery draggable droppable see here

13215979
draggable	droppable
i m trying to grab the data to eventually put in a database from each draggable element that s dropped into the droppable div

13216019
inherited	properties
i would create a view model that inherited the model overrides the properties must be virtual and adds the remoteattribute

13216075
button	checkbox
i need to set a radio button no_subscribe to true when all the elements checkbox are unchecked

13216113
addclass	removeclass
first i don t believe you can cross-fade background images using addclass and removeclass because you can t logistically fade an element in and out at the same time

13216113
fadein	fadeout
you will see that the fadeout runs first then the new class is added then the fadein is run and the first class is removed

13216113
fadein	fadeout
you can t run the fadeout and fadein which would create the cross-fade you re looking for at the same time because if you remove the first class before the fadeout is finished it interrupts the animation

13216137
wav	flac
that being said if you get a wav file you can losslessly compress that to flac and cut 30-50 of the file size down

13216137
mp3	flac
don t convert lossy compressed files such as mp3 to flac as you will actually be making the file bigger.

13216174
g++	gcc
i am also making sure that i use gcc and g++ version 4.4 as 4.7 there is some problem with cuda

put	get	viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve put this in a few different places viewdidload viewwillappear and can t get it to work

13216259
width	height
best way to solve your problem is to manually scale the image to a width of 220px or to set in your image tag remove the height in this case

13216271
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

13216314
int	chars
i solved my problem by using chars and int instead of chars and int respectively

13216318
memset	calloc
you can also use memset or calloc but this one is the simplest

13216330
put	get
the compiler does a bunch of additional checks and implicit casts to make sure you don t put the wrong type of value in or get the wrong type out but at runtime there is only one hashmap class and it stores objects

13216333
oncreate	findviewbyid
i would make a wild guess and say your oncreate is using findviewbyid to get specific ui element which is not present in the layout and you re trying to use that element without checking if it was found

13216343
int	chars
use the chars and int wrapper classes instead

13216381
macports	homebrew
i recommend using a third-party package manager for os x like homebrew or macports

13216381
macports	homebrew
i don t know about homebrew but i know from personal experience that it is very simple to do with macports

13216400
put	get	post	get	post	put
since every time we load the server page it always do the _post function so if the we post a null value therefore it would result a null also.to get the value that we ve posted a while ago form the search field we will put the value to the session

13216411
width	height
what s happening is the mobile theme is restricting the image width to 100 of the screen width but not adjusting the height accordingly

13216492
folder	directory
the only thing i want to do is that when the software is published and installed and the said files are in the resources folder so it would make them an embedded resource the csv and template files would be copied to a directory folder that my program would use

13216569
for-loop	loops
in the rare cases where the single evaluation behavior is undesirable it is easy to replace the for-loop with a generic loops using while end or repeat until

13216622
width	height
generally all jquery scrollbars calculate height width of the container on which it is applied to put scrollbars on them

13216622
width	height
when you do hide in jquery it does a display none the element is not rendered at all and thus no height width of its own

13216654
hide	show
i have a asp checkbox and a asp textbox on my aspx page i want to know show the textbox when the checkbox is checked and hide it if the checkbox is unckecked using javascript i really apprecieatee anyone who could help me

13216795
post	get
but for the life of me i can t get anything to look good in the actual .ajax post

13216798
mouse	keyboard
you d have to handle keyboard events mouse events and be able to identify your caret position within the textarea - all in a cross-browser friendly way

13216840
crypt	salt
you could also do more research on the topic and write some code to generate your own bcrypt blowfish compatible salt and use crypt directly rather than using the phpass library

13216858
hash	salt
note that in this example above the salt is automatically generated when the password is first hash

13216859

i would suggest storing the names from the file into a trie or dawg better space efficiency

13217387
intersect	contains
first we find the closest clustering center to the hypersphere s center point p.then we iteratively for every midperpendicular a hyperplane of each pair of centers with one of the two is the above one we compute the euclidean distance between the point p and the midperpendicular.if the distance is smaller than the hypersphere s radius it infers the hypersphere intersect with the midperpendicular.so this interior node may contains data points which may be not belong to the above clustering center the iteration breaks.if the iteration ends without break we can say it is ok to put all the data points contains in this node to the above clustering center in a blow without doubt

13217433
nstimer	catransition
i ve never worked with catransition before but i think you can do this with nstimer gcd or performselector withobject afterdelay

13217456

i have recently learned about setter and getter

13217456
getter	setter
i can use the setter and getter methods without the loop but i am not sure how to use them inside the loop

first you set the width of your label to your horizontalconstraint then you call that will adjust the height of the label to fit it s content but leave the width as you set it almost - that means it might become a little narrower

13218088
junit	mockito
i would write unit tests with junit and mockito

13218353
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller that is embedded in a uinavigationcontroller

13218365
uiview	subviews
if you re looking to combine multiple controls into a single unit the simplest thing to do is just to add them as subviews of a single uiview

13218380
hide	show
my current approach is to control the application from a separate class containing the main method which is supposed to store the settings and handle the showing hiding of the two jframes but i run into some problems i want the listener for the start -button in the settings frame to signal to the main method that it is time to store the chosen settings hide this frame and show the gol-frame

13218381
uiview	subviews
each page inside the scroll-view is a uiview obviously that can be composed out of other subviews etc

13218385
bash	tcsh
date stamping files is as easy as date in a simple tcsh or bash script

13218407
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven and got actionbarsherlock as a dependency in the test project s pom.xml

13218413
int	double
the different numeric representations will still match if you do a find on a number that can be represented in multiple formats a 32-bit int can also be represented as a double or int64

13218430
disk	ram
couchbase already tries to serve results out of ram cache before checking disk and is fully distributed to support large data sets

13218480
int	chars
the select-statement is being interpreted by the server and so it is recognized that there is the need of converting data from chars to int

13218480
int	chars
and an empty chars as you provide will be converted into 0 because of default value for int

13218486

13218599
portrait	landscape
my app supports two groups of viewcontrollers those that are supposed to work in portrait and those who are supposed to work in landscape

13218599
portrait	landscape
presenting viewcontrollers of different orientations from each other results in wrong orientations so someone suggested me to create a viewcontroller containment master viewcontroller making that shoulautorotate yes to all orientations and add two branches of viewcontrollers from that one for portrait with shouldautorotate yes for portrait and one for landscape with shouldautorotate yes for landscape

13218600
g++	gcc
i suppose i should also inquire what version of gcc g++ you are using and what version of osx.

13218600
g++	gcc
linking with gcc g++ you can compile file.c to file.o via gcc -c and then subsequently link file.o into an executable via ld

13218600
g++	gcc
it s possible you are using a newer older gcc g++ compiler under osx and your problems stem from improvements to the compiler

13218600
g++	gcc
overloading functions gcc g++ often determine c vs c++ compilation based on the filename suffix

13218600
g++	gcc
so gcc file.c and g++ file.c would both work regardless of whether the file is named file.c or file.c

13218619
implements	extends
this is usually a poor design as it would be better to put the different bits of logic into different classes that may potentially extends the same superclass or better implements the same interface

13218646
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
it works on linux distribs arch mint ubuntu ... but now i m trying it in windows32 visual studio 9 2008 and i get this message during generation

post	get
so for usability sake and keeping the server neat so i m not always guessing which script does what i want to mix post and get

13218877
client-side	server-side
the problem is that you re mixing up client-side code and server-side code

13218877
client-side	server-side
the javascript is run client-side but only after all the server-side code has been completed

13218906
setinterval	settimeout
i recommend using setinterval above settimeout in your case since you want to have the function executed repeatedly

13219012
post	put
if i missed to post any other information please tell me and i will put it online

13219018
hide	show
every time a page is show some javascript must be executed to hide show some elements depending on the session state

13219243
free	malloc
never use malloc free in c++

13219250
width	height
providing height and width to open

13219265
put	get
i think you re almost there but to get the late evaluation you want you need to put file_path in as a variable you want to patch and then use the lambda to delay binding

13219307
clang	llvm
note this is how clang and llvm deal with c compatibility for example

13219341
width	height
as sushil pointed out if the new window has to look like a regular popup set width and height to it

13219349
width	height
if you set the width and height attributes of your imageview to specific values the system will automatically scale you images to fit

13219373

put	get
i know i could put the script in to the main page s footer or something but i was hoping i could get around this as i will end up with a ton of scripts in the main page

13219516
typedef	struct
before typedef was introduced into c in order to use the above struct as a type you would have had to do something like the following

13219516
typedef	struct
in c++ struct and classes are similar constructs which create new types so the typedef is not as useful for those types of variables

13219516
unsigned	short
for instance if you have a color value variable that fits in an unsigned short if you use a typedef to create a new type for color value and use it consistently then it is much easier to recognize that a variable contains a color value and not some other kind of an unsigned short

13219516
unsigned	short
and then later you find that you need to change it from an unsigned char to an unsigned short there would be a single place to make the change and if your use of the type was reasonably strict that would be the only place you need to make a change

13219566
put	get
in first line i put the variable to the session.in my mail.aspx file i get this variable.in other lines i get the result view of my mail.aspx and put it to my div

13220102
width	font-size
if we set font-size of these two pseudo elements to 6 pixels thin space should always approximate to 1 pixel width regardless of dimension discrepancies

if you want to read from position x then you can use fread up to the x-1 and then reuse fread or fgets or fgetc to read from the position x

13220227
width	height
okay so the easiest way of doing dynamic widths is just to provide a percentage value for width or and height

13220227
width	height
so the key part is either leaving out the width and height properties of off the svg element or

13220229

13220472
calloc	malloc
so you should calloc the memory not malloc

13220475
int	chars
since the chars datatype is just int this shouldn t be a problem and also i think you could do

13220489
children	parent
as i understand it the strict warning appears to warn the programmer that there s a possibility someone could read the signature of the parent class and assume it s children behaves the same way

13220521
int	chars
what you are doing here is iterating over each of the chars in the string converting them to a stream of int then making that stream into an array

13220523
width	height
2- get the bitmap width height and then find the mathmatical relation ratio between bitmap width and imageview width

pop-up	dialog
it calls a custom uiview class customuiview.m to display the definition this is the dialog box that pop-up

13220817

the problem is that this new customuiview doesn t have access to the hash map which contains all my dictionary s terms and definitions

13220828

i tried the combobox s keyup and keydown methods to catch the key pressed and setting the selecteditem to an item i want and the to null this brings the item into view and does not make it selected

13220828
keydown	keyup
the problem is that after i set the selecteditem after the first key is pressed neither keyup no keydown are called again

13220831
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works fine but not in ie tested in ie9

13220854
button	checkbox
it is not a trivial piece of code though because of the variety of input tags and field types each of which may need specific handling textareas checkbox radio button selects ... so i thought i d first search ask in case it already exists

13220861
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ gives you a c++11 library whereas libstdc++ which is also the default in xcode 4.5 gives you a c++03 library with tr1 support

13220873
versioning	upgrade
but ideally upgrade to a more recent versioning

postgresql	mysql
i just installed all common packages like mysql postgresql curl etc didn t make any other changes but i have a problem

13220927

i received a md5 hash and a regular expression which have the same plaintext.

13220980
int	double
furthermore it looks like the parsing doesn t really work as when i place the point above a non-c primitive type not int double float etc instead of printing the type s definition in the modeline an error message like

13220981
folder	directory
if you add a . for the current directory to the sys.path search folder list then the os.chdir will become effective and the import lib.libcode should start working

13220994
hash	md5
you cant crack the md5 hash value it has used one way hashing algorithm

13221007
getter	setter
the grid submits all the form fields to the action mentioned in href so you must be having a getter setter for every form field on that action

13221033
hide	show
however if a user clicks on it again to hide it then clicks to show again the spinner doesn t appear because the content isn t being reset obviously

13221033
hide	show
however this time nothing works the div doesn t show or hide and the ajax isn t called

13221038
google-chrome	safari
it works as expected on the desktop browsers i ve tested and also in mobile safari and google-chrome on ios

13221038
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
just to note it works fine in firefox and dolphin on the nexus 7 just not google-chrome or opera where the same issue occurs

13221043
min	max
every variation seems to pass only the first min parameter and not the second max

13221049
width	margin
also do remember when you set the width to 100 for any element then it will take the full width of its parent element now adding some margin or padding to this element exceeds the full width of parent and may break the ui

13221049
width	margin
i.e margin 10px +width 100 width of parent element

13221053
viewdidload	viewwillappear
yet when i do so similarly to what i successfully do with a tableview just the viewdidload callback gets called but not the viewwillappear and in general it seems nothing happens like the view were not shown

13221080
google-chrome	safari
i ve optimized the site for google-chrome mozilla safari and ie9+

13221096
width	height
however when i wanted to resize it i have used createscaledbitmap bitmap width height boolean

13221096
width	height
i have changed the boolean value as true in the method createscaledbitmap bitmap width height boolean then it was working well with a bad quality of the picture

13221112
serializable	deserialization
if the enum singleton is stateful the state is lost during serializable deserialization

13221148
getter	setter
later you can set this array inside sharedpreference or can create setter getter to store this array and can retrieve the array for info inputted by user wherever you want

13221158
int	chars
regarding casting int to chars they say that the following are perfectly legal but you get a loss of precision which i can totally understand

13221168
implements	extends
the state class presents a node in the fsm we thought to implements it with state design pattern every node will extends from the abstract class state and every class would handle different types of events and indicate transitions to a new state

13221177
ssl	https
â if this is an https secure address click tools click internet options click advanced and check to be sure the ssl and tls protocols are enabled under the security section

i currently support keyboard mouse and gamepad but i m worried that i will get rejected because i don t handle touch

13221784
strcpy	strcmp
the strings class is just a generic class for the base string function such as strcmp strcpy and so on..

13221800
subtract	add
2 the paper which you can get freely at suggests that having coplanar points qi is uncommon but in fact it is quite likely because these points have their centroid subtract and so if you add them all up you get a zero vector

13221810
for-loop	arrays
i created this for-loop because i thought it would be easier to account for than to create an if statement in a normal for-loop to account for the whole 2d arrays

13221820
put	get
when i put this in the address bar i get my home page site and the servlet grabs all of my content as requested

13221830

post	get
you ll want to use post redirect get

13221895
width	height
i like to use a lot of unique graphics on my pages which often results in making different page sizes depending on available screen width height

13221921
mouse	keyboard
3.5 your app must fully support touch input and fully support keyboard and mouse input

13221952
hash	md5
step 1- i made a string param for getting hash string using md5 string method

13221980
screens	tablet
the media queries will allow you to set up your site for different screens groups with breakpoints set to cover most tablet phones etc

13221994
free	malloc
in your code you are copying into a temp3 node which lives in automatic memory on the stack pointing sp- suf to this memory will on the next iteration of the loop cause free to be called with the address of this object which has not been obtained by malloc and thus cannot be free by free

13222026
post	get
get and post are methods i already had lying around.

13222114
for-loop	loops
i wrote a following program to read the above input from a file but i am sure that this is not the best way to do it because it contains a lot of if-else loops and for-loop which will really sucks at the large inputs

13222123
portrait	landscape
i have issue with ios 6 the display show up as portrait and not as landscape

13222127
des	aes
you could go with aes or des encrypt decrypt

13222179
int	chars
now i want to call a function that needs to be passed a int pointer pointing to an array that maps out the bit values needed to display a chars on a 5 7 led matrix

13222188
pop-up	dialog
as an example i m testing an activity with some edit text a spinner and a pop-up dialog that shows up when i click a spinner option

13222188
pop-up	dialog
note here that with other methods filling the fields of the pop-up dialog is a real pain

13222214
int	boolean
i m using the native driver and the methods pg_fetch_ only return strings even if the column type is int or boolean

13222214
postgresql	mysql
one specific case is that i want migrate an huge application running on mysql do postgresql and would be a lot of conditionals that i d have to change

13222214
int	boolean
and keep going but numero is a int status is a boolean

13222235
repr	human-readable
str converts any python object into a string usually in a human-readable or friendly way there s also the repr function which does so with a bit less friendliness and more focus on machine-readability

13222271
rspec	capybara
require capybara rspec

13222360
getter	setter
to make it interesting this rectangle stores twice its width instead of the width so the getter and setter have something to do besides just copying

13222362
awt	swing
awt swing

13222366
inherited	properties
in python 2.x properties only works properly if you inherited from object so that you get the new style class

13222433
post	put
which basically says hey ui thread execute this thing for me - and put in the runnable all the code which must be executed in the ui thread - this is particularly useful when you have a thread retrieving data from the network which must not run on the ui thread but then must post the results on the ui which must be done from the ui thread

13222481
width	height
you said you set the canvas width and height to fill parents

13222493
equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode
no you can t do this - tostring equals and gethashcode have default implementation provided by framework

13222538
put	get
php won t actually expand the variable inside a quote you ll just get variable as text in the output instead so you want to put the variable outside the quote using dot between them like the second example or use quotes like the first

13222550
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
ie9 + firefox for a while back + google-chrome safari all support last-of-type or last-child

13222575
udp	tcp
it provides the perfect mix between tcp and udp reliable when desired unreliable otherwise

13222591
portrait	landscape
since the configuration object only know about landscape and portrait i use activity.getwindowmanager .getdefaultdisplay .getorientation to discriminate between surface.rotation_90 and surface.rotation_270 both landscape orientation but from different sides

13222608
loops	while-loop
you should change the value of num inside loops because the condition of the while-loop will never become false

13222637
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this out in google-chrome and firefox with the same result

13222692
children	parent
an element s parent should be at location floor mypos - 1 2 and its children should be at positions 2 mypos+1 and 2 mypos+2

13222703
post	get
post-requesting a location sending refresh header makes firefox create get request but still hold post data

13222739
int	double
you are doing several implicit type conversions in that function between int and double and losing information left and right

13222750
put	get
use a combination of get and put download the file and upload it again

13222753
google-chrome	firefox
i tested on google-chrome and firefox and works fine ie doesn t have support for rounded corners but it is centered

13222772
google-chrome	safari
here is a fiddle showing this custom binder in use only tested in google-chrome 22 and safari 6

13222783
wxpython	pyqt
but some people prefer wxpython or others such as pyqt

13222813
google-chrome	firefox
in each case i ended up with the same problem the user in the second thread reported regarding google-chrome and firefox but now for me it s ie not showing the contents of the external file

13222830
glulookat	glrotate
that s true gltranslate glrotate change the object coordinates before rendering and glulookat changes the camera coordinate

13222837
fast-forward	merge
ensure deploy is fully merge into review so that later deploy can be fast-forward to review

13222837
fast-forward	merge
fast-forward deploy to review git checkout deploy git merge --ff-only review and push it

13222848
google-chrome	safari
this actually works in modern webkit browsers like google-chrome and safari i just tested in google-chrome 22 and safari 6 respectively â here is an example that takes the current page s source code recreates it in a new document variable src reads out its title overwrites it with a html quoted version of the same source code and shows the result in an iframe

13222852
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
trident msie webkit google-chrome safari presto opera

13222853
int	double
if i want to pimp int and double i need to write code like this

13222857
google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly if i open it in my web browser google-chrome firefox ie...

13222881
button	checkbox
i have a 4 textviews 1 checkbox and 1 button

13222881
width	height
i have tried width height of wrap match parent and custom sizes with all the same result

13222888
children	parent
i have a node structure each node have children nodes but no parent node

13222953
datediff	difference
because of this datediff compares the last modified timestamp of the file with the current date at 00 00 00 and returns a value greater than 1 or less than -1 when the difference exceeds plusmn

13222954
implements	extends
the only way i can think of is to have model implements an observer class and have person extends an observable class

13222978
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m having is that the scrolling becomes really choppy jerky in google-chrome but somehow its fine in firefox

13222983
google-chrome	safari
this isn t entirely scientific but if i set .browser.safari false in safari or google-chrome then .scrollto no longer works on any element with any parameters

13222983
google-chrome	safari
i noticed this problem after following this advice distinguish google-chrome from safari using jquery.browser

13222984
google-chrome	safari
don t set .browser.safari false in safari google-chrome while using jquery scrollto

13223006
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
crypt always returns the hash string or a string that is shorter than 13 characters and is guaranteed to differ from the salt on failure

13223006
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
lets start lightly with a simple crypt call and a valid two-character salt for a standard des-based hash

13223006
crypt	md5
if you use php s crypt and specificly md5 here better named md5crypt md5 unix freebsd md5 cisco-ios md5

13223006
salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5
if on a system where php s crypt defaults to the said md5 and it is called not specifying a salt crypt will generate the salt

13223006
crypt	md5
but the md5 example is moot i picked it because you have it in your question but you should not use md5 with crypt see md5crypt password scrambler is no longer considered safe by author

13223006
hash	salt
as you can see the output length depends on the used hash-algorithm the length of the salt and even some hash specific parameters like the cost

13223031
crypt	hash
crypt will return a hash string using the standard unix des-based

13223031
hash	salt
the hash type is triggered by the salt argument

13223031
crypt	md5
character md5 depending on the availability of md5 crypt

13223031
hash	salt
valid salt allowed by the available hash

13223109
int	chars
when i then convert each element of the chars array into an int the first number of is always take 51 52 51 50 53

13223136
google-chrome	firefox
however firefox and google-chrome don t seem to even fire this function meaning they still perform the double postback

13223192
post	get
if an inbound get request occurs at the same time as a post update will apache ensure that the get receives either the old version of the file or the new one but not an error or some sort of composite

13223214
jar	war
typically for a web application this means the jar s containing the classes need to be packaged into the web-inf lib directory of the war

13223214
jar	war
with maven you should be using packaging type war not jar

13223215
onchange	onblur
changing onchange to onblur event

13223238
erlang	elixir
the basic scenario is this i need to load text from a database and then turn that text into an elixir module or an erlang module and then make calls into it

13223238
erlang	elixir
it seems like it should be possible erlang supports hot code loading and elixir is pretty dynamic but i just don t know the syntax or the right functions

13223238
erlang	elixir
i m learning elixir specifically for the ability to dynamically evlauate code but my elixir knowledge is minimal now- i just started- and my erlang is rusty too

13223260
clang	llvm
i use xcode 4.5.2 with apple llvm compiler 4.1 clang

13223260
sse	avx
i tried to compile a code which heavily relies on sse intrinsics with avx enabled no _mm256 functions and no __m256 variables yet and got slower code then i get when only sse 4.2 is enabled

13223272
post	get
i set it up as outlined at the attached post but my cron when running i get this error

13223295
put	get
trying to call the original camera activity getcamera and then get the picture taken and put it into imageview1 any help is appreciated

13223315
int	chars
at the point where you define that template the only f that is known to the compiler is void f int x chars y which obviously doesn t match the usage in g t t

13223351
google-chrome	safari
when using google-chrome safari or older versions of explorer the website s layout falls apart if someone has their zoom set to anything other than 100

13223357
superclass	subclassing
i need to have some sort of data structure that can contain heterogenous subclassing of the same superclass all of which i have implemented myself

bluetooth	usb
we probably will have bluetooth i m not sure but it seems like using a usb connection will be the easiest method correct me if i m wrong

13223421
super	extends
the collection will hold any object that extends super however you cannot arbitrarily cast each element into whatever you want

13223455
post	get
the past three days i have been trying to get the excerpt of a post outside of the loop with the following codes

13223460
mouse	trackpad
i don t know of any editor that can give me acme s mouse support but i m using a magic trackpad these days so that s not necessary

13223461
width	height
i want to step up my game and do the same style website but use some form of jquery to re-size all images while constraining proportions as the screen gets smaller larger.the website could have a maximum size and become smaller maybe even load a maximum size depending on available screen width height

13223498
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it with both latest firefox and ie without problem but google-chrome does not render it properly

13223498
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in both ie and firefox but not google-chrome

13223628
int	chars
ord converts the chars to its int value

13223636
google-chrome	firefox
i tried a little hack to get it going - putting a fake m-1 -1 at the start which seems to work around the issue in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

13223648
onclick	onfocus
i did an example removing the onclick onfocus attribute on your input and put them in the javascript section

13223665
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
if you re mixing use of stderr and stdout you cannot expect proper ordering unless you fflush after each use

13223665
stdout	stderr
things get even more complicated with multiple threads flushing is not going to be sufficient so i think you should pick one stream either stdout or stderr and stick with it

13223680
post	get
i have a form with too many elements that creates configs at times the form can t be filled out all the way so i have been using get instead of post to keep the bookmark

13223706

i ran into a bit of trouble while trying to get my game to work correctly after being put to the background by the user or a phone call for example

13223706
onresume	onpause
i succesfully implemented onpause and onresume

13223709
post	get
i m not sure my solution is all that great but i ll post it to see if we can get some discussion started

13223735
hide	show
show the removeme and hide all the others via css

13223748
vim	emacs
i m not aware of any modern editor mimicking acme but everything you ask for is in vim and emacs but they are probably not what you might call modern and their operation is diametrally opposed to that of acme

13223748
vim	emacs
the last item in your list is easier and more natural in emacs than in vim though

13223757
post	get
i am using the code below but when i look at the server log it shows it is doing a post instead of a get

13223793
post	get
if you don t want get you may use post and specify data as follows

13223812
post	get
how can i get rid of the question mark without using method post because i want users to be able to refresh the page without having the confirm form re-submission dialog popping up

13223864
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
the equation will only use addition subtraction multiplication division operators and will not use brackets

13223923
division	multiplication
loop though the operators and calculate multiplication and division putting the result back in the list

13223923
subtraction	addition
loop through the operators again and calculate addition and subtraction this time

13223927
primes	modulus
denote the modulus by n it doesn t need to be primes and denote the numerical base by b which is 10 for ordinary decimal numbers

13223962
int	chars
getc returns an int not a chars so it should never stop reading the file this is an infinite loop

13223991
getter	setter
it s just a more convenient way to define standard getter setter methods for your variables because writing all over and over again simple standard getter and setter methods can be a real pain in the .

13224001
getter	setter	accessor	properties
they declare and implement properties accessor methods the getter and setter respectively

portrait	landscape
if one branch of viewcontrollers is only portrait and the other only landscape then using containment is probably going to be difficult because of the moment you switch between the two

13224366
children	parent
orientation calls are passed from the parent to the children but they are only called when a rotation occurs

13224366
portrait	landscape
so for example your phone is in portrait and you re viewing the portrait vc when you switch to the landscape vc it will appear in portrait when you rotate the device the orientation calls will make it go landscape and prevent it from going back to portrait

13224366
portrait	landscape
or instead of using containment you could use the portrait vc as your rootviewcontroller create the landscape viewcontroller and store it somewhere so it remains in memory

13225478
integer	unsigned
you would use the keyword unsigned to signify that the integer doesn t allow a sign - it can only be positive

13225483
integer	unsigned
you should use unsigned integer data type

13225486
integer	unsigned
the way to fix this is to explicitly tell mysql server to create an unsigned integer

13225515
width	height
as a work-around you could create some constraints to link the width of the label to the height by some proportion so that the height change caused the width to also change and thus force the font to change

13225521
width	margin
i would leave the body as is and margin the wrapper to 0 auto and use a max width like you have

13225538
int	chars
it seems that because the chars is full when it generates the new unsigned int type the result is full as well

i need it to display the actual variable obviously and i need to be able to use the variable as a limit for a for-loop to get the variables in the arrays but it keeps segfaulting on me which is due to it using the address instead of the actual variable

13225780
getter	setter
properties can normally be treated like fields but they are actually backed by implicit getter setter so you can still reference them like fields or set them equal to values

13225780
getter	setter
behind the scenes they are using getter setter which you can redefine if you care to

13225780
getter	setter
it also shows that you can make a private property private field backed by private getter setter but you have to be explicit in defining the getter setter

it is overriding the width and height set by js

getter	setter
when a groovy class definition declares a field without an access modifier then a public setter getter method pair and a private instance variable field is generated which is also known as property according to the javabeans specification

you also need to put the return after you assign the total or the assignment will not get executed

13227892
move	drag
the map with the route is indeed drawn and the overrided ontap method works but it seems it only recognizes the tap if my mapview is defined as enabled and clickable but if i do so then the user can also move and drag the map as long as he holds pressing the screen

13230439
trie	tree
this problem seems like a good candidate for using a prefix tree or trie with segments of the path as characters

13230450
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you think about it foo .gethashcode and foo .gethashcode are totally different so there s no reasonable way you could implement a case-insensitive get on a case-sensitive hash map

13230450
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
or create a new case-insensitive dictionary with the contents of an existing case-sensitive dictionary if you re sure there are no case collisions -

width	height
hi just add one button behind that buttons and that button width will be 320 and height will be 480 according iphone size now you have one button in background and other buttons on that buttons.so now you can give different methods to these buttons.try it and tell me whether it is working or not

13230644
int	chars
the fact that getchar returns an int is certainly confusing it s because it needs to be able to return the special value eof which doesn t fit in a chars

13230659
int	double
double or floats and int are not binary compatible except for the value of + 0

13230690
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend google-chrome in-built tools for developers or firebug add-on if you use firefox to check whether elements you built are like you design them to be

13230699
post	get
whether it was done post or get method

13230731

and as bolding takes a wider width i cannot simply calculate the cell height with the string without attributes

13230761
width	height
i want to have a ul list but with its elements floating left and list to have fixed height and width

13230832
put	get
so if your put and subsequent get is happening in the same request it s coming out of the in-context cache in any case

13230838
queue	fifo
and failed job message arrive then it will function just as normal queue fashion i.e fifo

13230939

post	get
get and post method in http are two most popular methods used to transfer data from client to server using http hyper text transfer protocol protocol

13231349
post	get
both get and post can be used to send request and receive response but there are significant difference between them

13231349
ssl	https
all sensitive and confidential information sent to be server must go on post request and via https http with ssl

13231349
post	get
use post if you are sending large data which can not be fit into url in case of get

13231349
post	get
difference between get and post method in http protocol

13231349
post	get
most of the difference between get and post has been already discussed in there respective section

13231349
post	get
it all depends upon requirement when you want to choose get and post and knowledge of these differences help you to make that decision

13231349
post	get
get method passes request parameter in url string while post method passes request parameter in request body

13231349
post	get
get request can only pass limited amount of data while post method can pass large amount of data to server

13231349
post	get
get request can be bookmarked and cached unlike post requests

13231349
post	get
get is mostly used for view purpose sql select while post is mainly use for update purpose sql insert or update

13231367
subobject	instances
but i feel it should be the other way around in this case as the queries are subobject of the instances

13231394
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
you should use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

13231446
aggregate-functions	sum
you then apply an aggregate-functions with a case statement to get the count using sum for each of the different type values

13231465
min	max
because of that grouping you ll need to get max or min on the subject code

13231593
inherited	subclassing
if you want to inherited from viewmodelbase then you need to have only the subclassing be ref classes like this

13231762
hide	show
show hide logic is linked to network status change receiver

13231773
setinterval	settimeout
i would also strongly recommend using a chained series of settimeout calls rather than a setinterval call something like this

13231773
setinterval	settimeout
the reasons i advocate a chained series of settimeout instead of setinterval are

13231773
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
but it s up to you of course the above can be done just as easily with setinterval and clearinterval calls as with a chain of settimeout calls

13231847

queue	fifo
so where they ve used the term queue they indeed mean fifo as the word implies anyway

13232031

13232137
versioning	upgrade
do i need to upgrade uboot to a newer versioning

13232143

i want to change the height of a uiviewcontroller s view that is inside a uinavigationcontroller to display a banner at the bottom so that it doesn t obscure anything

13232214
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the only option i can think of right now is to use the uinavigationcontroller inside a dummy uitabbarcontroller that will be obscured by the banner but that seems unnecessarily complicated to me

13232264
opera	firefox
try firefox or opera instead

13232270
versioning	upgrade
also going by your line number it looks like you re not running the latest versioning or at least the versioning that i just downloaded so i suggest you upgrade

give it a shot and if you can t get it post what you have tried as another question

13238099
width	height
to achieve this i need the total page height width and the amount of vertical horizontal scrolling

13238108
width	height
the resizing is done smoothly and the containing html elements are resized automatically since their height width is set to auto

13238108
width	height
however the panel itself does not take height width auto values only integers

13238126
width	height
i did a bunch of googling but i can t seem to find the non-retina html width height for the ipad mini

13238126

more specifically the width height when using

13238126
width	height
ipad browser width height standard

13238143

in fact that is potentially dangerous in that it may well cause an infinite loop by submission the form within its own onsubmit handler you fire the handler again and try to submit the form anew and so on

13238277
multiplying	add
if you want to access position r c then you only have to multiplying r by n and then add c

13238291
coalesce	isnull
isnull coalesce column1 column2 no data

13238325
post	get
depending on if your are using post or get you can just loop the full post or get array to determine all of the form values

13238347
width	height
this function enables and disables ui elements depending on the window width and adapts the title height using a custom function making heavy use of jquery

13238427
put	get
but then i would like to access this database within my form1 class filling created table by using loop since i don t want to fill 255 rows manually when they are supposed to be filled with 0 s by default making some queries to get data from database and put some data in database

13238433

on the other hand you can use union all with distinct

13238457
int	chars	int	double
value types like int double chars

13238498
put	get
however if i put a breakpoint on any line past that such as 6 i get the object reference not set to instance of object error because nodes only has one item in it

13238509
ontouch	ondraw
it s probably faster to create the path in ontouch and only draw it in ondraw

13238518
filtering	grouping
server side filtering paging and even grouping

13238547
width	height
string windowargs toolbar no menubar no location no width 620 height 500 scrollbars yes resizable yes modal yes

13238556
int	chars
it s also fine to cast an int literal as you do in your question chars 8226

13238559
google-chrome	safari
if you use the cambria math font in your css some borwsers i.e google-chrome and safari will locate the clickable area outside of the normal click zone bounds on elements

13238601

as i m typing global it highlights it for me...then after pressing enter a list of all the folder files in that directory shows up

13238622
getter	setter

13238626
ksort	asort
i have tried ksort entity_list student_last_name or asort entity_list current_grade for example

13238640
google-chrome	safari
btw i m running this in safari and google-chrome and you can see what happens just watching the console

13238653
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome is everything ok but firefox and ie makes problem

13238700
rsa	aes
rsa is very computationally expensive by comparison with aes

13238700
rsa	aes
a good compromise is to use rsa to encrypt the symmetric key that is then used in aes encryption of the larger data

13238705
width	height
just pass your file.getabsolutepath as the first argument along with the required width and height to the decodesampledbitmapfrompath function to get an efficiently loaded bitmap

13238706
firefox	safari
even safari or firefox running on the same mac would work just fine

13238714
rel	src
when i have to load the big image i replace the src with the rel argument

13238739
min	max
every group has exactly one non-null value so we can use min max sum to get to the same result in another window function on top of that

13238758
children	parent
the reason for this is there will be 100 s of children of this common parent

13238781
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
code for ie7+ firefox google-chrome opera safari

13238852
realloc	memmove
and allocate space for as many nodes as initially required then using realloc to extend the list when needed and memmove to remove nodes by shifting back the nodes beyond the deleted one

13238895
gridview	rowdatabound
i was able to achieve this by using the solution that jã rn schou-rode provided i modified a little bit to make it work from the rowdatabound event of my gridview

13238936
src	attr
currently img only has src attr but want to dynamically find height and apply

13238949
dictionary	map
well if the entire purpose of your collection is to store the counts of the books than a dictionary map or whatever java s key-value collection is called

13238949
dictionary	map
now i suspect that your collection might be a little more complicated than that so you might want to make a book class which has count as a field and then i d probably have a string - book dictionary map anyway with the string as it s dewy decimal number or some other unique identifier

13238965
int	boolean
youâ ve written asinteger and asboolean instead of as int and as boolean

13239011
folder	dir
i want to create a predicate which will find this string with expression like dir dir2 folder file.doc

13239032
width	height
here s how to get the width height with straight javascript

13239063
width	margin
using margin 0 auto will centre the div fine but you have to supply a width in order for it to work properly

13239063
width	margin
alternatively you could get rid of the .centerer div instead just making the #main div centered itself by applying the same css - you ve already got a width defined so just add margin 0 auto

13239065
cos	sin	cos	exp
i can try to make some up with putting some sin cos exp together but it ll take time and is really frustrating

13239133
portrait	landscape	screens	tablet
in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false

13239176
inherited	properties
the prototype object from which functions inherited has a .constructor properties

13239187
xslt	xquery
the main reason i prefer that over a union type is that it works better in schema-aware xslt and xquery

13239220
width	height
the first 200px height and 600px width should contain a new div named

13239220
width	height
there should be another div here 200px height and 800px width

13239220
width	height
in the bottom we got 400px height and 800px width to use

13239283
public	protected
in c# programming language non-static members are avaialble on an instance of the class only if they are marked as public private protected internal are also avaialble on the basis of where you are created instance of the class

13239283
public	protected
in c# visibility is controlled by public private protected internal keywords and not by some logic

13239311
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in both google-chrome and firefox

13239331
hide	show
so on startup just show div id box_5 and hide the rest

13239331

when i click button 1 show everything and when i click button 2 hide everything again

13239341
superclass	subclassing
in the subclassing constructor you call a one-argument superclass constructor which you didn t declare

13239369
free	memcpy
i had kept the free datapage before the memcpy it s working fine but after memcpy it s not working

13239397
post	get
once you have that app you personally authenticate it to get information from or post information to facebook on your behalf

13239409
post	get
edit3 i realize making a get and post is a bit strange i ll try changing that but get post shouldn t be a problem i think

13239415
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you could put that in your viewdidload or viewwillappear and if you have a bunch of view controllers you can just subclass them all and put your logic in the subclass

13239452
stdout	stderr
can i get an explanation of which i should use closure or bind and pros cons and if a closure how would i actually write the callback function - i am unclear on how i access err stdout and stderr in that way

13239527
post	get
basically stick to 1 method either post or get and make sure that the various parameters are separated as they re supposed to be separated

13239543
multiplying	multiplication
it is a simple matrix multiplication code to multiplying two matrices

13239558
superclass	subclassing
as you work on it you ll probably realize you want to call createbody in the superclass constructor but implement it in the subclassing

13239562
put	get
dunno your specifics but if you try to create a method that it can t quite figure out put a class you haven t imported yet as a return value you ll get the second result in place of the desired one

13239575
width	height
the absolutely positioned element is taken out of the natural flow of the document which means your container has zero height and width

13239575
width	height
10 and 50 of that zero height and width are of course zero

13239575
width	height
if you give your container a height and width your percentage positions will start to work as you want

13239576
post	get
this ihttphandler would accept data in a post request s body as this seems more semantically correct than using the get verb and querystring parameters

13239604
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m attaching the mouseenter and mouseleave events to a class assigned to all the buttons which swaps the img src for all the buttons and a separate function to show the specific layer element for each button

13239618
google-chrome	firefox
i ran this in google-chrome and firefox and didn t see any performance differences between the two versions

13239623
width	height
i m trying to create a two dimensional array with independent height and width values

13239635
width	height
at that time i want it to open with same height and width as of the video

13239635
width	height
so i want to know video files width and height before i am playing that file

13239662
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
unfortunately neither uigesturerecognizer nor uitapgesturerecognizer exposes this information

13239662
uicontrol	uigesturerecognizer
uicontrol for example exposes alltargets and allcontrolevents which is basically what you are looking for but it is unfortunately unavailable for uigesturerecognizer

13239741
many-to-many	one-to-many
assuming you want the same movie to be relatable to multiple users making it a many-to-many relationship not one-to-many as you stated your model would end-up looking something like this in a dbms supporting deferrable fks

13239742
jar	manifest.mf
i created a jar file of my versions of these classes and added it to the bundle-classpath attribute of manifest.mf the bin.includes attribute of build.properties and .classpath

13239744
folder	directory
images related to a stylesheet should be placed in the same directory as the stylesheet rather than in a sibling folder i m assuming the images referenced by the stylesheet in the css folder are actually located in img

13239771
portrait	landscape
you will be told when the app is snapped filled or landscape portrait

13239796
concave	convex
1 - to reduce the number of vertices you can make all concave shapes convex unless this causes the start

13239797
super	abstract
your super class has an abstract method

13239797
abstract-class	superclass
declare the superclass as abstract since superclass must be an abstract-class to define abstract methods

13239826
primes	modulus
what you are doing is only a bit related to finding out primes in that you are using modulus operator that is needed but nothing more than that

13239840
post	get
if it s a client side problem your best bet to get it to work cross browser would be to split your post on the client side and posting it in several parts

13239953
int	boolean
because evaluating int as boolean caused a lot of hard to find bugs

13239972
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch is meant to help in the exception-handling handling

13239985
int	boolean
note that instr returns an int so testing the result of the function as a boolean should result in inconsistent behavior

13239991
int	chars
alternatively let a single template argument t be an actual function type then it can be void void int or void int chars etc as your heart desires

13240022
hide	show
what you want to do instead in your function_to_call is hide or destroy your splash window and show your next window gtk_widget_hide gtk_widget_show

13240071
width	height
also width height top and left in the properties tab are your friends

13240082
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i am not seeing this on firefox or safari so this may be a google-chrome issue

13240106
jtextfield	jtable
the defaultcelleditor for many jtable cell types delegates to a jtextfield which binds the delete key to the delete-next action

13240130
google-chrome	safari
i did find that adding display block to the password field caused the indicator to go away in both google-chrome and safari

13240135
webclient	httpwebrequest
if the swf file isn t too big downloads completely in under a few seconds then i d download it using httpwebrequest or webclient save it to a temporary file on disk then load it in the player by the local path

13240183
filtering	grouping
in a nutshell create power of two for each filtering grouping set the category mask for each object to the grouping enum and set its mask to the enum of the object types you want it to collide with or 0 to collide with nothing

13240186
easymock	powermockito
i am still new to powermockito and easymock

13240196

13240351
build-helper-maven-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
even though its possible to use a combination of the build-helper-maven-plugin for specifying multiple source folders and the maven-jar-plugin for building multiple jar files its only possible to split the sources on the package level see exclude include in the maven-jar-plugin

13240357
width	height
i tried using fb.uiserver.methods fbml.dialog .size width 300 height 555

13240374
werkzeug	gevent
also with gevent you can use low level web frameworks like werkzeug and webob werkzeug being my personal choice

13240374
werkzeug	gevent
gevent has wsgi server builtin it is very fast and stable and werkzeug converts wsgi environment and request data in nice and easy to use objects

13240447
put	get
you can then specify css styles that get put into the item s appearance style field

13240460

13240579
width	height
providing the width and height rescales the image

13240607
inherited	properties
now when you want to invoke such a function on an unknown object - like hasownproperty is often used in generic enumeration functions where any json might be passed in - you can never be sure whether you got a overwritten properties that might not even be a function or the original which you want or whether the object inherited the properties at all

13240616

google-chrome	firefox
for instance when i type in firefox and google-chrome console i get back instead of

13240946

to get a minimum of 20 rows the easiest way will probably be to add extra rows to your table footer and hide show them based on the number of rows in your table

13240968
google-chrome	firefox
double quotes is the way firefox and google-chrome prefer to represent string literals in the console

13240986
google-chrome	firefox
for instance when i type json.stringify in firefox and google-chrome

13241019
versioning	upgrade
conversely if you re on a versioning that is old enough not to support php 5.3 then you need to upgrade urgently because the stuff that was taken out of php between 5.2 and 5.3 was all done for security considerations

13242335
for-loop	arrays
remove it from the session arrays do this before you do your echoing for-loop

13242361
keydown	keyup
this won t work because you re binding on the keydown event and unbinding the keyup event which has no binding per your example

13242369
portrait	landscape
i set it to landscape using vba but it will always go back to portrait

13242369
portrait	landscape
if i step into the code right after this line the document is in landscape but as soon as i click even once only in the document it goes back to portrait

13242382
interpolation	splines
the first one would probably be slow for large data and the second one does not seem to offer any other interpolation method except splines

13242657
int	double
then i can declare parameters of double or int

13242657
min	max
2 i don t think you want to set min and max in your constructor

13242657
min	max
for example consider if you checked min and max before you allowed set like

13242657
min	max
you might just want to make min and max regular non-static members or initialize them some other way

13242673
comparator	comparable
this is done because number does not implement comparable which has the comparator method but all the java.lang.number classes eg integer do and you need the comparator method to check parameter range in the setvalue method

13242673
min	max
the other major change was to make min and max instance variables rather than static ones

13242673
min	max
you might consider having some static min max values to pass into the constructor or to implement subclasses like this

13242706
put	get

post	get
reading across 20 post i found that it was not apparent how to get a custom factory method to take parameters at run-time especially since we are forced to use the constructor-arg tags and refer to an existing bean in the context as setup below and the class in question acting as a static factory method

13243074
post	get
actually all of the information whether get or post in the http header is part of the ssl transport therefore the url parameters are encrypted as well so your get parameters are encrypted

13243074
post	get
i would say you re safe using this api the only difference between the get and the post methods would be that in the post the parameters would be in the body whereas with the get the parameters are in the header

put	get
what you seem to be trying to do on the other hand is load the page and then get the content of a div inside that page and put it in a container div on the current page which is overly complicated and a bad solution to what ever the problem is

13257630
jar	war
at this time as far as i am aware there is no need to package all the ejbs into jar and then combine this jar with a war into ear

13257630
jar	war
the war module has access to resources in ejb archive jar and ejb module can reference and access resources libraries in the ear file itself

13257630
jar	war
so having a structure of ejb archive which consists of many jar and war files may not be necessary but it is a best practice and one should be careful and concious about violating that rule

post	get
the real answer is if you hit the back button the browser doesn t send the post request you originally sent when you first visited that page what you might want to do if you are doing a multi-step form is either do it with ajax or use get instead of post

also you are mixing server-side code with client-side

13259563
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

13259564

13273316

can it contain getter and setter from spring dependency injection

13274320
filtering	grouping
there are a lot of filtering so i put them into grouping a b c

13274320
filtering	grouping
if i click one of them for example select the grouping b and than a context menu shows the b1 b2 b3 filtering options

13274326
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested this in ie9 and google-chrome but couldn t detect this issue in those browsers meaning they don t scroll the window unexpectedly so i m guessing it s firefox-specific also disabled every plugin in firefox etc.

13274330
children	parent
on the start drag event make the parent item have a higher index so its children stay ontop of the rest then on the drop event set it back to normal workds great d

13274361

for each higher zoom level the number of pixels needed to display the same area doubles in both width and height

13274365
pocketpc	windows-mobile
just to add since you are showing windows-mobile and windows-mobile-6 you should change your #define constraint to pocketpc instead of compact_framework

13274369
integer	fractions
if m is greater than or equal to 10-3 but less than 107 then it is represented as the integer part of m in decimal form with no leading zeroes followed by . u002e followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractions part of m

13274369
integer	fractions
the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a as a single decimal digit followed by . u002e followed by decimal digits representing the fractions part of a followed by the letter e u0045 followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer as produced by the method integer.tostring int

13274397
google-chrome	firefox
i ran some tests to see how eval direct and indirect calls arguments and fn.arguments interact on ie firefox and google-chrome

13274397
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s behavior is similar to firefox s when there is no eval or an indirect eval call it behaves consistently

13274397
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome also presents the weird case of being original even after assignment but it happens when eval is present while on firefox it happens when there s no eval or with the indirect call

13274415

13274993
jar	war
if you download findbugs itself in my case version 2.0.1 and launch the gui from the included batch file it restricts the file types you can put into a project for analysis inside the new project dialog to jar war ear zip sar

13275027
division	modulo
if is_modulo is true for a signed type int that is unchanged by the usual arithmetic conversions then for any arithmetic operation other than division by zero there is a single correct result in the mathematical integers that modulo maps to a single value in the range of the type and so the implementation is constrained to behave as if the actual result is the true result modulo the range of the type

13275030
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
all you have to do is copy the regular fileinputstream for your source file to the cipheroutputstream that s wrapping your fileoutputstream for the encrypted sink file

uiview	subviews
i m in an ipad app and using an mt.d dialogviewcontroller as a subviews in an overall uiview

13275156
post	get
another thing to note is that you are using get instead of post

13275267
scikit-learn	libsvm
there is no openmp support in the current binding for libsvm in scikit-learn

13275267
libsvm	liblinear	scikit-learn	liblinear	scikit-learn	libsvm
you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn

13275270
subtraction	addition
in the insert you re doing two row operations - one subtraction and one addition

13275270
subtraction	addition
when you have a duplicate the on duplicate key will run twice - once for the subtraction and once for the addition

13275270
subtract	add
you ll add the value then subtract the value yielding 0

13275300
google-chrome	firefox
using a closure is slightly faster on google-chrome twice as slow on firefox about the same on ie9

13275318
post	get
i can access the parameters fine using the get parameters but when i use post it fails

13275318

i use the following jquery to test both only switching post to get

13275318
post	get
when using get it prints the text but when using post it prints null

13275344
int	chars
probably the easiest way to iterate over them is to iterate over the int from 0 to 2 n -1 and use their binary representations as the indications of whether the chars should be replaced or not

13275354
post	get
im trying to get related post for actual post that user is seeing custom post type named property

13275368
versioning	upgrade
a baseline includes one complete schema creation script as well an upgrade script from allowed previous versioning if any more on that in a moment

13275368
versioning	upgrade
as we upgrade that versioning we just apply the change scripts in order

13275368
installation	upgrade
we do have a tool that packages these files and automatically upgrade databases which our support and installation teams use

13275368
versioning	upgrade
if they do and there is a valid upgrade path from the current versioning it applies the upgrade script and updates the schema_version.baseline and deletes all entries for change scripts from the previous baseline

13275368
installation	upgrade
another thing to keep in mind is if an installation wants to be upgrade from one baseline to another it has to apply all outstanding changes for the current baseline before we upgrade to the new one

13275418
width	height
you have set up your 3d camera to have a view width of 45 so an object at the camera with a width of 45 would fill the screen and a height of 45 over the aspect ratio

13275422
put	get
i d suggest you put this in some onclicklistener or something because if it s without boundaries in getview it s gonna get called alot unnecessarily

13275425
octal	decimal
long long int decimal octal or hexadecimal suffixed by both u or u

13275665
versioning	upgrade
as ios is upgrade the signatures and methods of older versioning get marked as obsolete by monotouch

13275686
superclass	subclassing
in subclassing i add the offset of the private class field thinking about the class as a c structure the superclass map using string name as a key.i will make to execute configure only once and then i want to use this offset for every person instance to access to its private fields at runtime this + offset field

13275687
executable	sfx
essentially i want an authoritative signature that i can say at least all winrar generated self-extracting executable created with the default sfx file in version 420 will have bytes 0x15 0xa1 0x45 0xcc 0x21 0x98 at location 0x00027400 and other non sfx files are unlikely to have this signature

13275687
executable	sfx
by nature of how sfx s work they will be very similar except for the archive portion of the file but some strings make poor identifiers e.x. this program cannot be run in dos mode is in every sfx but it happens to also be in most other windows executable

13275703
hide	show
you will receive the show hide notifications for both cases and be able to determine the available screen size from the metrics in the notification s userinfo dictionary

13275726
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t appear to happen in firefox or google-chrome

13275752
union	distinct
union adds a distinct operation which isn t required even if in your case it won t change the result

13275769
xslt	xquery
if you are using the schema for data binding or for schema-aware xslt xquery processing or for documentation or for generating instances or for generating forms then this kind of design can sometimes be useful

13275818
google-chrome	firefox
we have a vfp application and need to open a specific site in google-chrome or firefox

13275818
google-chrome	firefox
we have done this to open the default browser which is google-chrome or firefox

13275818
google-chrome	firefox
at a minimum if we can open google-chrome or firefox and pass post parameters without using a querystring that would be an acceptable start

13275844
subtract	add
first subtract the point from the coordinates then apply the rotations and finally add the point back to the result

13275892
textview	imageview
all is working well if the items are simple views textview or imageview but if the items are linearlayouts only the layout itself is displayed

13275934
int	chars
chars is signed here so in your second example which is encoded as 0b00000000000000000000000000000001 so becomes 1 as an unsigned int

13275972
int	chars
for the same reason that unsigned int chars 128 is 4294967168 chars is signed by default on most commonly used systems

13276003
move	drag
the thumbs should move that corner point when the user left mouse clicks on it and drag the mouse

13276003
width	height
the template for pointrelocatethumb is an ellipse of width and height 7 - which explains why i have to offset all the thumb locations by 3.5

13276031
put	get
on my mobile device the tabs work fine however on my tablet the tabs get automatically put into the actionbar

13276031
portrait	landscape
the devices are only in portrait mode i am not supporting landscape

13276032
jobs	cron
i suspect you re running into problems with the minimal environment that cron runs its jobs with

13276045
post	put
i ll post as much code or logcat as people want put i don t want to overwhelm folks with code either

13276088
redmine	gitorious
the ultimate goal here is installing and configuring gitorious to work with redmine but i believe the problem is isolated to ubuntu 12.04 and mysql5.5

13276095
min	max
a table s min pref max width is calculated from the sum of the respective column sizes

13276127
int	double
3- pass values from the image to complex.real maybe a problem about convert int to double

13276127
int	double
5- read data from â complexâ array and pass values to â imageâ struct to display the problem maybe i filter the result to fit the pgm format â convert double to int

13276132
getter	setter
the jquery data method acts like a getter for html5 data attributes but the setter does not alter the data- attribute

13276132
getter	setter
so in order to overcome these issues you need to use the html5 dataset attributes via jquery s attr methos as getter and setter

13276193
stardog	allegrograph	virtuoso	stardog	virtuoso	allegrograph
there are a lot of options out there mulgara jena sesame stardog owlim allegrograph bigdata virtuoso and oracle provides some rdf support if you have an oracle license but in my experience it s not as performant as dedicated rdf databases

13276208
int	chars
it is because whitespace can never be an int but whitespace is made up of chars

13276218
dictionary	map
in case you want to know what i m trying to do in my program with nested dictionary i m trying to hold map data on an astronomical scale

13276245
margin	height
you can set the height to 100 the height of this parent so the but it will looks weird because it will render the height + the padding + border + margin

13276245
height	border-box
you need to use the border-box property with the height

13276245
width	height
it allows you to define if the padding and or border or none by default are count in the height and width properties

13276328
subtract	add
from there if you were so inclined you could check if dst start or end falls in your time period and add or subtract an hour as needed

13276332
post	get
can you get the applications to log the date held in the calendar object and post it here as well just to make sure they have correct information

13276338
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop is used as the number of threads are less than the size of the arrays

13276351
ssl	https
username and password over an https connection should at least be unsniffable but you might want to look in to client ssl certificates

13276355
margin	text-align
usually when writing stylesheets for bi-directional sites apps both ltr rtl stylesheets mostly will look the same except for direction related properties float text-align padding margin ..etc so when you write a float left in some ltr stylesheet you ll have to write it again as float right for the rtl one

13276364
jobs	cron
i thought that i had removed sendmail when i installed postfix but these cron jobs started popping up

13276398
strtol	strtod
that are acceptable to strtod strtol etc. are unacceptable to fscanf

13276445
button	checkbox
finally noticed that the button in question had its user interaction enabled checkbox unchecked in the attributes inspector

13276449
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and ie9 this solution seems to be the fastest in firefox 15.0.1 manual iteration seems faster memory allocation management slower in firefox possibly

13276486
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

13276492
typebuilder	reflection.emit
see reflection.emit namespace and typebuilder s methods

13276523
onchange	onkeyup
i changed the event to onkeyup as onchange only happens on blur - when a field loses focus

13276564
tabcontrol	tabitem
this case had to be fixed in the tabcontrol itself because tests showed when the fake visility is set for the first time the tabitem does not have access to it s tabcontrol yet

13276588
width	height
most of my images have a bigger width than height so when i scaled them i just put

13276588
width	height
the only thing that worked so far was to put a static height in the ul and then scale in both width and height but then it s not a fluid grid

13276592
integer	unsigned
a byte when typically interpreted as unsigned is an integer in the range 0..255

13276641
portrait	landscape
i ran into something similar recently although my problem was that i wanted to force portrait in an iphone app but allow movies to play in landscape

13276663
gmail	hotmail
same with mac mail outlook gmail hotmail

13276664
switching	airplane
there you can switching the phone off put it into mute or airplane mode

13276667
post	get
guys i m trying to get a list of post and it s content not to display on page load but within each div there is a expand button that would expand just that particular post

13276668
oncreate	ondestroy
this can also be oncreate ondestroy or within a service

13276686
google-chrome	firefox
i ve broken them into test classes for each browser we plan on testing google-chrome firefox and ie9 for now and each test class has a startup method that logs in to the system under test and then executes the test s requested and a teardown method that closes the browser using webdriver.quit

13276686
google-chrome	firefox
when i run the whole suite i get errors on different ports for the tests for ie firefox and google-chrome - two errors for each browser as the suite currently has two tests for each browser

13276717
post	get
if this is the case what you can do here is use the http head request another type of http request like get post etc. in python s requests library to get only the header and not also the page body

13276718
google-chrome	firefox
if the code provided here does not work for you i would var_dump _session to make sure it s set as well as check the actual html in something like firebug firefox or developer tools in google-chrome

13276734
versioning	upgrade
it s possible that microsoft is pushing the nuget package to make it easier to upgrade as new versioning come out that aren t based on the core .net 4.5 files

13276782
tabcontrol	tabitem
to change the visibility of the tabitem during runtime a attached visibility property also prevents the tabcontrol s misbehavior

13276801
scrypt	kdf
finally scrypt is far and away the most theoretically secure slowest kdf

13276825
portrait	landscape
i m playing youtube videos in my app - the app is portrait only except that i d like to have the videos play landscape

13276849
superclass	subclassing
however when i invoke the getperson meathod in the subclassing it only returns the department information not the name and yearjoined that i only set in the superclass

13276869
int	boolean
note that the output for what i think should be boolean is instead the same int as the forloop.index

13276881
superclass	subclassing
you need to change your shopstaff method to return the superclass values with your subclassing return statement -

13277011
loops	if-statement
the first two codes are the ones i m working with and the problem i m having is that when i try to loops the if-statement it just continues to draw a straight line up instead of turning left in this case and then looping back to the beginning and drawing a line until it hits a wall again

13277031
uiview	subviews
all other objects in the game towers creeps weapons explosions etc are also subclasses of uiview and are added as subviews to the board when they are created

13277047
post	get
when i hit post button i get totally nothing in the browser

13277079
int	double
the simple way is to get a random int from double the range the closed range and divide by 2.0

13277123
jar	war
this will take care that the jar also actually ends up in the web-inf lib of the built and deployed war

13277156
margin	border-box	width	border-box	width	margin
it s because of your margin on the inputs spacing them from the parent element it s worse when not using border-box but still occurs because margin is not included in the width calculation

13277156
margin	height
as i said in the comment below the extra border from the focus styles was eating into your margin first which is why the height went unchanged

13277156
margin	height	width	margin	width	height
so the width should be correct now and the height won t change since it still eats into the margin above and below first but as i noted if you make the border any bigger it would still change the height of the input

13277160
move	drag
what i would like to do is if i touch and drag fling the left side the right side move roughly the same distance in the same direction as the drag fling operation

13277178
post	get
when i use the dropdown lists in the create view they work perfectly both on the get and post actionresults

13277178
post	get
when i try and use the same dropdown lists for my edit view they work for the get actionresult the view loads and the dropdowns work but when i try to post them to my edit actionresult i get the following error

13277237
post	put
and when you post into your db do not directly put the post variables in there first clean and strip the post then put the second var into your db

13277240
put	get
now i m trying to get the rowid from a row with specific cell and put the rowid then to update query

13277252
children	parent
a solution which handles additional levels of parent children would be the best one

13277266
set	bag
perhaps you could just set it as a view bag variable and pass it in on the controller

13277353
post	get
there s a chance the site uses post redirect get prg pattern

13277386
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
when using google web fonts on google-chrome under windows 7 the fonts seem to render incorrectly while on a mac osx on google-chrome safari and firefox it looks fine

13277411
realloc	malloc
i tried searching this site and i think that it won t work because there is no real way to determine the size of a memory block allocated with malloc so realloc doesn t know the new size of the memory block that it needs to reallocate

13277427
int	boolean
it would be simpler to record availability as an array of boolean or int

13277427
int	boolean
i think it would be better to use the default value of boolean or int to indicate availability - then you won t need to explicitly initialize the array at all

13277443
put	get
in the click me function put what ever action you want it to do there and get rid of all other anchors your code is not totally full because you have an empty function at the bottom but i can almost bet you are calling the same function twice

13277487
folder	directory
but i forgot the index file in the public_html when i include my headers footers and nav from that directory not being a sub folder the .. s mess every thing up

13277514
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade the apps rails versioning from 3.0.9 to 3.1.2 also switched from ruby 1.8.7 to 1.9.2

13277524
put	get
in the url if i put localhost 3000 assets fonts which is the folder of the fonts i get a routing error

13277552
realloc	malloc
if memblock is null realloc behaves the same way as malloc and allocates a new block of size bytes

13277575
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
even though that information is not available for us programmers it is required to be available to realloc even if the block was allocated with malloc or calloc

13277575
free	realloc
only the next allocation is for such a large block that it does not fit the memory free up with realloc

13277626
hide	show
the most you could do is load the mapview and start it triangulating but cover it with another view which show a progress indicator set up a delegate to get a call back when a location is found and if it is accurate enough for your purposes hide the top view and show the map that was hidden underneath

13277631
m2e	pom.xml
it sounds like from your pom.xml fragment that you are using mvn eclipse eclipse which you shouldn t be anymore instead use the m2e plugin

i don t want to use a stringstream or a fstream but rather what i suppose may be a custom stream that just acts as a giant byte array for whatever is passed to it

13277706
int	double
so your first invocation int to double will work fine according to rule # 2

13277706
int	double
but the second invocation double to int will give compiler error according to the statement quoted further in the same section -

13277716
free	realloc
this seems to be related to realloc does not correctly free memory in windows which mentions virutalalloc but i m not sure it clarifies the exact reason that realloc doesn t work

13277795
free	realloc
realloc doesn t free memory

13277795
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
these functions work with a big block of memory called a heap and carve chunks out when you call realloc malloc calloc

13277795

13277836
int	chars
chars behaves much like a smaller int

13277840
int	double
this is an object which both int and double inherit from so up to the point where a double number and an int number behave the same this will work

13277840
int	double
note that there is a difference between the primitives int and double and the objects int and double

13277857
put	get
on my original page in ajax function on success i get the data back and put it in alert to test like this

13277916
int	double
because you can set a double to an int then int as argument is ok to function with double as parameter

13277916
int	double
in that case you need to cast the double to an int

13277991
hash	salt
yes storing the password even reversibly encrypted is worse than a salt hash of some sort due to password reuse

13277991
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
arguably generating something from the plaintext password as by pbkdf2 or regular salt hash and then using that on both sides would be somewhat more secure

13278009

folder	directory
this feature was removed in tortoisesvn 1.7 which only the root directory of your working copy has the .svn folder

13278507
folder	directory
if you are adding a folder to the copy bundles then instead of referencing the file as gray_button.png you should reference if from code or xib you will have to include the directory in the name too such as directory gray_button.png

13278514
int	chars
i have defined a myapptable table which has id int primary key and a name chars varying 255 columns

represent a double precision floating point number as a double rather than an array of 8 bytes represent a 32 bit int as an int or int32_t rather than an array of 4 bytes et cetera

13278760
int	double
you have to either use double or floats arrays or scale the int by a factor of eg 100 not the total

13278804
post	get
i have seen on here how to do this using the get method but have not found any help for doing a non-jquery ajax call using the post method

should i do it as a service that i can pass the model to and it should return an object with the min max values

13278838
postgresql	mysql
use a real database server like postgresql or mysql -- they work because they are their own processes that manage their own files

13278903
stringstream	fstream
i don t want to use a stringstream or a fstream but rather what i suppose may be a custom stream that just acts as a giant byte array for whatever is passed to it

if getting the min max year is something that you need to do on a regular basis throughout your app i d put it in your service

13278971
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome return different values when accessing local storage via a key

13278972
zoo	xts
is it necessary to convert it to zoo or xts class

13279001
folder	directory
it is really easy to access files from assets folder for example if you want to read test.xml from assets directory you can use the following code

13279006
inherited	subclassing
and other classes such as nsset return type id because they can have subclassing nsmutablestring and nsmutableset respectively which will inherited this method

13279006
inherited	subclassing
as such these inherited calls need to return an instance of the subclassing s type and due to the rules of method naming you can t overload based on return type alone

13279007

integer	unsigned
i am trying to send an 16 bit unsigned integer over a unix socket

13279024
int	chars
to do so i need to convert a uint16_t into two chars then i need to read them in on the other end of the connection and convert it back into either an unsigned int or an uint16_t at that point it doesn t matter if it uses 2bytes or 4bytes i m running 64bit that s why i can t use unsigned int

13279028
int	double
now this doesn t cover the endianness of double being different than that of 64 bit int

13279028
int	double
an easier approach might be to cast your double into a 64 bit unsigned value then output that as you would any other int

13279040
post	put
when i tried to put the output in my post i ran out of characters so in case it s needed i put the entire output into a google doc

you can verify the hash in the database as well by using an online md5 hashing and get the length by measuring it using strlen

13279469
gridview	detailsview
i have inherited some code that has a gridview and a detailsview in a webpart control

13279469
gridview	detailsview
there s a dropdown list that filters the gridview by object type and the detailsview has an automatically generated insert button

13279469
hide	show
what i was hoping to be able to do is somehow capture the new event so i can put the commandargument value into a hidden field that the detailsview would then use to determine which type of object it s creating and also to show hide fields

13279470
cpython	pypy
try pypy instead of cpython

13279479

13279826
put	get
basically just get source code of all those missing packages and then put them into the api source and rename them into a name that is different from the original one and then change corresponding code in api that reference these methods as well you have to use a different name otherwise code reference methods in these package will still looking for methods in the core library i.e android api

13279830
margin	height
.outerheight true element height + padding + borders + margin

13279830
width	margin

but this logic fails for the larger images width and height as mentioned above

13280119
put	get
i assume when you say you want to put a file in a root folder of the project you are refering to a plugin that you are developing and then in runtime you want to get access to that file

13280170
children	parent
if the parent simply reads from the pipe it will block until one of the children has written to the pipe

13280170
children	parent
in order to distinguish the code the parent runs from the code the children run you check the return value of fork

13280170
children	parent
otherwise when the parent tries to do a read after the children have finished it will block waiting for it to close its own pipe

13286348
post	get
is there any way to do this perhaps as a transaction in tpl or tpl dataflow because at the moment when i run this the post does get started first but because the get is a fast operation it completes first and returns first and i would like them to happen in sequence as in a synchronous operation.

qobject	qmetaobject
then you can use qmetaobject invokemethod in order to call it only knowing that the base class is qobject note that you still need to know the qobject type of course. qt is internally just creating meta code that can be used to invoke methods by their names when they re marked with q_slot or q_invokable or in a slots section.

13286963
getter	setter
on the whole i would recommend exposing public variables on your php class except where you need to perform a more complex action in which case you would use getter and setter functions

13286964
submit	submission
as well since being submit button the default action is submission the form and i assume you don t want that

if the producer threads are waiting on a numemptyspaces semaphore for access to the queue this behaviour would probably happen anyway since it s unreasonable for the semaphore wait queue to be implemented in anything other than fifo but it s not guaranteed on most semaphore implementations

using public attribute or private with getter setter will both do the trick

13287018
getter	setter
if the attribute is critical use a getter and setter like this

13287018
getter	setter
because of the lack of strong type in php i will always prefer the private attribute with getter and setter

i was googling to find out the reason for type-casting of malloc and calloc

13287888
calloc	malloc
but i only found type-casting of malloc is not necessary since it return void pointer but what about calloc

13287888
calloc	malloc
now if we move back to first point about return value of malloc and calloc

13287888
calloc	malloc
what is the return value of malloc and calloc

13287888

is it necessary to type-cast malloc and calloc

13287924
calloc	malloc
is it necessary to type-cast malloc and calloc

13287924
calloc	malloc
the malloc and calloc functions return a pointer to the allocated memory that is suitably aligned for any kind of variable

13287924
calloc	malloc
null may also be returned by a successful call to malloc with a size of zero or by a successful call to calloc with nmemb or size equal to zero

is it necessary to type-cast malloc and calloc

it is right for both malloc and calloc

width	height
for wpf the unit size of these dimensions is set to 1 96th inch but when is ok on screen because default screen resolution is 96 dpi on the other side is wrong on the printer because it has a different resolution in other words confuting that height and width of the paper are read only properties if i cannot find the way to tell wpf that the unit size of the printer is not 1 96th inch but for example 1 300th inch if on the printer i previously set 300 dpi there s absolutely no way to print at higher resolution than 96dpi

13288118
width	height
a last note in my specific case i cannot use rendertargetbitmap and then resize all to match printer s paper height and width settings because i m printing high definition barcode images and it would cause an image rescaling that would make the barcode unreadable on final paper because i create it with the purpose to be printed with a resolution of 300dpi which without a resizing will result out of bounds because wpf is telling me the printer paper dimensions in the wrong unit size 1 96th inch despite the real dpis prevoiusly set on printer

maybe you calc the bottom right corner with left + width and top + height so you can check if this corner is under your div

if there are no dialogs appearing or notifications or toasts appearing after you receive that should be fine also if you want to be on the real safe side and only have one activity receiving at a time and only while the activity is visible move these to onresume and onpause

if you have a proper index that is a single index on the combination of width and height then the simple select on big_table will be way faster

these atributes may solve your problem here.otherwise you have to setup your layout dynamically with some ratios or factors you generate like textsize factor height using your screen height and width

13289912
width	height
if you want to make height and width on your own way than make custom class extend dialog like below

13289966

2 the second reason is of course to understand deeper what are the differences at the stack level between return of a custom data type and return of a basic data type like int or double

13290449
viewdidload	dealloc
please also note you are better to call in the beginning of the overridden viewdidload it makes sense as you need to let uiviewcontorller to do it s staff before you do some customized logic the dealloc is different as you need to do your logic before the standard nsobject -dealloc fires

13290465

cos	sin
the way i came up with solving the cos sin problem in dotless was to implement function extensions

13291658

you could split the send into 3 commands - operation int filename length int filename 0..n chars

13292229
put	get
otherwise there will be too much code to put in that block and all the escaping will get nasty

13292245

13292341
keydown	keyup
start moving on keydown don t stop until keyup

13292352

13292825
children	parent
edit to clearify in my edit view i add remove update existing childen in the children collection on the parent add remove is done using javascript

13292825
children	parent
however when attching the parent and saving the changes only added updated children are added modified in the database

13292825
children	parent
but removed children from the parent collection are not deleted in the database which i want them to be

13292841
minimum	max
also i noticed that adding new rows into collection if they don t need to be rendered immediately they will be out of the visible area is also very fast so we can limit the minimum set to 50 rows max visible rows and then add remove new rows as required

13292883
min	max
if setting default min and max values are possible i don t want to do that because the seekbar min and max values could change so doing math is better idea imo

13292910
post	get
i had previously managed to get a test program in monotouch working with the nuance speechkit by following the steps detailed in this post

13292911
post	put
to fix it you can put in the following code in your functions.php to remove post meta with a blank value for your custom keys

i get a zero returned when trying to post an image with no tmhoauth- response response being returned

13292930

this was tested in google-chrome v22 firefox v15 opera 12.1 ie9 ie9 set to browser modes 9 compat 9 8 7 and quirks mode

13293015
width	height
my guess purely a guess unfortunately is that one of those values is changed while the width height values stay the same

13293015
width	height
if you need the width height value of a scaled object you can just multiply the width height values by their respective scale properties

13293098
ddms	adb
there s a few times where i have problems like adb acting up and i have to run commands on the command-line like adb kill-server and ddms would freak out and try to reconnect usually 11 attempts

another user reported that listeners defined on a volume using the xfs filesystems were also ignored

13293281

when maven evaluates the pom.xml files and creates the effective poms aggregated with inherited some properties are excluded from being inherited

13293432
children	parent
your entities - parent and children - are in a detached state when you do the modification in the view

13293432
children	parent
to solve the problem you must load the current object graph - parent including children - from the database compare it with the object graph from your view and merge the changes into the loaded graph

13293436
onresume	onpause
from the onresume method and add it to the onpause method

13293452

i noticed this to be a problem even when futexes are not used directly but also when calling malloc free rand glib mutex calls and other system library calls that make calls to futex

13293452
free	malloc
when i stopped the process with gdb the backtraces showed the calls to __lll_lock_wait_private __lll_unlock_wake_private are made from malloc and free

13293507
width	height
i added four attributes to the layout called top left width and height

13293507
width	height
so if you set width but not height the image will scale in width and wrap_content for height

13293507
int	double
i achieved the precision you are looking for by using double float precision variables instead of int

13293507
hide	show
i also added a button to show hide the overlay image and one to switch between the activities

13293510
post	get
our network stack that talks to a rest server works fine in almost all situations except when we do a get shortly after doing a larger post

13293510
post	get
that attempt after should be a get that then pulls the data from the server that includes the new entry added via the post

13293510
post	get
however all we get is again what appears to be the last line from the output stream from the post

13293556
maven	pom.xml
i am using the maven enforcer plugin with the dependency converge in a multi module build so it runs the enfrocer plugin for every pom.xml in the build

interesting result so my class custom qgraphicsitem class the parent of the ellipses is a qobject so i can filter incoming mouse events from the scene

13293605
hide	show
the plan is that if any of the list items match then it should show the highest parent and hide all the others that don t have matching items

13293605
hide	show
i ve tried using the jquery each method to find all the items that contain the query and show them but it instead hide them all.

13293661
uipangesturerecognizer	uipageviewcontroller
one workaround that comes to my mind is laying a transparent subview on top of your uipageviewcontroller and add to it a uipangesturerecognizer to intercept that kind of gesture and not forward further

hide	show
jquery simple checkbox to hide and show divs product filtering which was answered excellently by manseuk

13294172
google-chrome	firefox
the other option you have is the coreanimation model with the invalidatingcoreanimation model on firefox and google-chrome

13294176
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter
it seems that dom s event order should be mouseover - mouseenter - mouseout - mouseleave which means that sometimes the cancel will be called before the delay is set

13294185
width	height
i found the solution this was happing b c i was resizing the div that the google earth was in it i use a fixed height and width works well

13294193

it somehow converts the suffix of the getter and setter to work like an actual field reference

13302732
getter	setter
so it shows error on compile when they don t put an actual field s name which is the suffix of the getter and setter function

13302732
getter	setter
i just want to replicate the system to ease the developers from having to use looping getter and setter to make a table

13302758
width	height
imagine this case a rectangle that we want that its height is always equal to its width a square let s say

13302758
width	height
for that case we are not obliged to mention the name of the binding object and the width will be always equal to the height whenever the height is changed

if you want to parameter the width to be the half of the height then you can do this by adding a converter to the binding markup extension

children	parent
another approach to satisfy 1nf instead of creating the new table struct for children is that we can switch to children-centric thinking and have just one table with a record per child which will include all the information about the parent of the child

children	parent
info about the parent obviously will be repeated in as many records as many children this parent has

the original compiler warning was because the multi-character constant n has a value of type int which is outside the range of values that can be stored in a chars so when c is promoted to int the comparison with the implementation-defined value of n is bound to be true

13314804

change the order of the gets and the puts - i thought maybe there was an entity group locking problem that i don t understand but switching the order of the gets or the puts didn t change the behavior

also adjust width and height as needed

13317773
put	get
the location of i variable is somewhere on the top and lets assume that it is 0x200 and the return address is located in a lower address 0x180 so in order to determine the where about to put the return address and yet to leave some space for the shellcode the attacker must get the difference which is 0x200 - 0x180 0x80 128 so he will break that down as follows ++ the return address is 4 bytes so we have only 48 bytes we left before reaching the segmentation

13317775
width	height
this is indeed possible to be cross browser compatible you will need to have width and height set in the html and body tags as well

13317824
inherited	properties
you could try making the properties an inherited dependency properties

13317868
qiodevice	qfile
the qiodevice vs qfile distinction isn t necessary but i personally favor using the base class

13317877
gif	png
and given the source data 256-color gif images png is likely to compress at least as well or even better

13317883

as to handling additional levels of parent and children you might need to choose between flexibility and efficiency

13317952

ah it s a chars but the function takes an int

13318188
int	chars
i ll just convert the chars to an int and pass it along

13318188
int	chars
now this chars has the value -124 so i ll just convert it to an int with the value -124

13318188
int	chars
but you should be aware of conversions to int especially when chars may hold a negative number

13318207

when i originally asked my question i had already renamed the images in dir folder but i had a backup of them so mixed the to jobs together and got my goal

13318400
min	max
for your min and max requirements i would recommend putting the requirements at the application level since it seems more application logic than a constraint on the database

13318412

13318598
return-value-optimization	nrvo
can be optimized away by return-value-optimization nrvo

13318598
return-value-optimization	nrvo
can be optimized away by return-value-optimization nrvo too

13318598
return-value-optimization	nrvo
as i said above even in a case with an unnecesary copy is possible and it can be optimized away by return-value-optimization nrvo

13318598
return-value-optimization	nrvo
so copy-elision return-value-optimization nrvo are still very important even in c++11

13318598
return-value-optimization	nrvo
and by the way when copy-elision return-value-optimization nrvo happens - it is faster than move

13318598
return-value-optimization	nrvo
for instance if you have function that returns vector even if move return-value-optimization nrvo copy-elision would be applied - it still may be not 100 efficient

13318771
carrierwave	fog
the problem turned out to be unrelated to carrierwave or fog

13318781

13318867
alertdialog	datepickerdialog
if you just want to initialize it with the current date as a reminder of what today is or at least don t need it to change as the user interacts with the picker you can do it by creating a temporary variable and calling the settitle charsequence method on it since datepickerdialog extends alertdialog

13319755
children	parent
notice how entries are for the most part sequential it s a sequential identifier not a hash mostly though not always grouped together the identifier reflects chronology not structure it captures insertion sequence which happened in single or multiple batches sometimes years and thousands of identifiers apart at the other end of the database and notice how parent nodes always come after their children sometimes after holes

13319755
versioning	upgrade
if you think there s more you need to know you may want to further inquire with websphere commerce experts as to what exactly lowe s might be using specifically for its n-xxxxxxx catalogue though i suspect that whatever it is is 90 + custom. fwiw i believe home depot who also appear to be using websphere upgrade to versioning 7 earlier this year

you cant have a declaration for two different data types in the for-loop so you need to push the vector or i inside loops but you could assign the values

13320865
put	get
define the overloading operator before you use it put its signature in the header file or define it as forward before using it otherwise you will get the default qdebug behavior

13320890

try-catch	exception-handling
to avoid this behavior the best approach is to actually catch and handle exception-handling by using try-catch blocks

13321094
implements	extends
normally it should be part of a class implements an interface actionlistener as coding.mof said or extends a class like mouseadapter and that class should be set to listen for actions on the buttons with a method like addactionlistener

13321168
google-chrome	safari
at a certain point the app requests a collection resource and inside google-chrome and safari i get an error like that

just one thing to keep in mind while using weights is that attribute for which you are giving the weight height width should be assigned value 0dp in the xml only then the weights will work correctly

13321680
gmail	hotmail
one thing that i have thought of is that the user will have to initially authenticate with oauth oauth2 using his email id yahoo hotmail gmail -- and only after that the app will actually show the admin interface

13321706
int	double
the spec strictly points that in the end however both int and double have to be store in primitive arrays - and here comes my question

13321706
int	double
i can t use an array from the beginning since i don t know the size or even an upper bound and using toarray also woulnd t work as i have to have primitive int and double in the end not objects of int and double

13321728
implements	extends
since you didn t define in multiple spots i would suggest you refactor the print job in its own class extends thread and implements starting the print job in the run method

13321735
int	double
however if your datagrid column already contains a numeric type like double or int you don t need to call tostring and then parse the string

now you have a pointer to a memory area of sizeof double bytes or sizeof double sizeof int int that can be encrypted

13322099
try-catch	exception-handling
you may always use a try-catch statement to see if an exception-handling was thrown from the code you provide and do something if required

13322099

i have this theory i can grab the file size using fseek and ftell and build a dynamic array as a buffer

13322274
multiplying	multiplication
for in the long multiplication method if you want to multiplying binary number 1001 by 1011 the procedure would look like

13322291
direct3d	direct2d
on windows 7 only direct3d 10 support interoperate with direct2d

13322291
direct3d	direct2d
on windows 8 direct2d can interoperate with direct3d 11

13322357
fgets	fgetc
fgetc is a function to read a single char simpler than using fgets

13322369
realloc	malloc
you could consider allocating the buffer dynamically by first creating a buffer of a fixed size using malloc and doubling with realloc the size when you fill it up

13322373
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have managed to make the menu perfect in firefox google-chrome and opera but in ie i ve got a little 4-5px gap at the end of the last element

instead try to use html anchor link - or html.actionlink in asp.net-mvc to reload the page or redirect somewhere

13322414
subtract	add
also instead of trying to assign an actual value to your current vote variable will notice that i simply use add subtract which makes it a lot easier when you run into many logic branches lot s of if

13322415
put	get
what you want to get in put in

13322423
hash	salt
encoding the salt and password bytes which may produce different results than just encoding everything as a single string which is what the hash function does

13322427
soundpool	audiotrack
i am quite new to android and java and i am also surprised that there doesn t seem to be a solution in pure java either by use of maybe soundpool or audiotrack

13322449

jar	manifest.mf
added the jar in the manifest.mf in the classpath bundle-classpath . lib jersey-client-1.14.jar

13322485
debian	linux
the solution should work at least for linux debian and redhat and os x 10.7+

13322520
profiler	visualvm
i would suggest using a profiler such as visualvm to determine which thread causes the issue and potentially what the exact circumstances are when it happens

13322575
implements	extends
i have a custom adapter which extends arrayadapter it implements the view holder patterns to show data text + image from a web service

13322575
disk	ram

13322635
margin	height
the .abouttile and the .gallerytile both have 105px height and a 10px margin between them

13322635
margin	height
or better yet to have 220px height and a 10px bottom margin

13322642
stdout	stderr
given my code below if you moved setenvironment to above #parent process code goes here you would see all but one real stdout and real stderr actually appearing in parent.log

13322642
stdout	stderr
the ideal is to remove any reliance on redirecting stdout stderr for logging

13322642
children	parent
this way the parent and children can simply request the correct log category rather than mess around with file handles

13322671
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
update interesting i m not getting anything with firefox or opera but i am with google-chrome

13322671
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it seems like google-chrome is following the spec and taht firefox and opera are not

13322671
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
with all three browsers i tried google-chrome firefox opera the element gets a red background while the mouse is down and goes white again when i release it

it works fine in viewdidload and viewwillappear but it doesn t work anywhere else

13322764
free	malloc
malloc free

13322764
free	malloc
you use pointer to structs in your outer struc so you must use malloc and free

if it does not work please post a few more details about the error you get

13322823
dictionary	map
store textures in map dictionary hashtable that maps file names to weak pointers to textures

13322823
lisp	scheme
however i m not quite sure how to port this scheme to common lisp because

13322852
margin	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	box-sizing	margin
alternatively try using padding instead of margin and box-sizing border-box browser support

13322862
maven	pom.xml
edit if you go this route i suggest following chapter 5 of the user guide on maven integration for setting up your pom.xml etc

13322876
express	node.js
i have app in node.js and express

13322933
keydown	keyup
to detect other keys use keydown and keyup

13322933
keydown	keyup
separately for your purposes i d probably trap the events on document rather than on a specific element keydown and keyup bubble so that works

13322967
hash	md5
i want to turn an md5 hash to a string

13322993
int	chars
if you marshal it to a chars type like ansichar you will have to convert the chars to an int value a byte before using it

13323004
implements	extends
public class helloandroid extends activity implements sensoreventlistener

13323007
ubuntu	linux
i don t know if it matters but x is windows server and y is ubuntu linux

filtering	grouping
you can grouping tbl_interviews by user_id to count the number of interviews per user and then filtering for users who have more than one interview in addition to having an interview this year

13323078
integer	unsigned
so let s say we have as our 4 bytes the ending result is a 32-bit unsigned integer

13323189
put	get
it might be ok for very simple scenarios but the more features you try to put in the harder it will get -- until the point where it becomes unmaintainable

13323190
hash	md5
no just using hash especially when just applying md5 to the password isn t secure because

13323190
hash	md5
md5 is prone to collisions so even with a hash prefer sha 256 or better

13323190
hash	salt
hash a constructed string for example username+ salt +password you can use a constant salt as long as it s not used by other programs it s enough for most uses

13323190
hash	salt
3 to store in database the username the salt if not constant and the hash

13323190
hash	salt
when authenticating a user you build the hash in the same way using the username and password given by the user and the salt you have in database and you compare the username and the hash to what you have in database

13323193
public	protected
if it s anything else - protected public or default package declaration then it should work

13323204
hash	salt
if you ve salt your password hash an attacker can t use general rainbow table attack against you the hash results from password and deliciously-salty-password won t match

13323207
hash	salt
a better approach is to use salt passwords as this make hash databases quite useless

13323229
inherited	properties
the general rule when using this method is that default values for simple literal properties strings numbers booleans can be set on the prototype directly but any properties that inherited from object including arrays and dates should be set to null and then initialized in the constructor

13323229
inherited	properties
it s very nice for inherited because of the second parameter that you can use to add additional properties to an existing prototype but it also is more verbose and makes it so instanceof checks no longer work the alternative in this example would be to check person.isprototypeof tim

13323290
debian	linux
it tends to be a simpler process and it means that you can distribute beyond debian systems to rpm based linux installs and mac windows

13323354
prepare	execute
this code wait 200ms execute a callback and prepare a new callback execute 200ms later

13323418
lisp	scheme
there is owl lisp a dialect of scheme r5rs with all data structures made immutable and some additional pure data structures

13323429
put	get
this is what i put into the manager to get the page to change

13323438
vim	emacs
i tried to generate the text file with vim emacs and echo -n hello file-to-buff.txt only vim adds a line break automatically

13323464
min	max
right now the intervalls are stored seperately in an arraylist with min 0 100 200 500... and max 100 200 500...

13323480
gruntjs	yeoman
i can eventually pack them up in a single vendor.js file using yeoman brunch or simple gruntjs that will be server in the html in a script tag

13323527
jar	war
i am using tomee to deploy an ear file that contains one ejb jar and one war

13323551
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox and ie 10 but not in ie 8 or lower..

13323555
min	max
min 0 100 200 500... and max 100 200 500...

13323598
hash	salt
the client then does something special with that value doubles it hash it with some salt uses it in a table lookup etc and uses the result in the next server request

13323618
division	multiplication
so in the end very often a bit shift means either multiplication shift to left or division shift to right because that s what it results in

13323618
division	multiplication
compilers often prefer replacing multiplication and divisions with number of bit shifts because for the computer shifting the bits is much faster than actually doing real multiplication or division of the values

13323653
post	put
or if you wanted to put a more general error message just leave your viewmodel properties decorated with the required attribute then in your login controller in the post method do something like this

13323658
migrate	upgrade
migrate and upgrade tfs collection from tfs 2010 to tfs 11 beta video

13323702

note that the reason pressing w fixes the problem is it sends a keydown event which would be ignored and then a keyup event finally releasing the key

13323790
min	max
fetch max - min 256 number of bytes and add them up

13323790
min	max
lets take min 0 max 1000 as an example

13323836
hide	show
but when i click on the tab the url in the browser just changes to this and doesn t hide show the data

13323875
background-image	background-color
background is just a shortcut that allows you to declare color+image+other properties at the same time instead of using background-color then background-image etc.

13323893
width	height
i set the imageview scale to width fit_content and height match_parent and it scales accordingly

13323903
range	max	range	min	min	max
for an integer in the range min max you would need ceil log2 max-min+1 bits

13323911

try googling postgresql select random row and you ll get half a dozen useful stackoverflow questions and also a link to an old blog post on depesz.com which covers the various options

13325193
ocp	principles
this is also better than creating a single vehicle which accepts a car or truck as in future if a 3rd class was required say coach then you could create a coachadapter without having to change any of the existing caradapter or truckadapter code which allows you to follow ocp open closed principles - code should be open for extension and closed for modification something you could not achieve with a vehicle class as you would have to modify it to support coaches

13325901
children	parent
we simply want to temporarily restore the original stdout immediately before rewiring it into tee so that tee inherits it as its standard output and actually writes directly to the original stdout your terminal instead of writing in the case of the forked children through the parent s tee which is where the child s stdout normally pointed to before this change by virtue of inheriting from the paremnt process and which is what injected those child lines into parent.log .

13325930

you are casting the int value to chars but then trying to assign it to a byte variable and for doing that you have to cast explicitly to byte this is neither c nor c++ anymore

13326119
onmousedown	onmouseup	onclick	onmouseup	onclick	onmousedown
the alert comes up between the onmousedown and the onmouseup events causing an onclick to never trigger

13326141
implements	extends
if i implements ifoo i must also implements ibar because ifoo extends ibar thus it makes sense to show that foobar also implements ibar and ibaz otherwise i d only see ifoo and would have to navigate to ifoo to see ibar etc.

13326275
width	height
in order to successfully create your plot pass larger values to the width and height arguments of jpeg

13326275
width	height
here s a function with an hwfact argument that should be a numeric value by which to multiply the height and width of your jpeg

13326275
width	height
so it took a jpeg with a width and height of 1500 that s 500 3 to create a completely illegible plot

13346453
realloc	malloc
instead of using realloc with a null or uninitialized first argument just use malloc to begin with

13346453
realloc	calloc
if the realloc call is necessary in the call then on the previous line use calloc instead - that will at least zero out the allocated memory so that realloc is given a proper null pointer

13346460

a linearlayout with layout_weight specified for height width will allow you to simulate a percentage based layout otherwise you can use fill_parent when you want to use the whole screen width height

13346520

my guess would be that firefox and google-chrome are handling the form element generated by this line differently

13347497
email	dkim
for the sake of simplicity i can live with doing so only for gmail users as gmail signs all of its outgoing email using dkim

13347596

13348558
mouse	keyboard
thereâ s no how to do it microsoft just took it off because now the objects align with other objects and you have 3 options to move the objects now with mouse by selecting the object and moving with your arrows in keyboard which moves around 0 30 cm and by holding ctrl and pressing arrows which is more precisely

activemq	rabbitmq
as an alternative approach i would recommend using an existing framework such as rabbitmq or activemq for this

13348657
graphics2d	bufferedimage
first check if you are calling dispose on graphics2d created via bufferedimage.creategraphics then check if you are calling flush method on bufferedimage you have created when you do not want to use this image any more

13348678
hash	md5
another thought would be to compute an md5 hash of the js file and use that in the path

13348680
strlen	memmove	strlen	strcpy	strcpy	memmove
instead of using memmove and strlen just use strcpy

13348688

13348720
folder	directory
i have an image map on my frontend and from there i need to access some images that are stored on different folder under the fileadmin directory

13348732
strlen	strcpy

13348733
put	get
on the 2nd sheet put your numbers in column a using autofill to get the progression or use as a formula to create the progression

13348759

i have got an error which tells index was outside the bounds of the arrays i dont know y it was happening since after completeting the for-loop and entering loops fresh again it was showing the variable value when exited from loops before

13348889
getter	setter
a property like that in groovy compiles to a private field plus a public getter and setter so in the superclass taglib you have implicitly

13348889
superclass	subclassing
when you declare myexampleservice again in the subclassing the subclassing gets its own private field with the same name and the setter gets overridden to store the supplied value in this subclassing field instead of the superclass one

13348889
getter	setter	superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
the subclassing has access to the superclass properties via the inherited getter and setter so it doesn t need to re-declare it

13348895
put	get
sql you never put quotations around column names...get rid of the ones around username too.and get one around the username value this one here

13348910
post	get
if you are only testing via get because it s easier to do but will use post or some protocol other than http in your actual app then you might consider using the wcf test client for debugging instead of the browser and or fiddler

13348920
min	max
from min to max

13348945
apache	nginx
a more modular system would be for you to write a script which when invoked will bootstrap a new db schema new virtuelenv install all necessary things into it add a site config for the new site to nginx apache and then restart the nginx apache

13348984
int	chars
i have worked on python and i know that to concatenate a string to be --- you can simply multiply an int by the chars - so in this case we can simply do it like result 3 -

children	parent
your loop might work if you had it like this since you are query the parent node each time for its children a list of node that will actually change as you move around

13349056
typedef	struct
it can be counter intuitive because i m using the same name for struct stacknode and the typedef stacknode

13349056
typedef	struct
i like it because if i am already going to typedef the struct i don t like resorting to struct stacknode nxtptr using the word struct inside the struct definition

13349062
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if the data you re working with is too complicated to easily store one item per line in a text file you could do a similar thing with objectinputstream and objectoutputstream which can read and write one java object at a time to a file

13349078
put	get
just put it in a string and get its length

13349113
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
all other browsers - firefox google-chrome safari opera and ie9 - works fine

13349129
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
to do so you d need to also pass to the function a pointer to the previous buffer which if shorter could be recycled with no need for a further malloc and if longer would be free d and reallocated or one could use realloc

13349135
fadein	fadeout
using jquery you can use the fadein and fadeout functions

the password is the to be hash using either sha-512 or bcrypyt i have done a little research and have seen a lot of people saying md5 is no longer secure enough i want to ensure the best security possible so what should i use to hash the passwords

13349197
hash	salt
i have also added a randomly generated salt using the following snippet which this appended to the front of the hash password and then rehashed

13349252
unixodbc	iodbc

13349298
post	get
after the mobile client get the accesstoken and facebook id it will post authresouce to django server with facebook_id as username and accesstoken

13349316
istream	getline
istream getline on the other hand discards the trailing n and so each subsequent iteration waits for and discards the first character of your input

13349339
width	height
the problem with preview and i assume also pdfkit behind it is that when you set the rotation to 90 it does not simply set the rotate attribute to 90 but it switches the page width and height and applies a transformation on the page content stream so that the page content appears rotated

13349343
hash	salt
if you had your salt hardcoded or somewhere else he would just have the hash passwords

13349345
unixodbc	iodbc
you ll be better off updating iodbc with all the latest patches apple tends to be a bit behind on these than shifting to unixodbc

13349392

serializable	deserialization
personally for my complicated data structures that i want to send receive over mpi i always implement serializable deserialization methods that pack unpack the whole thing into from an array of chars

13349450
hash	salt
edit if they gain access to your db they will have only your hash password and salt

13349536
fadein	hide
the problem with the script is that i think it should be an easy way just to point out to fadein one div class and hide the other items instead of writing every div class to hide which make the script pretty big

13349553
spaces	delimiter
i want to remove a asterisk from my matrix and write out that matrix to a text file and the remaining elements will be concatenated to each other without a spaces or any kind of delimiter

13349564

this can cause problems when plugins trigger overly generic names like open close show hide start end etc. yet so many plugins out there even ones from large libraries like jqueryui and bootstrap trigger these generic events without a second level namespace

13349764
hide	show
to provide a more concrete example suppose i m using plugin a which triggers the show and hide events on tooltips as the user hovers over certain text

so long answer short there isn t a direct method that i can find that will give you the straight float value of the height or width of your rectangle

13350071
getter	setter	width	height
at the end of the day if you need to get directly at your height and width i would recommend just creating a custom class and storing the body together with the float values and using getter setter

13350105
width	height
yourâ question answerâ isâ notâ soâ simple youâ needâ toâ useâ differentâ logicâ meansâ youâ knowâ how much width and height your each view have after clicking on it andâ then you can pass the reference of view to setcontentsize of scrollview.here is some tutorial which solved my problem when i was putting some run time data in scrollview

i can get the high low easy enough by doing a subselect in the select portion where i max min and join the data by product hr

13350862

13352027
getter	setter
this means limiting access to fields directly and using setter and getter where appropriate

13352032

subtract	add
so you basically have a list l and a number y-x if you must add x and get y it is easy to see it is equivalent to get y-x and you want to add subtract each element in l and get closest as possible to the value y-x

13352243
partition-problem	np-complete
note that the problem is equivalent to partition-problem which is np-complete since if you have a list l and values such that - you need to find two sublists l1 l2 such that and which is exactly partition-problem

13364241
disk	ram
you maintain in memory ram an array of pointers - these pointers indicate a disk address which contains a bucket that includes all entries with the corresponding hash value

13364299
subtract	add
the y-axis also seems to be flipped from what i used in the gluortho2d call discovered by making events add or subtract from x y coordinates of the image subtract from the y coordinate causes the image to move downward

13364323
portrait	landscape
everything works perfectly in portrait but cant figure out how to flip it to correctly work in landscape

you can use that method to load the file into memory and then use the nsdata instance method writetofile to save the file

13364673
nsurlconnection	nsoutputstream
the trick here though is if you want to download multiple files you either have to download them sequentially or encapsulate the nsurlconnection and the nsoutputstream such that you can have separate copies of those for each simultaneous download

13364673
restkit	asihttprequest
you might rather want to contemplate using an established third-party library such as asihttprequest or restkit

udp	tcp
no matter what the protocol - tcp udp or anything else - many smaller packets will be less efficient than fewer larger packets

13364677

in firefox page looks good like i want but in google-chrome and opera li elements are not in the middle of main div

13364761
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i think it s because google-chrome and opera add border height to li height so in these browsers li elements are 1px higher then in firefox but i m not sure if this is a reason

13364761
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i would like to have effect in google-chrome and opera exactly the same like in firefox

13364789
free	realloc
realloc frees your old block if necessary so you should remove the free stack line in increase_stacksize

13364819

you realloc and then free the original stack

13364819
free	realloc
in short don t free the original after a realloc

13364822

getter	setter
say i have a class implementation in gwt that is more complex than a pojo but whose methods are still relatively simple it has some utility methods in addition to its getter and setter such that i can call new foo successfully in both client and server code

13365074
getter	setter
we are currently using jackson on the server side and autobeans on the client side but that is strictly limited to pojo classes because autobeans come from an interface containing only getter and setter and there s no way to automatically pull that data into the more useful object

x86	64bit
when it is installed in windows 7 64bit typically it installs at â œc program files x86 â instead of â œc program filesâ

13366591

however i m also trying to use pyusb with a libusb backend to detect which usb devices are plugged in at any given moment

13366629
libusb	pyusb
in order to use pyusb to determine which devices are plugged in i need to use libusb to generate a driver for the webcam

the driver generated from libusb is automatically installed and then i can use pyusb s find usb.core.find method to enumerate the usb devices connected

13366671
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i think the problem is that you have added the values to the array and when u exit and return viewwillappear is called again which adds the same data to the array once again hence doubling the data for this you should do the code in viewdidload method

getter	setter
have public getter and public setter methods for that private data and access it through them

13366758
for-loop	loops
the for-loop specification then goes on to allow you to omit clause-1 so that you can declare or initialize variables elsewhere and you can omit expression-3 so that you are not required to evaluate any expression upon completion of each loops

13366758
for-loop	loops
the while loops and the do loops are strict and require an expression but the for-loop is a flexible iteration statement

13366827
put	get
it is not good practice to get and put values from html elements using html which somehow belong to calculation or integers values therefore always use hidden fields for this type of problems like i have included two hidden fields one for original value and one for the final value and at the end you can get the total marks values easily from the hidden field

13366830

13366879

13367155
spaces	delimiter
if you have a comma + spaces delimiter you can use -f instead of just -f

13367179
spaces	delimiter
the regex for field separator delimiter for your input matches a comma followed by zero or more spaces so your input can be any of

13367179
spaces	delimiter
the output field separator delimiter for your output will be explicitly a comma followed by a spaces so output looks consistent

move the button declaration to inside of your oncreate method and place them after your setcontentview r.layout.main

13367286

you cannot use findviewbyid without a context or an active layout call this method in oncreate after setcontentview

13367322
children	parent
now in the above example styles the confusion whether to apply styles to the parent element or the children elements

13367322
inherited	properties
the child element would inherited properties from it s parent elements

ember.js	backbone.js
this all changes somewhat if you re using a client-side mvc framework like backbone.js or ember.js but you didn t specify that so i m assuming you re going with stock rails

13367737
getter	setter
your enemy class no longer has to worry about the implementation details such as the getter and setter methods of your character class

13367744

onresume	onpause
- onpause and onresume are correctly controlled for the view

13367861
width	height
looking at the stretching properties in the attributes inspector of a uiimage the x and y values are the positions for the stretch starting point relative to the entire width and height of the image

13367861
width	height
the width and height are sizes for the stretchable area relative to the image size

13367861
width	height
most stretchable images will stretch from the middle so using these values for x y width height will usually work

13367861
width	height
note unless you have a very small image you are stretching this means that width and height properties will be very small 0.008 and 0.0 can be used instead

13367861
width	height
so practically speaking 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0 will almost always work for x y width height

13367861
width	height
in the small number of cases that 0.0 does not work for width and height this does mean you need to use a calculator to set these values in ib

13367916
width	height
another possibility would be to use it regularly embed it in a page in a normal way but position it absolutely make it full width height of a page and then use z-index css property to put it behind all the other dom elements on a page

13367935

13368109
children	parent
you need to set the width of a parent element and width of your children so they must go into next line

13368109
children	parent
the other posibility would be to set your parent element to position relative and then use position absolute on all children and simply precisely position them with top 20px

13368120

i am using the css code above and in both google-chrome and firefox this is giving the header a total width of 960px like desired however in my safari 6.02 which should just support box-sizing without the need for a prefix but i put one in as a fallback anyway i am getting a total width of 980px which means it is sized upon the content-box

13368513
post	get
hyperlinks do a get not a post that is why my previous code above was not working

13368538
getter	setter
what you can do with roslyn is create an abstract syntax tree based on an a file loop over the files of all types and for each ast search for properties that don t contain getter and setter explicitly defined and replace that ast with one that has the props the way you like them

the other option for you is to fflush the stdout which will force it to print anything buffered regardless of the n

13380938

now that works flawlessly but as soon as i start the script to use the joystick the mouse is useless because my python routine sets the value back to its original whenever a new joystick event comes in

udp	tcp
in contrast to traditional vpn which uses ipsec ip protocol with which many home routers and firewalls have issues it uses tls over tcp ip and udp ip protocols

13381696

the bootstrap collapse plugin lacks any short-circuit code to prevent the hide or show method from getting executed twice

13381926
hide	show
someone had proposed having the plugin prevent unnecessary calls but the pull failed due to sloppy git etiquette see prevent collapse from getting stuck in transition state by calling show hide when already show hidden

13381926
hide	show
for now a simple workaround would be to do your own error catching and prevent hide and show from being called twice

insofar as inherited itself is concerned just for clarity the concept is that if something is just like something else but with extra properties nouns or actions verbs associated with it you need not re-write the common parts

13385546
inherited	properties
okay so that s all well and good now say somewhere down the line we get to birds now we have a choice on how to handle flight we can a add flight as a boolean somewhere in the inherited chain or b create an interface for flight perhaps we aren t concerned with where in the inherited tree an animal is we just want to know that it can fly and therefore has certain properties like altitude and actions like takeflight

the problem this method bypasses the ability to use getter setter methods and each property would have to be public to be accessible

13385586
getter	setter
dynamic getter setter method calls

13385586
getter	setter
another way i have considered is to create an array of fields and have a strict policy of naming the getter setter methods

13385847
equals	gethashcode
if objects are not equals then they must have different gethashcode

13385847
equals	gethashcode
but two objects that are not equals may have the same gethashcode

13385847
equals	gethashcode
if the gethashcode is the same then the tie breaker is equals

13386574
int	double
since your attributes are of different types and they are in string form so you would need to use appropriate conversion from string to int or string to double which i have not considered here

width	height
using 8 or 9 api it is impossible to set filter for exact width and height just screen size definition like normal large etc. and density

13387041
width	height
my code might be a bit off and only for one side of the room but conceptually you are checking if your camera position modified by an offset based on camera width or height is greater or less than the room position modified by an offset based on room width or height

13387053
paas	jelastic
jelastic is a robust solution with the benefits of paas and caas in a single turnkey package

13387193
getter	setter
a truly well-encapsulated class has no setter and preferably no getter either

13387193

maven	pom.xml
i know that installing regular jars via artifactory creates a pom.xml file for the jar and from then on you can treat the jar like any other maven dependency

13387457
rspec	capybara
next i tried to parse out my capybara tests from my lower level rspec tests in my guardfile like so

13387459
express	node.js
node.js provides modules that do that stuff express that the nginx sever does not have...other than the event loop async architecture that is why it is faster

13387460
sudo	passwd
runtime.exec every form of echo passwd | sudo -s

13387479

gridview	formview
i have a formview control on the page that i use to enter new rows into a database table and a gridview control on the same page to update delete rows from the same database table

13387552
gridview	formview
the formview control has validators on it to validate any input being thrown at the database and it seems to interfere with the gridview when i try to edit a row

13387552
gridview	formview
when i try to save the edit the validation control on the formview gets fired and an error comes up because the textbox input is blank so the gridview cannot save the modified table data

13387600
gridview	formview
use different validationgroups for your formview and gridview instead

13387607
disk	ram
if i d used longs instead and not had the need for them i would be wasting ram as well as hard disk space if these object instances were being stored in a relational database

13387617
sudo	passwd
i suggest you approach this problem differently such as with different sudo configuration so it doesn t require a passwd from whichever account a suid binary wrapper or something similar

13387696
udp	tcp
this works because when working with sockets you usually don t get the protocol headers just the udp tcp payload

13387715

google-chrome	firefox
now site works perfect on a comp browser iphone android google-chrome but in firefox on the andorid it appears to look different like its not reading the media queries

13387766
min	max
tabs are right-padded so when window is too small min max close buttons don t collide with tabs - this should be doable in tabcontrol template

13387849

i have a list collection a total of 7 item which i m looping through to create a gridview inside a listview

13387903
innodb	myisam
i have no idea id any of the other info is possible in mysql for myisam or innodb storage engines

13387921
int	chars
i need to read in every chars of the file individually whether it be int or whitespace so i can build a faithful array

13387979
rss	feed
the scenario is a person has clicked on a link to an rss feed

13387979
rss	feed
but as at current chrome does not natively support the rss atom feed protocol and presentation of rss feed in google chrome is best mediated by one or another of several available rss feed reader extensions

13387991
for-loop	loops
in a for-loop like the one above the first bit is only executed once at the beginning of loops

13387992
accessor	properties

13387998
put	get
put all of those in a linear regression and you should get a near vertical line

13388025

so i need to apply total width of children to its parent container

13388050
clearinterval	settimeout
to rest the timer user clearinterval timer and start the settimeout again

13388058

i updated your fiddle to get the same effect in google-chrome firefox w css havent tested other browsers by wrapping the image element in a group with an empty rectangle the same size and location of the image

13388241
changeset	cherry-pick
this will work for hotfixes and it is simpler than cherry-pick your development changeset from your default branch

13388257
children	parent
parent div has a fixed width of 1000 pixels children divs are set to display inline-block

13388257
children	parent
same parent and children but the width of the parent is dynamically determined by the number of div children you place in it

13388257
children	parent
however when you make the browser window smaller the parent div becomes as wide as the window and the children start wrapping around making the parent taller even though we set a fixed height

13388267
inherited	properties
...visual studio will create a properties in web service proxy called usercredentialsvalue which will map the consumer public properties which inherited from soapheader in the web service.

if you are really concerned once you merge you can squash but i would not bother the history is important

13388300
udp	tcp
the question is about general principle of tcp udp communication not as much about ssdp specifics

13388300
udp	tcp
udp doesn t know if some packet is a response to some other packet as with tcp

13388310
for-loop	loops
while this is certainly easier and arguably more readable to use than a for-loop keep in mind that it will perform no better than using a for-loop it s just hiding loops from you

13388333
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is refering to a collection but iqueryable is just a query and it will be generated inside a expression tree.we will run this query to get data from database

13388348
post	get
i ve created helper class so i need only to call one of http helper methods depending if it is get or post etc

13388362
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this isn t a bug because the behaviour is consistent across firefox google-chrome ie9 and safari on win7

13388440
implements	extends
so we have from a previous developer a bunch of dao type classes that i believe were auto-generated from coredata and then each of these classes has a category that extends it to implements certain methods

13388463
base	fractions
to see how is this possible consider the fractions 1 3 in base 3 it has a finite representation while in base 10 it s periodic

13388644
instances	transient
c.requestedtype will give you the type for which you re satisfying the dependency and making it transient will avoid the issue that all types would reuse the single instances of logger named after whatever the first type to request the dependency was

13388647
folder	directory
i ve removed the .build directory from within the project folder forcing it to rebuild the project and that hasn t fixed anything

13388673
box-sizing	border-box
.block has box-sizing property set to border-box

13388723
vbo	vao
most of the examples i found on the internet use them with just one vbo or two vbos where the second vbo defines a different attribute rather than the same attribute which is my case.i tried binding every vertex buffer index i generate for my object with a single vao but it did not work as below

13388723
vbo	vao	vbo	normals
in my second attempt i tried specifying just the layout to the vao using glvertexattribpointer for vertices and normals and not specifying the vbo and ibo ids and render as i was doing without vao first render code above but now i was not specifying the vertex layout using

13388725
innodb	myisam
i think the main advantage of myisam is that it will actually index on the fields you specify rather than indexing each specified index to the mandatory auto-generated primary key id a la innodb

13388726
rss	feed
the page has an rss feed of edits

13388726
rss	feed
if you wish to know when any page in the wiki is edited then the wiki index page and it s associated rss feed and should do the job

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
2 a uiviewcontroller contained within a uinavigationcontroller - which shows the main app content

13388789
uibezierpath	calayer
it works with a car a calayer and a uibezierpath as the race track and is solved in this order

13388811
int	chars
to convert the chars in the string into int for calculation use ord ch - 48 because 0 has the ascii code 48

13388817
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
but the biggest snag is that opera displays all images correct but just in firefox ie google-chrome are mentioned problems

13388849
hash	md5
although i am not sure why one would want to use a byte array as md5 hash here is my solution

13388855
min	max
2. i needed a min and max date on each field to ensure the end user can t select anything less than say 3 days from the start date see below

13388855
min	max
but when i come back i can t seemingly pre-populate the fields properly so that my min max date rules stay in-tact

13388855
min	max
how can i modify my code below to ensure my min max rules are preserved while re inserting the values

13388954
int	chars
you cannot use an int in your ui code to represent a chars 13 field if that field contains meaningful leading trailing 0s

13388964
getter	setter
synchronized getter and setter

13389049
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton

13389067
put	get
basically i have a bunch of data i get from a database and put onto my page in a table

13389078
hide	show
since there is no native implimentation of the visible pseudo selector i decided to use css classes to hide and show my elements thus allowing to simply just check for the class name instead of visibility

13389086
subtract	add
i need to go through each individual element see if it is in the range -pi element pi if it is not then we need to subtract or add a multiple of 2 pi to get the element in the range

minimum	max
so i basically have a minimum longitude and latitude of 0 and a max of 1 to work with

13389263

viewdidload	viewwillappear
try setting the frame for the table view in viewwillappear frames are still not defined in viewdidload

13389335
ssl	https
passing the access token directly in a url param could in theory be possible but the auth sever would have to make sure the redirect uri is using https with tls encryption and a trusted ssl certificate typically from a certificate authority that is not free to be sure that the destination server is legitimate and that the http request is fully encrypted

13389399
subtract	add
in chess for example you might assign point values to each piece and add up how much material each side has and subtract

13389434
folder	directory
below you should just select your image and click upload it moves the image to the folder but not the directory to the database

13389467
width	height
in my real code i figure out the total width and height of a rectangle that can encompass all them and then i divide that by the size of the bitmap to get my scaling factor

13389467
width	height
please keep in mind that i cannot rely on the pictureboxâ s scaling abilities stretch and i donâ t want to simply apply the scale to the width and height of all the rectangles because in my real code it wouldnâ t work very well

13389469
implements	extends
implements interfaces is not inheritance which is when you extends a class

vim	notepad++
use notepad or notepad++ or vim for windows or your editor of choice as long as it s capable of generating a text non word processing document

13389537
put	get
one of the suggestions-- not chaining through all the layers but letting exceptions bubble up to a top layer where i can control the logging -- is reasonable and as long as they get to the top level it s easy to put code in one place to log the root cause instead of the wrapper

i m aware that at that point the v8 engine stores the numbers as double rather than int

13389738
int	double

13390383
vmware	virtualbox
maybe some way to do this with virtualbox or vmware

13390407

tell maven-release-plugin included via the oss.sonatype.org parent pom.xml to execute only against the core project

client-side	server-side
it could take time to devise a method to completely take control of your db once the vulnerability is found especially if the attacking party has to spoof rewrite client-side code to be compatible with your vulnerable server-side validation

13397449
client-side	server-side
don t spend too much time trying to understand the subtilities of client-side alteration the most important part is a robust server-side validation

13397914
g++	gcc
for some reason i still couldn t compile it using gcc compiler but i could do it with g++ compiler

13397915
for-loop	arrays
to speedup this function you can omit the check it becomes your responsibility to keep the input right and collect the fortran results in an arrays and do the final calculations for all the small arrays without for-loop

13398006
ready	each
as you can see btel did in fact provide the solution but the problem lay in keeping the two processes in lockstep with each other so that the worker only starts working on a new task when the task is ready and so that the main process doesn t read the result before it s complete

13398056

hash	salt
when you first generate the hash you need to store both the salt and the final hash - then re-use that same salt for future comparisons

13398306
hash	salt
so you d change your createsaltedhash method to take a password and a salt and write a new createsalt method to generate the salt when a password is created changed which is stored alongside the final hash

13398318
post	get
it works up to rendering experimentform but after location has been submitted i get a 405 error method post is not allowed

if your process gives a huge stdout and no stderr communicate might be the wrong way to go due to memory restrictions

13398467
width	height
variables vid video id unique vw video width vh video height vx video x coordinate for canvas vy video y coordinate vsrc video source path to file

13398503
hash	salt
the problem with that is that if your database becomes compromised the attacker will have the salt and the hash password so they can more easily determine the real password

13398503
hash	salt
pepper is similar to salt but you don t store it the database with the salt and hash password

13398511

13398855
nsstring	nsxmlparser
- void parser nsxmlparser parser foundcharacters nsstring string

13398915
hash	salt
as i understand it when you create the password it automatically generates a unique salt for you which is then stored in the hash password string

13398915
hash	salt
so you do not store the salt separately but in the same field as the hash password

13398916

post	put
the xmlhttprequest post put will first send a http options request header to the resource on the other domain in order to determine whether the actual request is safe to send

13399570
put	get
another solution is to implement the write operation with the function urlfetchapp to send http put request in google apps script and then we can use xmlhttprequest get to trigger this apps script

13399592
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux
in unix specification there is a thread function called pthread_suspend and another called pthread_resume_np but for some reason the people who make linux freebsd netbsd and so on have not implemented these functions

you can also extends mouseinputadapter instead of implements mousemotionlistener

13400322
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
as such i simply added a section to my pom.xml file that uses the maven-antrun-plugin

you can store a hash table dictionary map that maps from an element in the tupple to the tupples it appears in

13400516
implements	extends
create a class extends relativelayout implements ontouchlistener

13400520
inherited	properties
i m still investigating the matter but in addition to seans suggestion you could alternatively you inherited from the image control hard-code the layout template path by overriding the properties value to point to your template then add that control to the toolbox with a different name

13400572
post	get
p.s. the best place to post questions and get a timely response is via our forums

13401542
viewdidappear	didreceivememorywarning
thus you will probably want to handle didreceivememorywarning to release the model data for the previous views in either your modal sequence or push sequence in which case on viewdidappear you ll want to see if your app had to release the memory in response to didreceivememorywarning and reload it in that case

13401542

if you are submitting a lot of data use a post request and put it in the message body instead of a query string

13402120
min	max
extend the key type to ones that allow for fields to be flagged as max or min values and provide a sorting algorithm that accepts them

13402127
versioning	upgrade
one reason because a complicated database structure mixed with the need to handle upgrade and downgrades of the different versioning of the app without losing data can quickly get out of hand

13402130
getter	setter
getter and setter

13402193
width	height
right now blocks below the slider is jumping up its because for example when window screen width is 900 element height is 300 and if screen width is 899 element height is 300 too

13402193

13402425
post	get
i m trying to write a couple of endpoints that will make get and post http requests to various backend services the format of data is all going to be very similar so responsehandler function will be copied over and over to different route function i wonder if there is a way to externalize responsehandler for reuse

13402426
wav	ogg
wav and ogg are though

13402848
interbase	firebird	postgresql	mysql
previously i forgot to mention databasebrowser a free small fast portable utility that i also use from time to time which can edit oracle mssql odbc mysql oledb postgresql sqlite interbase and firebird

13402850
apache	nginx
this is no different then a .htaccess file in apache that limits access by domain ip or an allow block in a nginx config

13402851
cout	cin
or remove the using namespace std and call std cin and std cout explicitly

13402853
awt	swing
not possible for awt textfield you can to add documentlistener only to swing jtextcomponents

13402853
documentfilter	jtextcomponent
maybe you need to use documentfilter for swing jtextcomponent s

13402928
public	protected
if a class had an internal or public member that was never used outside the class hierarchy it would be made protected etc

13402930
gitolite	gitosis
gitosis or the more recent gitolite makes it easy to use a git server for users not really used to linux and ssh and not having their own access

13402930
pull	push
if they re used to linux and they have to access the server for other reasons and everybody has his own public repository on the server and everybody just pull from other repositories and push to his own ones you don t really need gitosis

13402931
prepare	execute
create from the information_schema.columns table a string that contains the sql you wish to execute then prepare a statement from that string and execute it

13402950
subtraction	addition
matrix addition subtraction is only defined for matrices of the same dimensions

13402992
folder	directory
likely mathjax fails to detect its own root directory against which additional files urls are resolved or you actually miss the extensions folder

13402993
width	font-size
also using ems or for the nav elements like width font-size and paddings and or margins would be a good idea

13403055
int	boolean
i have tried to return the count variable but i get an error saying i can t return an int value from a boolean method which i expected

13403055
put	get
but i can t find a place in the code to put it since i always get an error stating that the println is unreachable code

13403074
implements	extends
however i am going to extends the functionality of the interface and these classes in the future to filter out the fake valid series based on certain criteria added to linq queries which is why i made the repositories implements

13403103
hide	show
here my idea is to add this tab to all the entities and hide show this tab by querying the config records with current entity name

13403106
median	minimum
in the documentation it says that for each entry 5 values are provided minimum q1 q2 median q3 maximum yet when i structure the mvldata like such

13403106
median	minimum
but i can only see 5 possible values not 7 or is there more than minimum q1 q2 median q3 maximum to a boxplot

13403109
client-side	server-side
the strange thing about this configuration is that for each application in the suite there s about 4 the client-side code is separated into it s own war file and the server-side code is separated into several war files

13403109
client-side	server-side
basically i have gotten server-side debugging working but i would like to get client-side debugging working via eclipse

13403109
jar	war
all shared components that we created window management system etc... were jar d up and included in each applications war file

13403166
hide	show
you can hide and show enums if you perfom the setvisible method directly on the panel you want to show

13403200
width	height
the way i would do it is i first check the width height of screen

13403200
width	height
then i compare that to width height of the image

13403200
width	height
put in mind you have to check the width height of your image in relation to that of the screen

13403200
width	height
for example if the image is too wide for the screen but not as high then the image should be scaled down with the width height ratio mantained so it will be displayed as a horizontal rectangle inside your div

13403247
hide	show
show and hide would be fine too

13403301
setinterval	settimeout
if you need it to run an animation at each invocation that s where d3.timer would be useful - otherwise the standard setinterval and settimeout methods are likely to be easier

13403325
strcpy	strncpy
best thing you can do though is to follow the same approach used by safer functions of standard library like strcpy vs strncpy you pass a third parameter which is the maximum length that should be copied eg

13403334
try-catch	exception-handling
have tried throwing exception-handling and playing with try-catch but i m out of my element at this point

13403350
int	boolean
the value can be string int boolean probably others

13403381
ng-view	ng-include
i had template html files views loaded with ng-view from routeparameters and an ng-include referring one of these templates within another one of them

13403386
uninstall	upgrade
the upgrade path from 2010 - 2012 actually gets you to fully uninstall 2010 so the upgrade + migration to another box is pretty much the same just with a db backup restore added in

13403469
salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5	hash	salt
from my understanding of the crypt docs this provided salt value should specify that crypt run in md5 mode which will produce a hash of the format 1

13403469
hash	md5
the 1 specifies the value was hash with md5

13403563
integer	unsigned
problem how to test check if a value is an unsigned integer uint in javascript

13403563
integer	unsigned
about this shows how to test check if a value is an unsigned integer uint in javascript

13403564
integer	unsigned
about this shows how to test check if a value is an unsigned integer uint in javascript

13403565
pop-up	dialog
i also have created a pop-up dialog box as well

13403573
portrait	landscape
also it might be better to make the inputview have the same width of the screen 768 portrait 1024 landscape

13403600
int	chars
signed chars signed short int signed int signed long int signed long long int are called standard signed int types

13403600

textview	simpleadapter	simpleadapter	convertview
you ll need to override the simpleadapter s getview int position view convertview viewgroup parent method and cast the result to a textview

13403770
qevent	qwidget
there is qwidget event qevent in its stack trace

13403770
children	parent
qobject cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread

13403785
superclass	subclassing
here the superclass will hold the reference of the subclassing and the methods which are overridden by subclassing will be executed of the subclassing otherwise all the methods of the superclass will be executed

13403806
int	chars
chars are not int in php you need to call ord on them to get meaningful comparison with the number literals

13403813
for-loop	arrays
that s because your num 3 count arrays 3 and the outer for-loop has no bearing on inner for-loop

13403831
superclass	subclassing
that means that such a variable can point to an object of type superclass or any of its subclassing

13403836
japplet	jdialog
like jframe and jdialog japplet is a swing top-level container

13403848
backtracking	greedy
greedy which just reduces to backtracking

13403855
realloc	malloc
btw i have omitted to check whether realloc or malloc returns null signifying a memory error

13403915
int	chars
you are confused by the combination of your incorrect test of chars against int and the reassignment of in a tight loop

13403917
children	parent
for the strange put request on the children it s because when deleting the parent ember-data nullifies the parent property on the children

13403930
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are done as two instructions

13403930
division	multiplication
multiplication and division for double-word integers is more complicated but it follows the same sort of grade-school math - but where each digit is a processor word

13403966
public	protected
make it public or protected and it will work

13404009
public	protected
change it to public or protected

13404041

anyway as you can see i have some logs in here and i watch the logcat output to see when the dialog pop-up and here is what i get

13404060
ubuntu	linux
i did this tutorial running hadoop on ubuntu linux single-node cluster and everything worked fine

13404060
ubuntu	linux
after that i tried this running hadoop on ubuntu linux multi-node cluster enter link description here but i got following eror

13404060
ubuntu	linuxmint

profiler	yourkit
i have an rcp application and there is a slow memory leak and i recently started using yourkit profiler which seems to be the best app out there for this

13404347
post	get
you can get the current matrix post the appropriate rotation with postrotate and then set it back to the shader element

13404431
int	boolean
since some of your rules evaluate to a boolean and others to an int or only compare int you d best let your rules return a generic object and cast accordingly

13404435
jtree	jtable
you could browse the directories on the left side jtree and when you select one you could see its content on the right side jtable - just the files

13404464
post	get
again this is a bit a guess on how you structured things so if you can post a code sample i am sure you can get a much more detailed answer

13404474
viewdidload	viewwillappear
1 you need a flag value set true initially in viewdidload or viewwillappear

13404503
versioning	upgrade
i am stuck with a symfony application using versioning 1.0.17 which can t be upgrade at the moment

13404508
for-loop	loops
if you just need to print out the values you could use a for-loop to loops through all the values and print them individually just without a newline

13404522
int	double
you have some issues in your code but basically int division will not give you double

13404522
int	double
the result of an int divided by an int is another int not a double

13404544

13404682
post	get
i am trying to get post from my mybb database and then display it in the homepage

13404731
hide	show
the new update for the html5 widget has added an animation at the end that hide the waveform and show sharing options and embed codes

13404731
hide	show
shouldn t this handle hiding the element as the api docs state that this parameter will show hide share buttons dialogues.

13404746
mouseup	mousedown
i m noticing that if i click on an item i get two notifications one for the mousedown event and again for the mouseup event

13404787
sse	avx
a vectorized kernel means that by using simd instructions you can execute 4 sse or 8 avx opencl logical threads in one cpu thread

13404820
vbscript	jscript
you could always use vbscript or jscript

13404820
vbscript	jscript
also jscript and vbscript hosts are available also on machines that don t have powershell

13404820
vbscript	jscript
you run your jscript i prefer jscript to vbscript because of its resemblance to javascript

13404821
gwt	cssresource
gwt s cssresource can do

i have been in the process of converting a http application to https and ssl with a self signed certificate

13404913
instances	transient
as mark stated in the transient scope your dependencies will be injected as new instances of bounded objects but in transaction scope they will be created once per request

13404968
min	max
in the limits header you can find a templatized function for max and min

13404970
hash	md5
you re running into this problem because triple des s key size is 168 bits 21 bytes but md5 generates hash that are only 16 bytes 128 bits long

13404970
des	aes
note that the effective key size of aes is larger than triple des

13404970
pbkdf2	md5	pbkdf2	hash	hash	md5
consider using a proper password-based key derivation function like pbkdf2 instead of a general purpose hash function like md5 or the sha family

13404973
matlab	simulink
i did a google search for discrete pid controller simulation and found simulink matlab and python answers as well as more references to books

apache	nginx
also need usertrack extension which is readily available in apache for nginx or similar alternative of it

13405097
post	get
however when you first load the edit post page you get the map crunched up inside the canvas as well as an incorrect zoom level

13405141
switching	screens
as another thought you might be able to switching between a standard phoneapplicationframe and a transitionframe based on whether you need full screens d3d or not

13405153
min	max
the problem is arraylist doesn t know how to calculate min max and average

13405182
google-chrome	firefox
this worked in firefox but not in google-chrome

submit	submission
submission is the only way to transfer it to the server whether you submit the form via ajax or traditional methods - no difference

13405456
versioning	upgrade
i also upgrade to latest versioning of eclipse before doing that

13405498
mdpi	hdpi
device-independent pixels dp these will be equal to the pixel size for mdpi displays 1.5x the pixel size for hdpi displays and 2x the pixel size for xhdpi displays

13405498
mdpi	hdpi
12dp 12px mdpi 18px hdpi 24px xhdpi

13405498
mdpi	hdpi
if you re designing at 72 dpi photoshop default dpi setting an 8pt font would be equivalent to 8px which would be 8px at mdpi 12px at hdpi and 16px at xhdpi or more simply 8dp for all densities

13405514
children	parent
delete all children with associated foreign key to the parent

13405527
versioning	upgrade
this worked as expected with all versioning thru 4.09 but after upgrade all item get the pipe symbol even the last one

13405544
textview	imageview
supposing i have the following layout 2 imageview with a textview under each imageview

13405544
textview	imageview
the textview will be about 5 smaller centered below each imageview

13405544
textview	imageview
put each pair of imageview and textview in their own linearlayout so 2 linearlayouts with each linearlayout s layout_width set to fill_parent and equal layout_weight 0.5 for both

13405605

13405697
folder	directory
note that myproject.fla must be at the main directory of that folder structure

13405712
screens	tablet
the general concept is that information you would have presented on multiple screens on the handset the list of items followed by the view to display the selection can be brought together on the same screens on a tablet so the list now sits side-by-side with the view of the current selection

13405764
subtract	add
subtract that index from 6 and you will get how many days you need to add until the date is sunday

13405797
thin	unicorn
i then turned to looking into restarting unicorn or thin based on some insight i got

one could argue that a lighter framework such as sinatra if you re going to use ruby or something like bottle python or the javascript stack of node.js + express would be a better fit if you truly are just going to create a restful api + some landing pages but rails does this perfectly fine as well and has a lot of other functionality that will be available for you to grow into if the time ever comes

much better solution is to have your php pages save their intent that something needs to be run in batch mode into database table mysql or postgresql

13413699

13413844
cassette	combres
the question is without going with another option like node cassette combres servicestack etc

13413892
int	chars
so in very portable code if you need a signed type capable of holding values up to 127 then you should use one of signed chars int int_least8_t or int_fast8_t according to whether you want to ask the compiler to make it

13413892
int	chars
work in c89 signed chars or int

13413892

all my protocols are supplied as c header files with all the typedef and struct s in them and any changes made to the protocol in the future will be done in the same way

13414027
openjpa	datanucleus
it seems that eclispelink openjpa and datanucleus already provide integral restful jpa out of box

13414047

13414473
bluestacks	android-emulator
let me just say that code work on bluestacks android-emulator

13414508
getter	setter
the way jaxb normally handles multi valued properties is to provide just a getter and no setter for the which returns a mutable list - you re supposed to call the getter to retrieve an initially-empty list and then create the member objects for this list using new in the normal way and add them directly to the list

13414508
getter	setter
single-valued properties not lists should have been generated with both getter and setter

13420723
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
caliburn.micro is a viewmodel first approach

13420723
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
caliburn.micro uses a convention over configuration mechanism to map views to viewmodel

13420732
factors	mean
one confounding factors which is responsible for some of the more confusing aspects of your output is that the check doesn t mean what i think you think it means

13420760
keystore	jks
then use pkcs12 as the keystore type directly or convert it to jks with keytool

13420786
width	height
the problem is that for your height and width properties these are nested within other object elements within the void

13420856
post	get
if you post a code sample or tell me what technology your using .net mvc3 i could give you some sample code or resources to get you started on how to do that

13420920
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
mutators setter and accessors getter are a sneaky way of overriding the assignment operator

13420920
accessor	properties
require them for assignment 3 they provide access restrictions readonly and writeonly properties have no equivalent in fields 4 six months down the road someone will need to convert your public fields into private fields and create accessor and mutators for all of them and will likely cuss at having to do your drudgery

13420947
width	height
if images will affect the height and width and the image tag has no width and height set ready isn t the choice for you - otherwise it probably is

13420952
post	get
in my other functions using the same curl_req method with get and post everything goes well

13420963
hash	md5
the signing function takes in some information hash it with md5 i know but legacy requirements and then encodes the output with base64 which takes a series of bytes via const unsigned char and the total size of the message

13420963
hash	md5
i first tried crypto++ libray for md5 and it would provide expansion in the future for other hash and protocols

13420963
openssl	crypto++
the md5 library i m currently using is here though i want to move to crypto++ in the end or maybe openssl

13420993
hide	show
if you need to swap fragments often you can use the fragmenttransaction hide and show methods so you avoid the initialization overhead

13421035
many-to-many	one-to-many
the values in sort_fields are calculated from multiple other associated tables some one-to-many some many-to-many according to some complicated rules

13421052

i don t want to use any jquery plug-in for this just need something simple when i click on tab hide and show contents

13421076
uitableview	nsindexpath
that code looks like this from the function - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

13421084
portrait	landscape
rotating works fine the whole view fits in portrait scrolls on landscape

13421096
google-chrome	safari
i added a icon to a site i built but the problem is it doesn t appear on google-chrome and safari

13421113
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you should use an objectoutputstream to write the list of shapes and retreave them from an objectinputstream

13421119
hive	hdfs
a good reference on hive and how does it differ from traditional databases can be read about on the post hive- a sql like database over hadoop on my blog hadoop hdfs map-reduce and hive

13421146
put	get
so then my problem is how to write the code that is get two random rows with three columns and put the resulting array into an array that can be shuffled

13421207
width	margin
i think the real trouble is that jqmobile is setting the left and right margin to 30 leaving only 40 of the total width for your title

13421223
hide	show
then on clicks you hide show as necessary

13421228
hide	show
i tried performing a click on the parent form in my decoder event which hide the menu but the menu still won t show on the child screen

13421245
range	max
to get a random number in the desired range use large_rand max + 1 where max is the largest number you want to get

13421291
children	parent
will return the parent s children in the order they were saved to the database

13421306
put	get
i have put a solution query and its output for you in the same sqlfiddle for you get a clear idea

this uses a std ostringstream to build a filename using stream operations and returns the built std string

13421328
google-chrome	firefox
but if i try to open it in google-chrome firefox i can see only an empty rectangle

13421361
accessor	properties
so as i understand it the only time you don t want to use the self.propertyname is inside the properties s accessor method since it would cause an infinite loop

13421383
dns	spf
add an spf record to your dns record

13421428
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
extract link via lxml.html or beautifulsoup

13421435
for-loop	loops
since the for-loop executes a single operation which could be a block enclosed in semicolon is treated as the body of loops resulting in the behavior that you observed

13421493
client-side	server-side
there should be a client-side validation function and a server-side validation function

13421501
int	chars
however i do have one item that needs to be read in as a chars array and then converted to int for ease of use in the future

13421510
getter	setter
my personal preference is to use the dot notation where ever possible but use the direct instance variable if required for example within getter setter

13421529
post	get
there is a lot more to setting up a uitableviewcontroller than i could get into in this post so check out some tutorials on youtube or something as they have already taken the time to explain everything you need in a much more digestible format i found this one to be very helpful when i was first starting using table views but there are tons of others there too

13421547
atoi	atof
don t ever use atoi or atof or anything from ato.

13421560
width	height
i believe this because they are loaded from a string they don t have height width properties to select the position

13421598
min	max
white 500 and 200 are the max and min sizes you want to apply

13421617
put	get
the locator needs to be set to make sure that ticks don t get put at non-integer locations which are then forcible cast to integers by the formatter which would leave them in the wrong place

13421622
identifier	ambiguous
likewise if there is more than one argument being passed to the constructor markov reader writer or if the single argument is not an identifier markov foo it is not ambiguous

13421626
getter	setter
as well as setter and getter you should avoid dot notation in your init and dealloc methods on the grounds that it s not safe to call published methods on a class that s half constructed or half destroyed

13421626
subclass	accessor
the particular risk is that a subclass might have added logic into its accessor

13421626
subclass	accessor
if you call the accessor in dealloc then you ll call the subclass after it s deallocated itself

13421626
subclass	accessor
if you call the accessor in init then you ll call into the subclass before it s initialsed itself

13421652
opera	google-chrome
once i also allowed picasa to store a cookie in google-chrome it did update instantly while opera was still delayed

13421660
strlen	strcmp
i see a few problems in your code first strlen returns the length of string not including the null byte so you don t need -1 that s why it probably doesn t match any of the strcmp s

13421705
mouse	keyboard
glfw see wardds answer also a c library and also poses an abstraction layer but more focused on display and keyboard mouse i o instead of broader i o audio etc.

13421859
satisfiability	np-complete
one known np-complete problem is that of boolean satisfiability which is the problem of determining if the variables of a given boolean formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to true

13421859
satisfiability	np-complete
i suspect that since the search space is demonstrably larger than that of a the boolean satisfiability problem and that since a solution would also determine that a formula was satisfiable and is thus at least as hard as solving the satisfiability then the problem should be np-complete

13421888
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the header text in the h2 tags is huge in ie 9 compared to firefox google-chrome or safari

13422344
pull	push
log4net is inherently a push model which is not obvious most people associate method calls with pull models but we can change it to another push model that most .net developers are more familiar with events and build another push model on top of that which makes it easier for us to subscribe unsubscribe to these events observables

13422401

13422588
ienumerable	iqueryable
from my understanding ienumerable does not transform the original query information that iqueryable holds

13422588
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you look at msdn it turns out that iqueryable inherits ienumerable

13422588
ienumerable	iqueryable
it is important with linq-sql to work with iqueryable unless you want the query frozen at the point it is turned to an ienumerable

13422588

getter	setter
and code in managedbean with getter setter for smsclist variable and selectedsmsclist

13434265
public	protected
then if not skipped onauthorization calls public isauthorized and if that call fails it then calls protected virtual handleunauthorizedrequest

13434268
oncreate	onstart
before that version oncreateoptionsmenu was called during oncreate but now it seems to be called at least after onstart

13434275
put	get
the basic gist of this is that you let user s create their playlists in the tplaylist table single row per user playlist you put all your music track data in tmusic and the mapping table tplaylistmusicmap is where the individual tracks in each playlist get stored

13434301
ember.js	backbone.js

13434621
fadein	fadeout
you can either use fadein fadeout

13434627
jar	war
the problem i found is that when you have a war embedded within a jar the uris can end up being ones that do not work with the default jar uri handler trying to access the war file

13434627
jar	war
then you just point jetty to the jar file itself as the war file

13434646
hide	show
you can create relativelayout and show hide it and use 1 activity only

13434651
put	get
i ve put the node in and the path to get to that node in parentheses

a simple get using xmlhttprequest works fine in google-chrome and firefox because it supports request headers which allow the browser to request a cors response as shown in the following lines of code

13434711
pop-up	dialog
when i click on the link link the dialog pop-up but when i confirm it no redirect happens when i click on the link link again i get redirected

hide	show
i m playing around with the css and javascript for flexslider 2 and i can t figure out how to hide the prev arrow for only the initial slide of my slide show

13434720
entities	entitymanager
the reason i am asking is that under stress testing simulating hundreds of users we notice mangled jpa entity values values which don t exist in the database which might suggest some race condition thread unsafe access on the entitymanager handling the jpa entities

13434743
for-loop	arrays
i could use a for-loop to go through the arrays and average individual elements but this would take a long time and i would imagine not provide the speed that i would like

13434777
pop-up	dialog
for example with 4 human players four dialog will pop-up in a row to ask each player what they want to do

13434787
versioning	upgrade
the error will not show if you compile the project with play compile as sbt will use the correct scala library versioning but it will show in the ide until you upgrade it

13434811
hide	show
take a look at apple s reachability project that tests internet reachability and just implement it in your app to hide show the map

13434822
sqoop	hadoop
i know that we can get data tables from mysql server data to a hadoop filesystem using sqoop

13434837
super	extends
the trick is that your class extends sqliteopenhelper the call to super in your constructor triggers a lot of behind-the-scenes code

13434879
int	double
however if i remove the member double d int mytype and changes the operator and mpi type routines accordingly the reduction is done without any problem

13434902
hide	show
i create simple code for show div when mouse over one link and create simple menu head the idea itâ s when go over the link show me one div and before i can go over this div and select i want over it but actually i canâ t select nothing because if i no over the link the div hide all time

13434902
hide	show
3 when i go out over the link the div hide content and i canâ t select nothing into the div show

13434935

i am also setting the minimum maximum range and the starting position

13434990
awt	swing
i don t fully understand the library inheritance in java to its full extent yet and i m not sure if awt and swing applications are something that is built for the major oss out there

13435020
aggregate-functions	sum
this is just an example i also have another case where i want to save the result of an aggregate-functions for a table in another table for easier and faster access like storing the sum of payments for a student in the students table as column is that kind of denormalization breaks the db design standards

13435033
queue	fifo
a queue is a fifo fifo data structure

13435037
fink	homebrew
there are also fink and homebrew

13435064

i ve been doing well with almost all of the for-loop code i ve been translating to list comprehension but am very stuck on what i thought was a fairly simple loops

13435071
jruby	mri
running the commands via heroku toolbelt from outside of jruby mri 1.9.3 works fine

13435085
goto	break
i can t paste a picture but if you rightclick on the source when at a break point you will see goto disassembly in the menu options

13435113
mathml	tex
the right way to include mathematical content is mathml -- which is part of html5 but see below for using tex

13435113
mathml	mathjax
ios s uiwebview is webkit based and therefore has the same partial mathml support though on ios5 it s significantly worse due to a font bug so i would also suggest to use mathjax disclaimer i m part of mathjax

13435113
mathml	mathjax	mathml	tex	tex	mathjax
mathjax is an open source javascript library which understands tex and asciimath input converts either one to mathml and renders mathml as html-css or svg in any modern browser

13435113
mathml	mathjax
additionally it has better mathml support than webkit and you can always configure mathjax to use the native mathml support if you want -- say when you know your content should render fine in webkits native support

13435128
post	get
when you send information from the client to the server via http get or post the information must be properly encoded

13435162
comparator	comparable
if you plan on sorting numerous list s in this way i would suggest having chromosome implement the comparable interface in which case you could simply call collections.sort mylist without the need of specifying an explicit comparator

13435295
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i then use a for-loop to loops through both arrays and print out the strings together which happen to create a folder destination and file name

13435297
profiling	debugging
set the configuration of the profiling action to debugging

13435297
profiling	instrumentation
run successive profiling directly from within instrumentation when you do

13435326
client-side	server-side
i ve been trying to mimic classical inheritance in javascript i know i know half the posts i read on here say not to twist javascript into such a framework but my application needs to have a client-side heirarchy that maps to the inheritance structure of my server-side php code

13435368
width	height
well if i understand you correctly you only have to calculate all combinations of height and width and take the lowest cost.the problem here is to find an interval which will include the best answer but also a stepsize which is feasible for you current problem otherwise you will have too many possibilities

13435377
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
i tried uigesturerecognizer and uitapgesturerecognizer with cancelstouchesinview set to yes it fires up and blocks the single taps but not the dragging around

13435381
children	parent
edit solved parent children treeview issue being seen

13435382
queue	fifo
a queue is a data structure that uses the fifo format

13435465
try-catch	exception-handling
assuming you are using the bufferedstream input idea from another answer instead of using try-catch blocks to safely convert the input to an integer you can throw exception-handling from the main method

13435470
jruby	mri
i think they have done a wonderful job making the jruby implementation almost completely match the functionality if not the speed of its mri counterpart papering over the difference between the vastly different implementations

13435471
pop-up	dialog
usually if you are trying to make a pop-up box or dialog you can try to use other pre-designed plugins including jquery ui or blockui of which the former only supports dialog but the latter supports all kinds of pop-up boxes

13435562
fadein	fadeout
see this question jquery ie fadein and fadeout opacity

13435585
int	double
where int float double and real are user-defined c++ types

13435607
for-loop	arrays
px py are float type one-dimensional arrays of int n size i is also int used only in for-loop

13435629
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
once these cookies get set they are being passed just fine to my app from google-chrome firefox safari ios and osx version etc

13435633
x86	64bit
to understand why you probably need to remember the current x86 cpus with 32 and 64bit values started life as much more limited 8-bit machines going back to the intel 8008

13435663
rss	feed
after google decided to shut down the api of feedburner i ve unsuccessfully searched the web for another way of displaying the current subscribers of an rss feed

13435665
onkeyup	onkeydown
don t forget to define forms onkeydown and onkeyup events.

13435667
int	double
so if your method argument declared as accepts and you try to add an int into the list of double .which is wrong because double is not a super type of int thus is not a sub type

13435667
int	double
if it accepts it and you try to add a double to list of int

13435667
int	double
you just added a double to list of int

13435673
ubuntu	debian
as others have explained you can t expect a 1 1 match between the packages you re seeing in your ubuntu debian distribution and the packages you re seeing in buildroot

13435673
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian packages take source packages in this case libcap and create multiple binary packages from them in order to allow you to install only the library or the library + development files or the library + programs etc

13435690
move	drag
without it i can t see how to possible drag and move elements within ff

13435764
post	get
now i no longer get post data sent to my confirmation page

13435791
super	implements
for example to implements a super basic example container that just shows each child full screen you could do something like this

13435818
zoo	xts
here s one way to achieve this with base plots but as justin suggested you could also look into packages that offer additional flexibility for plotting date objects such as zoo and xts

13435853
rss	feed
after writing a rss aggregator that was handling 1000+ feed i was hooked on using a parser

13435867
getter	setter
i m sure clientbean.client is client type and its getter and setter are correct

13435892
dreamweaver	aptana
in dreamweaver they appear in the toolbar in aptana 3 they appear in the outline phpdesigner they appear as dependencies

13435913
ctrlp	fuzzyfinder
there are various other plugins like fuzzyfinder and ctrlp that offer alternative space-saving buffer listing and switching solutions

13435920
devise	cancan
i keep getting an error trying to use activeadmin in my rails application with devise and cancan

13435942
int	boolean
it is distinct from the int 0 just like boolean s false

13435953
int	chars
in java all variables are either reference types or primitive types int chars float etc.

13436039
width	height
detecting the width and height of an element in javascript involves creating an img from the background image

13436061
range	max	range	min	min	max
imagine you have a range initially 0 to max and select n points at equal distances within this range including the min and the max

13436061
range	max	range	min	min	max
of these n points find the point with the best price and the points on the left right of it become the new range or the point itself if it was the old min or max

13436061
min	max
and you can remember the values from the previous iteration with n 4 you d only calculate 2 points per iteration as you d know the values at min and max already

13436087
iboutlet	ibaction
ps my connections seem to all be correct the interface builder iboutlet uilabels are properly mapped connected and the uislider which triggers this method is connected through ibaction

13436137
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering work perfeclty but only in the current page

13436156
post	get
with that i can get the first post id and total entries for this topic for the board.

13436156
min	max
now you can left-join to the pre-aggregate query for min max post and entries count.

13436156
post	get
once for the first post so you can get the initial subject caption time and whatever else you might care about and again for the last post to get its time subject etc.

13436167
int	chars
return the unicode string of one chars whose unicode code is the int i..

13436167
int	chars
return the string representing a chars whose unicode codepoint is the int i..

13436176
guava	lambdaj
on the other hand for some other uses you can use a more functional approach like guava or lambdaj

13436184
post	get
use post instead of get

13436184
post	get
my personal rule of thumb post for forms get for variables passed thru url

13436220
onfocus	onblur	keydown	onblur	keydown	onfocus
if you re trying to modify in an onblur handler the same node you re trying to remove in another handler eg onfocus keydown etc then the first call to removechild will fire the onblur handler before actually removing the node

13436220
onfocus	onblur
if the onblur handler then modifies the node so that its parent changes control will return from the onblur handler to the removechild call in your onfocus handler which will then try to remove the node and fail with the exception you describe

13436220
onfocus	onblur
any amount of checking for the presence of the child before calling removechild in your onfocus handler will be fruitless since those checks will happen before the onblur handler is triggered

13436220
onfocus	onblur
the following code will show how the onblur event handler runs before removechild in onfocus actually removes the child

13436233
tunnel	vpn
if you need to be high secure you should not use public services and directly tunnel your traffic to target serves by using vpn

13436246
rtsp	rtmp
wowza is supporting the output which can be played ios because of the ios cant play flash then it cannot played rtmp or rtsp

13436263
width	height
looking to hide the controller except on rollover or find a way to adjust the width height

13436263
width	height
when i adjust the width or height via css it causes spacing issues in other browsers that hide the controller by default

13436286
put	get
i m able to put the script in my path and get lein to download but for some reason when i run lein version i keep getting

13436306

passenger	unicorn
personally i use nginx and unicorn but i don t remember that line when i did mess around with passenger

13436318
google-chrome	firefox
well it was not the issue of versions and both 0.3.1 and 0.3.3 works fine when resizing bordercontainer but only in google-chrome and firefox

13436358
free	malloc
you just pass the pointer that malloc returned to free

13436359
width	height
what interests me is the columngridview they have developed which not only does variable width but variable height seems that based on content will happily show the best space for the cardview

13436359
listview	gridview
my own custom implementation based of a listview gridview - not impossible but a lot of work

13436440
pop-up	dialog
as a result of this change when i right-click on a custom problem in the problems view the quick fix menu item becomes available but when i select it a dialog pop-up that says there is no fix available for the selected problem

13436445
firefox	safari
which is perfectly fluid tested in osx firefox safari ios6

13436452
folder	directory
if your main issue was being forced to use the asset folder this method lib let s you use a file from any specified directory

13436488
button	checkbox
i have some radio button and or checkbox in my layout and i would like that my textviews that are around have the same text appearance size color etc.

13436488
button	checkbox
p.s i do not want to change the default text appearance that radio button and checkbox already have

13436496
primitive	reference-type
because you are comparing values reference-type values with primitive values the only way it could work would be because of an auto unboxed conversion

13436517
simulation	sampling
if you don t know have a profiler to use you can do a poor man s simulation of a sampling profiler by running your app with a debugger breaking into the debugger repeatedly and noting which function it is running in

13436561
int	chars
note that the same approach can be implemented without packing the identifiers into int i.e keep each hexa-decimal digit on it s own int chars type but i thought that the memory saved by this packing might mean something

13436562
xbee	pyserial
if the xbee is connected to the computer as a serial device you can just use a serial library such as pyserial

13436593
post	get
in the case of msdn these parameters end up in the query query string of the url that i send out with curl since msdn only accepts get not post

13436620
inherited	properties
this bit in your xaml means that the selected data item will be bound into the properties vehicleid of the datacontext of the grid which will be inherited from the control page that it is on

13436637
char-pointer	pointers
the result will be a table of pointers to fixed-length char-pointer arrays that can then be used iteratively in the same place you currently and repeatedly open parse use and throw away all that content

13436662
passenger	webrick
the app works fine on webrick when i ssh into the server and run rails server but passenger the server platform provided by justhost is having some issues

13436686
stdout	stderr
subprocess.call args stdin none stdout none stderr none shell false timeout none

13436713
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tried this in multiple browsers google-chrome safari firefox deleting browser history etc

13436719
stdout	fflush
to avoid that put a fflush stdout after all printf statements that don t have a terminating

13436740
prepare	execute
the value gets calculated and prepare to be returned then the finally block execute in its entirety and only then the caller gets to proceed

13436759
outputstream	inputstream
also i think you may want to be setting the inputstream property rather than the outputstream because you are downloading a file rather that uploading one

13436766
implements	extends
in java you can create an anonymous inner class which means that instead of defining some top level class that implements onclicklistener which btw you can easily by having the class that all of this is happening in simply declare that it implements the onclicklistener interface public class whatevermyclassnameis extends activity implements view.onclicklistener you are actually just creating an unnamed on the fly onclicklistener instance which cannot be referenced anywhere else because you haven t declared a reference to it

13436786
post	get
however on the part when it automaticly post on a user s wall i can t get it to post the url of the post that they are reading but only a static url

13436853
wordpress	phpbb
i am developing a site using wordpress phpbb and as you must be aware that the image paths are generated by these cmss

13436859
folder	directory
sorry im new to codeigniter and the codeigniter docs do not say about multiple directory in the libraries folder

13436887
google-chrome	firefox
this function fires in firefox google-chrome

13436910
post	get
i don t have any problems in development but when hosted at hostgator i sometimes get logged off when i try to create a new item http post

13436910
post	get
i realized that i could get to the iis logs so i compared the post that succeeded and the one that failed and immediately noticed something

13436910
post	get
when i first did the get to load the item create page view the cs-username was populated but when i did the post to create the item it was gone

13436910
post	get
there was a 7 minute delay from the get to the post but i can see i logged on 1 minute before the get so the session was only 8 minutes old when the post happened

13436924
udp	tcp
it will be running a completely custom protocol not tcp or udp over ip so that the overhead is minimal and the high-speed fieldbus can be saturated while not receiving or transmitting frames

13436930
many-to-many	one-to-many
the same goes for one-to-many and many-to-many associations

13436957
post	get
setup an html form with a username and a password box that submits via post not get

13437007
implements	extends
an implements class can extends your abstract class to derive the benefits of already implements methods of the interface

13437027
free	malloc
free don t need to know the number of bytes just use it as jonathon reinhart said.there is a simple implementation of malloc and free in chapter 8 in tcpl .just read it and you will know how free works without knowing the size of you dynamic allocated memory.hope it works

13437074
int	boolean
this is a function an overload of operator that takes two int and returns a boolean

13437095
post	get
you need to get the raw post data using file_get_contents php input

13437110
integer	unsigned
dword is a 32-bit unsigned integer type defined by the windows api

13437110
integer	unsigned
and there are two main possibilities for converting a negative floating point values to unsigned integer

13437110
integer	unsigned
as if the floating point value say -1.23 is converted to signed integer and then adjusted by a suitable multiple of 2 n to bring it into the unsigned integer range or

13437110
integer	unsigned
as if the floating point value again say -1.23 is adjusted by a suitable multiple of 2 n to bring it into the unsigned integer range and then converted to the unsigned integer type

13437120
int	double
i have to convert a selectionsort method that was covered in my book that was built to sort arrays and make it generic so that i can enter either double or int into it and have it work

13437120
int	double
the problem here is since the int and double are now in int and double wrappers it breaks the selectionsort method

13437121
post	put
if token and sign in work but your browser isn t getting the cookie put the cookie code before the post code

13437136
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the item cell is imported into the root view loaded and registered in viewdidload updated in viewdidappear and added to the table in tableview cellforrowatindexpath

13437151
int	chars
matches this chars index const chars int undr iso standard rules

13437151
int	chars
invalid types int chars const chars int for array subscript

13437153
inherited	properties
i thought that perhaps this resulted from the fact that my person model does not inherited from tableserviceentity i refuse to introduce that coupling - so i decorated it with this attribute instead dataservicekey partitionkey rowkey and manually gave it a partitionkey and rowkey properties

13437153
inherited	properties
so i tried to create an entity that did inherited from tableserviceentity which would allow me to query this table as you can see from the queries the only properties i m worried about is name

13437187
implements	extends
in your first example your new interface b is defined to extends from a so going forward any class that implements b automatically implements a

13437203
maven	pom.xml
with a maven project you can should also add license details to the pom.xml file

13437206
implements	extends
2 if you designed an interface c which is a marker interface and you want all the classes derived from a given class b to be marked the best solution would be to use b extends c and not going and putting the implements c everywhere

13437222
post	get
or explain how you planned on accessing hte xls file and post a portion of it somewhere tha tpeople can get to

13437236
slideup	slidedown
the code you wrote calls slideup then calls the return value of slideup as a function passing slidedown

13437240
post	get
in my controller based on user post i want to make a call to an external provider site to get process some data and get results

13437252
width	height
strictly assuming if you are using css background you can use the background-position property to position your image and use width and height to get it to the right size

13437265
comparator	comparable
a quick peek at the javadocs shows that double implements the comparable interface which means that it will have a comparator method

13437265
int	double
the point that your book is trying to force you to get your head around is the concept that you can have multiple types int double that implement the same interface comparable and that you can take advantage of that in your code

13437265
int	double
so you could write firstdouble.compareto seconddouble and firstinteger.compareto secondinteger - but by implementing your sort on comparable instead of int double etc... you can just use

13437267
slideup	slidedown
then in your slideup or slidedown functions the second parameter is a callback for when it is completed

13437274
children	parent
i created it so i could get a list of parent objects that have children that match the some_id_on_child value 123

13437274
children	parent
however when i ask for the count length size instead of returning the number of records that were returned above it returns the number of children that match the criteria per parent

13437279
cdr	cons
cons car and cdr

13437334
width	height
with loadimage you can specify a desired width and height

13437413
keydown	keyup
the best i ve found so far is to record the state of the input keys in internal state modified by keydown and keyup and run an nstimer to apply them
