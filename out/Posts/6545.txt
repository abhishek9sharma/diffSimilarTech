superclass	subclassing
then you can write an initialize method in your subclassing that defaults the constant attributes and passes the values to the superclass for the actual initialization

17285806
dbcontext	objectcontext
but i could give you a suggestion you see dbcontext wraps an objectcontext within it and it calls methods on that objectcontext to do its job so in way or another it provides a simplified version of the objectcontext

17285806
dbcontext	objectcontext
of course this means you can still access the wrapped objectcontext instance like this where db is your dbcontext subclass so instead of providing two different apis which may confuse clients and require more maintenance you can enhance you dbcontext subclass with the additional methods you require for performance and those additional methods can leverage the objectcontext

17285809

17286103

17286479
disk	ram
the only problem is that this will probably require on the order of 5.2gb of ram to handle a 2.6gb dictionary so you ve got the in_dict stored on disk in your peculiar form and want to write the out_dict to disk in similar form without ever reading everything into memory

17286494
move	drag
in xcode 9 if you drag a file from one group to another and the groups have different folders xcode 9 move the file to the new group s folder regardless of whether the new group s folder has the same name as the group

uibutton	uinavigationitem
you first need to define a uibutton to be a uinavigationitem which will do your login or log out on click

17286658
superclass	subclassing
instead of copy-pasting code around or even setting up a utility class or superclass that all your view controllers use to insert this facebook button a quick and dirty way is to create a single button in a navigation controller subclassing and insert that same button as each view controller is shown

17286658
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
because your window s root view controller is a uitabbarcontroller then we can use that as the owner of the facebookbutton which is shared between all uinavigationcontroller

17286689

17286932
width	height
i want the iframe that vimeowrap outputs to have a width and height of 100 or nothing

17286934
inherited	subclassing
in your first example where you inherited from wx.toolbar and abc.abcmeta you don t want apptoolbar to be a subclassing of abc.abcmeta you want apptoolbar to be an instance of it

17286934
metaclass	subclassing
though looking at this a bit closer it seems that you can t define a subclassing of wx.toolbar with abc.abcmeta as its metaclass as wx.toolbar is an instance of a metaclass other than bultins.type

17286959
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
either implement iequatable t on your types of interest along with overrides of object.equals and object.gethashcode or provide an instance of iequalitycomparer t to your type consumer

17290268
google-chrome	firefox

also note that in practice many implementations will simply use an unsigned int or or something like this to represent the integer and then you get for the size requirement in bits.

17290329
width	height
this changes the width and height

17290523
getter	setter
and you should generally prefer to access properties instead of instance variables because this way you ll be able to change properties getter setter methods of storing data implementation without changing everything else

do i even need to worry about the copy constructor assignment operator for the derived class if all it has is double int etc

17290582
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but firefox doesn t seem to like it

17290605

int	chars
the compiler you are using seems to treat the two-character constant as a two-byte int where the high byte is the chars and the low byte is the chars

17291290
int	chars
if you try to cast it to int like you ll get the chars code

17291313

inherited	properties
as far as the reason the for-in loop will cycle over all properties of the object including functions and inherited properties

17291451
try-catch	exception-handling
since the method throws a checked exception-handling hence you need to handle that in code by enclosing the potential exception-handling throwing line within a try-catch or inform the code which calls your method which contains the potential exception-handling throwing line by adding a throws in your method declaration

17291459
try-catch	exception-handling
this means that it must be caught using a try-catch exception-handling or thrown using the throws statement

17291851
fflush	gets
i see that the wcmapreduceserver only gets a partial number of client messages at any time and then wcmapreduceserver outputs meaning the client shutdown happens before the client actually manages to fflush all pending messages

17291851
dictionary	map
the big flaw here is that even though display_list has the lowest priority if any map or reduce task takes arbitrarily long the display_list message will go through before all the mapreduce subtasks have completed and therefore the outcome of this mapreduce example is non-deterministic you can get different dictionary out of each run

17291852
google-chrome	firefox
all those problems are on internet explorer on firefox and google-chrome it s okay

17291858
screens	hdpi
but what about others i have done many calculations and a lot of searches online to figure out a defined size for other screens but i seems can t also while applying the formula .75 ldpi 1.5 hdpi 2.25 xhdpi to get other screens it doesn t add up

17291858
mdpi	hdpi
like 320x480 is mdpi to get the hdpi do 1.5 and you will get 480x720 which is not the situation for devices out their

17291858
width	height
so if the problem is with height only i m thinking creating background as patterns and then work only on the width of the screen size and re-size every other elements to screen width only like 240px 320px 480px 720px and also consider the size of them to fit minimum height

put	get
so to finally get around to your actual question to access your data you need to put all your items into a single data structure rather than printing them

17292112
post	put
the other listeners will however try to submit the form so if you put your code in form.submit then you have a chance of stopping the post back

17292144
folder	directory
it exports the contents of your project s assets folder files and directory to a temporary directory and then sets an environment variable to that path so your native code can chdir to the temp directory and you can use the regular old standard library file io routines

17292152
min	max
use the min and max attributes

17292191

17292660
put	get
note that put accepts json in the body and get returns json

17292660

this perfect as it let s you generate as many subclassing as you like even in other bundles without your superclass in my case abstractcontent needing to know about them

17293905
hide	show
after that as per your requirement you hide show this layout with their all contents

17293905
hide	show
when you hide show linearlayout all content with this layout also hide show automatically

17293997
opera	firefox
if it was a non-official ie property it wouldn t have been implemented in the webkit opera browsers mentioned in the w3 spec nor would firefox actually be trying to implement it check out the bug link above

17294137
width	height
it was also possible to manually set the width and height through the intialisation code

17294158
getter	setter
automationproperties contains all the properties for uiautomation elements setter and getter as the name suggest

17294164
integer	unsigned
sizeof int is of type size_t which is guaranteed to be an unsigned integer

17294164
integer	unsigned
integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted

17294164
integer	unsigned
operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to

17294164
integer	unsigned
thus -1 is converted to an unsigned integer

i need to get number of times a fb user tagged in post

17294486
width	height
for bitmap object i can get the width and height easily on the image object

17294486
width	height
then i can set the regx regy to 1 2 of width or height

17294521
width	height
you can either have a fixed width and height and set overflow to auto like already suggested

17294577
client-side	server-side
you can redirect normal users landing on the url elsewhere if you want either client-side via javascript that the scraper does not interpret or server-side then you have to exclude the scraper from that redirect via its user agent

17294737
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
when a user uploads a jpg gif bmp image i want this image to be converted to a png image and then converted to a base64 string

17294802
yourkit	jprofiler	visualvm	yourkit	visualvm	jprofiler
after a lot more investigating the answer is very simple none of the mentioned profilers are capable of what i wanted in this question - not visualvm not yourkit and not jprofiler

17294816
scatter	graphing
i would need a vba code that finds all the data columns by given data column header and draws graphing of all these data columns to one scatter plot chart and names the drawn line with current sheet name

17294816
scatter	graphing
following data would create one graphing to scatter plot chart

17294816
scatter	graphing
and this one would create another graphing to the same scatter plot chart

17294885
post	get
i m using ajax to get body text of a certain post type at the moment i m using

17294892
post	put
i downloaded insert php plugin and put code in post and didn t worked then i put this code to template and is buged

which will work same as it work on desktop but still you will have to take care of the resolution of the page height width of the ui component

17294970
post	get
2 find out what the parameters are find out if the method is get or post

17294984
ansible	puppet
something like ansible puppet chef capistrano or the like

17295016
getdate	sysdate	postgresql	mysql
you might also use getdate sql server now mysql and postgresql sysdate oracle or something else

17295029
nhibernate	queryover
so i have written the same in nhibernate using queryover

17295085
post	get
this works fine for get requests but post requests will loose the parameters passed on the url

17295085
post	get
i need to get from to here maintaining post params

17295113
post	get
on the page load i want to pass first of drop down to another post method to get results from database but due to async calls it s coming null so i want to use method instead of

17295166
width	height
this works as expected except in chrome where the image won t scale its width proportionally once the height is reduced below the size at which it was first rendered

17295218
getter	setter
the vespromodel.java class just holds the fields of the table along with their getter and setter

17295258
google-chrome	firefox
2 the behaviour is same for firefox and google-chrome

17295288
post	get
i need to get number of times a fb user tagged in post

17295288
post	get
and even if you where able to query all relevant post you can only go so far back in time with fql after a while you will not get any data any more â so an overall count of how many times a user was tagged is not possible this way

17295327
width	height
you can also control the width and the height of the popup through the api

17295328
tinyint	varchar
if however i change this to bit or tinyint 1 it fails with mssql error conversion failed when converting the varchar value on to data type tinyint

17295364
post	get
based upon my code i ll get the typename from the view in my controller s post method

17295370
getter	setter
i have two dto objects say a and b which are having getter and setter and are used to take data from the database

17295405
int	double
just create a object with the same fields as your json make sure the types are the ones you are receiving string int double etc...

17295435
getdate	dateadd	dateadd	isnull
the code is for sql server in case you use another dbms u will need to replace dateadd minute -10 getdate for getting the timestamp 10 minutes before now and isnull tcount.numberofrecords10min 0 for eliminating nulls replacing with 0

17295444
move	drag
i drag a line between 2 divs with a tool and the arrow follows the rectangle bounds either if i move the source div or the destination div

17295444
move	drag
and i have a function that does the same think but when you drag a destination rectangle so every arrows that are bound to it move as well

17295469
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu and linux

17295613
getter	setter
indirectly when you override the abstract class properties the getter can retrieve from a private field and then you can create new properties that have setter that set those fields

17295621
google-chrome	firefox
ie10 firefox and google-chrome on the other hand return the updated size

17295643
postgresql	mysql
as i understand they are implemented as connection adapter methods and for example the mysql adapter has a add_column_sql method while the postgresql adapter does not and its sql is a variable inside its add_column method

17295648
width	height
or pass layoutparams.wrap_content into relativelayout.layoutparams and change height and width of your custom view

17295653
lodash	underscore.js
a i personally like lodash or underscore.js if you prefer partial for this

17295683

one of our customers however has a proxy server in between that strips incoming https request from their ssl payload and forwards a plain http request to the webserver

17295707
folder	directory
when i publish my project myweb.dll file is created in bin directory of publish folder

17295713
post	get
get this api can be visited by anyone but if it is post it just can be visited by admin

17295768
int	chars
if you have a function that needs that something chars or int in this case not the pointer itself you need to dereference the iterator

17295791
memcached	apc
memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc

17295791
memcached	apc
it s an ok option if you don t have apc memcached or equivalent in-memory caching

17295848
hash	salt
hash depend on your salt value

17295853
hide	show
this is the code that i want to show or hide when the check box is selected

17295855
bash	zsh
to the bottom of your shell rc file - if you are using bash then it would be your .bash_profile if you are using zsh it would be your .zshrc

17295919
getter	setter
perhaps somehow overriding the getter and setter on the mapped property itself

17295951
min	max
you can t use min and max like that

17295986
google-chrome	firefox
they updated quirks mode to be more like ie9 i think not sure on that so it s more in line with google-chrome firefox etc

17295988
ng-switch	ng-class
is it possible to avoid repeating the code here by replacing the ng-switch by ng-class

17296011
put	get
where i put users name and submit to get their information

17296043
implements	modifiers
i m working on implements dual-role modifiers keys

17296043
keydown	keyup
basically rshift on keydown and rshift up and on keyup

17296062
jar	war
that s why we provide sling both as a war file and self-contained runnable jar

17296202
opera	firefox
from what is said though no real difference in functionality except that findelementbyxpath is not available in the generic driver class so it doesn t allow to change driver from firefox to opera let s say easily

17296365
int	chars
assume that after chars there can be 2-5 int

17296378
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter	nsdatecomponents	nscalendar	nsdateformatter	nscalendar
in cocoa you use instances of nsdateformatter nscalendar nsdatecomponents to do this job

17296392
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

17296428
int	double
int string float double have simpleintegerproperty simplefloatproperty simpledoubleproperty simplestringproperty

17296482
int	chars
what that particular error is telling you is that at some point you are comparing a chars field it probably usually contains numbers to an int field

17296482
int	double
double check the datatype of each of those columns to make sure they are in fact int

17296516
sse	avx
for tlp i use openmp and for simd i used avx however the code below works for sse as well

17296516
sse	avx
this will use either avx to write 4 doubles at once or sse to write 2 doubles at once

17296598
width	height
height width are values that are specified at design layout time

17296598
width	height
use frameworkelement.actualheight and frameworkelement.actualwidth to get the rendered height width of a control

17296645
width	height
you can not able to get the dimension of the image that is height and width before downloading the image

17296683
post	get
here are a couple post i found that discuss how to get the full file path from a .net console application

17296702
google-chrome	firefox
it s okay if the solution won t work on google-chrome firefox etc

17296707
getter	setter
i think you re better off creating a new class that can store objects of the types that you want and just retrieve them using getter and setter

17296736
post	get
you can use server side _request which will work for both post and get method

17296746
width	height
enforce set the width height to 182

17296779
superclass	subclassing
first i don t think you can do what you want because the caller could always specify the superclass as the generic and then pass a subclassing as the first argument

17296819
gif	png
png and gif are necessary here

17296819
width	height
new_image imagecreatetruecolor width height

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
be aware that this will only work in google-chrome opera and ie10 firefox will support it soon

17296848
textarea	textbox
this textarea functionality is similar to rich textbox

17296882
notepad	textpad
i was able to remove them by directly editing the pdf file in textpad notepad might work also and changing the values for the cropbox setting

17296894
width	height
containers don t have a width or height so in that case you would have to calculate the width and height from its child-pobjects if those are all bitmaps or bitmapanimations

17296918
hide	show
however if you want to show hide using javascript

17296940
put	get	post	get	post	put
but that doesn t work since our api is using not only head and get requests but also post put delete

17296940
apache	nginx
another idea is using second ec2 instance instead of s3 bucket to host website using some web server like nginx or apache

17296945
int	chars
you could create a public chars property that uses a private int field and only map the field

17296956
daemons	systemd
if you re running the openssh ssh daemons on an android device and you ssh into it and start a bash shell it ll behave just like any other linux openssh bash systemd your processes will get sighup when you disconnect

17296966
int	double
core data uses nsnumber to store primitives such as int float double bool

17297055
inherited	properties
alright so now the object p inherited from f.prototype and it has an implicit properties named constructor which points to f itself

17297055
inherited	properties
now the object p inherited from f.prototype and it has an implicit properties named constructor which points to f itself

17297134

when save button is clicked i d like to do some checking such as i would like to send the data of textarea to store in the database table only if input checkbox is checked

17297184
persistent	transient
transient never persistent not associated with any session

17297265
int	chars
i am using the following code to take a string value like 9s or 4c that is located within a string array and find just the int value of the first chars

17297280
post	put
honestly i use the exact same pattern as you do except for the fact that i use post for object creation and put for updates only which is the standard way of doing it

17297280
post	put
also post should return 201 - created along with the created object and put should return 204 - no content with no data if the operation succeeds

17297287
google-chrome	firefox
note i ve seen this behavior in google-chrome and firefox

17297368
x86	64bit
compile for x86 and install the 32 bit oracle client on your 64bit server could run side by side if you change the oracle_home tns_admin .

17297629
children	parent
do you keep the parent if they are better than the children

17297630
stdout	stderr
you could setup two loggers one for stdout and one for stderr but then you would have to write

17297630
stdout	stderr
popen.wait will deadlock when using stdout pipe and or stderr pipe and the

17297657
post	get
the parameter is not needed for other types of requests except in ie8 when a post is made to a url that has already been requested by a get

17297669
folder	directory
then in each of your domains folder where it better suits your needs create a directory symlink to the common folder we just created.

17297706
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql will use their own variants

17297770
int	chars
somewhere in there you re storing int in a chars field

right now you are setting the view and label s height and width to the same thing

17297897
mapply	lapply
i have also done some experimenting with lapply mapply ddply but without any success so far

17297927
int	boolean
public view getchildview int groupposition int childposition boolean islastchild view convertview viewgroup parent

17297964
inherited	subclassing
this has the added advantage that subclassing can simply inherited it or override it to adjust what the method does including calling the original parent implementation

17298003
screens	tablet
2 i have to develop an app for 10.1 tablet and i was hoping that when i click on the activate camera button the front camera activates and rather than showing what the camera sees in the complete view i should be able to show it in a defined box on that screens

17298020
keydown	keyup
then you have events you can attach to the select element such as change keyup keydown etc.

17298091
youtube	vimeo

17298093
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox google-chrome safari all ok

17298132
width	height
the only solution i have come with is to get the plane that the polygon lies on it will always be flat and somehow rotate or translate the vertices in the above method to flatten it to the xy line to allow for the correct height and width to be determined

17298137
rdf	owl
nonetheless owl can be serialized as rdf and while there may be pitfalls because there might be variation in the way that an owl ontology can be serialized into rdf you can probably get the sort of results you want

17298153
put	get
i can t find how to compile the apache_mod.c with maven to get apache_mod.so because it seems that an apache2 module needs to be compiled with apxs2 command which already put the .so file in usr lib apache2 modules

17298167
accessor	properties
checking only isvirtual of properties s accessor will give you also interface properties that are not declared virtual in your class

17298366
prepare	execute
you can then look into using explain analyze possibly with separate prepare and explain analyze execute explain analyze true timing false to get the server runtime without detailed per-node timing overhead the log_min_duration_statement server setting psql s timing option the os time command etc

17298369
symfony	silex
bolt silex symfony based cms

17298390
ssl	https
if you re using https rather than git for your clone it s possible that it s barfing on the ca certificate you don t have a copy of the intermediate certificate to verify your ssl connection

17298390
debian-based	linux
usually with debian-based linux distributions

17298390
ssl	https
however this is a bad solution as of course turns off ssl verification which makes using https somewhat pointless and leaves you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks

17298390
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux	debian	linux
what you need to do is download the ca certificates package for whatever os you re on under linux well debian ubuntu it ll probably be something like

17298483
strsplit	substr
you can use substr and strsplit methods like

17298503
hide	show
alternatively you could only add the handler when you show the element and remove it when you hide it

i have this setup a main uiview contains an uitextview that has a uitextfield as subviews

17298881

17302301
client-side	server-side
if the editor does not keep database transactions connections open for the duration of file editing however and the java application runs client-side rather than server-side as you could simply create a lock in the editor for concurrency on the server side then things get a bit trickier and i haven t yet had enough database experience to say how you would resolve that as using a field in the database to indicate editing status would have concurrency problems with that type of setup unless the database itself supports locking on records but that would depend on the db engine in use

17302356

put	get
have your indexed get put accessors assemble a structure out of information stored in those arrays

17302538
getter	setter
for example if you wanted to behave like an array of point one could have a fixed array for all the x coordinates and a fixed array for all the y coordinates and then have the getter construct a point by combining an x and y value and the setter store the x and y values from the passed-in point

17302538

gridview	objectdatasource
i ran into this issue recently and through a series of obscure searches found that the reason i was seeing a second execution of both the selectmethod and the selectcountmethod specified in my objectdatasource was from changing the visibility of a column in the gridview after databinding had already occurred

17303112
gridview	objectdatasource
it turns out that any changes made to the columns shown in the gridview after it is databound will cause the objectdatasource to re-execute both methods

17303113

column should be anchored into its parent to have a real size and its children should anchor horizontally left and right into column to have a real width and for the height items must size them self according to their internal layout.

your parent will specify your children s size and position

17316134
children	parent
so for example if you have 2 items you want to display in the parent the parent will see that and measure half of the block s width for the one child and the other half for the other child then the parent will position the children so that they are displayed correctly

17316134
children	parent
your children s size will obviously be determined by the parent when the onmeasure is executed in the parent

this is safe so long as your vector has at least 4 elements in it iterators in general can be moved through the bounds of their range and random access iterators can be moved via addition subtraction of an integer type

17326644
children	parent
this should happen because the new parent that you have created you are associating existing children to it

17326644
children	parent
as long as there are new children added to the parent children which do not exist in db this should not be an issue

17326734

17327029
min	max
to get the max and min key values of the object if this is truly what you mean and not the key of max and min values perhaps worth clarifying in your question then for the example you have given you could do it alternatively in pojs like this

17327029
min	max
if on the other hand you want to get the key of the max an min values then you can do this in pojs

17327101
folder	directory
one way is to browse the repository to the place where you want to insert your new directory and right-click and select create folder

17327869

if you don t want the overhead of windowmanagers points or displays you can grab the height and width attributes of the topmost view item in your xml provided its height and width are set to match_parent

17327869
width	height
then findviewbyid r.id.entirelayout .getwidth will return the screen s width and findviewbyid r.id.entirelayout .getheight will return the screen s height

17327891
integer	unsigned
assuming it s an unsigned integer two of the following will do depending on the order of the bytes

17327930
children	parent
so i ve tried to create partials and nested resources but it s not working rails says that my edit link from parent to children is not valid

17327940

you could probably make it work from a post install hook by manipulating the userâ s project directly but that would get very fragile and likely break in the future

17327953
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade to rails 4.0.0 and i changed the gem versioning of sass-rails and coffee-rails

17327980

newer version of jquery will throw the error as it uses for..in to iterate and i guess older version uses for-loop to iterate as if you have passed as arrays your string gets split into characters hence the behavior

17328773
division	multiplication
reciprocal multiplication is used to implement division but using it for is easy based on the formula

17328796
put	get
when i put in lib assets javascripts datatables datatables i didn t get the error message and my page loaded up

pop-up	dialog
i would take the very same grid settings as used above and the jqgrid would display in a dialog pop-up or a new page

17328972

the main difference is that i would make an ajax call to get a rowcount first but only create the grid in the dialog pop-up new page if there was any data

17328972
pop-up	dialog
i have been looking at building the dialog pop-up grid inside a div on the page that currently has the functioning grid above on it

nfa	dfa
given that you have code to determinize a nfa to a dfa the simplest solution to minimize it is brzozowski s algorithm

17329117
spaces	delimiter
there is no need for delayed expansion a temp file or findstr and certainly no need to count spaces delimiter tokens

17329126

17330606
uinavigationcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
not knowing exactly why this was happening i backtracked and eventually started using jai s answer as a solution creating an entirely new uipageviewcontroller pushing it onto a uinavigationcontroller then popping out the old one

17330606
uinavigationcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
so the reason why uipageviewcontroller was squawking and giving assertion failures both when i originally attempted to call setviewcontrollers animated no in the completion block of setviewcontrollers animated yes and also now that i am simply using a uinavigationcontroller to push on a new uipageviewcontroller but doing it again in the completion block of setviewcontrollers animated yes is because it s all happening on that secondary queue

when you close the pool by matlabpool close parfor behaves just like a for and allows all graphics handling

17331960
calloc	malloc
but if you use calloc the subsequent loop is superfluous anyway unless you re on a weird machine where the in-memory representation of a null pointer is not all bits zero but then you should probably not use calloc but simply use malloc anyway

17331960
calloc	malloc
there are those who excoriate the use of casts on malloc and calloc

when i try to evaluate a corresponding scheme snippet of code in racket

17332247
getter	setter
it also makes sense to use properties for values that need to be shared across modules without needing to use getter and setter where you want to use obj.property rather than obj.getproperty

17332247
getter	setter
also property access is much more efficient than using a function to retrieve a value but getter and setter can provide significant functionality value validation and integrity checking over simply reading or assigning a value

17332258
disk	ram
no overhead for processor ram if the same format is frequently requested you are trading it with the disk storage which is cheap comparing to the formars

integer	unsigned
the name indicates it is reading an unsigned integer uint but the type used is a signed int

17332537
int	chars	getchar	fgetc
the type of c should be int because fgetc and getc and getchar return an int and not a chars

17332537
int	chars
as elchonon edelson said the chars constants such as 0 and 1 are int constants in c they d be chars constants in c++ and the values for 0 and 1 are very often 48 and 49 respectively but the c standard does not guarantee that

17332651
post	get
you could also explicitly create the form fields for the check boxes and use name post attribute_name_here as an attribute in your check box fields it looks to me like you will need some more explicit code to get this done since you are probably trying to save the selected item into one field for the post

if you ve got a side-column that s sitting outside your ng-view and that s what you want to turn off on then i d suggest including the class on the first page to make it go full-width and at the same time use some kind of logic with ng-hide ng-show on that first column

prng	random
in particular your numbers won t be normally distributed even if you re calling the prng s normal distribution function because the prng only guarantees that the random numbers generated from a particular seed will be normal

17355488
prng	random
if you need a large set of random numbers to be repeatable for a specific set of inputs then generate a single number which is a function of those inputs seed the prng with that then get numbers from the prng in a predictable sequence

17355488
prng	random
if the set of inputs you use to determine the random sequence is large and in particular larger that the size of the seed for your prng then you won t have a unique sequence for every set of inputs

children	parent
when the height of a parent element body html is auto the resulting height is calculated based on the natural heights of the children

17356107
children	parent
absolutely positioned children will have their position calculated based on their absolutely positioned parent

17356107
children	parent
because you removed the parent from flow control and gave it a height based on the viewport it no longer calculates its height based on its children and the larger child overflows

17356107
children	parent
but because it only involves pulling one element out of flow control you don t have to worry about the effects of adding more content on a precarious interaction between children heights and positioned parent

17356113

you should construct the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream at both ends

there may be support added in the future for width height but for now its not available

17357094

int	double
as others have said you can t convert a 150.0 to an int but you can convert it to a double single and then cast it to int

17358106
int	chars
this does mean for example that int 7777 value might be passed where only a chars is expected and the value may be truncated to 8 bits without warning but that s generally better than having the program crash because the number of bytes of data passed didn t match the number consumed or some other weird side effect

getter	setter
even if you use getter and setter which i personally would - i almost always keep fields private that doesn t mean that protected becomes pointless.

17358245
getter	setter
it just means that you re likely to make the getter and setter themselves protected rather than the variable

17358245
public	protected
for example in the template method pattern you may well have a public method which does some setup calls a protected abstract method and then perhaps does some final work too

17358268

17364732
int	chars
if the smaller type is signed then the promoted type is sign extended - the signed chars value -x is promoted to a signed int with the same value -x which in 2 s complement machines means prefixing it with some 0xff bytes

17364732
int	chars
unsigned chars 0xaa is promoted to unsigned int 0x00aa and unsigned chars 0x55 to unsigned int 0x0055

17364732
int	chars
signed chars 0xaa is promoted to signed int 0xffaa negative signed value is sign extended - signed chars value -86 is promoted to signed int value -86 and signed chars 0x55 to signed int 0x0055 positive signed chars value +85 is promoted to signed int value +85

17364732
int	chars
unsigned chars 0xaa is promoted to unsigned int 0x00aa inverted to 0xff55 then stored as an unsigned chars causing it to be truncated to 0x55

while rdf and owl are often used together owl data is serialized in rdf the two are conceptually distinct

17364802
swrl	owl	rdf	swrl	rdf	owl
an owl reasoner could be implemented that makes no use of rdf and a swrl engine could be built that make no use of rdf graphs

17364836
width	height
i want if used does not provided width or height or provided empty brackets or not provided it at all then groups for width and height does not evaluates

17364915

17365506
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview just redirects paint events to the underlying invisible qwidget

selecteditem	selectedindex
selectedindex is a number not the selecteditem

17365665
google-chrome	firefox
but seems you code shows unwanted behaviour on firefox as well and only works on google-chrome suggesting that maybe this is not the solution you are after

17365678
udp	tcp
this game server actually uses sessions which have both tcp and udp connections

17365678
udp	tcp
this makes it easy to send reliable data over tcp and all the frame data over udp

17365694
udp	tcp
note for the slow response scenario make sure that the ports that are required by kerberos authentication udp 88 and tcp 88 are open when a firewall is involved in the perimeter network

put	get	post	get	post	put
you can choose to follow the general standard and use get put and post calls to interact with these items but then you can t use sitecore caching without custom backend caching code

17366286
put	get	post	get	post	put
if you are going to create multiple sublayouts i recommend creating a base class that handles general methods for get put and post and then use those classes as the base for your sublayouts

17366286
put	get	post	get	post	put
for post use the request.form object to get all of the form elements and iterate through them to process the information provided it may be easiest to put all of your form data into a single json object encapsulated as a string so .net sees it as a string and therefore one single property and then you only have one element in the post to deserialize depending on the post path the user specified

17366321
folder	directory
it fails and it doesn t download any dependencies from nexus and still no repository folder is created in .m2 directory

17366486

width	height
to do this before you copypicture set its height equal to its width like this

17366565
integer	unsigned
you can simply request the data as an unsigned integer

17366569
width	height
you specify the height and width of the window in the call to window.open like so

allocator	stl
most of the time i am confused about how allocator deallocation of stl objects is done

17366656
allocator	stl
also can anyone give references where i can read up how is allocator deallocation handled in stl or what are best practices to avoid such memory copying issue in case of large applications

17366657
client-side	server-side
i wrote an application in java rmi and the server-side part is in a machine and the client-side is in another one

int	chars
the times are stored in the database as int so this case statement is used to rebuild either 3 or 4 chars int into a datetime

17367118
mousemove	mouseenter
so you don t need it to inherit control and to register mouseenter you have to add mousemove event handler for your form not your line

17367204
google-chrome	firefox
i am using svg crowbar and it works great in google-chrome but in firefox it does not export the css with it and i m just not going to bother with ie

17367444
squash	fast-forward
note that currently only squash and fast-forward options are supported

17367476
width	text-align
span tags do not have display block by default so the text-align will not have an effect since the span tag will just occupy the width of its contents

17367480
width	height
standard properties width and height are setted properly byt costom property framescount does not

17367536
post	get
i suspect that you re seeing this issue because you re including a query string with a post request instead of a get request and so rails isn t decoding the query string

17367546
width	margin
outer an auto margin and a width

17367548
integer	unsigned
if you really need an unsigned integer type to store pointers use uintptr_t or intptr_t for signed integer type in

17367818
width	height
topofcell.png is a first cell and you can put a img height 10px width 300px with corner radius 5 in the middle you can use a img width 300px height 1136px with some graphics and in the bottom mirrored the first one you can see your table with graphics pragmatically

17368213
charindex	substr
charindex will return 0 if no spaces are in the string and then you look for a substr of -1 length

17368244
width	height
the technique should not depend on explicitly knowing the width or height of either the centered content or the containing box

gson	jackson
these type of things can best be done by libraries such as gson or jackson

17368937
laravel	codeigniter
the trick is to not use the codeigniter library load method.it will always throw an error because codeigniter does not yet support namespaces likely why so many people are moving to laravel and the cfpropertylist library uses namespaces

17369106
calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
there are various valid ways to return a pointer to a struct or any type of object but the only way to return a pointer to a new object that didn t exist before the function was called is to use malloc realloc calloc aligned_alloc c11 or some implementation-defined allocation function mmap on posix systems etc.

17369128
pull	push
i assume you started your deriv repository by running git clone main deriv and that you want a workflow where you pull from main but never push

it has built-in converters for simple types like int or boolean but not for complex types not to mention your own types

17369244
google-chrome	firefox
so because of that this is what worked for me in ie firefox and google-chrome

17369252
fish	bash
that alias works in bash so you probably wanna port it to a fish

google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the vertical centering of the text is done via flexbox which has limited support google-chrome ie10 opera safari most mobile browsers

17369285
integer	unsigned
the first conversion converts the value to an unsigned integer

17369285
int	double
the second takes that int and converts it to a double of the same value

17369287
integer	unsigned
i should note that my strings were originally created using nsuintegers unsigned ints so i didn t have to worry about parsing an integer that was too big

17369301
folder	directory
however the act of loading a page creates a app_code folder on my ci server and after that i get the message the directory app_code is not allowed because the application is precompiled

17369366
mouseover	mouseout
full code for mouseover mouseout events

17369377
folder	directory
so the first simple saving is using a file .plist inside your app under the appdelegate.m you have to check your directory if the file exist and copy inside a documents directory the only writable folder but after that you have to learn how to load and save on the same file using dictionary mutabledictionary and some other class

17369433
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i right click on the image and ask to copy image location in the google-chrome browser copy image url

17369457
installation	upgrade
so we rolled back to the q1 installation and decided to upgrade in a controlled environment

17369474
width	height
2 once the view loads programatically find the height of linear layout and then programatically set the width of the squareview to this same value to make it a square

17369510
getter	setter
ember s extends is actually a much more sophisticated object system that provides getter and setter computed properties among other things

assuming txtbox1 is the string the user enters and spaces is the word delimiter

17388332
children	parent
i have done the concatenating the strings part but the problem is children concatenated with their parent are still there. they should have been deleted. and i thought by writing a clear method i could deal with it

17388335
int	double
reftype1 contains int and double fields and another array of int with on average 50 elements

17388335
int	double
reftype2 and reftype3 contain int and double fields and another array of reference type reftype4

17388377
screens	tablet
with smartphones and tablet devices becoming increasingly popular it s becoming more and more important to optimize our websites for different screens sizes

17388379
filtering	grouping
the files are dirrerent kind pdf images doc txt and so on several are identical like above file2 - easy to filtering with digest md5 but the only way grouping them together is based on common parts of a path - project1 subproject and so on

17388380
hide	show	children	parent
on click of parent 1 it reveals its children and when you click on parent 2 parent 1 s children hide and parent 2 s children show

17388380
hide	show	children	parent
and if parent 1 s children show you wil be able to hide them by clicking on parent 1 again

17388397
mp4	webm
if you mainly wish to be able to programmatically cut and join video you could certainly just adopt mp4 h264 instead but you may be pro-freedom and whatnot and wish to use webm for ideological or monetary reasons

17388413
setinterval	clearinterval
the setinterval method will continue calling the function until clearinterval is called or the window is closed

17388414
actualheight	actualwidth
to get it to fill your screen you would compare the actualwidth or actualheight properties of your scrollviewer and its content and set the zoom factor to the result

17388436
google-chrome	firefox
- a way to inspect elements like you can do in google-chrome and firefox

17388472
gif	png
i have had this problem as well the issue is usually that even if the image compresses well both png and gif usually does a good job the image fails to load because most image viewing programs uncompress the image in memory before displaying it

17388490
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient

17388504
jar	war
if you just export the project to jar file you can package the jar war by using the apache ant tool

17388512
children	parent
however you can still look for the parent node then iterate over the parent s children until you found your node to retrieve its index

17388587
int	double
however this means that only int value could be used or numberformatexception will be thrown than for string.valueof some_variable it doesn t matter cuz it works for any type of value including all primitives float double byte long etc and will never throw any exception

17388595
ready	each
so i re-wrote the script that determines which javascripts to add to which page in php and had the new php script enqueue each of the javascripts in the wordpress-approved form listing the relevant bits of jquery and jquery ui as dependencies which makes wordpress take responsibility that those dependencies are loaded and ready to use with the exception of the quirk when the enqueued javascript runs

17388602
width	height
note that for sprites which go outside the screen boundaries they wrap around this is done by the mod width mod height parts

17388607
width	height
i use diameter to assign the its width height and borderradius

17388607
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the result is something that looks like a circle at least in google-chrome firefox opera and safari

17388607
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
testing in google-chrome firefox opera and safari i noticed that this behaves differently for css hover and javascript onmousedown when the cursor is just outside the area of the circle but inside the area of the rectangle that would be visible if border-radius was not set

17388623
width	height
6 percent of window height and 3 percent of window width

17388637
put	get
-------------------------this is my out put jsp where i get null value-------------

17388650
qgraphicsscene	qimage	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qimage
the qimage is then converted to qpixmap which is used to create a qgraphicsscene and from the qgraphicsscene i create a qgraphicsview

17388683
put	get
i m very new in c# and what i m trying to do is build a web service when user can put latitude and longitude and get the google type back

17388708
screens	tablet
i am trying to create a custom settings activity for an app where i want a normal full screens activity for phones and a custom calculated size for tablet that lays on top of the back activity

17388708
width	height
i have no title the size of the content does only fill out the width and height that i have set and are centred on the screen

17388714
mamp	wamp
i found out that this line wasn t generating the correct request in wamp but it was generating the correct request in mamp

17388754
pop-up	dialog
so you could just store a boolean in sharedpreferences to show a pop-up dialog after x number of app opens if this value is true

17388818
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in firefox 22 but not in google-chrome 27.0.1453.116 m

17388830
loops	if-statement
but given the other choices using a switch or if-statement to decide what to do are rarely good either and with a bit of good design don t design something that calls a virtual function to add two integers together if it s going to be called in a tight loops - because the overhead is going to be fairly significant - use a function that knows there are hundreds or thousands of integers to add together - if possible of course

17388841
int	chars
because is converted to an int to do the arithmetic which then cannot be put back into a chars array

17388841
int	chars
doesn t convert the chars into an int when doing the increment so it compiles ok

17388841
int	chars
note that the following line will compile ok because we are casting the int result back to chars before putting it in the chars array

17388841
int	chars
if your goal is to count up the number of occurrences of each chars you should instead use an int array since you are interested in counts

17388841
int	chars
if you really do want to count up the number of occurrences of all the chars in some text one good way to do it is to use a where each chars maps to an int count

17388899
int	double
i ve tried the same for sum and it works fine with long int double and float

17388952
cpu	processors
i should add that i am skipping over the more complex scenarios where there is contention for cpu time such as on a single-core processors

17389104
keyup	onfocus
trigger the keyup handler onfocus

17389141
margin	height
however it appears that safari calculates top bottom margin percentages with respect to the height of the containing block which makes more logical sense but is nevertheless incorrect as far as w3 standards go

17389181
getter	setter
if you do tdd you should write a test for getter and setter

17389181
getter	setter
its a kind of religious war to use a tandem of getter and setter for

17389181
getter	setter
to look in the getter and the setter to figure out what caused the

17389181
getter	setter
if you want to identify obsolete getter setter and other dead methods which are not used by production code use static code analysis for that

17389184
put	get
get the last value you put inside the sharedpreferences and concat with the new one for instance

17389232
mouse	keyboard
handle keyboard mouse inputs

17389302
rss	feed
with the rss feed i actualize the links

17389345
margin	text-align
mayb you should set inline-block maybe text-align center and reset margin padding of second level too

17389385
cvs	svn
of course there s middle solutions to this problem like svn but let s say you use something like cvs och vss

17389399
hash	md5
you could use md5 it is a hash algorithm

17389423
hash	md5
for the security bit you could hash the correct password an then create the hast of the input and check if those are equal for example md5 or sha1 as posted in the answer before md5 and i think sha1 too are not secure but i doubt anyone would put so much effort in unlocking this level

17389424
post	get
at first you must get post instance not class

17389424
post	get
with post instance you can get propery by index

17389437
client-side	server-side
there is very little you can do to secure the password on the client-side without using a hash function and server-side run-time communication

17389532
filtering	grouping
this default view is shared by all bindings to the collection which causes all direct bindings to the collection to share the sort filtering grouping and current item characteristics of the one default view

17389559
inherited	properties
an abstract contains common methods and properties that are available to all child classes that inherited from it so you don t need to re-define those identical blocks of code in every child class but use inherited so that they are only defined in a single place

17389586
super	extends
it s not ideal - i d prefer more semantic ids like - but it s good enough and it s super easy - it means i don t need to set up and learn another markdown parser or work out how to extends the redcarpet

17389602
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested on firefox google-chrome opera safari and ie and it works

17389646
int	chars
whereas float to byte short chars int or long is narrowing conversion

17389698
opera	google-chrome
tested in google-chrome and opera

17389723
opencv	emgucv
for apache you needed to compile opencv and emgucv for linux and then install mod_mono for apache

17389725
implements	extends
it is also worth adding that a class can implements multiple interfaces but it can only extends one class abstract or concrete

17389779
dbcontext	objectcontext
plus there are other code differences between dbcontext and objectcontext

17389818
width	height
when you used 200x200 image it was the same whether you used width or height

17389818
opencv	emgucv
you could do that by using pointers much faster because if you are using indexing emgucv internally uses calls to opencv for an every pixel

17389840
pdu	smpp
even when there are no sms or dlrs to send receive there is a continous exchange of smpp pdu enquire_link enquire-link_resp that ensure that the bind is established

17389845
width	height
the dimension class encapsulates the width and height of a component

17389845
width	height
so if you need a dimension class holding width and height in floating point precision you can t use java.awt.dimension

17389862
direct3d	directx
for example you might end up with a dependency on a direct3d dll for a qwidget based project which is due to the fact many of the stock qt builds are built to use angle which is a directx based emulation layer of opengl es 2

17389862
qtcore	qtgui	qtwidgets	qtgui	qtwidgets	qtcore
static builds are really nice because they offer better performance and you end up with a single file of about 8-9 mb for basic gui application qtcore qtgui and qtwidgets

17389889
width	height
the dimension class encapsulates the width and height of a component .

17389889
width	height
write your own class that can handle float values as width and height

17389924
spanned	charsequence
but this won t work for html emails because spanned returned by html.fromhtml is not a subclass of charsequence

17389934
oncreate	recreate
so instead of defining the fragment in your layout xml you can define a fragment container and add your fragment to the container in the oncreate of the parent activity to ensure that when activity is recreate you are also creating a new fragment and commit

17389936
submit	submission
currently you are starting the submit for the first and then starting the second right after so the second one stops the first one from submission

17389950
google-chrome	firefox
however this animation is only 3-dimensional in google-chrome not in firefox or ie 10

17389967
int	chars
in general it s okay to cast down from an int to a chars but not the other way around

17389977
puts	gets
the pipelines are then just normal channels that you use with puts gets read fconfigure etc

17390018
solaris	aix
remember that most linux libraries are intended for use on other unix-like platforms also the bsds solaris aix osx even

17390021
spanned	charsequence
this works around the problem for plain text emails but won t work for html emails because spanned returned by html.fromhtml is not a subclass of charsequence

17390068
libjpeg	libtiff	libjpeg	libpng	libtiff	libpng
and libc6-dev is part of the required group like libjpeg libncurses libpng libtiff xlibs etc

17390072
google-chrome	firefox
firefox not just firefox google-chrome ie etc does it as well automatically add accept headers

17390117
centos	linux
i used another linux distro centos 6 before and it worked fine for me and other users

17390154
jobs	cron
struggling with cron jobs

17390154
jobs	cron
until recently had whenever cron jobs running successfully several times a day

17390154
jobs	cron
now the cron jobs are somehow failing as i can see from syslog

17390175
nsurl	nsstring
how to get the nsurl nsstring for a file path in internal directory

17390225
for-loop	arrays
or you can give up on clearing the arrays at construction and add a for-loop right after your line to do the clearing

17390242
inherited	properties
the graph properties is inherited from cptlayer

17390267
ord	chr
it takes two input strings converts the corresponding character in each string to its ord inal representation xors them together converts that back to ascii with chr and joins the whole mess together again

17390282
rss	feed
i have a website and that website has rss feed attached to facebook page

17390282
google-chrome	firefox
they only work in google-chrome means they are properly redirected in google-chrome browser and not in firefox and ie

17390282
post	get
whenever i click on links of post on my page through ie or firefox the url does not simply redirect to my website and i get to see nothing as if i am not connecting to internet

17390282
google-chrome	firefox
and i checked i am not alone even the tech giant website mashable.com links also don t open in ie and firefox from facebook they only open in google-chrome

17390301
entity-relationship	diagram
i am looking for free online flash silverlight or javascript - simply browser-based tool for creating uml diagram entity-relationship diagram

17390324
stdout	stderr
each process has it s own stdout stdin stderr so as the cron tasks is on a new process it won t print to your terminal process stdout

17390407
int	double
by universal binary format i mean format that will allow me to save any common structure string int float double custom structures like vector3f - 3 float values as one object etc. will be space ram and cpu-efficient and will have parser and saver written in java

17390429
addclass	removeclass
addclass and removeclass are only helper functions which are kind of overrated for this simple case

17390435
intersect	contains
it selects items where they do not intersect with the selected items list where selection is determined by whether one string contains the other

17390437
bash	subshell
this differs from under certain circumstances such as subshell that do not require bash to be re-initialized

17390463
matlab	simulink
iâ m trying to call java methods from simulink matlab using jni

17390463
matlab	simulink
simulink matlab has some methods to be used

17390478
folder	directory
optionally to allow all newly created by apache or some other user files and folder be accessible from your user make them receive group ownership same as their parent folder by setting groupid bit recursively on your project root directory chmod -r g+s path to project root

17390490
int	chars
if i understand your needs correctly uint style ones are the only ones that will give you binary compatibility guarantee and of cause int chars will but others tend to differ

17390571
gif	png
the script works 100 fine with all jpeg jpg gif png s except for those images that have been imported by the user with iphoto.

17390597
jobs	cron
also i prefer creating rake tasks for cron jobs as opposed to runners

17390623
dictionary	map
background the dictionary maps state label-tuples to successor states for an nfa and i map to true and false to immediately accept reject the word

17390674
switching	screens
those view s frame doesn t cover the whole screens and i need to switching between them when selecting different tab items

17390787
post	get
when you submit a message the information is sent via post data to a page within an iframe on the current page but i can t seem to get it to both submit and clear the one specific textbox

17390796
cos	sin
n.b the cos and sin predicates work with radians

17390828
width	height
i have a jbutton that is stretched to it s parents width height via girdbaglayout

17390828
width	font-size
the reason the button s font-size is calculated relative to the button s size for this calculation its width is needed.

17390849
width	height
but you can read directly the width and height property of the img dom element after

17390866
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
openfiledialog and savefiledialog position themselves in the upper-left corner of

17390909
folder	directory
i have a applet which usually uses jacorb.jar in endorsed directory under jre .now i made a change in code to download jacorb.jar tp the windows temp folder eg

17390918
post	get
i get the ajax error alert that i defined as post failed

17390963
getter	setter
note that a getter setter is unnecessary here

17390968
put	get	post	get	post	put
put get delete post accept three arguments

17390980
postgresql	mysql
we are very interested in using meteor in some of our upcoming web applications but as many others we have existing postgresql and mysql databases that we need to interface with

17390980
postgresql	mysql
i see that someone has started work on integrating mysql with meteor but i haven t been able to find anything for postgresql

17391038
google-chrome	firefox
on desktops when clicking on this link google-chrome just ignores the link but firefox and internet explorer redirect to an error page

17391055
put	get
i can put any valid value for layout_height and get the same result

17391055
margin	height
i ve never used the height attribute in xml but i couldn t find the difference in the docs particularly how each one is calculated when the element it s operating on also has values set for padding and or margin

17391132
width	height
the height of pseudoelements has to be equal with border width of box.div

17391158
getter	setter
the getter and setter need to have a capital letter after get set

17391160
post	get
you can t be using using get because your form is using post

17391207
margin	background-color
css white background-color and negative margin

17391241
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux ubuntu

17391255
kerberos	ntlm
the browser sends an ntlm type-1 token because kerberos has failed because your ad dns setup is incorrect

17391257
width	height
yes it seems reasonable to think of a square as a subclass of rectangle for which both the width and the height are equal

17391258
keydown	keyup
the best way is to use the keydown and keyup events along with a timer

17391258
keydown	keyup
so when a key triggers a keydown event you set an interval timer that fires every x milliseconds with your function then cancels the interval when keyup is triggered

17391263
mouse	keyboard
basically all ui event handling is always done on a single specific thread called the event dispatch thread and doing anything else in that thread prevents ui events mouse clicks keyboard input etc from being processed and thus makes the ui hang

17391299
width	height
and following link to customize grid height width font size and font family

17391319
spaces	delimiter
either remove from the inner loop so it uses the default delimiter spaces and tab or choose a different delimiter character and your script should work as expected

17391319
spaces	delimiter
note however that relying on the default delimiter in the inner loop may produce undesired results when fields of the nested array contain spaces

17391319
spaces	delimiter
this is because spaces and tabs are the default delimiter in for f loops

17391361
put	get
i used a brute force technique just to see if i could put an array in a div by using the jquery .html command the only command i could get to work - i tried .val .data and a bunch of other methods for putting the array in a div.

17391372
folder	directory
hello i m trying to create a directory in the users folder

17391376
spaces	delimiter
i tried to change the delimiter to and i got the same result with spaces instead of commas

17391379
width	height
you are basically throwing them all in the dashboard setting the height and width properties and letting them render

17391400
tiff	png
check the image format that has been exported from iphoto.photos from iphoto can be exported as jpeg | png | tiff

17391447

uitableview	uisearchbar
having set viewforheaderinsection to be a uisearchbar for in order to have it at the top of my uitableview

17391500
folder	directory
it is also a good idea for development environment to setup a workspace directory in your home folder to hold your projects and than making virtualhost files in your etc apache2 sites-available folder you need sudo privileges

17391511
appfuse	spring
i have an appfuse app spring mvc + hibernate i would like to deploy on heroku

17391549
inherited	properties
i need to create a main class animal then have two sub classes inherited properties from animal which are cat and dog then i was to make multiple objects multiple cat s and dog s inherited from the class cat and dog i read it s not really a class but it behaves as a class

17391565
pop-up	dialog
use dialog instead of jframe for pop-up window

17391565
mouse	keyboard
with setmodal modalitytypes to prevent mouse and keyboard events outside jdialog if is required

17391593
windows	wow64
i am trying to compile and run code snippet bellow which work in windows x86 or wow64

ubuntu	debian
i have tried to run it on debian wheezy stable and ubuntu lts 12.04

17391780
width	height
i m trying to get the width height of a element with jquery

17391780
width	height
the only way to get the actual width height of hello world is to remove the div tags around it

17391781
portrait	landscape
when you rotate the view everything works fine but when you switch to another tab and then go back to that tab in landscape the view webview searchbar and toolbar go back to the portrait layout.this is the code i used but it doesn t seem to work

17391803
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason when i open the file this message shows up in both google-chrome and firefox

17391902
pop-up	dialog
this makes no sense ok should be there while i see the pop-up dialog

17391904
folder	directory
basically i d like to to able to use git on a certain folder without keeping the .git directory in that same folder

17391967
128bit	64bit
the older arms may or may not have been from that era but post acorn the armv4 to the present is a 32 bit system from a perspective of the size of the general purpose registers the data bus is 32 or 64bit the newest arms have 64bit registers and i would assume if not already 128bit busses depending on your system

17391967
x86	mips
certainly compiled for arm that is what you will get or mips or x86 or power pc etc

17392010
websocket	pusher	pull	push
the only thing that might be a little different is if you need to implement a realtime feature you could check websocket and a push server like faye railscast or pusher so you don t have to pull data from rails doing a request ever x seconds

17392048
subtract	add
it says that if we add 1 to the maximum value and subtract 1 from minimum

17392049
uiview	subviews
i m using the initwithframe method for initializing a uiview that would act as a subviews for the main view of the view controller

17392049
portrait	landscape
however the uiview always seems to present itself based upon a portrait mode frame thereby hugging itself to the side of screen instead of a landscape mode frame where it would cover the entire screen

17392158
put	get
i am not willing to put a breakpoint on the next line and then continue that will get very old very fast

17392162
hide	show
i am trying to show hide columns of a datagrid via a context menu

17392170
accessor	properties
in a nutshell add an action properties to your viewmodel with get and set accessor

17392207
many-to-many	one-to-many
the models are linked to each other one-to-many many-to-many almost kinds of relationships and now i have a problem when deleting one entity which is being used by other entities

17392209
hide	show
why don t you make just one that has server controls inside of it and then you can show hide the ones that do or do not meet the conditions like this

17392219
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
my code works in ie 10 firefox google-chrome safari mobile safari mobile google-chrome

17392298
getter	setter
because of lazy loading the values in the field only get loaded when you access them from the class itself. something that in normal circumstances would use a setter getter

17392298
getter	setter
in order to load the values you ether have to write getter and setter

17392311
post	get
for example if you have stored the username in a table called info and you get the user-entered value through a form post then your code should look something like

17392319
post	put
so i ve been battling with this issue for the last 2-3 hours and i decided to put a post here and someone might help

17392343
hash	md5
i recently had to change my password via database using md5 hash generator

17392347
int	chars	division	modulo
if you were counting by incrementing an int then you d have to convert to a string each time and read off the chars or use floor and modulo division each time to pick out one digit neither of which are acceptable

17392361
int	chars
as you can see is the single chars - which can t be converted to an int

17392384
min	max
the mminguestcpu variable and associated getminguestcpucount method and mmaxguestcpu getmaxguestcpucount should be relatively straightforward - typically it will be 1 for the min and the max will be the number of physical logical cores available on the host

17392411
ssl	https
i ve forced https ssl in many applications using this approach

17392417

pop-up	dialog
i created clickable icon that when clicked should pop-up a dialog with some information

17393736
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
private variables are not seen by the subclassing so if i need to access or change the variables of the superclass in my subclassing i am forced to use some accessor and mutators method like getmyprivatevariable or setmyprivatevariable

17393736
inherited	subclassing
but when you extend some class and inherited its members this works as if you have declared them in the subclassing directly

17393736
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i understand that such a practice would break encapsulation but this seems irrelevant in the case of inherited because again in this case everything works as if the members of the superclass were declared in the subclassing so the subclassing has a natural right for being able to access its members directly no matter if they were inherited or not

17393748
button	checkbox
i just want each item in the list to have a checkbox so you can select one or multiple notes and then press a delete button redirect to an are you sure you want to delete.

libpcap winpcap is a cross-platform library originally created for bsd un x and created long before .net even existed so it was obviously not designed with .net s networking objects in mind

17393950
mouseleave	mouseenter
if in the loop where the markers are created you give each sidebar item a reference to its marker instead of the locid then there s no need to loop to rediscover the marker on mouseenter mouseleave

17393950
mouseleave	mouseenter
now the mouseenter mouseleave handlers should simplify as follows

17393950
mouseleave	mouseenter
and the corresponding mouseenter mouseleave handlers would be

17393950
hide	show
to get the sidebar entries to show hide in sympathy with the category controls initialize should be as follows

17393958
inherited	subclassing
if i need to access or change the inherited variables in my subclassing i am forced to use some accessor ...

17393958
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
you may be confusing the meaning of inherited with the fact that the instance of the subclassing possesses all the members of its superclass

17393958
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the best way to see what it means that private members are not inherited is observing that the subclassing may declare its own private member and this can never cause a clash with a superclass s private member of the same name

17393958
public	protected
members are declared protected only when designing a class specfically to be used by subclassing in this case the protected members are in fact a part of its public api

17393958
public	protected
if such classes had all their members protected it would be tantamount to making them public since any client code could trivially make its dummy subclass not adding anything to the parent but exposing its internals

17393961
folder	dir
i had to move my devserver folder to c program files common files microsoft shared devserver dir

17394036

i want the container to also have max and min dimensions

17394086
min	max
i ve also added the max min dimensions

17394093

17394899
stdout	stderr
probably the problem that you re running into is that program.py is printing things both to stdout which works for going into output.txt using and to stderr which would not go into the output.txt file using but would go into it if you used 2 instead

17394908
mouse	keyboard
i don t want them to be able to change the text of the item just select it with the mouse keyboard

17394930
width	height
do this also for the width the thing you didn t expect from your code is the height inside the try block you must note that it s vailed only inside try block

17395436
min	max
i don t need the min and max in my java if i can keep the memory in the rs

17395436
min	max
i like the idea of learning the scene with the min and max values of the color and comparing the next snapshot with the min and max

17395446
d3.js	leaflet	leaflet	openlayers
i was thinking of generating tiles to serve to openlayers or leaflet for display but my data has a graph structure that i would like to take advantage of and i think using neo4j possibly in combination with a visualization library like d3.js may be an easier way to build my tool

17395481
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
problem occurs in browsers like firefox google-chrome and opera - but works fine on ie9

17395513
inherited	properties
but that only works for object like o that inherited the constructor properties from their prototype object and where that has a useful value with something pointing to the prototype object

17395513
inherited	properties
because you re trapped in the circular structure as myconstructor.prototype has that constructor properties itself and not inherited from object.prototype

17395553
put	get
the same applies when i want to put bar inside a string instead i can use m - to get this

17395566
getter	setter
so i place its setter and getter using the property and synthesize method

17395587
for-loop	arrays

17395755
getter	setter
attr_accessor creates getter an setter methods for an in-memory attribute on that model

17395755
getter	setter
this will take precedence over the getter and setter method that are automatically generated by activerecord for your underlying database attribute so when you call save ar doesn t think that you ve updated approved_at because really you haven t you ve updated the virtual attribute only

17395788
width	margin
my end goal is to have two boxes each sharing 50 of width with margin in-between them

17395803

17395948
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
the user input is delegated to a separate function so that i may expand the program to subtraction multiplication and division without repeating lines

17395969
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
and then run crypt over the output of pi as the input for the password field passing in the sha512 hash as the salt more on that in a second

17395969
crypt	salt
you re incorrectly feeding the password into the salt component of crypt when using crypt_des which is horrifically weak

17395980
wav	flac
i ve managed to write the flac converter tested and works but it does not encode the wav files i ve been writing

17395986

for example if a parent layer is scaled at 50 then all the children will have the 50 factored in when they display even if the scaling for the individual object is 100

17396092
ubuntu	linux
i am programming it in my linux ubuntu environment and i need to have the finalized product be a .exe file to run on windows

17396156
integer	unsigned
as i already outlined in a comment above the root cause of the problems you are having is that php has no concept of unsigned integers and it handles this by converting numbers that overflow the bounds of an integer to floating point which doesn t play nice with bitwise operations

17396156
hex	binary
it s worth noting that your current approach to certain procedures is very inefficient - all that converting to from hex strings and places where binary is represented as ascii strings - but i ll gloss over that for now while i show you how to quick-fix your current implementation

17396156
hex	binary
we also need to replace all those 0xffffffff hex literals with a binary safe implementation as these will also result in a float on 32-bit systems

17396175
cfstring	nsstring
nsstring is a convenience wrapper around cfstring

17396175
cfstring	nsstring
i would try to avoid cfstring if you can get acceptible performance with nsstring

17396179
google-chrome	firefox
the code works in firefox and google-chrome

17396202
client-side	server-side
since this is a client-side captcha and not a server-side captcha you may have to do nothing since the value is not received from nor passed to the server and all it serves is to be a local gatekeeper before the next request is made

17396202
next	except
as you have already recorded the next request which would be the result of a positive captcha then you may have to do nothing except run the script again not withstanding any other non-captcha dynamic data which needs to be in place to execute the next page

17396252
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you want width to be fluid but padding to be fixed or vice-versa then you need width 50 with box-sizing border-box

ios safari and google-chrome don t respect lang attribute and they always apply browser s locale

17396310
onresume	onpause
originally i wanted the fragments to update as they were swiped to but since they re swipeable i can t use onpause and onresume because onpause and thus onresume only gets called when a tab is 2+ screens away

17396319
versioning	upgrade
perhaps a good way to do it is by copying this exact implementation if you are working with a previous versioning of java and that way later when you upgrade to the jdk 8 all you will have to do is to use the new jdk implementation for the method

17396321
min	max
and previously i defined the min and max from the content of the mpmovieplayercontroller

17396336

the solution we re looking into is to provide server-side paging with support for filtering and sorting

17398653

post honeycomb apps have to be started manually by the user after installation or upgrade

17404342

17404603
children	parent
in other words all direct children need to follow the parent in the list

17404666
division	multiplication
unfortunately this straight forward approach doesn t do the trick since it either overflows as pos old range new can be as large as 2 94 if i do the multiplication first or gives me rounding errors if i do the division first

17404666
division	modulo
this ensures that the calculation neither overflows the limits of a long-integer at any point nor looses accuracy due to premature rounding the modulo captures the part lost to rounding in the first division

17404671
width	height

17404827
hex	binary
use binascii.unhexlify to turn your hex strings to binary data then xor that going back to hex with binascii.hexlify

17404827
ord	chr
the actual xor is applied per byte of the decoded data using ord and chr to go to and from integers

17404827
int	chars
you don t have to use unhexlify but it is a lot easier than looping over s1 and s2 2 chars at a time and using int twocharacters 16 to turn that into int values for xor operations

17404827
ord	chr
use bytes instead of str.join and you can drop the chr and ord calls as you get to iterate over integers directly

17404847
portrait	landscape
for some reasons we had the terrible idea to have an application with a fixed landscape orientation and one screen is in portrait

17404874

because the result is blob binary string you simply have to convert it to integer in this case unsigned int but if you use signed then you will get signed integer

17405786

property visibility in a subclass can only be the same level or more liberate private - protected - public but never more restrictive

17409767
getter	setter
doctrine generate entities did not take superclass s public property into account when generating the getter setter as the implementation with a public property is non-standard

so code from tutorial legitimately makes width and height to match

17410490
width	height
for the second call however containing relativelayout takes margins and padding into account and passes measurespec for width with exact mode while height is passed in at_most mode

17410490
width	height
for vertical screen this works ok because width got reduced by margins and value for height is still height of the screen also reduced by margins

17410490
width	height
for the horizontal screen orientation however width is set to the value defined during first call while height is reduced by margins

17410490

when code tries to set width to match height this setting operation does not work properly because width mode is exact

this will ensure that no matter how much padding or margin you have it will always stay at the height and width you specify

17410564
min	max
however it is definitely faster than doing it on cpu and the output would be min max value

17410616
min	max
for a 100x100 texture you could try rendering to a 20x20 grid texture have the fragment shader do 5x5 lookups with gl_nearest to determine min and max then download the 20x20 texture and do the rest on the cpu

17412569
elf	coff
using elf in place of coff gives following error

17412727
getter	setter
the attribute getter and setter functions getwidth and getheight are the interface

17412727
getter	setter
having setter and getter sometimes feels like a typing exercise when writing the rudiments of a class but it usually pays off when the class and its interface gets more complex

17412727
getter	setter
for very simple classes the separation seems pointless and one sometimes omits the getter and setter and grants direct access

17412727
getter	setter
but as soon as the object becomes more complex getter and setter are a good idea

17412727
getter	setter
one major application for getter is to implement a read-only interface to some aspects in this case there is just a getter method no setter and the data elements are made private

17412736
getter	setter
moreover the use of getter and setter makes your code easier to maintain and update in the future

17412743
getter	setter
if you force the class user to access the class attribute via setter and getter methods you will later be able to change the way those attributes are implemented without changing the interface

17412768
portrait	landscape
the idea is that if you re in portrait mode and the media orientation changes to landscape it won t start using the landscape query unless the width also increases

17412928
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

and methods to access the ivars are also automagically created getter and setter

17413646
getter	setter
in your other viewcontroller you need a reference to the instance of scontroller you previously created and want to talk to it is important you understand this then you could access the instance variable through the generated getter setter methods like so

carrierwave	paperclip
gems like paperclip and carrierwave let you do this and this is the most popular way with rails for dealing with uploading images

17413906
rcurl	httr
the get method of httr uses rcurl curlperform internally as does rcurl geturl so the observed behavior is not surprising

17413915

int	chars
as you can see some values are int and others are chars

17415182
int	chars
in c chars is a kind of short int

17415183
int	chars
first off i am not even sure if thats the correct way to declare a chars in an enum but as you can see some values are int and others are chars

mvp	presenter
i have the following simple code of presenter and view mvp

17432787
entities	entitymanager
i say a conversation scoped entitymanager is bad practice because it can easily lead to lazy initialization issues detached entities and memory leaks

17432816
mvp	presenter
mvp does some separation of concern and you can easily test the presenter with mocked views since you re injecting it through an interface

17432822

post	get
the form should use to get the form input so that it allows either a post field or a url parameter like this

17436408
put	get
this implementation provides guaranteed log n time cost for the containskey get put and remove operations

17436409
keyup	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keydown	mousedown
first of all you will need to add some eventlisteners for the keydown keyup and mousedown events

17436409
keydown	keyup
for the keyup and keydown you need to lookup the keycode you want to use

17436417
put	get
this implementation provides guaranteed log n time cost for the containskey get put and remove operations

17436417
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

17436447
post	get
these examples are taken from showing the difference between post and get and you should use post for logins and secure information but if you wanted to change your ios code to work right now it looks like removing the lines of code that start with request would simply connect to the url send the data just as you do when you say it works when you type it in a webpage and it works

17436447
post	get
as well you could receive post and get methods on server side if you use _request

converting hexadecimal to decimal hex chars to int in c++ convert hex buffer to unsigned int ...

17436663
lxml	beautifulsoup
before answering your question directly it s worth saying as a starting point if all you need to do is pull content from static html pages you should probably use a http library like requests or the built-in urllib.request with lxml or beautifulsoup not selenium although selenium will probably be adequate too

17436690
post	get
i have not been able to find a way to mock this for testing get post methods for a requesthandler class

17436732
width	height
it has read-only properties width and height

17436732
width	height
it would be possible to derive from that a type readablesquare which has the same properties but contractually guarantees that width and height will always be equal

17436732
width	height
from readablerectangle one could define concrete type immutablerectangle which takes a height and width in its constructor and guarantees that the height and width properties will always return the same values and mutablerectangle

17436732
width	height
one could also define concrete type mutablerectangle which allows the height and width to be set at any time

17436748
mouseleave	mouseenter
as that avoids the uneccessary loop and hover wrapping of mouseenter mouseleave and gets the classname from the native property

i am trying to detect when the mouseup mouse button released occurs outside of the element that the mousedown event was triggered on

17436760
mouseup	mousedown
i ve tried different selectors for the mouseup -- document window â body â â html â and â â -- from what i am seeing it appears that the mouseup is not firing on release of the mouse button outside of the mousedown element because the alert does not happen

17436782
uitableview	reloaddata
in viewdidload or anywhere that you reloaddata you should determine if there your table is empty or not and update the uitableview s backgroundview property with a uiview containing a uilabel or just set it to nil

17436792
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m trying to trigger mouseenter and mouseleave for a view specifically only the element which contains children

17436811
post	get
as soon as a file get s posted you will get a post_data field as actual post data

17436821
queue	fifo
if i gave you a queue instance then you would know that by iteratively calling remove you would retrieve the elements in fifo order

17436852
put	get	post	get	post	put
the app.all means that the route will match get put and post request

17436874
subtract	add
subtract from this the number of rows up to fixcoverage could be with another match but in the example is 4 and add 1 for what may be the start row for your weighted average formulae

17437009
stdout	stderr
here s how i m getting stdout and stderr

17437013
queue	fifo
the difference is that for a queue you are guaranteed to pull elements out in fifo order

17437084
hex	binary
if you read the docs i linked to above they clearly show that you can pass binary base64 or hex input and output encodings straight to the decipher methods

17437200
x86	64bit
integer return values similar to x86 are returned in rax if 64bit or less

17437214
int	chars
if you are using i to access memory presumably chars in the string in the body of the for-loop and you left that code out of your question in an attempt to provide a minimal example then the crash is easily explained by the fact that s.length - 3 has the value size_max due to modular arithmetic on unsigned int types

17437214
integer	unsigned
subtracting 3 from that would yield negative 1 except size_t is an unsigned integer type

17437214
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

17437214
integer	unsigned
46 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

17437281
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller

17437505
google-chrome	safari
i need google-chrome to autofill similar to how safari does

17437533
integer	unsigned
the reason you re getting the warning negative integer implicitly converted to unsigned type is that 0 is a literal integer value

17437540
for-loop	loops
iterate backwards in a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

17437555
serializable	deserialization
the string that is being serializable looks good but for some reason deserialization is failing on two properties an int and a datetime

17437646
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
because you are setting your onclicklistener for your imageviews within your listview onitemclicklistener

17437666
queue	fifo
the limitations imposed on a queue fifo no random access as compared to an arraylist allow for the data structure to be better optimized have better concurrency and be a more appropriate and cleaner design when called for

17437666
queue	fifo
in regards to design if items are to be accessed in a fifo fashion then using a queue automatically communicates that intention whereas a list does not

17437741
post	get
1 can i use the same url and handle the post get from it

17437771
submit	submission
if someone is using a normal html form or the submit listener that s all good but if someone is doing something fancy like submission the form using the enter key or running a submit function on button click i need to be able to pick up those submission events as well

17437771
submit	submission
it s also possible to submit a form by just sending the serialized form data to the server without submission the html form

17437817
multiplying	multiplication
however this causes unnecessary time overhead because we are multiplying a with b even though we only need the the multiplication of each row in a with the column of b that has the same id that is row 1 of a with column 1 of b row 2 of a with column 2 of b and so on the multiplication that form the diagonal of c

width	height
the point is that whenever the window is resized the images should take up up the maximum amount of height displaying as many li s as the width will allow

17438177
onresume	onpause
the reason why is happening is because you are not unbinding the service in scenarios where ondestroy is not being called like pressing home notice that pressing home only calls onpause and onstop hence in order to fix this issue you need to do what you are doing in ondestroy unbind service during onpause and bind again onresume so when user press home the unbinding method is properly called and when the activity is reopened the onresume will try to bind the service again.

17438197
children	parent
if you want to use local variables then they have to be scoped within begin...end block however if you have nested begin and end blocks within some begin and end block then the variables declared in the so called parent begin and end block are accessible from the so called children begin and end blocks

17438235
post	put
we also manage when to use post or put directly from the client code and not relying on backbone to do it automatically

getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
answer a is not reasonable because accessor mutators getter setter is never the aim for proxy

17438450
getter	setter
in such case we make a so-called holder which provide you getter and setter to let the foo method able change the reference of bar which is visible to caller

17438450
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
neither answer best describe such use but a is a bit closer because getter setter aka accessor mutators is what a holder normally provides

lxml	beautifulsoup
interestingly beautifulsoup lxml changes the tags around noticeably from content encoded to simply encoded

17438479
portrait	landscape
one benefit of this solution compared to hard-coding a width of 500 is that if your app supports portrait landscape rotation the code above will correctly adjust the field width as the screen width changes

debian	linux
i am working with raw sockets on linux debian and i have a problem when i use write instead of sendto

17446177
imperative	declarative
note that sparql is a declarative language not an imperative one so there s no concept of iterating over things

17446368
post	get
i have use the following one which you can use both get and post

17446401
mocha	sinon
this is perfect since i already use sinon for mocking purposes and i guess it makes sense that mocha itself doesn t support this as it s more in the domain of a mocking library

17446401
mocha	sinon
here s an example employing mocha chai sinon

17446438
google-chrome	firefox
but seeing as my app loaded ok and i could see everything on screen in google-chrome and in firefox i just ignored it

this is why i choosed a different approach which works well for ie firefox and google-chrome

17446653
versioning	upgrade
index versioning has changed and connet be upgrade

17446653

the upgradenotallowedbyconfigurationexception states that index versioning managed by var lib neo4j data graph.db index lucene-store.db has changed and cannot be upgrade unless allow_store_upgrade true is supplied in the configuration

17446657
stdout	stderr
so it is still similar to print statement but with a more elegant way to see the result without polluting stdout and stderr

17446713
junit	testng
note like all java mongodb tests this uses testng not junit but it s pretty similar in this case

17446777
onkeyup	onkeydown
i using the event like onkeyup and onkeydown function

17446783

i have about 500k of these folder and directory please guide me and let me know if what i am currently doing is efficient

17446837
concave	convex
i m assuming you want the concave hull and not the convex hull

17446942
int	double
but this second option is not too accurate mainly when dealing with equivalent types like double int

17447001
int	double
given an array of strings some columns can possibly be double or int in string format i would like to convert this array to an int array

17447001
int	double
then to create my new array which should be of type int or double i could loop through the whole array and define the new array via the dictionary

17447003
google-chrome	firefox
use firefox s or google-chrome s developer tools

17447006
width	height
i ve tested this on two seperate computers and it would appear that the actual size limit to a bitmap in firemonkey is 8000x8000 px meaning both width and height respectively cap at 8000 px size

17447035
getter	setter
also if you provide both setter and getter method you have to synthesize the

17447084
dictionary	map
dictionary is good if you want to map each string to a key like this

17447162
versioning	upgrade
basically nothing will break when i upgrade a system to a newer versioning even if it is just one part of a larger system or uses resources created by the older system

17447332
post	put
i just put here some code to show what i did ask if you need me to post anymore

17447436
put	get
also put the string literal first in case that make is null so you don t get a nullpointerexception

17447513
implements	extends
i can further click on an interface and get information on which classes implements it in the standard classes anyway and which interfaces extends it

17447523
put	get
note you may have to put your breakpoint inside invocationhandler#invoke to get near this through the proxy layers or roll your own

17447538
superclass	subclassing
imagine i have two classes subclassing and superclass and i have the following arraylist

17447538
superclass	subclassing
is it possible to iterate over superclass in such a way as to only select subclassing

17447633
superclass	subclassing
but if you really do have reasons for not using it you could always give the superclass some variable and change that to false in the subclassing if you wanted

17447634
superclass	subclassing
the first approach for subclassing subclassing superclass cannot work as the compiler cannot ensure that there are only objects of tyoe subclassing in there

17447653
128bit	64bit	integer	unsigned	integer	fractions
a labview timestamp is a 128bit type consisting of a signed 64bit integer measuring the offset in seconds since the labview epoch january 1 1904 00 00 00.00 utc and an unsigned 64bit integer measuring the fractions second

17447791
hide	show
as attached in screenshot when i click on edit button then i want to hide edit button and show save button

17447893
put	get	post	get	post	put
it seems to behave the same no matter whether i put the calculation in the get handler or post handler

17447894
win64	windows
you could also use test code that does not explicitly rely on _crtmem windows apis boost test library has a runtime parameter to detect memory leaks so you don t have to actually implement it yourself but i don t know what it is doing under the hood in win64

17447898
identifier	ambiguous
but the myninja identifier would be ambiguous outside the function itself

google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine for firefox ie9 and google-chrome

17448319
width	height
your s have no width and height the moment you will declare those in some way everything is going to be ok

17448319
width	height
i suggest to give property of width and height to element instead of

17448326
min	max
you haven t declared a height add in a height 80 you have just said what the max can be and the min can be - it doesn t intrinsically know what it should be in between

just fix the sign and exponent bits and use a uniform random prng for integers to fill the mantissa bits

17448607
abstract-class	superclass
now what i have done so far is to create a superclass abstract-class

17448607
getter	setter
now to my question some of these objects will be relativly small for example i have an object that only consists of three fields with getter and setter

17448620
for-loop	loops
note that your attempt at chunking doesn t work because the for-loop in the foreach loops is repeatedly assigning a matrix to the same variable

17448620
for-loop	loops
then the for-loop itself returns a null as the body of the foreach loops so that sub_task is a list of null s

17448625

17448690
post	get
the problem is that you use a get instead of a post request

17448705

you may wish to capture stderr output as well as stdout output by adding to the command line

width	height
you are already using width and height 100 on the canvas so it and everything in it will be scaled with the page and unfortunately also give less quality and performance

17450191

the best way to scale as canvas do not take -values itself is to calculate the actual width and height in pixels and remove any css scaling

17450678
nvcc	pgi
the other reason why we want to mix pgi s pgfortran compiler with gnu s g++ is that we need to use the pgfortran to compile the cuda-fortran part of our code and we also need to use nvcc from nvidia which use g++ to compile the host code to compile that omp segments which have cuda in them and which can not be compiled correctly by pgfortran

don t know anything about the c# interop you re tryign to do but i can tell you that the issue you have with cannot instantiate abstract class is because you are extends manageddll icalculatorevents and it s presumably an abstract base class meaning that you need to implements the pure virtual functions that are in that class

if that s what you want then what you should do instead is set width and height to 100 instead

17451186
post	get
however a colleague pointed out that this results in a context no longer correctly in sync with the data it represents and thus is a terrible idea -- even though it s okay for my case because i m immediately stopping the program if you were to continue the request as suggested by the original post you would run the risk of attempting to use a corrupted context and you could get unintended side effects

17451351

subdirectories in the root app_code folder indicating the virtual directory they belong too must be used

17453437
folder	directory
you would have to modify the defaulttemplate.xaml by default it already downloads the source to the build agent working directory you just need to add a copy folder activity that copies it to the target file share

barring hidden uses of standard library types it is perfectly safe to mix libc++ and libstdc++ in a single program where some tus or libraries or modules use libc++ and some use libstdc++

17454642
libstdc++	libc++
if an interface uses libc++ std string directly a library expecting libstdc++ std string will not link to the interface because the actual symbols are different std string vs

17454642
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ also ensures that low level features like exceptions and dynamic memory allocation are abi compatible assuming you build libstdc++ and libc++ using the same abi library so it s safe to deallocate memory in a tu that uses say libc++ when the memory was allocated in a tu using libstdc++ or to throw an exception from code build on libc++ and catch it in code using libstdc++

17454642

according to dev.w3.org csswg css3-box #the-margin-properties it states note that in a horizontal flow percentages on â margin-topâ and â margin-bottomâ are relative to the width of the containing block not the height and in vertical flow â margin-leftâ and â margin-rightâ are relative to the height not the width . so it goes both ways. â adam sweeney

inherited	base-class	inherited	subclassing	base-class	subclassing
the first reason is versioning - if a new constructor is introduced in a base-class or if a constructor signature is changed in a base-class subclassing will inherited those changes which can lead to unpredictable side effects

17472936
implements	extends
this problem often surfaces in frameworks of various types where often a part of the framework s api consists of classes that you re expected to extends or abstract classes for you to implements - if the constructor signatures change in a framework class you would inherit those changes which most of the time isn t going to make sense

17472936
inherited	base-class
these two arguments are actually two sides of the same coin arguably constructor inherited is fragile because constructors define the needs of a class - for example it s not reasonable to expect the author of a base-class to be able to predict all the needs of your extended class

17472936
inherited	base-class
if constructors can t be inherited that forces the author of any class to be explicit about all the ways in which an instance of a class is expected to be constructed - even if some of these constructors are going to be totally trivial the fact that they are defined in the class itself demonstrates that the author of that class did consider them useful and had to understand and consider all the needs of the base-class which may have been written by a different author

apache	nginx
the python application is then run within the web server using something like mod_wsgi or fcgi for apache or uwsgi for nginx

get a quote general enquiry post a feedback - unless you have better idea of doing this

17478306

also i noticed the namespaces display in google-chrome but not in firefox

17478770
multiplying	multiplication
to get an idea of if-statement vs selective-multiplication i tried the code below and saw that multiplying the result by 0 instead of failed-if-statement false and multiplying by 1 instead of passed-if-statement true if-statement is slower and just computing always is faster if there are only 3-4 double precision multiplication

17478792
clang	llvm
c++11 has permeated into the glue code because auto is just too cool but the consequence was that i basically had to go and build llvm clang and libc++ on linux in order to start using my tool on linux

17478792
clang	llvm
it is hard to see how given that llvm clearly is very capable at cross-compiling to arm one might be prevented from the use of clang to get the job done using more direct methods such as cross-compiling to the target paltform

17478880
interpolation	splines
higher order estimates to do this you typically need to create a full connectivity mapping of the grid points so you can do splines interpolation and get a smooth interpolation that will typically be more accurate at points between the grid points assuming that the function being described by the samples is in fact a smooth function

17478923
width	height
another easier but less pretty way to solve this is to add a uiview to the scrollview and pin its width and or height

google-chrome	firefox
use some developer tools in your browser developer tools in google-chrome firebug extension for firefox or any other such tool in any other browser and try to check http response you are getting for your ajax - check if http headers are correctly set utf8 encoding etc. and maybe if ypur special characters are displayed correctly there - so you can see if you are getting correct answer from the server

17479631
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as for the second view controller s animations i don t think there is any other good way than doing it in viewwillappear although i would prefer viewdidappear since the outlets of the destination view controller are not set while performing the segue they will be nil

if you re using mamp to wamp and lamp i think that it should to be kinda similar try open the file mamp library bin envvar and the four lines of if and else that should looks like this

17479947
std	ostream
std ostream has an overload of that takes a pointer to a function or something similar that can be invoked anyway that accepts the pointer and invokes the function passing itself as a parameter to the function

17479947
std	ostream
the version that s built in to ostream comes from std ios_base and that s the type it uses for the parameter and return but if you re trying to write your own you typically want to use std ostream instead

often i can export my image properly even though it s beyond the stage area by choosing minimum image area on my export settings however if i ve noticed that if at any point the width or height of my project reaches beyond 4000 pixels including any masked or hidden artifacts my export will glitch on me incredibly

17480106

i need to push the search bar over to the right just like how it should look in ie google-chrome firefox opera

17480310
google-chrome	firefox
my recommendation is to use either google-chrome of firefox for your primary development and then just test in ie as needed since their developer tools are more advanced than those in ie

17480361
maven	pom.xml
other popular option if you don t want to use .project is to use maven and use import existing maven project then navigate to your pom.xml

your website should have a file called .htaccess in the site s root directory the root directory is the folder that contains all the rest of your site s files

it s hard to debug without your spring security configuration but i m guessing when you go to portal form.html spring redirects you to a login page using http post while your login page controller handler is only mapped to http get

17480418
metaclass	subclassing
but additionally the metaclass of a class must be a non-strict subclassing of the metaclass of all its bases

17480418
metaclass	subclassing
in other words the class s metaclass and the metaclass of all its bases must either be the same or all those metaclass must be subclassing of each other

metaclass	subclassing
so the above solution may not work if a class tries to use a metaclass which is not a subclassing of met

this happens in firefox google-chrome and opera running on a windows 7 machine

17492792
freebsd	solaris
the only problem you d run into is that the -t option for mv is non-posix and so certain posix oses may not support it freebsd solaris etc

17492797
hide	show
instead of show hide which toggles the display property you could use the visibility property

17492806
sorting	filtering
for reference i m using this script for the table filtering sorting

17492831
sorting	grouping
then i think that it is a matter of sorting the grouping rows manually by setting their indexes giving a row s count

17492889
post	get
partial get post requests work very well for more time than they should now it seems very difficult to overcome this problem apache is well aware of this situation

17492910
put	get
but this algorithm is not 100 accurate and that is why even if you put your device on flat surface like table you get some non-zero value

17492925
google-chrome	firefox
it varies a bit between firefox and google-chrome

17492953
keystore	jks
on a jks or bks keystore the password is not pointless but it doesn t do what you might assume either

17492956
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
if i have a div with an explicit background color set and an input element inside it with background-color set to inherit then it works as expected on google-chrome firefox and safari but doesn t work on ie 8 9 or 10

17493009
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome on android or in safari on ios it works like this way but on android browser url is still mydomain after the click

17493066
google-chrome	firefox
as mentioned i already found a solution for firefox but it was not working on google-chrome

17493066
google-chrome	firefox
after some fiddling i also had a solution for google-chrome which wasn t working on firefox

17493066
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested it on firefox google-chrome ie opera and maxton and it worked

17493071
mspec	fakeiteasy
my tools of choice are mspec and fakeiteasy but suggestions in any frameworks would be gratefully received

17493076
ienumerable	icollection
if the ienumerable can be cast to icollection then the count can be determined quickly without iterating

17493123
put	get
when you get the value on or off just open the sharedpreferences and put those values in it

17493145
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in latest firefox and google-chrome same differences everywhere

17493186
width	height
assuming your bytes string contains color data for each pixel of an image in a one of the supported pixel formats you can create a bitmap with a specific size using this constructor bitmap int width int height

17493197
prepare	execute
added foreach so that the statement is prepare once then execute looped for each row to insert

17493207
width	height
but what i d to do is to prevent user from making the frame size larger than specific width and height

17493230
implements	modifiers
tried different approaches with lazy modifiers but fails to implements it

17493274
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
to elaborate slightly on my comment above it looks to me like you re trying to use ocamllex to do what ocamlyacc is for

17493274
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
i think you need to define very simple tokens in ocamllex like booleans numbers and variable names then use ocamlyacc to define how they go together to make things like iszero diff and if

17493275
post	get
the issue shows up when trying to get and post to the nested resource

17493357
getter	setter
i have an object that has private properties accessible via getter and setter and specified in the _sleep magic function

17493357
children	parent
i want to json_encode the parent object and all of the children arrays of objects etc etc

17493357
children	parent
i see here that the parent object s insertions parameter which is an array of three insertion objects is not itself one parameter with three insertion children but rather three insertions parameters

17493377
getter	setter
this includes all tableview methods including straight getter and setter

17493380
put	get
get in your action listener method then put

17493399

17493439
post	get
do get code to only appear on post permalinks you need to include a combination of blocks

17493450
inherited	properties
for some reason inherited with the background color properties in ie10 seems to be implemented differently than other browsers

17493450
background-color	transparency
setting background-color transparency on an input field seems to disable the input field in ie8

17493456
keystore	jks
the bouncy castle specifications section 5.4 states that when operating in the same fashion as jks the keystore is resistent to tampering but not inspection. - which strongly suggests this is true for jks

17493456
keystore	jks
most concrete but least official is the reverse-engineered implementation of jks which also backs up the claim that the keystore is not encrypted with the keystore password

17493476
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-image	background-color	background-image	background-position
you can either define background-color background-image background-repeat and background-position separately or use the shortcut background

17493508
ssl	https
i am getting ssl handshake failure when i try to invoke https service call within weblogic

17493536

either don t use an int field type rather use a textual type or remove the and non-numeric chars from the data you are inserting

17493555
folder	directory
note because the vstemplate will create physical directory for each of the logical solution folder and place the different projects physically within those directory on disk that way is not an option hence why i m using the iwizard

affinity	processors
i have a pool of worker threads on each numa node with processors affinity set and a balancer that spreads work evenly among the pools nodes

17493580
box-sizing	border-box
jsbin is going with box-sizing border-box

17493629
quicksort	heapsort
anyone in computer science will know that heapsort is o n log n worst case in theory while quicksort is o n 2 worst case

17493629
quicksort	heapsort
however in practice a well implemented quicksort with good heuristics will outperform heapsort on every single data set

17493629
quicksort	heapsort
and while quicksort can handle presorted data with a good heuristic in o n heapsort will always reorganize the data in o n log n as it doesn t exploit the existing structure

17493632
width	height
the bitmap drawn represent some sort of glass which is rectangle with width equal to the width of listview and some height

17493705
width	height
obviously once you have detected the paper you will need to take the four corners that it detects create width and height and plumb that into your cropping function

17493710
slideup	slidedown
basically i am using slideup and slidedown to show different options based on what the user selects

17493720

the drawn circle which as the same radius as the bitmap s width and height is slightly larger than the bitmap

17493800
innodb	myisam
basically if you want a database that supports acid innodb supports all aspects of that and myisam supports none

17493829
put	get
however thanks to the new line character at the end of my statement used to retain the original line breaks of my array my variable contains an extra blank line at the end that also get s put into the database

17493843
ubuntu	linux
system i have access to are windows 8 linux ubuntu android ics

17493904
width	height
making the element height 100 will do just as its suppose to do but any other padding will just add to the size of the height or width depending on how you pad it

17493904
subtract	add	height	border-box	width	border-box	width	height	box-sizing	border-box
but if you make the box-sizing border-box this will force the browser not to add to the height or width but instead take or subtract 100 -50px from the height or width

17493911
pop-up	dialog
i have written a jquery-ui dialog to pop-up as a confirmation on particular links

17493930
box-sizing	border-box
use box-sizing border-box

17493989
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the code to fire showauthenticationdialog needs to be in viewdidappear rather than viewdidload

17494065
implements	extends
this should work fine for your intent object since it implements parcelable but it may not work for say handler because it only extends object

17494085
strlen	substr
the php code is supposed to echo only one character of the name using strlen rand and substr yet that only happens sometimes

17494102
mousemove	mousedown
so when i get a mousedown in grow i do a on mousemove on the grow rect have also tried layer and stage

i am overloading the addition and subtraction operator for a matrix class i m writing

17494222
int	chars
if the value p being boxed is true false a byte or a chars in the range u0000 to u007f or an int or short number between -128 and 127 inclusive then let r1 and r2 be the results of any two boxing conversions of p

17494264
children	parent
i had a question about how css selectors work between parent and children and which one would take precedence over the other

17494280
getter	setter
don t forget to control the nullvalue and the getter and setter

17494332
min	max
if you want to sample every 2 seconds and show max min ave for the whole period that cmd.exe is running then the code below will work

17494332
min	max
but if you want to sample the data every two seconds and show the max min ave for that 2 second interval then all 3 will be the same because you only have 1 sample during that interval

17494339
width	height
basically have a fixed height width on the .icon-stack

17494339
margin	height
the negative top margin has to be equal to the child elements height

17494389

cairngorm	flex
if anyone has used cairngorm within flex actionscript 3 its model locator is a singleton

17494445
translation	localization
the translation will always be from english to a foreign language and so the app itself does not require localization of buttons headlines text etc

17494445
translation	localization
now i m not sure if i should store the strings in core data or use ios localization as the translation seem more like app data than true localization to me

17494477
width	height
can set image width and height like

17494477
width	height
ctx.drawimage image x y width height

17494601
printf	strstr
i m interested in something like strstr function but that i could pass a formatted string as argument like what i pass to printf

17494623
int	chars
if the value p being boxed is true false a byte or a chars in the range u0000 to u007f or an int or short number between -128 and 127 inclusive then let r1 and r2 be the results of any two boxing conversions of p

17494623
int	chars
less memory-limited implementations might for example cache all chars and short values as well as int and long values in the range of -32k to +32k

17494625
puts	gets
so if gets significantly dominate puts which happen really only at the point of creating a new user i don t see any issues

iâ ve been reading on inputstream fileinputstream bytearrayinputstream and how their use seems quite clear output streams too

17494639
onresume	onpause
the recommendation is to save your data in onpause and rebuild it on onresume with some flags so flags can tell you if onresume called after onpause onstopped or activity is freshly created

17494646
min	max
the reason that the measure-object command is giving you the same value for max min and average is because you are only passing it one single sample the max min and average of one sample is always the same

17494646
min	max
i would store that information in an array and then when i pass the array to my measure-object cmdlt it will give me the correct max min average

17494646
min	max
then we use the measure-object to take the array and calculate min max and avg values

17494646
min	max
you can t easily get min and max cpu from that but using the starttime property you can get an average value

17494649
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
add a uinavigationbar to a uitableviewcontroller without a uinavigationcontroller

maven	pom.xml
now to set up jetty the second pom.xml at this link describes how to start and stop jetty on the maven pre-integration-test and post-integration-test phases

17495176
width	height
you cannot manually change the size of a cell it is resized by the tableview to the cell size tableview width and row height when it layouts its subviews

17495216
min	max
i think my problem lies in the fact the avaudioplayer outputs a max of 0.0db and a min of -160db and i need to process this input so that it outputs a float 0.0 to 1.0 suitable for the alpha channel

17495222
versioning	upgrade
however my server upgrade their php versioning and phpmailer 2 stoped working

17495237
hex	binary
looks like you can query binary columns with the hex function and it will give you a hex representation of the bytes which won t funk up your output

17495248
post	get
i am using the jquery post method but when i get the data returned i cannot create the labels based on the fields in the json

17495558
nunit	mstest
despite being integration testing such tests are usually launched from your unit testing tool nunit mstest etc.

17495558
nunit	mstest
the unit test tool such as mstest or nunit should not require a consolidated web.config that represents all the services that will be hosted during the test

17495558
cassini	iis
the wcf service hosting could be either in-memory with the unit test tool or out-of-process through such hosts as cassini iis express etc

17495565
folder	dir	folder	directory
so here s ultimately what i ve done it turns out that karma can handle watch serve files that are not within the base directory and it makes them look to the browser in the form of absolute c dir folder blah file.js

17495570
hide	show
the blinking uses opacity rather than show hide fade or toggle so that the div remains clickable in case that s ever an issue allows you to make buttons with blinking text

min	max
i don t think there s a simple statistical test beyond what you have worked out - standard deviation or even min max which is about the same

17495858
hide	show
then you can show hide the data loaded in your application depending on the access level of the signed-in user

17495894
keydown	keyup

but i wanted it a bit smaller so i added height 140px and width 500px to my css this is proportional to the original size of my logo

17496000
textview	imageview
now declare the variables for textview contents declare the imageview bind em together.

puts	gets
also your current code just gets the last value and puts it in the string

17496222
folder	directory
in this directory i have a symlink relative to a parent folder like this

17496266
put	get	post	get	post	put
the nsurlrequest s httpmethod parameter provides the method get post put etc. as an nsstring

17496298

please check the xpages log files in the ibm_technical_support folder in the data directory

17496330
subtraction	addition
the system therefore allows addition of negative operands without a subtraction circuit and a circuit that detects the sign of a number

17496330
subtraction	addition
moreover that addition circuit can also perform subtraction by taking the two s complement of a number see below which only requires an additional cycle or its own adder circuit

17496350
treeviewitem	menuitem
treeviewitem or menuitem

17496368
getter	setter
right now your getter is getting itself and the setter sets the property itself both of which will cause a stackoverflowexception

17496423
width	text-align
you do not need the overflow text-align or width properties

17496479
pop-up	dialog
obviously this means the current page is going to be replaced - and that includes the pop-up dialog which is part of the page

17496479
submit	submission
if you want the dialog to show immediately be visible while the form is submission and remain visible afterwards then you re going to have to manually submit the form data via an ajax call of some sort

17496512
public	protected
a method is overridable if it doesn t contain the final keyword and if it s public or protected

17496512
public	protected
if the two classes are in the same package you can also override the method if the method is package protected it doesn t have public private protected on it

17496514
octal	decimal
i would suggest you look at octal decimal and hexadecimal numbering systems once you understand how to figure out convert any of them to decimal you will know this one too

17496577
single-quotes	double-quotes
note that that is not valid json you have to use double-quotes not single-quotes

17496604

formview	checkboxlist
binding checkboxlist in formview

17496653
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
i m prosessing my updates as nsinvocationoperation by adding to nsoperationqueue

17496748
width	height
ok yeah so it s the issue of how scrollviewer passes infinity width and height to children in its control

17496748
width	height
oh wait it should have width and height set even if the actual width and height have not been set

17496755
hide	show
on the main app i m trying to bind input and select fields to show hide depending on whether or not a checkbox is selected

17496765
getter	setter
to detect that you ll need to use something like getter setter and track a private mutation flag

17496778
post	put
so if you need to have something happen on the page load you ll need to put that call the one you mentioned in your post into the on load function as well

17496808
post	get
update actually this only seems to work if req is from a post not a get

17496840
getter	setter
on the other hand if what you need to know is whether or not a property has ever been set regardless of it s value you ll have to use private properties and getter setter functions

17496842
button	checkbox
i have two checkbox that i want to make to behave like they are radio button only one of them is checked at time

17496847
actualheight	actualwidth
if so then you can definitely bind to the scrollviewer s actualheight and actualwidth properties to manage the minimum scale

17496848
ant	maven
i wouldn t be able to download it and figure out how to get my tools ide maven ant etc to run it

17496897
accessor	properties
unfortunately the class in .net does not allow you to change the next and previous properties directly since they don t have a set accessor

17496909
children	parent
with nested documents you can only get back the whole structure parent + all children and you can only update the whole structure

17496909
children	parent
on the other hand this way you can search on the parent and get back the children or search on the children and get back the parent

17496909
children	parent
also children are separate documents and you can index query them independently regardless of the fact that they have a parent

17496916
inherited	properties
and when you use newinstance .myvalue it automatically retrieves the direct properties if it exists or the inherited prototype properties otherwise

17496979
x86	64bit
reason being is that intptr works on both x86 and x64 whereas an int is too small for storing a 64bit pointer which is a long so you ll run into problems when you switch platforms

17497068
accessor	properties
your properties declaration is adding the getter and accessor

17497092
for-loop	loops
when i simulate this model i am able to see value 3 at every loops 10 ms loops inside the for-loop

17497128
post	get
once i get it all up and running i d be glad to post the full complete code for anyone else here who would like to use it for their own purposes

normally a website with an rss feed available will make a declaration to the feed within the page s html code here is an example of what you would normally see

rss	feed
therefore i would suggest looking for a html link tag with the type set to application rss+xml obviously the herf will then provide you with the url for the rss feed

17506579
inherited	subclassing
if part of the implementation of run is common to both sub1 and sub2 i suggest you simply use inherited and override run in the subclassing

17506579
super	abstract	super	implements
the trick here is that the super class can be defined abstract while implements methods

17506587
superclass	subclassing
as far as i know it s not possible to cast an object of a superclass into an object of a subclassing

17506599

margin	height
one way would be to make the handler a consistent height and set the bottom margin

17506759
int	chars
i attempted to use an unordered_map to hash a chars key to an int value

17506771
int	chars	factors	matrix
but one important difference is if your data contains a factors or chars column as.matrix will coerce everything into a chars matrix while data.matrix will always return a numeric or int matrix

17506774
post	put
post put delete etc use pre-flighted cors

17506778

i have a folder in my app directory named uploads where users can upload files and download files

17506841
folder	directory
i don t want the uploads folder to be in the public directory because i want to control download authorization

i was thinking of maybe limiting the files which can be included to the current folder so that the user cannot access files in the main directory

17507155
hide	show
i m actually having the same problem like as in how to prevent jquery .toggle to show hide all within .on #39

width	height
my question is very wierd after searching and reading the code 40 times i can t explain why the jpanel and jframe gets additional 10 pixels to their width and height

17507488
width	height
use frame.setundecorated true then you will understand why there are 10pxls increased in the height and width

17507500
subtract	add
you can t just add or subtract a fixed number because the target time zone may use a different offset depending on exactly what date you re talking about

17507507
pull	push
the first commit is the one which is formed when i was trying to push code and it asked me to pull code first and then push

17507727
cos	sin
i can t rotate sin x or cos x even though i would love to

17507732
post	get
last time i checked facebook apps post data to the server url so you should ensure that your routes are not just get routes

if the header is fixed like you say put the margin top on the content div to the height of the header

17507789
hide	show
further i don t want to hide or show the entire annotation based on selecting or deselecting

17507799
wav	ogg
i found a similar question at encode audio from getusermedia to a .ogg in javascript -- this links to a project that looks like it might eventually be able to convert from wav to ogg in javascript which would be great but as far as i can tell does not do so at the moment

17507799
wav	ogg
edit my app engine code is written in python so another possibility would be to do the conversion there with a python module that can convert wav to ogg

17507800
post	get
the error i get when using csrf_protect on the post method is

17507870
mouseover	mouseout
on mouseover it displays market.png with the transparent background part being tile_4.jpg and out mouseout it is tile_4.jpg

17507871

17507876
punctuation	words
if it has a punctuation mixed in the words i want to replace them with spaces

17507885

bionic libc docs sysv-ipc.txt for details

17507889

you could use the mouseover and mouseout events

17507950
putty	winscp
so in order to do that i downloaded winscp and used that to transfer the css file of the website to my laptop make a change to the css code and then transfered the new code into putty account

17507961
mouseover	mouseout
you could also use mouseover and mouseout events as well

17508035
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox everything works properly but when you scroll and then click on a nav link simply using an id to move down the page but on google-chrome the navigation disappears until you scroll some more

17508036
getter	setter
the getter setter methods are given below

17508036
getter	setter
i guess i am missing a point although i checked some tutorials about getter setter methods

17508058
getter	setter
you should remove the setter since the getter relies on peripheral information and isn t a standalone value

17508070
hash	md5
i was wondering what s the largest string i can hash with sha2 or perhaps with md5 without breaking it into pieces

17508110
disk	ram
yes you can do it but beware nib files are stored on disk instead of in ram so it is 10 000 times slower than not using a nib

17508190
drawrect	layoutsubviews
i found that layoutsubviews called not last i checked init method layoutsubview willdisplaycell table view delegate method drawrect and prepareforsegue

17508190
drawrect	layoutsubviews
my solution was to call layoutsubviews in drawrect and this helped for the first time table view appear

17508191
cos	sin
there are an infinite number of directions and the values for cos b and sin b are undefined

17508249

for-loop	arrays
if i try to add randomint to an arrays after the for-loop has been processed i get an error type mismatch can t convert int to int which makes sense

17508453
subtract	add
you can add or subtract any multiple of the modulus from the result since

17508480
jobs	cron
so try setting up cron jobs properly

17508484
portrait	landscape
this has nothing to do with portrait or landscape

17508505
express	node.js
i m using node.js express and i have other files that i wish to be part of my server so i m using

17508514
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
i capture touches in each subview with touchesbegan touchesended and touchesmoved

17508517
subtraction	add
if you re ending up with a negative number perhaps after doing a subtraction you re essentially supposed to add n to the result until it s non-negative

17508523
folder	directory
as it turns out web2py has problems with folder names with hyphens in the application directory

17508546
button	checkbox
what is happening in my case is after the user checks the checkbox and the radio button are enabled if the user selects radio2 and submits the form the selection automatically goes back to radio1

17508558
int	boolean	int	chars
like an int 5 a string hello world a chars a a boolean true or false or a float 3.1415

17508588
mp4	h.264
i embedded my own mp4 h.264 file onto html5 file using video tag

the browsers which i tried are firefox and google-chrome

17508596
websphere	ibm
we use ibm websphere appserver 7v

17508629
hash	md5
using jmeter i would like to take values from csv file concatenate the values and do a md5 hash on them and then send the value as part of http request using http request sampler

17508632
int	chars
java s tostring for an array is to print followed by a chars representing the type of the array s elements in your case i for int followed by then the identity hash code of the array think of it like you would a memory address

17508666
centos	linux
so i m uploading a file to my vps linux centos 5 64 bit via ftp using java

17508673
getter	setter
you need a getter and a setter for an editable control

17508687
g++	gcc
in case you really want to code in c++ you should add some extern c and remove the c headers involved if you prefer c i suggest to remove that and use gcc instead of g++

17508721
innodb	myisam
switching the engine to myisam fixes the problem but i will need to add triggers for this table in the future so i want to stick with innodb

17508727
switching	screens
switching from 3.5 to 4 screens is only made for you to take a look what changes with your layout how is it resizing

17508727
portrait	landscape
same goes for portrait and landscape orientations in each viewcontroller

17508746
children	parent
there are multiple business capabilities and they can have business capabilities as parent and others as children

17508836
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you have to write things twice because google-chrome needs -webkit- when firefox or opera don t

17508836
opera	firefox
i prefer to use only -webkit- once and i keep the text-decoration since opera and firefox know about it

17508848
getter	setter
using setter and getter can come handy

17508848
getter	setter
here we inherit the thread class to our custom class that will have setter and getter and argumented constructor

17508850
int	chars
you might use a chars value of some sort though you won t be wasting space in the structure even if you use an int it will have a size of 8 bytes on 32-bit machines and probably 16 bytes on 64-bit machines

17508880
post	get
so i thought that the servlet i made could handle requests through get and post at the same time concurrently when my webpage is communicating with the server

17508880
post	get
what s happening is i have a post request getting called through a jquery ajax request and on success of the request it calls a callback javascript method that has a jquery ajax get request

17508881
persistent	transient
i know transient field value does not get persistent in the database

17508894
ubuntu	centos
i use centos 6.4 php5.3 and apache 2.2 on vmware virtual machine and phpstorm with firefox on real ubuntu

17508917
versioning	upgrade
versioning 1.2 2013-01-04 upgrade for ios 6.0 now using automatic

17508919
photoshop	paint.net
there are many good looking button tutorials for gimp photoshop paint.net or other programs that you can find through google

17508929
fseek	ftell
using php s ftell and fseek was avoided

17508966
keydown	keyup
we know that a keyboard basically can trigger two types of events keydown on press before release and keyup on release

17508966
keydown	keyup
a key is pressed when a keydown event and a keyup event occur consecutively

17508972
adk	adb
i m also assuming you got your logs via adb over wi-fi and not connecting it over usb as that cable should go into the adk board

17508993
sorting	filtering
note this won t be sorting sorting by age it should be exactly a filtering having values less or equal to 18 and older than 18 -- a drop down list or radio buttons

17509037
width	height
i ve put the quotation marks inside their own divs and have set their height width accordingly but i can t seem to dynamically determine the height of the div that the actual quote text is in

17509058
put	get
i will eventually change this to read and write from my online mysql database because i will have each one of my actors use this app but i want to get this local copy working so i can put each talent s information in there

17509074
super	self
it is said that if you don t invoke the super constructor by your self the compiler will insert a no-arg call to super for you as the very first statement in the constructor.

17509100
google-chrome	firefox
when you re trying to style an element and it isn t taking right click that element and click inspect element assuming firefox or google-chrome which will help you figure out answers to these kind of questions yourself

17509127
rss	feed
i ve got this an rss xml feed which has mp3 s wrapped like this

17509159
unsigned	short
the weird thing is when i changed boost uint16_t to unsigned short boost uint32_t to unsigned int in source header files of constant class it goes no problem

17509159
unsigned	short
i guess the error is result from some mistakes of type redefintion like boost uint16_t in the header file means a type but another type in source file for example boost uint16_t could means unsigned short in header files but unsigned int in source files maybe

17509159
put	get
but i don t get why it happens here as i already put namespace before type

17509166
implements	extends
so the dependency is more likely to be from some jar that implements or extends log4j rather than from client code.

17509199
getter	setter
further a computed property is a function that acts as both a getter and a setter depending on the number of arguments passed in

17509234
post	get
first i created a servlet that serves both get and post

17509234
post	get
i then tried invoking both get and post within 5 seconds window and this is what it looks like

17509234
post	get
both get and post requests are served by different threads and invocation of get and post method are not synchronized

17509246
width	height
the width did successfully but the height won t

17509297
post	get
if you are trying to make it look nicer in the address bar i would suggest using post rather than get forms - the data is sent in it s entirety but not shown in the address bar and not subject to url length limitations

17509301
udp	tcp
i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching

17509301
udp	tcp
to be honest i prefer to use tcp but if udp works better then i have to use udp

17509325
opencv	emgucv
use emgucv which is a .net port of the popular opencv library for image processing

17509372
google-chrome	firefox
or if i try the following it doesn t work in firefox but it does in google-chrome

17509425
width	height
your parent div of the table has a width and height of 100 which is going to be whatever the parent element is

17509425
width	margin
you can instead use margin to set the top and right but you then cannot use the 100 width that will not work

17509430
children	parent
if both tables are empty it creates the parent and children correctly by assigning parent_id

17509499
google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly fine on google-chrome and safari and mostly on ie 10

17509499
put	get
if so can i use jquery to get the mouse positions and put it back into javascript

17509590
macports	homebrew
in case macports does not work for you try homebrew

17509615
getter	setter
another benefit to using private properties and accessing them through getter and setter is that you can use those functions to manipulate the values before they actually get set

17509658
post	get
post honeycomb you will get networkonmainthreadexception

17509693
try-catch	exception-handling
use try-catch or try-catch-finally for questions about the catching side of the exception-handling handling

17509741
google-chrome	firefox
add a parent wrapper to wrap the whole example with a height of 500px or so and it works as expected in at least firefox and google-chrome

17509763
gif	png
i got the resize photo script frm some website and basically it work just fine but the problem is i can only use it to upload jpg photo only if i try to upload other extensions such as png gif i will get the error here is my code

17509786
gif	png
jpg gif png are different image formats with different kind of data stored

17509786
gif	png
start to search in imagemagick s documentation for gif and png

17509798
width	height
width and height on a span won t work because a span is an inline element

17509801
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu

17509801
folder	directory
view hidden files in home directory press ctrl+h on home folder

17509831
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i assume you have a tabbar controller as a root controller so please check if you are not resetting ui state on viewwillappear or viewdidappear

17509846
super	self
or super self within a class definition

17509875
preventdefault	mouseup
to do so i called preventdefault on the touchmove function but the problem is that i also need to get the position of the mouse release once the user calls the mouseup event

17509883
getter	setter
note that using getter setter is the appropriate way of doing this

17509927
floating-point	integer
user variables can be assigned a value from a limited set of data types integer decimal floating-point binary or nonbinary string or null value

17509927
floating-point	integer
storage of the first three of these datatypes for integer decimal and floating-point values require 8 30 and 8 bytes respectively

17509930
post	get
i want to write a program preferably in python which could monitor my gtalk status messages and whenever i post a new gtalk status message this program will get the content of this message and post it somewhere else

17509938
super	self
when you call super self.__class__ self in a method of c it will be like calling super c self which means call the version of this method inherited by c

17509938
super	self
but when you call super self.__class__ self from b it s still like calling super c self because it s the same self so self.__class__ is still c

17509938
super	self
of course what you really want is to be able to call super classthatdefinedtheimplementationthatiscurrentlyexecuting self and that is effectively what the python 3 super does

17509938
super	self
it s not clear to me what you mean about super self being a shortcut

17509945
nfa	dfa
would learning dfa and nfa be useful in having a better understanding in regular expressions

17509989
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i realized that i needed to reset the ui settings in viewwillappear because viewwillappear is called every time the view is asked to appear unlike viewdidload which is only called the first time the view is created

17510014
mouseup	mousedown
in this example i create a variable outside of the event scopes for click position which constantly gets overridden on mousedown then referenced on mouseup a bit cleaner than using trigger

17510026
post	get
start using requests now because it makes working with get and post as well as other kinds of interaction much easier

17510033
int	chars
a switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data

17510033
int	chars
primitive types chars byte short and int discussed in

17510049
sorting	grouping
sorting and grouping simplexml data example of using xml.gz file with simplexmlelement

17510051
sequence	permutation
note that they are not ordered randomly at least not for short sequence so you may want to choose a random k-size permutation for that

17510082
keyevent	onkeydown
in my fragment b i implement onbackpressed and onkeydown int _a keyevent _b from mainactivity to make back button work with webview in fragment b

17510096
min	max
ignoring public holidays the first and last working days of the month then are simply the min and max weekdays of the month

17510101
tunnel	packets
if the udp apps are on different computers let s say local and remote i d like to associate their respective tun devices with an ip address so i can send a packets from local to remote via the tunnel by sending the packets to the ip address of the tun device on the remove machine

17510121
serializable	deserialization
if you need a custom serializable to set deserialization options you can pass it to method

17510122
google-chrome	firefox
bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers

17510135
uilabel	uibutton
pin vertical spacing for the rest elements uiwebview - uilabel event date and uilabel event date - uibutton

17510144
width	height
the 2 panels on the left side 60 width and 50 height each then the panel on the right side 40 width and 100 height

17510171
lsp	principles
see also the liskov substititution principles lsp

17510171
superclass	subclassing
the point is that polymorphism in java and other programming languages relies on you being able to treat an instance of a subclassing as if it was an instance of the superclass

17510176
clang	llvm
for example here is an equivalent program run through clang and llvm for other targets

17510184
superclass	subclassing
constricting the access modifier of a superclass method is an invalid override because it s breaking the superclass contract and invalidates the substitution principle a subclassing object is-a superclass object as well

17510222
innodb	myisam
you would need to change myisam to innodb before creating the foreign keys and it will work perfectly fine

17510243
submit	submission	post	get
you have to disable javascript if you want your submission work properly otherwise it doesn t send submit buttons by request post or get

17510254
put	get
i am unsure of how to get the out put to start with 6 and decrease then increase

17510406
windows	wow64
this is because all 64-bit versions of windows include a special subsystem windows-on-windows or wow64 that runs 32-bit code

17510406
windows	wow64
visual studio itself is an excellent example it s still 32-bit code but runs fine even on 64-bit versions of windows thanks to wow64

17510435

the script from the website can take youtube and vimeo videos and make convert them into html5 video

17510502
youtube	vimeo
one side effect of this script is that since it can convert both youtube and vimeo videos to html5 then the players will be the exact same for both of them

17510505
windows	wow64
there aren t any drawbacks on installing 64bit software on 64bit machines but 32bit software will be executed on a compatibility layer wow64 - windows on windows 64

storing to int boolean and chars stloc stfld stind.i1 stelem.i2 etc. truncates

17511809
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
convert instructions that yield short integer values actually leave an int32 32-bit value on the stack but it is guaranteed that only the low bits have meaning the more significant bits are all zero for the unsigned conversions or a sign extension for the signed conversions

17511809
16-bit	64bit
modern 32-bit and 64bit processors can work more effectively with 32-bit integers than they can with 16-bit integers and since all integers that can be represented in 2 bytes can also be represented in 4 bytes this behavior is reasonable

so i understand that ntfs support filenames up to 32.767 characters in length however according to knowledge fat16 only support 11 character filenames 8 + 3 so in reallity operating systems should have a function which our program can call to dertemine the maximum filename size simply because all filesystems have different limitations including the length of the filename

17514642
int	double
as others have already said passing an int to printf when it s expecting a double causes undefined behaviour and anything could happen

int	double
i know the byte array contains always one long one double and one int in this order

17515359
for-loop	loops
in the first for-loop loops runs for two values 1 and 0 and since largest gets 1 similarly in the other loops smallest gets 0

17515359
min	max
or you could just keep the numbers in a list and when done is typed print out the max and min of the list

17515366

17515487
kerberos	ntlm
failure to register a spn might cause integrated authentication to use ntlm instead of kerberos

17515502
screens	tablet
for example when supporting tablet you would have a layout-xlarge folder which contains the layout for your widget on extra large screens

17515527
for-loop	arrays
you need to terminate your for-loop at the end of the actual string rather than looping over the entire arrays

17515590
min	max
i want a match if the string contains more than 5 email ids i am new to regex and tried the min max function but no use

my goal is to have the progress dialog dismissed after the location is established also the alert dialog should pop-up but it is not

17515740
loops	while-loop
so if your while-loop were being entered even once it would actually be an infinite loops because loops body doesn t actually do anything

17515750
min	max
i tried to get it using min max and tickinterval property but seems like its not coming up fine

17515769
bash	zsh
it seems to run with the wrong version of ruby because is not the same as in bash or zsh or sh

17515811

typedef struct type type allows you to use type in c without having to use the struct keyword before the struct name

17515837
google-chrome	safari
one it is using pygame in fullscreen mode and i was wondering how i can get other windows google-chrome safari mail thunderbird itunes to go on top of the already fullscreen window

17515893
int	chars
in 8 bit micros passing a chars derivative instead an int derivative typically saves you a byte on stack as int are usually 16 bits

17515894
hash	md5
this is just my opinion but i would use idea #1-- each time the form loads give it a random hash just md5 of the time + random number would suffice and then keep up with those hash like they are unique window identifiers

17515915
width	height
for example a header has 800px width and 60px height

17515919
typedef	struct
i know that typedef ing allows you to refer to a struct without using the struct keyword

17515919
typedef	struct
i ve seen this typedef in a c api but struct system has not been defined previously

17515937
typedef	struct
the typedef declaration you present subsumes the declaration of struct system

17515937
typedef	struct
thanks to this typedef system now names an incomplete type so you can use it like in interface definitions without needing to expose the actual definition of the struct which can be kept private

17515970
width	height
the total size of a frame is w x h x 3 2 where w is width and h is height

17515976
folder	directory
ensure your libs fuelux directory contains the entire contents of the dist folder from the fuel ux repo

17515977
width	height
however when i created the model i did not make fields for height and width

17515977
width	height
if not how could i go about adding the height and width fields to the model and have it auto add from the images already stored in the database

17515978
int	double
for example if i implement sort routine i would like to use direct comparison of values of int double etc types it is more efficient than calling of interface methods like delphi s standard generic containers do and function ansicomparetext for string type

17515981
post	put
post and put requests hang indefinitely

17515998
typedef	struct
c struct cannot be accessed by their name only so the typedef is needed to be able to call a system just system

17516084
geany	notepad++
they already mentioned notepad++ but there s also geany which is available for windows and linux also has the ability for auto close tags droidedit for android smultron for os x users and if you love web based apps like myself there s the codemirror javascript library

17516084
geany	notepad++
also ctrl + f to find text ctrl + h to replace text notepad++ has a replace all function but geany does not

17516095
prepare	execute
i m writing a class for php pdo so that i can shorter the prepare and execute methods

17516105

to ignore key events caused by key repeats keep track of which keys are pressed during the keydown and keyup events

17516151
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
and the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object

17516166
screens	mdpi
most common situation is design in mdpi which means that 1dp on device with mdpi screens will be equivalent to 1px of design layout

17516166
mdpi	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	tablet
so for example large 10inch tablet with 1280x800 screens resolution is mdpi device not hdpi not xhdpi

17516174
width	height
the alternative to scripting something would be to update your application to try to find the width height and update them if they are not already set

17516192
next	except
all is working except that i m facing a problem passing data between the previous controller and the next controller having the different menu

17516197
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
since the function addlistitems accepts listcontrol and checkboxlist listcontrol can have more than one selection i first accidentally happened to pass two selected values to the radiobuttonlist when replacing the checkboxlist with the radiobuttonlist

17516217
mouse	keyboard
whenever i click or press a key on the keyboard the mouse coordinates jump to really strange values and then return to normal a second later

drupal joomla wordpress etc

17516415
google-chrome	firefox
the script identifies a mobile operating system when i use google-chrome or when i use android s default internet browser. it does not identify a mobile operating system when i use firefox

17516437
hash	salt
the place to generate the salt and to hash the password should be in the code not in the database

17516437
pbkdf2	hash
to hash passwords you need a slow key-derivation function like bcrypt or pbkdf2 but most databases have no implementations of such functions

17516437
hash	salt
the salt as well as the cost factor is usually stored in the same string as the password-hash so you need only a single field to store the hash

17516437
hash	salt
to verify the password you first have to search with the username for the password-hash then the function can extract the used salt and the cost factor and finally the entered password can be hash with the same parameters for comparison

17516478
post	get
internally the inline formset uses a queryset based on the instance of the parent model you give it - i think passing in in the get code path and if the author form doesn t validate in the post would work but i ve never tested that

17516508
super	extends
hello i m trying t instantiate an object from a class that extends its super class and its constructor super but am having hard times with the java accepting arguments in the constructor of the instantiated object can someone please help me out thank you

17516532
put	get
but if i put for example the fastround code above the race code or simply remove the race code the fastround results get displayed

17516540
implements	extends
make the first prompt as a class that either extends one of the input type prompts stringprompt or implements the prompt abstract class

17516580
for-loop	arrays
i can t comment on the for-loop which clearly assumes that alldata is an arrays of dictionaries to which i cannot attest without seeing the json

17516608
factors	matrix
when you have large data and a sparse matrix computing a full svd is often impossible since the factors will never be sparse

17516704
put	get
get with find the number of rows minus 20 put the result to in the for f loop

17516741
jboss	glassfish
by the way this code was working on glassfish recently migrated to jboss and not working on it

17516746
button	checkbox
when you check out with godaddy via express checkout they pass a parameter telling the checkout process to offer a billing agreement between the customer and godaddy which the customer then agrees to it is a checkbox and line of text above the pay button which changes to agree and pay

17516750
post	get
it s not in get or post for sure and how i can parse it in php

17516760
free	malloc
this is because the heap that the application uses will not in itself be free only the small blocks that go into the heap which will be reused by new or malloc next time you need a block of that size

17516765
submit	submission
however when submission the form using a normal submit button no ajax or js at all here there is no entry news_content in the _post array nor is there any other element containing the data at all

17516771
subtract	add	min	max	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
why we subtract min from max add 1 multiplying the answer by math.random and then add the min

17516772
stdout	stderr
i initially had this using exec but wanted to catch the stdout stderr information as it occurred so i figured i d use spawn and rewrote the code to use that

17516821
pull	push
i d like to push the changes upstream pull request but i have many commits that became irrelevant as i was developing

17516835
overwrite	preserve
while it would be possible to update the data it would be at risk of being overwrite when in order to provide an alternate template which will be preserve when the page is edited via the admin it s necessary to specify some configuration values and some corresponding layout xml

17516849
min	max	range	max	range	min
your range is how far from your min desired number to your max desired number which is max - min

17516849
min	max	range	max	range	min
if you want to include the max value in the range of numbers generated then use max - min + 1

17516849
min	max
you would now get a random number between 0 and max - min including the larger value

17516862
min	max
â a random integer between min incl. and max excl.

17516862
min	max
â a random integer between min incl. and max+1 excl. or between min and max both inclusive

17516864
profiling	debugging
select your development provisioning profiling for debugging and your ad hoc

17516919
multiplying	subtract
the mathematics behind what maps give you evenly distributed results is a bit complicated but in short if your map only involves adding subtract multiplying and dividing by constants it s legal in the sense that the results will also be evenly distributed

17516919
min	max	range	max	range	min
now for the final trick...mapping 0 1 to an arbitrary range min max

17516919
range	min
the secret here is to re-write this as min min+range where range max-min

17516919
range	min
here you can see that it s simple to transform the range 0 range to min min+range -- you just add min to it

17516919
range	min
so if i had the range 0 range and i wanted to get min min+range i would use f x x+min

17516919
range	min
f x x range + min

17516919
min	max
will transform a real number from 0 1 to a real number from min max

17516927
hash	salt
this string includes not only the hash password but also the algorithm salt value and number of rounds of hashing

17516927
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
the crypt function is supposed to pull the salt value out of this string and then apply it to hash the first argument

17516942
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
try testing with a different browser - ie run netsuite in firefox and test the ecommerce functionality in google-chrome or safari for instance

17516967
png	ico
i chose png as extension because pil does not support ico files which could be the culprit

17516968
hash	salt
so you need to give it the salt you used when you created the hash

17516988
crypt	hash
the crypt function in php doesn t necessarily return an sha512 hash

17517034
put	get
except if i put string where i get a

17517116
daemons	launchd
b programs which manage launchd daemons and agents for you both launchd control and lingon

17517173
squash	branch
git rebase -i origin master will replay your branch history on top of the current origin master and you can fixup squash your commits or delete them entirely you just remove the commit lines when the editor pops out

17517190
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this function that sorts my links works like a charm on google-chrome safari firefox but not in ie

17517230
loops	if-statement
avoid having diverged warps wavefronts if you do if-statement in loops it is really bad so better you find another way

17517263
ati	nvidia
the following elaborations are based on documentation from nvidia but i would doubt it to be any different on ati hardware though the actual numbers might differ maybe

17517279
webkit	gecko
you can achieve the same functionality by embedding webkit or gecko but as far as i know that is exactly what awesomium does behind the scenes

17517289
shadowing	named
when you call test the named parameter becomes a local variable shadowing the global variable

17517368
carrierwave	paperclip
i m trying to setup the store_dir for the files being uploaded to carrierwave but i want a particular url structure like i had using paperclip

for whatever reason i cannot get the following code to work at all in ie9 but it works in firefox google-chrome and opera

17517431
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu .appdata application name

17517436
put	get
but if you want to do more advanced things it s best to get hold of the r object and use that to put your objects in

17517453
qtextedit	qtextdocument
i think you can use it for any class based on qtextdocument qtextedit for example

17517454
allocator	stl
gcc 4.7.1 gives me a similar error in its hash map internal structures so clearly i m doing it wrong but this is my first foray in allocator in the stl and i m at a loss

17517457
put	get
and in my tableviewcontroller i have a array named list and all the items in the list get put into my tableview

17517468
width	height
each input vertex has a 2d position the first vertex is in the top left then they are arranged in rows down the screen a size they are all width and height 1 a rotation they all have rotation 0 and a layer 0-15

17517502
post	get
do a post request with the same headers and i bet you ll get an html error page

17517523
width	height
edit to clarify i am looking for the scale factor to use given an angle a height and a width

17517557
put	get	post	get	post	put
you have to put a name on the text box you re entering text into and use that post variable to get the text on the server side

17517593
children	parent
each of the child functions returns a promise and i want the parent function to return the successful failed result of the children

17517600
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like the mailto links we re embedding in our website fail to do anything in google-chrome though they work in firefox

17517619
bluestacks	android-emulator
you can even select and choose bluestacks as your android-emulator through eclipse and it is fully compatible

17517623
width	height
width and height of the intermediate images in pixels

17517627
put	get	post	get	post	put
although the documentation states that post get delete patch and put methods are supported but does not clearly state what happens to these methods

17517650
width	height
i d like it so that the image fills the width or height whichever is smaller first

17517670
google-chrome	firefox
but it only works in firefox and google-chrome

17517750
folder	directory
alternatively you may create a folder called lib and put the jar in the lib directory then you may perform the following steps

17517785
squash	branch	squash	merge
i don t want to squash all commits into one in experimental branch but i want to have only one commit during such merge instead of all single ones

17517793
onclick	onsubmit
i always use onclick rather than using form onsubmit because generally your form will want to link to a .php file whereas using the button s onclick allows for extra flexibility

17517831
implements	extends
instead of implements dbobject or extends one of the existing implementations like basicdbobject you could have all objects which can be saved in the database have a method public dbobject todbobject which creates and returns a dbobject representation of the object

17517839
subscript	superscript
everything was going good until i noticed that both superscript and subscript aren t properly toggling

17517844
put	get
i tried to put together my own example for typeahead.js and for some reason i can t get it to work

17517845

min	max
if you put all the numbers in a collection you can use the linq to objects extension methods min and max

17537952
min	max	put	get
because you cannot get the min or max until you ve generated the full list that code needs to be outside of the for-loop and you need to put all the random values in a collection so that they persist

17537958
for-loop	arrays
the python code i figured would be the easiest part in that i could just create a simple for-loop to tack on an index to the variables from the bash code and then create the python arrays dynamically but it hasn t worked out so good

17537958
put	get
now instead of the index i get a null value which implies maybe i m on the right track but i m still stuck and i figured someone on here would quickly see the error of my ways and put me on to the right track

getter	setter
there is no java rule for making getter and setter public but these are made public for a reason.the point of getter and setter is that only they are meant to be used to access the private varialble which they are getting or setting

17537980
getter	setter
this way you provide encapsulation and it will be much easier to refactor or modify your code later.using getter and setter functions allow for constraints and encapsulation

17537980
getter	setter
a good article on the usage of getter and setter

17537984
getter	setter
if a field is private and has no getter setter it is that way for a reason and is acceptable as long as you don t need to access it outside the class

17537984
public	protected
if it is public there s no point and if protected it s per-package or subclasses not necessarily in the same package

17537984
getter	setter
if you want to make a field private and the getter setter controlled you can use access levels as well

17537985
put	get
i get all the advantages of using routeduicommands the command text is automatically displayed in my menuitem along with the shortcut key including disable support my menu item ui or any other control that binds to togglereadcommand is specified in one place via xaml in my view no more separate commandbindings and inputbindings but i still get to put my command code in my viewmodels where it belongs

just filtering the orders when grouping on customer

17538004
getter	setter
you need to have public getter and setter for your object to function as a javabean

17538004
getter	setter
if you don t have a javabean requirement for your objects then you don t need have to provide public getter and especially setter in your classes

17538029
getter	setter
yes get and set methods also called getter and setter or accessor methods should almost always be public although they can be otherwise -- there s a difference between can and should

17538029
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter is usually so other classes can access the encapsulated instance variables

17538052
hex	binary
as a consequence if you ever take a look at the disassembly for any elf binary that would eventually be copied as a hex to your avr chip you will see two sections __do_copy_data and __do_clear_bss when required

17538151
width	font-size
say the div have 300px of width how would i set the font-size of the text so that it would always take 100 of the width considering the text is never the same length the text is some dynamic titles generated by php

17538166
width	text-align
text-align justify will make paragraph text extend to the right side but you cannot adjust the size of a header so its 100 of the width

getter	setter
you may need to limit access to getter and setter

17538175
getter	setter
unless you are writing code that deals with dependency injection systems or that use reflection to have your objects communicate with database don t worry about the specifics of getter and setter

17538178

in python3 photoimage can open gif ppm pgm images

17538703
post	get
try to get the post variable by _request not _post in your query

17538703

i think ie interprets this situation differently then google-chrome and firefox which is why is might have worked on there

inherited	subclassing
a subclassing is any class that inherited from a parent or super base class

another issue i noticed you were having was that the images can t have a negative width or height value

17538983
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
finally if you re doing more complicated stuff you can use execnet which wraps up jython - cpython - pypy to let you use whatever s best in each part of the code without having to do all that explicit subprocess stuff

17538992
iboutlet	ibaction
as it is instantiating those objects in your view it s going to read the iboutlet and ibaction connections in your storyboard and start assigning the hydrated objects to those properties that were connected at design time so that you have programmatic access to them at run time

17539267
comparator	comparable
use comparable or comparator and then apply

17539267
comparator	comparable
if using comparable interface you have to implement comparator method and

17539278
comparator	comparable
the idea of comparator is an object that provide comparison service between two items not a contract where one is comparable to another comparable interface

17539283
google-chrome	safari
this line doesn t seem to set the rotation of the loading spinner but in safari and google-chrome it does

17539286
comparator	comparable
sure they are indeed comparable but they are not comparison functions 1 themselves it makes no sense to have string implement comparator

17539303
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox when i click a link in the html inside the object tag the browser tab has a loading icon as per a normal page event giving the user feedback that an event has occurred

17539307

this is because you are using webkit prefixes google-chrome and safari are build on webkit so they wont work o non webkit browsers like firefox

17539310
for-loop	loops
in my tests i found that one of the loops i tested titled for-loop is astronomically slower than the other loops

17539310

other than performance issues they are equivalent in every cpython jython ironpython and pypy implementation but it doesn t seem to be stated anywhere the way it is in 3.x

17539438
put	get
just because you are using your own namespaces you will need to either use global classes like input get or you will need to put use input

17539447
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this way the method using the comparator doesn t need to know whether it s a case-sensitive comparator or a case-insensitive comparator or something else

i have managed to make it sometime disappear by restarting apache nginx

17539499
inherited	subclassing
an intermediate entity has subclassing and inherited from a class closer to the root entity and may or may not be instantiable

to avoid the problem pass references to objects contextually as function arguments or similar transient local state instead of using persistent members

17539528
comparator	comparable
why cannot we just implement comparator just like comparable and use

17539538
portrait	landscape
and for other views like fill portrait and landscape you ll define the liquid design layout

alternatively you can use indexof using the id for the node but i only needed the parent nodes selected and none of the children as doing this also selected all the child nodes

17539547
mp3	wav
i d like to automate nero s mp3 encoding so that i could perhaps just drag and drop a wav file and get it as an mp3 in 256 kbps instead of going thru all the menus each time i publish a new loop

free	malloc
a static test basically looks at the source code and attempts to find a matching delete for every new and free for every malloc

17539618
gif	png
my next guess -- to pull this off -- would be to set the og meta image to a blank gif or png

17539635
folder	directory
if you do it this way then 3 directory will be created for 1 2 and 3 and in those directory only files with the same number as the name of the folder will be under them

downcasting	upcasting
i understand the concept of upcasting and downcasting in java and don t see any advantage in this particular situation

17539674

17539750
post	get
the usual way this sort of thing is done is by sending values using either post get to the page with the next question and using them to create hidden input tags and the next time passing these hidden input tags as well to the next page or you could do what simon said

17539773
ggplot2	ggmap
for some things easier than ggplot2 or ggmap

17539778

17539818
rspec	capybara
going by what the tutorial has you do and without your gemfile to double check i believe you are experiencing a conflict between capybara 2.0 and rspec on the visit keyword

17539818
rspec	capybara
notably we changed the type that capybara assumes your specs run under in rspec to feature previously it was request

17539925
post	get
i think it demands post to get search arguments and therefore delivers search results

17539947

remember that if you allow post to be authored by simple email you are going to have to do some sort of checking to make sure that you are not posting each and every spam email you get

17539990
realloc	malloc
also you re not checking for null returns from malloc and realloc though those would cause your program to crash not just leak

17540028
put	get
use this to get button value put it right where you have the alert

17540147
int	chars
secondly you re trying to match chars to a list which contains int so the in checks are always going to be false

17540163
button	checkbox
i could just use checkbox but i would really like to be able to use my custom button

17540218
maven	pom.xml
on your maven pom.xml alongside with other spring 3 dependencies and the setup as described in the tutorial should look alright

the approach of binding to an observabledictionary which implements the inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged should work

17541855
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged

afnetworking	sdwebimage
for anyone looking to use both sdwebimage and afnetworking as-is here s my caveman solution to discourage use of the colliding methods

17552176
min	max
you can also find the max and return an ordered vector w the position but not the min

17552177
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
it seems that replaced inline elements have properties like width height margin etc that non-replaced inline elements don t have thus making the difference between block elements and replaced inline elements harder to explain and vice versa inline-blocks have some of the delicate features that inline elements have as well.

17552208
domxpath	domdocument
xpath is also available for use with domdocument see domxpath

17552266

apache	nginx
you can then handle your preferred authentication mechanism with apache or nginx

17552316
content-length	content-type
it contains no body and no content-length content-type

17552316
post	get
it looks as though you are trying to pass post variables in the url but that is what you do with a get request not a post

17552326
submit	submission
you should use the form s submit event not the click on anything to process form submission

17552333
google-chrome	firefox
i am thinking about using webrtc native c++ api to create my own server application to connect to the current implementation on google-chrome or firefox browser client application.

17552343

17552483
switching	screens
if i run my application and go to the screens with the switching button it crashes with the following error

17552517
setinterval	settimeout
mostly no see below for why mostly you have to yield back to the browser via settimeout or setinterval so it can update the page display and that will indeed increase the amount of time the loop runs

17552608
putchar	gets
then getchar gets the character from that buffer one-by-one and putchar displays them one-by-one

i ve tried using the straight-forward z-index rule it works in firefox but not google-chrome

17552685
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but in google-chrome the child goes under the content along with the parent

17552724
put	get	post	get	post	put
it s easy enough to have different serializers for different request methods eg something to response to get requests that s different to put post etc...

17552724
post	put
that may not be exactly what you re looking for because when you put or post data you ll still end up with the same output style as you supplied

17552734
for-loop	loops
here is a little quote from expert c programming - deep c secrets on the difference between using a loops and using memcpy preceding it are two code snippets one copying a source into a destination using a for-loop and another memcpy

17552734
memcpy	memmove
while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop

17552746
persistent	transient
it says that a filehashmap is persistent by default but the zero- and one-arg constructors the one you re using which specifies the file name is the one-arg create a new transient filehashmap â that is the file is deleted after the filehashmap is closed

17552746
persistent	transient
the two-arg constructor takes the filename and an int options flag but there s no specific option for persistent so you just have to make sure the flag is not transient to be precise

17552838
hash	md5
you are computing the md5 hash of the wrong data

17552838
hash	md5
the fingerprint of a certificate is a hash md5 sha1 sha256 etc. of the raw certificate

my second question was going to be is there some generic work around i could use when i want to cast such a value to a byte or int or some other datatype i could cast normally cast from a double but i thought of a couple

17552858
datediff	difference
you can use the datediff function to get the difference between two dates and add those together

17552871
width	height
you also have to take into consideration the fact that paddings get added to the width height so the container needs to be bigger

17552873
metaclass	superclass
and the principles of inheritance do apply for meta-classes as well there superclass is its classe s superclasse s metaclass and climbs up so until it reaches the base object whoe s metaclass is the metaclass itself

17552899

17552947
firefox	safari
i tested in firefox and safari

17552983
oncreate	recreate
i solved my problem by using a static variable which is set to true just before recreating an activity and when activity execution is in oncreate i use this variable to decide whether this activity is recreate and if yes then call method to perform remaining task

17552988
google-chrome	safari
it may be that google-chrome decodes the url for you while safari does not

17552989

17553150
svg	vml
you mention that you re trying to write separate code to make the feature work in svg mode and vml mode

17553150
svg	vml
the developer just writes to the raphael object and raphael deals with the separate code branches for vml or svg

17553150
svg	vml
given that i m not sure why you d feel the need to write your own svg vml code paths

17553202
for-loop	loops
the i at the end of the for-loop issue should be able to be fixed by replacing your loops declaration with

17553217

equals	tostring
the trick that i didn t understand was that javascript doesn t truly support an equals method or even a tostring method that i was used to with java

17553384
boost	allocator
often times custom allocator also implies custom deallocation in which case boost shared_ptr can be used to manage the lifetime of the object and invoke a custom dealloction strategy

17553436
width	height
the table cell will always have the same width but dynamic height

17553445
hide	show
desktop would show the content automatically and hide the button

17553467
width	height
we pretty much create a new top level menu and add all the desired hot-key label s to it and set it s width and height to 0

17553468
integer	unsigned
i have a byte array in which a value is stored as a 16bit unsigned integer

17553470
hash	salt	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
it is a common practice for password hash functions slow key-derivation function like bcrypt or pbkdf2 to return the salt cleartext as part of the password hash what means that you can store salt and hash together in a single database field

17553470
hash	salt
to verificate an entered password you first have to search for the password-hash using the username or email and then the function can extract the used salt from the stored password-hash and use it to compare the hash

17553470
hash	salt
the second salt is actually called a pepper the best way to add this server-side secret is to encrypt the already hash password with this secret

17553486
post	get
similarly if i do a get operation instead of post then i get a numberformat exception in android client

17553490
for-loop	loops
with the string declared outside the for-loop it is accessible outside loops

17553516
union	distinct
the dr subquery gets all possible combinations of destination and route - the use of union distinct indicates that duplicates should be removed

17553527
unsigned	short	16-bit	64bit	int	chars
the integral types are byte short int and long whose values are 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit signed two s-complement int respectively and chars whose values are 16-bit unsigned int representing utf-16 code units

17553547

queue	fifo
i believe each queue is processed on a fifo basis standard queue behaviour but say i have several queue - all with pending jobs - and two workers processing ie all queue

17553626
queue	fifo
if it was a universal fifo it would be the oldest job on any queue but it looks to me like there s some sort of queue rotation going on instead

17553634
pivot-table	crosstab
if you want those columns dynamic crosstab pivot-table you can do the following

17553640

17553873
multiplication	dot-product
total speed ratio of latest case vs java s loop-unrolled multiplication for single thread was nearly 6x after i applied multithreading it increased to 8x not much because of memory bandwidth not the compute limit for this particular dot-product

17553880
folder	directory
i thought this error might be caused by the folder_to_checkout_to not existing yet but when i create the folder and call a git init and then re-execute the git clone command above from the parent directory it returns

17553881
min	max
that height definition can itself be a height property setting but not a min or max version of that or it can be as in your case by a position absolute that you have also defined the height of by setting the top and bottom properties

width	height
for now i m only using .ui-autocomplete-input to change the height width of the text field

17553925
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
if you want to avoid this behavior you can use qgraphicsview setscenerect or qgraphicsscene setscenerect to fix the rect position

17553931
public	protected
a compiled module dll can be referenced by other code and then private public protected do matter

17553984

17558321
min	max
then whenever you dequeue the min or max you can remove the corresponding element from the other heap

now i cannot simply calculate the expression and then modulo it to n as the multiplication and division are going in a loop and the value is large enough to not fit even in long long

17558842
multiplication	modulo
but if i calculate the multiplication modulo it would be like

woocommerce	wpml
i ve got a wordpress website running with woocommerce and wpml plugin for multilingual

hide	show
hello i am trying to toggle hide show comments i originally had it working just fine because i thew all my comments inside of a single div with class .forum-comments

17559052
primes	modulus
in your comments below the question you clarify that the modulus will always be a primes

17559053
folder	directory
so now when they save i need it to create the folder named after it to save it to that directory

17559056
factors	mean
for each of these histograms i also want to add mean and sample size--they need to be calculated for each level of the factors zip_cpt

17559105
division	modulo
you should probably look up how to do division with modulo first it should be clear to you

17559173
oncreate	setcontentview
you can do all this after your setcontentview within the oncreate method

17559235
division	modulo
in order to find an exact solution to this rearrange it as 6 x 4 mod 11 which makes clearer how the modulo division works

17559235
primes	modulus
note that when the modulus is not primes there may be multiple solutions to the reduced problem

17559240
serializable	deserialization
here is my serializable deserialization code

17559243
folder	directory
there are a finite number of root directory entries in some drive formats so this creates one root folder and then subdirectories inside that

17559280
atan2	sin
simply running gcc -lglfw3 -lm -lgl -lglu boing.c gives a wall of undefined references starting with sin and atan2 followed by various gl and glfw stuff

17559315
geocoding	geocode
but geocoding all the locations each time the map loaded would be a bad practice anyway -- you should cache your geocode results for some short while according to terms

17559316
direct3d	directx
i ve tried both a wpf window with re-positioning of shapes on a canvas and drawing directly to the direct3d directx instance of desktop window manager and re-position by changing transform matrixes

17559333
onkeyup	onkeydown
make sure that you are attaching your handler to the onkeydown or onkeyup events

17559348
post	get
then you do not need to get and post data from sever and your app can act as an offline app once it has data

17559348
post	get
and then you may do normal get and post as you would for a web service

17559350
range	minimum
they only have minimum range requirements specified by the language standard

17559350
range	minimum
even though the minimum range requirements for int and short are the same in a typical modern implementation the range of int is usually greater than the range of short

17559360
int	chars
int main int chars mount error msg method filesystemmount with signature bas on interface org.freedesktop.udisks.device doesn t exit

17559362
rss	feed
and i want to read some rss feed from url and i have asynctask class for that called loadxmldata and here is code of that class

i am working on a website for my client in which tiff images need to converted to png or jpg before they are assembled into a pdf

17559384
int	boolean
should output string int boolean

17559425
google-chrome	safari
the above code works fine on safari and google-chrome

17559480
range	minimum
the guaranteed minimum range of int and short are the same

17559480
range	minimum
however an implementation is free to define short with a smaller range than int as long as it still meets the minimum which means that it may be expected to take the same or smaller storage space than int 1

17559504
16-bit	64bit
different architectures have different size natural integers so a 16-bit architecture will naturally calculate a 16-bit value where a 32- or 64bit architecture will use either 32 or 64bit int s

17559504
int	chars
in a lot of code the size of a variable isn t critical because the number is within such a range that a few thousand is way more than you ever need - number of chars in a filename is defined by the os and i m not aware of any os where a filename path is more than 4k chars - so a 16 32 or 64 bit value that can go to at least 32k would be perfectly fine for counting that - it doesn t really matter what size it is - so here we should use int not try to use a specific size

17559531
direct3d	directdraw
if you re using direct3d directdraw

17559539
hide	show
i m new to jquery and was looking for a way to show hide partial views in mvc 4

17559543
put	get
you can put anything in a namespace but you can t put namespaces inside things that s not a very formal way of saying it but i hope you get what i mean

17559584
implements	extends
if you want this class to actually implements that interface you ll need to specify that in the class declaration public class dialogbox extends activity implements dialogboxpopup

17559598
viewdidload	viewdidappear
seems like the issue was because i was calling the code from viewdidload i moved it to viewdidappear and now its fine

17559614
google-chrome	firefox
as part of my troubleshooting of being unable to launch srcds the dedicated server for the source game engine i decided to try out launching some other executables specifically google-chrome and firefox

17559621
google-chrome	firefox
i realise after some research that background-image transitions are not currently supported i therefore attempted to construct an opacity transition using the pseudo class before which i believe currently works in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox

17559671
post	get
i am writing a servlet using eclipse that receives post request from a client that should do some splitting on the received text access google geolocation api to get some data and display to the user

17559709
xgoogle	mechanize
now since the only available apparently wrapper is xgoogle the option is to use some sort of browser like mechanize but that is gonna make the code entirely dependant on google html and they might change it a lot

17559714
filtering	grouping
query all autoscaling grouping with the launch configuration name as a filtering

17559729
put	get
i am trying to put together a regexp in vba but even in ruby i can t get it right

17559742
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome but not on internet explorer

17559745
hide	show
i actually have simplified the code for what i originally had which has five divs and show hide different ones based on the dropdown choice

17559772
put	get
but when i want to read it from xml and put it back in mysql table i cant get the right format

17559778
ssl	https
the correct solution is to use an ssl certificate and exclusively use https

17559836
for-loop	loops
i ve set up a for-loop that works the same as my loops for my number of forces and i am trying to get it to record each force through clicking the buttons in the new rows

17559863
noscript	meta
noscript in the head element may contain only link style and meta elements see the spec

17559874
fadein	fadeout
every time someone chooses a title the corresponding pargraph after each title will fadein and any visible paragraphs will fadeout

17559903
put	get
in my parser i have get and string defined as part of several rules which means that it gets implicitly put into the lexer

17559938
put	get
then i want to get those objects in the resultset and put them into an arraylist as you see in the code

17559960
config	ini
the issue was related to the session config in the ini file

17559976
textarea	pre
enter is visible in the source or pre tags or textarea s or when enabled by css white-space etc. while br is the line break in html

17559978
terminate	timeout
i commented out another kernel which was not launching due to having many registers and now the error on the kernel above changed now it says the launch timeout and was terminate

17560032
accessor	properties
in the case of managed objects core data will provide the accessor for you and you just need the dynamic properties declaration to let the compiler know that it shouldn t generate accessor itself

17560069
actionscript	haxe
seee the haxe language - its compiler can compile haxe very simmilar to actionscript to swfs

17560071
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
in previous code in my program i had saved an arraylist consisting of objects of a custom class called location as you can see in my code in a file using objectoutputstream and fileoutputstream

17560074
subtract	add
add one to that or subtract and then move the item to the new position

17560145
jobs	cron
the dev appserver doesn t automatically run your cron jobs

17560145
jobs	cron
you can use your local desktop s cron or scheduled tasks interface to hit the urls of your jobs with curl or a similar tool

17560153
junit	jmock
i am working on a project that has a dependency of junit 4.11 and a transitive dependency of jmock 2.6.0-rc2 who in turn has a dependency of junit-dep 4.4

17560153
m2e	pom.xml
looking at dependencies via m2e in eclipse when i check the dependency hierarchy tab of my pom.xml i ser 1 resolved dependency for junit 4.11 and multiple ommitted for conflict with 4.11 versions on the left

17560170
put	get	post	get	post	put
post get options delete put

17560182
nsstring	nsdata
this is because nsuserdefaults can usually only store objects of type nsstring nsnumber nsdata nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

17560186
udp	tcp
but for instance comparing webrtc srtp over udp with vp8 codec against flash rtmp over tcp with h264 codec i would say that webrtc wins

17560186
udp	tcp
the transport would be tcp against udp

17560193
maven	pom.xml
update i ve found that trying to do maven clean and maven generate-sources succeed on the pom.xml

17560202
x86	64bit
copy the x86 or x64 on 64bit os folder address under bin folder where your emgu is installed

17560228
post	put
want to use token base authentication system so api call for put post delete will only execute for authorized user

uialertview creates a uiwindow which it retains

17560331
hash	md5
svn dump files can have a md5 hash for copy-sources like

17560386
rss	feed
the element of the rss feed contains html

17560386
rss	feed
the accepted answer to the linked question already shows this quite verbose for simplexml it does not play much of a role here whether that rss feed is using cdata or just entities like in your case

17560391
opera	google-chrome
but its present in opera dragonfly and its very handy so probably google-chrome will copy it eventually but no such feature request exists in bug tracker now

17560393
put	get
i m trying to parse xml in a grails controller - i can successfully parse the result of a get but when receiving a put i can t get the values out of the request

17560421
maven	pom.xml
using android maven plugin and intellij this works perfectly because you can just add the library pom.xml to intellij and intellij will automatically compile the library using the source code on file system instead of using existing jars in repositories

17560439
ilist	icollection
if that isn t the case and indeed you want to make sure you don t enumerate the collection more than once you would make it available as ilist iset or icollection

17560508
inputaccessoryview	autolayout
i want to create an inputaccessoryview for a uitextview programmatically using autolayout

17560508

17560580
hash	salt
what hash was implemented when you passed 0 as a salt

17560583
ant	maven
i would like to use the hibernate tools toolset but all examples seem incomplete or contradictory - some reference using ant tasks some reference maven plugins and the jboss site itself indicates that hibernate tools 4.x now seems to be an eclipse plugin

17560596
atomic	lockless
one possible approach would be to use a lockless array using atomic built-ins provided by the c compiler of pending children

17560669
cout	cin
by the way all bets are off if cin or cout are connected to any kind of terminal

17560669
cout	cin
the resulting graphical operations and i o from cout will bring the machine to its knees before your program gets a chance to run and for cin you would have to be a pretty fast typist

17560728
width	height
the deal is that with top left width and height property we create a box the same size as your grid div and at the same position

17560738
google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure if its still in draft or not but it works in google-chrome as well as firefox

17560855
sat	np-complete
as an example the first proven np-complete problem by cook is the sat problem where you try to decide if there exists a possible assignment to a set of boolean variables such that a boolean formula would evaluate to true

17560855
sat	np-complete
with the correct procedure you can transform all decision problems in np to sat in polynomial time and this makes sat np-complete

17560855
sat	np-complete
since all problems in np can be reduced to sat and sat can be reduced to 3-sat this makes the 3-sat problem np-complete

17560864
coffeescript	haml
so haml 4 includes a coffeescript filter which allows us coffee-loving rails people to do neat things like this

17560933
coalesce	isnull
this uses isnull instead of coalesce because of a bug in sql server that evaluates the first argument twice when using coalesce

17560974
post	get
the 2 get methods work but the post still gives that error

17560990
for-loop	arrays
instead of using an arrays created with range use a for-loop as follows

17561017
int	boolean	int	double
blam comment is worthwhile to consider a range to check generally applies for an int or a double for other types i d say you could just add a boolean that return the validity of that object and perform such validation inside the object itself

17561052
min	max
i was wondering if there was anyway to position the legend box based on the width of the plot itself and not on max min values

17561097
hibernate	jdbi
this can then be hooked into jdbc hibernate jdbi or some other jdbc based framework

17561252
superclass	subclassing
i want to override the superclass s method in my subclassing

17561268
getter	setter
i only needed to access the locale so i added a property to the entity with the setter and getter and i set the locale before calling the view i use template for the return by the way

17561281
width	height
basically i wanted to start with an algorithm that would give me on a 2d surface of given height and width of integer values a local density value for any point defined by integers a b

17561299
gridview	rowdatabound
if you want to alter the format of a column of a gridview from codebehind add a rowdatabound to your grid view

17561350
getter	setter
in an android project i have some private variables in a public class the warning messages keep reminding me of implementing the getter and setter instead of assigning values direct to those private variables

17561365
jar	war
the jar or war file should be the unit of deployment management

17561365
jar	war
if you start patching jar war files on production servers it is hard to track what is actually being used where

17561365
jar	war
but even in that case it is best to modify the jar war on your build platform and deploy the modified jar war

17561372
getter	setter
getter and setter should be implemented for private member variables of a class when you need to control the access and modification of their data

17561442
getter	setter
create public getter and setter when you want to allow classes to access your classes private data

17561442
getter	setter
create protected getter and setter when you want to allow only inheriting classes to access the private data

17561442
getter	setter
you don t need to create getter and setter to access private data from the same class but many people think it creates code that will be easier to maintain in the future as requirements change

17561442
getter	setter
another reason for getter and setter is where the form or use of the data can change for example your might have private data to store the birthdate but create a getter named getage

17561454
groupbox	panel
you need to create a group using container control panel or groupbox

17561468
post	get
basically i m building a form with paypal so giving customer the option to process payment later send1only or now send1and2 one post wouldn t be a file it ll be the paypal link and other would be to get info to me

17561502
stringbuilder	bufferedreader

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the thing is it works perfectly on firefox google-chrome op safari

17561550
mouseover	mouseout
in addition each path has a mouseover and mouseout event bound to it

17561550
keydown	keyup
upon keyup and keydown events in the suggestion dropdown list i d like to trigger the associated path id mouseover event handler

17561566
width	height
also i want to point out that you re using deprecated methods for resizing the image--please use css to do this rather than width height attributes

17561580
folder	directory
right now we installed worklight directory on all nodes in the same folder but can we install the worklight server directory on shared folder and refer to the shared installed directory on all the server nodes

17561729
capistrano	bundler
in case of capistrano deployments set this flags for bundler capistrano

17561734
width	height
the height all have to be the same 18px but the width can vary

17561734
width	height
i have seen other solutions for these when the width is fixed and height is set to auto like below this solution

17561734
width	height
what i would like to do is to keep the height of the image at 18px and have the width be whatever fits the aspect ratio

17561783
post	get
it ll give you the url being called the type of the request usually get or post the request arguments and the full text of the response

my answer to first question mark the text in emacs using either mouse or set mark c-spc and press - backspace button on keyboard instead of c-w

17561861
width	height
what i would like to do is to keep the height of the image at 18px and have the width be whatever fits the aspect ratio

17561868
hide	show
my business spec says if carier is unitedhealth then show diagnosis code field but hide it when carrier is bluecross

17561886
hide	show
during rendering the visibility properties will hide show the elements in question

17561911
post	get
controller.user.identity.name is used to get the desired username in controllers works well in pre and post publishing

17561920
openni	kinect
i use opencv and openni to calibrate the kinect and my hd camera with the method in rgbdcapturekinect

17561923
inherited	subclassing
rails uses single table inherited which means the data for all of your subclassing is kept in the same table which is why you got the error you did

17562014
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the ajax below is perfectly working in google-chrome ie opera and safari

17562051
vim	sublimetext	ubuntu	linux
an alternative and i know this sounds like a very bad idea to you right now is to install virtualbox free with ubuntu as a virtual machine and develop on linux for a while using an editor like sublimetext 2 or vim

i want to create a uiview that has two parallel subviews of this custom view

17562293
width	height
i have a parent div with a max height width set

17562300
hide	show
according to that you can decide which imageview and which edittext you want to show which one you want to hide

17562300
textview	imageview
when you set the visibility of receiver speech textview to invisible and imageview to invisible you will get this layout

17562300
textview	imageview
and when you set the visibility of your speech textview to gone and imageview to invisible you get this layout

17562330
width	height
just adding a 100 height as well as width to the divs yields what you want

17562330

17562412
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but not in ie and firefox both latest versions

17562442
submit	submission
you need to preventdefault in your submit handler or the form will be submitted in addition to your ajax submission

17562445
getter	setter
scala generates a getter and a setter and makes the param private

17562445
getter	setter
i was trying to write the desugared version of it with explicit getter setter but couldn t do so 100 the same way as the private var had a naming collision with the getter

17562473

17562879
post	get
there really is nothing different between get and post

17562879
post	get
while get uses url visibly you should not think that post data is hidden in anyway as this could create false sense of security

serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

17566019
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

17566019
public	protected
the automatically-generated uid is generated based on a class name implemented interfaces and all public and protected members

17566025

xstream	jackson
jackson xml module faster than xstream

17566038
serializable	deserialization
the uid is used to check if the class you are trying to de-serialize is the really the one you think it is so if your class in your code has one uid and the class that was serializable has a different one the deserialization will fail

17569162
rdf	owl
the relationship between owl and rdf

17569162
rdf	owl
owl although designed to be used in the semantic web and thus with rdf data is really a logical language that only incidentally happens to be related to rdf

17569162
rdf	owl
the utility of owl arises from the fact that like rdf it uses iris as identifiers but the logical structure could exists entirely separately from rdf

17569162
rdf	owl
in fact though owl ontologies can be serialized using rdf and indeed this is probably the most common serialization used owl can also be serialized in owl xml the owl functional syntax the manchester owl syntax and any other serialization format that someone invents

17569162
rdf	owl
now owl can be serialized using rdf so it s feasible to create a wrapper layer over an rdf graph so that you could say â œcreate for me the class that is the intersection of a and bâ and get back the resource identifying that class and transparently adding to the class whatever rdf triples are needed in the owl serialization to assert that the new class is equivalent to the intersection of a and b

17569162
jena	reasoning
the fact that owl-level constructs in jena are simply wrappers over the rdf serialization means that rule-based reasoning is limited in what it can achieve

17569162
rdf	owl
the protege-owl api is an open-source java library for the web ontology language owl and rdf s

17569162
rdf	owl
the fullest one of these shows that there are classes for both rdf s and owl entities

i can set either the width or the height as a of the browser size but the i have no idea how to set the other property value

17569461
joptionpane	jdialog
based on my assessment of that code which was not an sscce therefore this might be wrong i can guess that you are using the jframe when you should actually be using a modal jdialog or a joptionpane

17569482
width	height
div1 needs a height of 60 and the width needs to be 1 4th the height

17569483
implements	extends
public class buspanel extends jpanel implements runnable

17569488
ctime	posix

width	height
doctype defined i have created a subroutine that corrects the width or height on elements where the left right style or the top bottom style are set not â œautoâ

17569891

to avoid going in to all kind of unit conversions the routine temporary removes the left or top style and sets the width or height to 100 to determine the right or bottom offset in pixels

17569897

min	max
because actually i ve found a solution to this problem but it acts in the childs create a loop that goes throw all the parents childs then get the max left and min left of these childs then it returns the distance between the min max and the same tip for the height by getting the max min top however this tip needs childs to have an absolute position to get there left top am looking for an existing jquery or javascript function that does that without absolute position for childs

17570480

17570894
gif	png
if the final size of the gif or the png is large then probably a buffered video is probably better

17570894
gif	png
this is because the whole gif png file needs to be downloaded before it shows i am not sure how interleaved pngs works when they contain animation though

17570894
gif	png
the canvas in this is only a displaying device and not really necessary an image container does the same job and can also animate the gif png whereas a canvas cannot

17571159
textview	imageview
adapter will be consisting of one textview and one imageview preferably

17571159

17571190
int	double
make a variable double sum 0 and a variable int count

17571242
coffeescript	haml
here since haml needs to wait to see what the value of the interpolation is the coffeescript is recompiled each time

expect100continue will prevent the soap request xml being sent on the initial http put post the server will send an ok continue and the client will then send the soap request xml

17571455
hide	show
an alternative would be to have this textbox as part of your grid and show hide the textbox with some javascript - this way it would be available on postback as it was not dynamically added

17571485
gif	png
it works fine for jpeg gif or png

17571494
getter	setter
that is the getter and setter for the property will always be fully completed regardless of what other threads are doing

17571532
post	get
i have a mvc application that uses a lot of ajax requests to get and post forms within divs on a page.however i stumbled upon the classic ajax timeout issue for which i have fixed by creating a custom authorize attribute that just returns a 401 which allows me to redirect to the login page via jquery all well and good at this point

17571540
int	chars
note that using string.valueof around the int typecast is neccessary to avoid the chars ch to get promoted to int

17571540
int	chars
so if you don t convert the int to string then as per above statement the 2nd argument - ch will be promoted to int thus appending the ascii code for 1 instead of chars 1 itself

17571549
post	get
i would have two methods one for get and one for post the post can then take enquiry as a method argument with modelattribute annaotion

17571827
getter	setter
that is the getter and setter for the property will always be fully completed regardless of what other threads are doing

17571827
getter	setter
setter getter for these nonatomic property

17571827
getter	setter
so by looking on the setter getter methods for both atomic nonatomic that nonatomic methods are very light weight

17571833
onfocus	onblur
edit this is actually more difficult because you have to mess with the onfocus onblur events as well

17571837
superclass	subclassing
as per me all subclassing should adhere to all behavior related to superclass

17571843
getter	setter
note since ko.obsevable is a function rather than an actual property thank ie for not supporting javascript getter and setter accessing the value is a little different

17571858
getter	setter
and that would both create the setter getter methods automatically and it would also create an instance variable named _count

17571858
getter	setter
next by doing the above the setter getter will be created with the proper memory management retain release patterns and you don t have to worry about it

17571858
getter	setter
if it is written correctly -- and it will be since you are using automatically synthesized getter setter -- that method will either retain the object releasing the previous one or it might make a copy of the object

17571886
post	get
about post get you can read this volley - post get parameters hope this helps

17571897
listview	gridview
so i have inflate gridview in custom row listview

17571921
put	get
the best solution i found was to put the file as an embedded resource on the test project and get it from my unit test

17571999
superclass	subclassing
in object-oriented design it is useful for all subclassing to support the contracts of their superclass so that an instance of any subclassing can be used anywhere that a superclass is referenced

17572111
superclass	subclassing
sometimes you have a subclassing that can t or just won t provide all the services the superclass offers

17572163
for-loop	arrays
to get indices use for-loop and iterate over the arrays

17572216

and about the cyclic value dom elements are cyclic in nature because every dom element has a reference to its parent and in turn every parent has references to its children so a cyclic structure

17572351
single-quotes	double-quotes
use double-quotes instead of single-quotes

17572360
octal	decimal	octal	hex
so for instance the 666 in your code is seen as octal 666 and is treated as hex 0x1b6 decimal 438 which is the â char

17572398
pop-up	dialog

to get an idea how to parse json files you can take a look at this blog post i wrote the example there is much more complicated but you will get the point

17572608
submit	submission
if i understand it right the required fields are preventing the form submission if they are not set and the page is just reloaded - so the submit function is not called

17572614

setinterval	settimeout
as others have stated settimeout can be used very well to handle these sorts of scenarios and setinterval could also be used but is discouraged by some

17572727
setinterval	settimeout
you can even recursively call a function that has settimeout built into it as mentioned in the mdn documentation of setinterval

however i still get a timeout when sending the post data

17578110
hide	show
the using-scope construction show and hide the busy screen using

17578126
post	get
after that the most efficient approach likely would not be using the activities.list method to get all their public post but instead to use the activities.search method to search for the given url in public post then you d parse the response to see if the current user s id matches one of the shares

17578149
unix	bsd
this means it works on every up-to-date bsd unix including mac and every glibc-based system including linux â but again not windows

17578149
jython	pypy
of course if you re using jython ironpython or pypy it probably depends on some feature in the underlying java .net or python runtime rather than the c api

17578229
button	checkbox
if you ve got radio button that don t share a name with other radio button they should be checkbox and not radio button

17578310
post	get
his solution worked perfectly if you have to allow a user to go back to a search or something along those lines i would totally recommend using the get method even if you are used to using post

17578337
post	get
it seems like there s an ajax request to get the list of linkable post pages and then javascript handles the rest

17578356
accessor	properties
simply because logic might be added to those properties later that all accessor should use

17578381
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox

17578397
folder	directory
there are several other places where i use the new-item -itemtype directory command and those work around 99 of the time but occasionally they will create a file instead of a folder as well

17578426
width	height
basically i d like to keep an element size at a certain ratio with the height say maintaining the same value or 50 as the width

17578437

17578469
getter	setter
i ve set this method for my getter and setter

17578523
folder	directory
the best way is to separate your projects files everything in your .war from custom files like user data or uploads by saving the the latter in a directory outside your webapps folder

17578525
int	chars
what i m trying to achieve is to combine those 8 bits from the chars that i get into a big 24 bits int

17578549
int	chars
the catches works fine for single chars or int outside of the range 0-4

17578554
getter	setter
setter getter

17578602
portrait	landscape
i take a photo with a screenorientation portrait but a catch a landscape picture so with a rotation of 90â

17578610
integer	unsigned
the operator is performing an unsigned right-shift of bits when applied to an integer it has the effect of dividing by two

17578709
width	height
forcing the canvas to have a height width did the trick

17578763
subtract	add
in a similar fashion you can add or subtract months and years hours or minutes

17578799
post	get
the web service just accepts soap http post and http get methods

17578817
folder	directory
it says file not found i was thinking primary.js is in jquery folder so i used .. ajax to go back one directory and jump to ajax but it does not seem to work surprisingly when i moved the file to html request.php and made ajax request simply request.php it worked

17578871
jar	war
since the idea is that each war has to use the shared persistance.xml from the jar jpa project y removed the persitence.xml in each war mata-inf folder but then when i want to build the war i get no persistence.xml file found in project war name

17578904

17579002
profiling	debugging
when i use a profiling to debugging the plugin it works fine but otherwise nothing happens

17579028
excel	listobject
you could make a listobject in excel with an external data source that s the same as the rowsource of the listbox

17579043
opera	firefox
in opera and firefox #send_reminder is populated with the data returned

17579043
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
whereas browsers like firefox and opera seem to continue with the ajax call google-chrome just cuts it off

17579072
octal	decimal
values it is prefixing 0x for octal 0 and for floating points it forces some decimal rules.

17579128
hide	show
with text toggling b w show hide

17579135
google-chrome	firefox
i have developed a webapp that functions in google-chrome firefox and newer ie

17579161
integer	unsigned
however since the op here has a method to check a signed 32-bit integer and not something much larger like an unsigned 64-bit integer then a quick check shows the truncated square root of int.maxvalue to be 46340

17579182
hide	show
i have my uitableviewcell set up so that you can swipe right to show actions then again swipe left to hide them

17579201
width	height
if width and height is sufficient for your purposes then you can use gc.textextent to measure any string s rectangular area with a particular font

17579264
width	height
i notice that your svg file specifies hard-coded height and width in the svg node itself

17579269
post	get
if i use a post i get a 405 method not allowed error

17579387
post	get

17579417
google-chrome	firefox
this works good in google-chrome and firefox

17579426
children	parent
if all the children in any given ul have the class .selected add the class .selected to the parent li so in this case the li containing the text one would be the only parent li to have the class .selected added

mocha	node.js
sails.js uses the mvc pattern for node.js and i was wondering if mocha could be hooked up for testing models

17579448
maven-javadoc-plugin	pom.xml
so i also include a configuration for the maven-javadoc-plugin directly in the section of the parent pom.xml

17579483
width	height
i get the number of links there are and then set the width and height of the canvas accordingly so there are 200 images per row

17579499
ienumerable	iqueryable
it was probably a deliberate decision rather than an oversight since an ienumerable iqueryable can always be converted to an using the cast method

17579511
tolower	toupper
i ve had to fix performance issues related to regular expression parsers tolower and toupper have never come back to bite me

17579552
overlay	z-order
depends somewhat on what the rest of your pages are like but an overlay control like that can usually just be put inside your main container on the page whether its a grid or canvas or whatever as the last element so it ll be top-most in z-order and then just set to be not visible collapsed until needed

17579555
hide	show
now when i click on the color labels for hide show the bars the click effect stops on the bar previously hidden

17579562
width	height
so you move past both the height and the width dimension

17579599
width	height
opengl uses the window coordinates from 0 width x 0 height where 0 0 is the bottom left corner of the bottom left pixel

17579611
min	max
in short could you tell me how to 1 add max min close functions to buttons i create 2 give my title bar the ability to drag the window and 3 the ability to resize from all sides and corners

17579659
width	height
my css has percentage for height and width properties.

17579679
width	height
as a standard the width and height of the fancybox changes in relative to the width and height of the images but i want to be 800 width and 600 height at all images

17579738
integer	unsigned
use the cereal or binary package decode into a 16 bit unsigned int word16 then convert that value to a full integer

17579802
spring-amqp	spring-rabbit
the spring-amqp sub-project is a general abstraction with spring-rabbit being the implementation for rabbitmq

17579805
exif	jfif
there are two common types of jpeg files jpeg jfif and jpeg exif

17579805
exif	jfif
both specs jfif and exif require that their corresponding header appears directly after the soi start of image marker

17579805
exif	jfif
in the case of jfif it is an app0 marker in the case of exif it is an app1 marker

17579805
exif	jfif
it is possible to have a jpeg jfif file with an exif block somewhere later in the file

17579805
exif	jfif
iphoto ends up converting it into a jpeg jfif file but retains the exif metadata somewhere later in the file

17579805
exif	jfif
therefore the exif block can happen at an arbitrary position in a jpeg jfif file

17579940
udp	tcp
as a side note in the title i said tcp udp because i am willing and considering for security purposes to change from udp connection to tcp

17579984

17580172
put	get
in that case i wouldn t put it in db seed as that might get run in production

17580188
innodb	myisam
innodb is a much more complex feature-rich engine than myisam in many respects

17580188
versioning	upgrade
your best bet may be to upgrade your versioning of mysql if you re behind

17580211
post	get
i m trying to get the id of the category on a category archive page of a custom post type

17580222
folder	directory
i m going to set up my nlog config to write to this new logs folder instead of the application directory so even when the application is run by non-administrators nlog has sufficient privileges to create the logs

17580231
post	get
get and post aren t two ways to pass data

17580275
hide	show
so the easies way is hide show but this means is not the most efficient

17580298
listadapter	convertview
the important thing to note is that the convertview is actually retrieved from the listadapter s recycle bin to try and reduce the number of allocations gcs as you are scrolling through the list

17580325
post	get
wp_get_ post _categories can only get post categories not a custom post s categories try this instead

joptionpane	jdialog
change your first jframe into a modal jdialog or joptionpane

17580357

17580373
implements	extends	nscoder	nsobject
ok i finally discovered the issue i was extends my class from the nsobject subclass which does not implements the nscoder protocol so i was encoding and decoding my object in the incorrect way

17580385
try-catch	exception-handling
checked exception-handling must be handled by the calling code using a try-catch block or your code must declare that it can throw the exception-handling by using a throws clause

17580398
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox try to figure it out for you you shouldn t rely on that

17580453
r2winbugs	r2jags
r2jags depends on another r package r2winbugs

17580475
google-chrome	safari
my code hangs google-chrome and safari for about 3sec

17580487
hide	show
and use ajaxstart and ajaxstop to hide and show it

17580490
winbugs	openbugs
openbugs an open-source version of winbugs

17580491
winbugs	openbugs
r2winbugs is an r package that interfaces with the winbugs and openbugs gibbs samplers

setinterval	settimeout
setinterval executes an expression every interval seconds settimeout is a one time execution after a given amount of time

17580501
ready	each
each time when some ajax call is ready you will increment the counter

17580507
qdialog	qwidget
if you really need qdialog not qwidget you need to derive gotocelldialog class from qdialog not qwidget

17580535
openni	kinect
the 32bit version gives less problems than the 64bits but i ended up installing and working the openni 1.5 and the kinect non-official drivers

position absolute doesn t respect anything except the next parent with position other than static

17580642
libs	buildpath
a you install e fx clipse and modify the projects buildpath to include the javafx-sdk libs

17580646
outputstream	inputstream
the important point is that transcoderinput and transcoderoutput can work with any inputstream and outputstream not just file streams

17580646
stdout	stderr
this version also doesn t write anything to stdout stderr unlike the high-level api

17580646
tiff	png
for jpeg png or tiff output replace org.apache.fop.svg.pdftranscoder with org.apache.batik.transcoder.image.jpegtranscoder pngtranscoder or tifftranscoder note that these raster formats are in a different package

17580695
put	get
you can certainly put them in variables but it s generally accepted that the way to get the values in thereâ whether they re database credentials api keys or other secret valuesâ is to read them in from configuration files which are located outside the document root where they will never be accidentally served

17580723
postgresql	mysql
in ruby using active record or the mysql or postgresql drivers gems or the sequel orm you ll get back integers

17580723
int	boolean
that said using int to represent boolean values which is what a checkbox represents on off is wrong but that is probably a legacy thing or maybe your as400 dbm doesn t support boolean

17580731
filtering	grouping
this grouping documents by their last_syls field with a count per grouping then filtering that result set to all results with a count greater than 10

17580973
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
i am looking to add functionality to a web application to enable users to write a string representing date time addition subtraction

17580981

i m not sure that if this is an efficient way to do this and it s important that i get it right because this could potentially be sifting through thousands of post

17580981
post	get
the start hours argument is for how many hours ago to get post

17581002
width	height
make sure you set a height and width of the 100 on the body html element like so

17581023
pygtk	pygobject	gtk	pygobject
pygtk is the legacy binding between python and gtk and pygobject is the preferred binding if you go down that road

17581036

one can set width height for the publisher div element via properties

17581036

17581166
width	height
you can set the subscriber div s height and width by passing an object with a width and height attribute to the session.subscribe function

17581166
width	height
you could also style it with css by using a parent container and setting the subscriber s width height to 100

17581188
width	height
scaletofit w h will scale an image proportionately based on the larger of the width height of the source image

17581188
width	height
whatever comes out measure the width and height and at least one will be one of the dimensions that you specified

17581204
width	height
the section.container has no width and height set so you get the element not going where you think it should

17581214
google-chrome	firefox
while running this code open it in google-chrome or firefox and open developer tools ctrl+i or f12 and see the debug console it will show if there are errors in the javascript

17581250
hide	show
in xcode i am trying to get a button that plays a click sound when pressed and hide and show objects

17581334
avr	microcontroller
this code will be run on an avr microcontroller so i can t have anything with a huge oop overhead but the particular microcontroller i m using does have a relatively large amount of program flash and work ram so it s not like i m trying to operate in 2kb but i do have to keep in mind limited resources

17581350
post	get
and to get worst it s impossible to deactivate while not using internet banking at least in chrome the only solution is remove the extension or clean the post content field and the excerpt field if it have tinymce activated

17581396
hide	show
if you sometimes show hide stuff it might get messy and complicated

17581407
folder	directory
i ve already redirected apache to check the c apachehtdoc folder as the source directory

17581407
folder	directory
i ve tried looking at folder permissions but i m not sure how to see the contents of the c apachehtdoc directory and the subfolders i m bound to create

17581457

it functions correctly in safari and google-chrome

17581546
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data lbog lbog is the name of the project

17581565

17581633
google-chrome	firefox
i haven t tested ie9+ but it works as intended in google-chrome and firefox

17581691
hide	show
i m trying to show only the divs that have a specific class and hide the ones that don t

17581691
hide	show
in this example i m trying to show the divs where class is panel_profile and hide the wood div

17581719
children	parent
though i would give up on slide and use an address without to get to the parent of all slides and then address the slides as children

17581770
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately if an error occurs in the idl routine execution a dialog box will pop-up and halt program execution until manually clicked

17581787
hide	show
edit you need to hide the ul inside the li and only show it when you hover it

17581806
nsstring	nsdata
since cfstringref is toll-bridged to nsstring and so is cfdataref to nsdata perhaps working entirely in core foundation might work

17581845
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this worked fine for firefox google-chrome and ie but with safari the height that the resizable method assigned to the ui_wrapper around the img was the height of the container for the canvas i.e the height of #canvascontainer

17581845
width	height
i finally decided that i couldn t trust any values that resizable assigned to ui_wrapper or to img so after the call i manually set ui_wrapper and img width and height to what i wanted

17581850
post	put
to be honest this is a terrible idea if your aim is to continuously post data this won t really solve your problem because then you ll just be leaking sockets server side unless you put the server side socket handling code in a while true loop which is likely another bad idea

17581852
tiff	png
but the image must be in a correct format jpg tiff png etc

17581872
serializable	deserialization
i have a simple xml annotated class that i want to use for serializable deserialization

17581911
powermockito	jmockit
two well-known contenders in this market are powermockito and jmockit

17581984
accessor	properties
if that s hopelessly inefficient for your use case you could make custom accessor mogenerator is a big help with this for your properties that collect on the editing thread flags for changes to all the properties you re interested in

17582028
google-chrome	firefox
javascript can adjust the widths of the columns but accessing to properties like offsetwidth causes a reflow which is a quite heavy task even for a browser like google-chrome or firefox and adds an annoying rendering lag with even not-so-large tables but with dynamic content

17582028
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
but it works fine in google-chrome safari and firefox

17582037
post	get
i tried all combinations sending them through get and post as well as calling script through get and post using restclient ff extension

17582143
button	checkbox
my procedure is when pressing the checkbox inside the accordion group it expands the body of that accordion group and show another button somewhere else

17582143
hide	show	button	checkbox
the problem is when pressing two checkbox the button show up and hide really fast

17582153
keydown	keyup
if you want to change the behavior of your specific text editor you will have to implement your own text editor that reacts exactly on keydown keyup events and handles the repeating internally through a timer

17582161
folder	dir
from the spread sheet i will be having it add folder dir and file that i need

17582162
width	height
the obvious issue with this is that you ll have to know the width height of your text in advance

17582186
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
other implementations jython ironpython don t have a gil but their approaches aren t practical for cpython and not easy for pypy either from what i hear and they can t exactly replace cpython as they lag behind a lot don t support c extensions are less portable to more exotic platforms etc

17582192
width	height
i know i could have achieved the similar functionality of placing image over input field using this way or this way by simply positioning tag over input box and then handling the required events but that way didn t seem too flexible with input fields of varying width and height or if the wrapping div doesn t have position relative

17582201
post	put
the best solution that s been offered so far is to track the hash changes locally and put post them to a service when the browser fires onbeforeunload

17582211
post	get
this version makes at most three db queries - one to get the category preferences for a logged in user one to get latest_post_datetime and one to get post with confidence of having at least one matching post

qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
i am trying to make qtableview qstandarditemmodel with arbitrary sized qicons

17582412
printf	strcpy
since buffer overflow insecurities became well-understood the drive to institute proper bounds checking has pushed many programmers away from traditional buffer- and string-manipulation functions like strcpy and printf at least in part because of the tendency of these functions to invite buffer overflow problems by making assumptions about the size of the target buffer

17582449
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

post	get	src	attr
however i cannot figure out how to get #pic attr src into a post variable

17582484
post	get
another issue i am seeing is that you are searching the post data but the url is sending get data

the first will check your get data while the second will check both the get and post starting with the post

17582491
children	parent
in a wordpress page i want to show children of the direct parent without wanting to specify the page

17582539
width	height
because i couldn t size the iframe s height to its content reliably i set the iframe height to the height of this viewport and set it to scroll its content vertically but i can t set the iframe s width to that of the viewport as then it triggers certain media queries in the content s css even though the html of that content is larger than that

17582549
post	get
the question seems answered but a post by romain guy seems relevant to get more info avoiding memory leaks

17582563
width	margin
and the second boxe a negative margin of its own width to pull first box in the middle

17582573
free	malloc
this restores the ability to have the philosophy that if a program s malloc just failed that program has a good chance of having been the actual cause of memory exhaustion and can then back away from the construction of the current object free ing memory along the way possibly grumbling at the user for having asked for something crazy that needed too much ram and awaiting the next request

17582573
realloc	malloc
so if you want to take the old-school physical model approach make sure your computer has it enabled or there s no point to testing your malloc and realloc calls

17582573
free	malloc
however there may be some interesting things one can do with glib in the physical memory model by emplacing your own memory handlers with g_mem_set_vtable since you might be able to poke around in program globals and reduce usage in a cache or the like to free up space then retry the underlying malloc

17582591
sequence	permutation
to check that one sequence is a permutation of another you expect the sequence with no last iterator to be at least as long as the first sequence

range	min
which shows a date range of a min 18 years old however the default calendar blocks out the days and months less than 18 years

17582899
inherited	properties
first of all i would like to say that as a personal preference and from a bit of experience i learned not to use inherited for code reuse or common properties but rather only to benefit from polymorphism so i would extract those common data properties into a new class and use a dictionary for the varying properties then use delegation composition to store the data for a certain sample

17582922
width	height	width	font-size
i m trying to replace a specific class-less word not the entire string with a form of the same height or font-size and width

since you said it s happening on network folder my first inclination is that the windows process that this app is running under doesn t have security access to read the directory info

17583099
maven	pom.xml
so i am not sure what i need to do to get around this issue when using a local repository and get maven to download dependencies directly i can download both the pom.xml and .jar files for the maven-settings-2.2.1 artifact

17583352
int	double
conceptually if you want the tuple to just contain the fields you should invoke as gsmcellparser cellid lac lat lon then the tuple passed to the eval func would have a schema of int int double double

17583394
ant	maven
then run v1testsuite by hand or use appropriate ways to have it run by an ant target or a maven execution test step

17583404
width	height
the height x width would depend on your image and you would tweak the top and right to fit your situation

17584424
int	double
for 2d etc arrays of int or double you usually do make the body of the array contiguous

17584465
integer	unsigned
what they may have been thinking of is integer arithmetic if it s possible that i1 + i2 will overflow but you know that i3 - i1 will not then could either wrap around if they re unsigned integers or trigger undefined behavior if they re signed integers or both if your system happens to perform wraparound for signed-integer overflow whereas will not have that problem

17584468
put	get
this lets you get the creation and initialization of ch done then after that part of the expression is complete put in the parentheses around the to override the precedence of assignment vs

17584631
jar	war
i had to make parent_last class loading at web module level and delete following jar files from war -

17584631

you can see from the traceback that we finally goes to return super myobjectproxy self .__getattribute__ attr that should not go to

17584852
post	get
when i load my footer view i get an csrf error this form post did not pass our security checks

17584895
post	get
if you can afford the changes just make the list or array a body parameter and then use post instead of get or like i suggested above one request for each item in eventactionitem array

17584896
width	height
simply set the div width and height to see it

17584910
profiling	instrumentation
i have built and installed a shared library to do some profiling of my projects via code instrumentation specifically with the -finstrument-functions switch of gcc

17584910

fast-forward	merge
fast-forward merge

17585009
fast-forward	merge
immediately after develop was fast-forward merge into release-1.3

17585009
fast-forward	merge
when possible git does a fast-forward merge by default a feature that does the wrong thing half the time which is why the graph looks confusing

17585009
fast-forward	merge
note that a fast-forward merge leaves no direct evidence in the resulting graph

17585009
fast-forward	merge
unlike a regular merge a fast-forward merge does not create a new commit object and no existing commit is modified

17585009
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward merge simply adjusts the branch reference to point to an existing commit

17585009
fast-forward	merge
even though there is no direct evidence of a fast-forward merge the fact that you can reach that one merge commit by following each branch s first-parent path strongly indicates that this was a result of a fast-forward merge

17585009
fast-forward	merge
anyway this mistake eventually resulted in something that looked just like a fast-forward merge even though git merge was never typed

17585022
min	max
so when expected number is 65532 i can accept 65532 + 10 so min 65532 and max 5

17585133
subtraction	addition
in gcc addition and subtraction operations are allowed on pointers of type void and pointers to functions

17585139
unsigned	short
the following solutions do not make that assumption neither do they assume message_number wraps around at unsigned short

17585195
subtraction	addition
if you use unsigned you get gf 2 k arithmetic for some value k edit addition and subtraction doing full finite field is much more work

17585195
unsigned	short
typically for unsigned short k is 16 for unsigned int it is 32 and for unsigned long long it is 64 but in any case it is at least 16 because uint_max is at least 65535

17585195
unsigned	short
if you wish to use unsigned short the one wrinkle in c is that unsigned short expands to signed plain int instead of unsigned int in the usual case when

17585195
unsigned	short
the rest of the code is unchanged note that assigning unsigned int back to unsigned short is well defined as it reduces the value mod 2 k

17585270
fadein	hide
the script with the afteradd function changes color of the cart normally but when i add the hide and fadein effects the add function continues to work however the hide fadein or add color effects don t work

and a function pointer is just a 32bit or 64bit unsigned integer which points to the specific location in memory that the function in question resides

17585342
implements	extends
okay so i am kind of confused about the uses of extends and implements

17585342
implements	extends
i have found work-arounds but they don t seem as effective and even if they work they still leave me confused as to what extends and implements are really for

17585342
implements	extends
1 what does extends do 2 how could i use extends in my program intuitively 3 what does implements do 4 how could i use implements in my program intuitively 5 what i should use in this scenario where i have many different objects towers doing nearly the same thing perhaps towerarcher towerbunker towersnipernest towerbarricade etc

17585348
freebsd	linux
i was wondering if there is a way we can cleanly remove only the tcp ip stack from freebsd codebase and linux codebase

17585722
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
you can use data binding approach for repeater or gridview or datalist

17585796

then instead of running the script from a mouse button you just assign the mouse button to perform the keyboard shortcut

17604027
single-quotes	double-quotes
bonus points if you also ensure it handles curly-quotes single-quotes and other special cases but feel free to go on the assumption of plain double-quotes if that makes it easier

17604030
pop-up	dialog
fb.login does a check for the login status of the user but it always will pop-up a login install dialog regardless of the status and if they re logged in installed it will hide the pop-up immediately

17604030
post	get
the fb.login method is also used if you need to request additional permissions from the user say you just get a vanilla install at first and then later the user says they want you to post to their feed

17604036
zipoutputstream	zipfile
to create a zipfile either use the old api with a zipfile zipoutputstream or use a zip filesystem of java 7

17604059
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
a tree of sortedlist or sorteddictionary collections would probably do what you re trying to do

17604072
width	height
so instead you can bind the width and height of the child control to the parent s actualwidth and actual height

17604072
width	height
i am hoping that layout doesn t run immediately when a width or height is changed but instead the system rechecks for size changes periodically

17604083
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome firefox and ie

backbone.js	javascriptmvc
i am learning javascriptmvc application development using backbone.js and having issues rendering model collection in the view

17604384
filtering	grouping
trying to apply the filtering to the grouping doesn t work either fiddle

17604407

you are filtering a single radio input which is checked not a radio grouping and nextuntill only selects the next siblings of the selected element that doesn t work with your current markup

17604421
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
and you can use mouseenter mouseleave this is actual hover instead of mouseover mouseout and use .stop to cleanup any previous animation from running on frequent hovers and simplify it to

17604474
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
unless you use the border-box box-sizing model padding is added to a span width

17604478
mouseover	mouseout	onclick	onfocus
i ve tried onclick instead of onfocus and it s identical i ve also tried forcing it to do things on mouseout or mouseover in order to brute force the problem but nothing seemed to work

17604518
maven	pom.xml
import to your ide as a maven project using the pom.xml descriptor in the root folder

17604566
google-chrome	firefox
not on google-chrome nor firefox

17604601
hex	binary
since binary content the #0 character in particular or the 0x00 hex value c c++ won t be displayable in a tmemo anyway the text would be terminated at the first #0 value you d need to replace it with something

17604677
intersect	contains
if you want to get only items that are completely visible use contains instead of intersect

17604701
salt	md5
md5 is portable as long as all involved parties input salt and pepper are the same

17604710
width	height
when you set a size for the tree you are setting a fixed size so that the tree has to conform to that width and height

17604722
width	height
it really depends on how it was done but as long as you are consistent with the conversion and have the correct height and width read maximum y and maximum x respectively it should not matter

17604744
google-chrome	safari
other option is to create a class and apply different css for google-chrome and for safari

17604784
for-loop	loops
there is no reason at all for you to either allocate or delete mybogusdbl inside the for-loop because arraysize never changes inside loops

17604790
google-chrome	firefox
for example an ios client would have to use the webrtc sdk and the google-chrome firefox web app would have to include the webrtc javascript library

17604829
int	double
in your converter you convert not string to int but double slider.value to object label.content which can be a string too

17604848
polymorphism	specialization
now polymorphism lambdas are different they define a type with a member function template operator so each time you call the closure s operator with different argument types you will instantiate another specialization of the function template but that has nothing to do with auto the use of auto is just syntax for declaring a template

17604883
textview	imageview
i want it so that if the value of the imagearray at that current position is empty or null a post without a picture then it instead sets the imageview visibility to gone and makes the textview take up the entire item

17604913
ienumerable	iqueryable
in simple words all operations on ienumerable causes simple iteratation over all elements well it s lazy ienumerable really slower than iqueryable

android-maven-plugin	proguard
no marketplace entries found to handle android-maven-plugin 3.1.1 proguard in eclipse

is there a way to have wrapper class be exposed as public but other class be private protected inside the wr

17605156

i find it hard to believe that there aren t instances of the atoi atof etc which take a length parameter but i can t find anything

17605248
subtract	add
one will add the form value to que product quantity other will subtract and another one will change to the value in the form

17605267
inherited	subclassing
i was going to suggest modifying afrestclient to inherited from afoauth1client but i found this pull request where matt states that afoauth1client is meant to be separate from your client subclassing

17605268
strtol	atoi
by the way you should consider using more robust solutions for parsing the number like strtol sscanf or the c++ streams - they all can report a parsing error in some way while atoi just returns 0 which isn t distinguishable from a 0 that comes from parsing the string

17605268
strtol	atoi
if you are sure that the garbage doesn t start with digits you can use atoi strtol istringstream as is - they automatically stop just when they see the garbage

17605273
folder	directory
template directory refers to the your theme folder inside of wp-content

17605276
mouseup	mousedown
i m using events like mousedown and mouseup to know when to move the window or not

17605276
move	drag
however sometimes when i try to move the window chrome hooks up on it and drag the content i don t know the right word to use here just imagine you re dragging an image from the browser to your desktop like the image below

17605302
mouse	keyboard
on desktop the user is expected to click the submit button next to the item they are affecting and this is generally what happens the button is close to where their mouse keyboard focus is and the visual association is strong

17605326
typedef	struct
you can also define a type such as typedef struct foo foo

17605326
typedef	struct
or typedef struct foo mytype

17605370
post	get
your curl command sends data in a post request whereas the ajax call uses the get method

17605370
post	get
according to the tt-rss api documentation older versions supported both get and post but now data must be encoded using json in http post data

17605410
free	malloc
but that requires the use of malloc and free

17605410
integer	unsigned
keep in mind that a pointer is nothing more than a 32 or 64bit unsigned integer which represents a location in memory you can put any number you want in a pointer just don t try to access the memory it points to

17605439
public	protected
by exposing protected class through public interface

17605440
width	height
normally i would just absolutely position the rest of of the elements in the content div but the absolutely positioned div contains an image slider which is responsive so the height of the div varies depending on width of the screen

17605461
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
which you can then call upon from any instance method via the automatically synthesized ivar _pph or via the properties s accessor

17605588

pop-up	dialog
i m trying to excel export from pop-up window jquery ui dialog .i have java class method with response type content-disposition attachment header.but its not downloading the excel sheet

17605631
cpu	processors
if the concern is that the values of mutable fields of the deserialized object not marked with volatile might be in the processors cache on one cpu and not flushed to main memory i actually can t answer that with authority but i would be very surprised if the guarantees were not the same as those of running a constructor

17605663
implements	extends
i have a small class that implements a dictionary that maps from the type of an interface to an implementation of that interface that extends from a base class

17605718
submit	submission
as for your question your code is a little unclear but what you probably should do is return false at the end of the submit event to prevent the form from submission and then in the ajax event if it s cleared for submission do a

17605733
getter	setter
instrument the bytecode on the fly when you load it using something like bcel and replace local field accesses with calls to dynamically generated getter and setter and do the above bookkeeping there

17605740
keystore	jks
since you ve imported the key from the pkcs#12 store into the jks store using the keystore s password that doesn t mean that the password of the key itself was changed and it s probably not keypwd jetty s default

17605748
persistent	transient
if you don t need to persistent the property annotate it with transient if you do need to persistent it then you need to properly annotate user with entity etc

17605749
stdout	stderr
i recently stumbled across fopen and the similar functions after researching how stdout stdin and stderr work alongside functions like printf

17605757
put	get
you should not need to do anything to get sessions working as we automatically put them into memcache by default

17605774
int	chars
string#hex doesn t give you the ascii index of a chars it s for transforming a base-16 number hex adecimal from a string to an int

pull	push
there is a pro version but the user guide downloadable pdf gives you the db schema plus rules on push pull syncing

17605988
width	height
after more debugging the hexbin functions they are not compatible with negative and or fractional domains- so i solved this by mapping my original data by linear scales up to the height and width of the hexagon plots

17605988
min	median	min	max	median	max
i also modified the hexbin binning function to handle three element arrays and can compute stats on the third element using color or size to show mean median stddev max min

17606036
typedef	struct
i am experimenting with struct pointers and typedef in the code below

17606063
children	parent
however rendering can cause your binding to update so if the process of rendering the parent panel would increase the width of the panel for example a parent panel placed inside of another panel that automatically stretches its children to take up 100 of the space like a grid or last element in a dockpanel then it will trigger an update on the binding and increase the width of the child during the render cycle

17606063

i would like to create a function with jquery javascript that would fill a parent div with children divs of random sizes that add up the size of the parent

17606167

in order to check each row column and subsquare i suggest having extractor methods that get the nth row column and subsquare from your matrix ie don t try and put it all in one method

17606173

websphere	ibm
there s the free tomcat j2ee server or ibm websphere if you need to massively distribute an application

uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller
i am trying to set the color of the uinavigationbar on a uitabbarcontroller

17606325
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
but my variation on the matter is that the uitabbarcontroller is not the rootviewcontroller but another uinavigationcontroller so this doesn t work for me like i want to

17606329
int	chars
third the argument of malloc should be sizeof chars len not sizeof len since the latter equals sizeof int

17606351
hash	md5
you could try using hash md5 sha1 etc

17606376
getter	setter
you can have a class with getter and setter of the 2 numbers integers

17606383
width	height
remember i am trying to create a scrollable form that resizes its width but not its height so the user only has to scroll up and down to access fields

17606383
width	height
now add all the labels and text fields are required to the contentview and make sure you add vertical constraints from top to bottom and left to right so that autolayout can figure out the width and height in order to calculate the scrollview.contentsize

17606486
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush the stdout

17606510
queue	fifo
regardless i think you can put all the initial images in a fifo queue and throw at it as many processors threads or machines or nodes that you can afford

17606533
stdout	fflush
if you are sending the output to stdout then a call to fflush will work

17606586
superclass	subclassing
let s say i have and and i took a pointer to an instance of the subclassing and addressed that pointer to a superclass pointer

17606588
hide	show
to hide and show the tr

17606621

17606629
post	put
this is the exact code that i put into the post on my site

17606675
post	get
this task is going to be a lot of interfacing with the wechat api in order to do get requests and post requests to their server

17606675
post	get
in this case you would have to store their token and user information as a cookie or local variable and use it to post and get messages from that user

17606675
post	get
once you have all of the necessary tokens to get permission to post and get messages for a user then it comes down to doing calls for them from your rails application

17606675
post	get
instead you can use a gem like faraday to easily make api calls to get and post via url

17606680
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and internet explorer but in firefox as soon as i load the target page into the iframe it takes over the whole window

glut	sdl
i know how to do that using sdl or glut

17606841
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
finally as it stands right now most of the conversions will fail -- you ve used the default private inherited which prevents the implicit conversion from to that you d normally expect to see happen you probably want class subclassing public superclass

17606845
getter	setter
you can actually define setter and getter in javascript and not just mimick them

17606871
hide	show
how can i make this function intelligent to know which div content is supposed to hide or show

17606910
serializable	deserialization
it s a great json serializable deserialization library with huge community support and one of the best options performance-wise even asp.net webapi is using it as its default serializable

uidatepicker	uiswitch
recently i updated my xcode 4.6.3 to xcode5 dp2.everything was working fine in xcode 4.6.3.i mean inside a viewcontroller there is a uiswitch and uidatepicker and two buttons set and clear

17607204
uidatepicker	uiswitch
when i select a particular time from uidatepicker and change the uiswitch state to on and by clicking the set button an alarm is set for the selected time

17607204

and if i change the uiswitch state to off uidatepicker will show the current time otherwise the selected time.this was working fine in xcode 4.6.3

17607204
uidatepicker	uiswitch
but after updating to xcode5 dp2 everytime i toggle the uiswitch state uidatepicker is returning back to the current time i mean even if i select a time other than the current time in uidatepicker and toggle uiswitch to on state uidatepicker returns back to current time.i dont know what is going on here.is there any problem with xcode5 dp2..please help me

17607297
jobs	cron
similarly i want to have more files in that directory for each separate cron jobs

17607317
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
trying to match these names seems difficult as matching is case-insensitive due to the file system format of the sd card and android linux based is of course case-sensitive so any matching done will return true but writing read will fail because the actual folder name is wrong

17607345
folder	directory
where _mylibrariesdir is the directory that your libraries photos documents etc folder are located

17607345
folder	directory
this differs from a shortcut in that shortcuts do not act as directory so if you just had a shortcut to the avd folder you could not go to c users yourusername .android avd as it would produce a file not found error and if you tried to click on an avd shortcut file it would take you to d _mylibrariesdir .android avd instead of keeping you on the c drive

17607361
folder	directory
change directory to documents terminal would show me what folder i am in

17607363
getter	setter
so the above essentially constructs an object and defines a getter and setter on it

17607387
width	height
w3c standards state that margins that are defined using percentages should be calculated with respect to the width of the containing block not the height

17607387
width	margin
however i d suggest using some js to target safari get the width of the container and apply a margin as a percentage of that width

17607397
onclick	onchange
you need to use onchange event for select instead of onclick for each of your options like

17607562
pop-up	dialog
i hate this dialog to pop-up and want to disable it

17607574
rss	feed
another alternative is to write an rss reader but i m not sure if it s possible to fetch rss feed per user

17607605
getter	setter
will fail to get access to your model fields so you just need to add getter and setter for your id username password and email fields

17607805
folder	directory
go to your .gradle installation directory .gradle usually on your home or user folder

there is no implicit conversion from int to double in scala

17609093
int	double
in case of testtupletype testtuple error contains all information string int is not a string double

keydown	keyup
indirectly related to what you re asking i d suggest also moving the cleartimeout into the keyup handler just before settimeout and removing the keydown handler something like this otherwise you may find you have two or more timeouts set at once because to type an uppercase letter the sequence is 1 shift down 2 letter down 3 letter up 4 shift up

17630049
keydown	keyup
also even without using the shift key when typing quickly i often find i haven t quite released a key before typing the next letter so i get more than one keydown event in a row before the corresponding keyup events - this has no noticeable bad effect in normal circumstances but is noticeable when there s code responding to both the down and up events

i want to get width and height of images from server side call if possible

one way of storing tree is to store each node as a document with references to its children parent ancestors as mentioned here

17630378

17630400
allocator	stl
by default the standard stl allocator is used that gets its memory from the heap

17630400

17638742
margin	height
i have a feeling that the solution will most likely be involving jquery to determine the height of the wrapper layer in pixels and applying the negative margin to the internal layer on the fly using position rel

17638757
width	height
but here is the point you cant use paddings with height or width

17638802

now depending where you want to create this folder if it s in your app folder where your user has permissions to read write search chmod 755 and chown to set the owner of the folder better use chown -r to apply this to all subfolders after this you ll be able to create that folder with

17638992
sudo	passwd
normally this is running in a background and you won t be there to write the passwd so you ll have to add your command to not require passwd while running sudo with nopasswd directive you can do that

17639015
rss	feed
i handled that by using an rss feed class simplepie to fetch the tweets from twitter twitter provides rss urls for each member

17639015
rss	feed
for instance if you have ten people accessing the page at the same time it doesn t make sense to overload twitter with ten rss feed requests at the same time

17639015
rss	feed
i just found that as off last month i believe it was june 12 2013 twitter closed down the rss feed api so that option is not longer available

17639173
partcover	fxcop	gendarme	partcover	gendarme	fxcop
sonarqube uses gallio gendarme fxcop stylecop ndepths and partcover to get your metrics and all this is pretty straight forward since sonarqube do this automatically without much configuration

17639173
post	get
i post som pictures for u too get a feeling for it

17639194
tablet	galaxy
so for example a galaxy note 1 calling a gs3 experiences more delay than a galaxy note 1 calling nexus 7 tablet asus and galaxy note 1 calling a xiaomi mi-2 phone

17639208
multiplying	modulo
so instead of integer modulo you can get two floats then multiplying one float with inverse of the divider

17639285
fadein	fadeout
what i want to do is to have a nice fadein and fadeout function on these items

17639285
fadein	fadeout
applied to each li element i have a fadein function working on the fiddle but not the fadeout

17639306
fadein	fadeout
the second round they are hidden cause of the previous fadeout so the fadein does work this time

17639318
robocopy	xcopy
my first reaction was to suggest that you use robocopy since xcopy is depracated

17639354
min	max
missing values std dev min and max

17639374
equals	gethashcode
note your product class overrides equals without overriding gethashcode

17639393
post	get
i would normally assume the page is a value passed through a post or get if so this is open to manipulation.

17639397

but the width and height properties are hard-coded

17639412
automake	autotools
using autotools autoconf automake

those are not huge upgrade for normal versioning this is x.0.z x.1.z x.2.z at best

17639530
width	height
works when i create bitmap with 1 pixel width and 1 pixel height

17639543
strdup	malloc	strdup	calloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	strdup
that s not exactly right although declaring it static would fix the problem so would allocating it in the dynamic memory malloc calloc realloc strdup etc

17639547
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn
i ve used rcs cvs svn and git along the way any of them will do the trick for you

17639548
min	max
min and max and generates n random 2d intervals whose width and

17639548
min	max
height are uniformly distributed between min and max in the unit

17639553
padding	overlapping
i tried set padding 1.2 - 1.3em for right and left side it do set some spacing but in the middle of ebook i see it starts overlapping on the right edge of the pages so the edges of pictures and text are clipped

17639558
width	height
this array must be at least as large as width height

17639566
ienumerable	icollection
i was looking at the .net generic collections like icollection ienumerable to see any that can support bidirectional navigation with methods like movenext moveprevious

17639578
int	chars
i notice that chars array is a int but i could not figure out how i should have passed the chars index

17639627
put	get
and if i put the semicolon then the php runs as usual and get the output 1asdf

17639650
integer	unsigned
the former contains unsigned integer elements

17639702
int	double
we could therefore iterate over every point if the coordinate system is based on int and not double and check this condition

17639791
int	double
the fillrect and drawrect methods take int arguments not double

17639803
width	height
this basically means that they are treated like characters but can have width and height

17639830
versioning	upgrade
bitnami does have a recommendation regarding how to upgrade to current rubyinstaller versioning which is a relief

17639847
width	height

17639847
width	height
to make things worse at the time the view is being displayed i only have url s for the images so i have no idea about width height of the images

17639855
int	double
if cls is of type double or int the correct case is matched but of type string or the case _ is matched println nothing

17639902
for-loop	arrays
after the for-loop add null character at the end of arrays 0 that may help

17639905
directwrite	direct2d
then there is also directwrite which is supposed to be used together with direct2d

17639905
gdi	direct2d
that should be faster as direct2d offloads a lot work to graphics card while gdi eats mainly cpu and system memory

17639912
equals	gethashcode
you must be careful however since calling virtual methods defined on system.object like equals or gethashcode will cause i to be boxed since virtual method dispatch requires a method table pointer although the jit may be able to do the dispatch statically in some cases

17639912
equals	gethashcode
usually you can avoid calling equals or gethashcode directly by constraining t further to implement and using an for comparisons

17639950
debian	linux
i know that all of the clients will be using python 2.7.3 on debian linux v7

17640011

17640068
trie	tree
trie tree are a way of storing multiple words in a single tree the root is the null string and each edge adds a character

17640163
int	double
however even then your routine does not expect values of type class it expects plain values of type string or int or double .

17640195
int	double
also instead of int in the sample code it could be float or double as well

17640201
alloca	malloc
we could have used alloca or c99 s vla feature to avoid the need for the malloc call but for illustration purposes this works

17640206
width	height
i don t even understand why it needs such a weird width restriction and why it needs the parameters of the width and height if it already has the bitmap.

17640233
fadein	fadeout
i think this issue might have to do with the fadein and fadeout being done async

17640262
hash	salt
looks like it s not doing things how i expected a base64-encoded hash with random salt i think

17640323
put	get
method should be used with http verb i.e get put and so on

17640351

only tested in safari and google-chrome same result for both

17640513
width	height
problem is the path shape does not offer width or height

17640548

this works well but the description property doesn t smell right to me as it has overridden the base nsobject description getter + nsstring description

17640569
nginx	lighttpd
lighttpd or maybe nginx

17640598

google-chrome	firefox
i don t need to support legacy browsers not even internet explorer 9 if is works on google-chrome and or firefox is enough for me

17640714
for-loop	loops
you could loops while then add a special check for after or you could use a for-loop which increments i and then does i-- at the end

17640790
google-chrome	safari
i see that it takes about 22ms on google-chrome and about 600ms on ipad safari .

17640800

this is max number +9999 999999999 min number -9999 999999999 this is 4 for the integer part and 10 digits for the decimal part

17640921
inherited	properties
by creating a properties whose getter is the same as the signature of an inherited method you are overriding it

17640921
inherited	properties
as best practice for kvc and kvo purposes it is a good idea to avoid potentially clashing with common inherited methods properties and ivars

17640936
min	max
i know how to use the aggregate transforamtion group by customerid and use the appropriate min max functions to get the requested values

17640938

because of it is not right to call printf or std ostream opeartor std cout in signal handler

17640993
for-loop	loops
update concerning the two-variable for-loop approach in your question and the other two answers note that since both those variables will take on exactly the same values in each iteration of loops you can just as well use just one variable

17641098
rss	feed
i m on a little rss feed reader and i d like to load to each article the first image to set that as main image

17641243
pop-up	dialog
but to avoid pop-up showing off screen jquery mobile also enforces a padding between pop-up dialog and the edge of the screen and by default those padding margins are 30 vertical and 15 horizontal

17641243
width	height
to position popup to exact x and y you want you will need to add half of popup s width to the desired x and half of popup s height to desired y

17641256
innodb	myisam
select count without where is bad query for innodb as it does not cache the row count like myisam do

17641256
innodb	myisam
after you remove this specific type of query you can talk about innodb vs myisam read performance

17641256
innodb	myisam
innodb and myisam are very different in how they store data

17641256
innodb	myisam
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam

17641301
actionlistener	documentlistener
from my searches i ve gathered it would probably involve either a documentlistener or an actionlistener or both

17641419

google-chrome v28.x mozilla firefox v22.x current versions as of this writing internet explorer 10

17641466
public	protected
i also used the read command with option flag to verify wether the blocks were protected and as said the nxp tag reader app they are all public

17641516
opera	google-chrome
code logic it finds opera first in the loop but then meets google-chrome which also matches

17641516
opera	google-chrome
in your case this code would find opera first matching opr and ignore google-chrome afterwards even though opera matches with google-chrome

17641516
opera	google-chrome
the problem with that code is that this time google-chrome will be the problem it will be detected as opera

17641528

lodash	underscore.js
so i was checking out underscore.js and i stumbled into lodash

17641708
width	height
you compute the perimeter and area from the width and height rather than keeping them as fields

17641728
prepare	execute
you can prepare a statement and then execute it

17641749
for-loop	loops
after each loops of the for-loop executes nothing will have a strong reference to the thingviewcontroller

17641758

17641775
principalcontext	directoryentry
i don t understand why you are mixing the new principalcontext with the old directoryentry stuff

17641775
userprincipal	directoryentry	principalcontext	directoryentry	principalcontext	userprincipal
if you re using the new principalcontext - then use the userprincipal - it contains nice and easy to use properties about the user - much easier to use and work with than the old directoryentry stuf..

17641803
pop-up	dialog
i would like to define this pop-up dialog and reuse it for all pages

17641849
put	get
i would like to get all the elements of a certain class and add sequential ids to them and also put them in an array

17641880
accessor	properties
the get and set portions of a properties or indexer are called accessor

17641880
accessor	properties
by default these accessor have the same visibility or access level that of the properties or indexer to which they belong

17641893
superclass	subclassing
using single_table default on the abstract superclass and joined on subclassing works for me

17641898
put	get
if i put it in test mode it should always work but i still get the following error and on subsequent refreshes during this session

17641906
fadein	fadeout
so if say they have the maximum item to display at the time is 3 what i really want is to let them fadein using jquery one by one and when it reaches the max_item i want that to have a delay of say 1500 millseconds using settimeout or something similar to display that for a bit then the three of the items will be fadeout and starting the next three items and so on as an infinite loop

17641906
fadein	fadeout
the above code will fadein through all the items in the list but not infinite and what i want now here is the same as the above where i want to only display 3 items then fadeout and show the next 3

17641912
getter	setter	accessor	properties
the rule is that if the properties has both a getter and a setter get accessor and set accessor then an extra access modifier is allowed on only one of these accessor and the accessibility of the accessor in question most be more restricted than the accessibility of the entire properties

17641912
getter	setter
in the example the getter is still public like the entire property while the setter has a more restricted access here private

17641914
width	height
it works by assigning the window width and height of the device viewport to a data attribute for future checking

17641914
width	height
since phones don t resize width when pulling up the keyboard only the height checking the ratio and the width against the original width can tell you if the keyboard is up

17641933
getter	setter
in this example the interface has specified a getter but not a setter

17641967

if you don t care about the performance issues you can get away with using the non-cached versioning until you upgrade to rails 4 or rails 3.2.16 because those versioning introduce breaking changes that force you to use the asset pipeline and its corresponding syntax

17645837
versioning	upgrade
sqlalchemy 0.7.10 cannot upgrade due to using geoalchemy but am interested if newer versioning would make this easier

if you upgrade to a new versioning of rails rails 4 and rails 3.2.16 come to mind and you suddenly start to see this error it is likely that your stylesheet is pointing to the non-fingerprinted non-cached versioning of the files

17646320
post	get

17646564
spaces	delimiter
splits the line on some delimiter such as or spaces such as flds line.split

17646564
int	double
using strings is a little slower over the wire than sending binary data but the protocol is much easier to debug in my experience because you don t have to worry about differences in sizes byte ordering of binary types int long short float double across different platforms

17647062
free	malloc
most malloc implementations maintain what is called a free list a list of which blocks are still available to be allocated

17647062
free	malloc
to allocate a new object malloc must scan the free list looking for an empty space that s big enough

17647062
free	malloc
you correctly observe that a true gc has to operate beneath the level of malloc and free

17647062
free	malloc
as a side note it s worth learning about how malloc and free are implemented -- they aren t magic either

17647300
width	height
this also assumes that you want your max height width to be your limiting factors

for-loop	arrays
it made me wonder if it is faster to use a double for-loop with excluded id s in an arrays

17648465
for-loop	loops
the fundamental difference in most programming languages is that unless the unexpected happens a for-loop will always repeat n times then finish with a while loops it may repeat 0 times 1 more or even forever depending on a given condition which is always true at the start of each loops and always false on exiting loops for completeness a do .

i ve seen some apis especially in scripting languages we use perl and js in our team that use combined getter and setter methods

17651297
getter	setter

maven	pom.xml
an alternative is to not actually get the root pom.xml from the company maven repo initially but instead install it directly into your local repo from git

im using the uigesturerecognizer to transform a view and its workin perfectly but now i want to use it to transform my view width and height independently

17657553
width	height
the only way that comes to my mind to solve this is getting the two finger positions and make an if clause to recognize if the user is trying to increase width or height but for this i need to get each finger position involved in the pinch gesture

17657583

17657719
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
essentially the rootviewcontroller of the current uiwindow should be the only uiviewcontroller with a visible view

17657719
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
if more than one uiviewcontroller hangs off the applicationâ s uiwindow only one of these will get the messages for changes in orientation

17657719
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
nested uiviewcontrollers are not guaranteed or likely to receive messages for changes in orientation or lifecycle messages such as viewdidappear viewwillappear viewdiddisappear and viewwilldisappear even though they inherit from uiviewcontroller

17657719
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller

17657798
ubuntu	linux
as a side remark if you want to keep up-to-date with the r versions from cran and not relying on the native r of your linux distro ubuntu then add the following line in your apt sources

17657871
width	height
you just need to configure the bitmapfactory.options variable by setting the output width and height based on the screen size

17657876
switching	screens
since you re replacing the whole screens s content just switching the uiwindow rootviewcontroller makes the most sense edit alternately many devs would just use a navigation controller to present the second view because it s simple and convenient

17657892
udp	tcp
i am trying to implement data transfer between a back-end server and the android device which is a request from device to server for information and the server responds udp use because it is faster and the functionality of tcp isn t needed i guess...

17657928
width	height
determine the device width and height and scale it

17657951
versioning	upgrade
if amazon changes the queue url in a breaking way it will not be immediate and will be deprecated slowly and will take effect moving up a versioning when you upgrade your sdk

17657966

cloudant	couchdb
cloudant s replication is 100 compatible with couchdb

if i don t add n or fflush stdout i am not getting stdout as output

17657996
stdout	fflush
when will i get all buffered stdout s as output if i don t add n or fflush stdout

17658023
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor so the overriding method in the subclassing will be invoked before the subclassing constructor has run

17658043
stdout	fflush
indeed a new line or a fflush because by default stdout is line buffered when it refers a terminal device

17658071
filtering	grouping
in each grouping i have put a filtering to filtering by the filtering grouping 1 filtering results with a filtering of 1 etc

17658071
put	get	filtering	grouping
i know the data is there because if i put a filtering on the whole table for 3 and just let the filtering at the grouping level work i get

17658071
filtering	grouping
if i do a total though without a grouping filtering but with the table filtering it brings back 8.0

17658071
filtering	grouping
the adjacent grouping however are not filtering results separately

stdout	fflush
the best practice is for you to manually fflush the stream stdout once you have fed it all of the text you want printed

17658368
udp	tcp
why tcp connection is possible web socket but not udp

17658371

17658380
mouseup	mousedown
what i did was first i fire a mousedown click and then the mouseup event on the specific element

17658383
maven	m2e

17658398
google-chrome	firefox
you can get access to udp using webrtc which is available in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox

17658505

17658523
width	height
fixed width but height according to the content

17658530
min	max	range	max	range	min
then the appropriate way to use a kd-tree or better yet a range tree imo is to store the min and max x and y coordinates for the rectangle as a 4-dimensional point and build a tree for the 4-dimensional points

17658546
disk	ram
on my development machine i have a slow system disk ssd and a fast ram disk development disk

17658621
put	get
you could hard-code information about those certificates into your code or better yet put it in a config file so you could change it without altering any code and do something like comparing certificate fingerprints to get an appropriate degree of assurance that it is actually the legitimate certificate

17658682
g++	gcc
to clarify based on the edit in the question the problem appears to be usage of c++11 features which is presumably default in visual studio where the gcc g++ will take a more reserved approach

17658693
put	get
in order to solve this problem i think you would either have to delete singletop to make it create another activity every time action_search is done and put handleintent intent method call in oncreate or override onsearchrequested s startsearch ... ... ... ... method to get the intent and set the intent flag

17658699
postorder	inorder
when to use pre-order inorder and postorder traversal strategy

17658699
postorder	inorder
before you can understand under what circumstances to use pre-order inorder and postorder for a binary tree you have to understand exactly how each traversal strategy works

i ve red every post on the if else elif statements in python but still can t get why

i want to subscribe an inherited base method to an event in base class then be able to call the constructor in a subclassing and get the subclassing event method to get called instead of the base classes when that event is fired

17658971
boost	stl
of course unless this is a learning exercise you d usually just use std unordered_map or the boost tr1 or stl equivalents if you can t use a c++11 library

17658988
post	get
it seems that you fail to understand how http in general works get post redirect etc

17658988
post	get
even if you managed to get those desired parameters in the original post request by js ajax then the enduser would still get a browser-builtin security dialogue asking for confirmation to re-send the submitted data to a different domain

17659000
inherited	properties
i managed to share a build script via the properties sheets by writing it as a macro in the inherited properties sheet

17659003
rss	feed
thing is my items are links to rss feed and in the controller i want to parse through these rss feed and set up the model data for the view to handle

17659003
rss	feed
now there are some more modifications to the modelling to be done i need to model the actual rss feed content but my first problem is that the data fetched by the service is not modifiable in my controller since the call hasn t finished at the time i try to access it i guess

17659178
serializable	deserialization
your example is simple enough to parse manually using the dom or sax api but i d still suggest using an xml serializable api such as jaxb xstream or simple instead because writing your own xml serializable deserialization code is a drag

17659407
google-chrome	firefox
the other thing to note is the webrtc data channels can be configured for different reliability modes with the reliable mode being implemented with sctp firefox and google-chrome

17659407
google-chrome	firefox
when testing the data channels i would recommend using firefox since the webrtc work was split such that google-chrome initially focused on peerconnection and firefox on datachannel so firefox is still ahead in their implementation of the datachannel

your xml might be simple enough to parse manually using the dom or sax api but i d still suggest using an xml serializable api such as jaxb xstream or simple instead because writing your own xml serializable deserialization code is a drag

entity-relationship	diagram
here are crow s-feet notation entity-relationship diagram of the current and proposed schemas

17659763
put	get
i was thinking of having the equation be some kind of array which would include arithmetic enumerations between property names which could then be serialized if we want but the whole thing is still very much a work in progress and i wanted to put all this out there early on to see if i could get some opinions

17659826
children	parent
this parent element have many children in which we would like to define a default value

17659846
width	margin
i have a main div width 960px which is centered in the browser window with margin 0px auto

17659849
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a more advanced method would be creating a uinavigationbar item in your storyboard with an associated iboutlet setting an outlet to that item set all the properties from with in the storyboard like the background image then with in the viewdidload method set the iboutlet of the uinavigationbar to the uinavigationbar of the uinavigationcontroller of the uiviewcontroller that you are loading

17659852
udp	tcp
those information must be complete and reliable so http is based on tcp not udp

17659883
width	height
in view c the foreground view that is above the uiscrollview make the width and height both 0 so that the view is no longer technically on top of the scrollview and set clipstobounds no so that the contents of view c still show up on top of the scrollview

17659901
pop-up	dialog
i m having a problem where the url hash # ui-state dialog doesn t always get removed from the url after the pop-up closes

17659901
pop-up	dialog
i m almost 100 sure the hash is the problem because i tried visiting my page with the # ui-state dialog hash manually put in and then when i open and close the pop-up the page refreshes the first time that i open close it

17659911
put	get
i am trying to build an configuration parser for my application i installed apc today but everytime i try to put an serialized object in the store it does not get in there and does not

17659920
width	height
let s say w and h are width and height of the triangle

17659922
width	height
in the overlayview the view on top of uiscrollview make the width and height both 0 so that the view is no longer technically on top of the scrollview and set clipstobounds no so that the contents of the overlayview still show up on top of the scrollview

17659936
min	max
specifically play around with the xaxis settings in the basic tab type scale min max etcetera

17659943
bufferedreader	filewriter
im still new in java and can t fully understand how bufferedreader and filewriter really work so some of this were uploaded.this code must delete a line that the user wants to but instead of a line..it deletes the whole file content

17659953
width	height
in the uiview on top of the uiscrollview make the width and height both 0 so that the view is no longer technically on top of the uiscrollview and set clipstobounds no so that the contents of the view still show up on top of the uiscrollview

17659956
stdout	stderr
open3 only takes stdin stdout and stderr

17659975
width	height
in the transparent uiview let s call it overlayview make the width and height both 0 so that the view is no longer technically on top of the uiscrollview and set clipstobounds no so that the contents of overlayview still show up on top of the uiscrollview

17660021
int	chars
it appears that your system uses signed chars s and 32-bit int s

17660041
stdout	stderr
to send both stdout output and stderr output to dev null put the following at the end of your command

17660071
min	max
for example the rectangular regions between x1 x2 min y max y .

17660071
min	max
so i would like to cover x 0.5 to x 1 min y to max y with some color that corresponds to z 1 and between x 1 x 1.5 z 2 and so on

17660075
for-loop	arrays
at the conclusion of this last for-loop the arrays result contains integers that correspond to the number of days hours minutes seconds and millis derived from your date subtraction

17660076
portrait	landscape
yes the problem occurs when using screen landscape only because the screen changes to portrait internally

17660098
int	chars
the addition will only add the integer-encoded values of the ascii chars and result in an int

17660114
int	double
so it is perfectly permissible to have an int variable named real and a double precision variable named enddo

17660119
opera	firefox
i have a self-signed java applet which communicates successfully with a trial web server on my local net using build 1.7.0_21-b11 and firefox or opera running on a windows xp 32 bit virtual machine

17660122
width	height
here s the latests jsfiddle it should work like you want what you have to do is set a height and width to center vertically then put 50 for the top property and then for the margin-top property put the negative half of the height of the div you want to center

17660175
std	ostream
you can use std ostream s stream insertion operator to print individually however

17660198
put	get
i am unsure how to initialize the widgets multiselect numeric and fileupload because if i put the javascript initialization in the template i get errors

17660203
post	get
however this code sends a post and a get request

17660207
width	height
the tablayoutpanel is wrapped by a resizepanel with a given width height

17660207
width	height
if i do not specify the width height my tablayoutpanel does not appear at all

17660215
pull	push
we push it left 50 of the screen and then pull it back to the right 50 of that

17660261
folder	directory
the problem of course is how to have project level defines while have shared source code files shared files are in their own directory outside of the project folder

17660265
multiplying	add
then multiplying the year part by 12 months and add the months part

17660339
for-loop	loops
i don t know that this will fix your problem but you could try changing your for-loop to a for each loops so that you have a reference to the current object rather than accessing it by index

17660344
width	height
i ll try this but it doesn t works when the tab height width is greather than the image tab height width the image doesn t resize me

17660391
clang	llvm
the linker will take the value what is already in the section and add it to the value of the symbol by which is meant its address in the symbol table referenced by the value property of the relocation in our case we added 2 so clang llvm hardcoded a 2 in the section

17660436
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
sorry for this pretty simple question i have a master page with a menu located at left and an updatepanel inside a contentplaceholder located at right

17660473
clearinterval	settimeout
you have to pass the return value of settimeout to clearinterval not your functions

17660518
portrait	landscape
i m trying to target several devices and tell portrait and landscape apart the media queries i use are

17660522
surveymonkey	box
i m trying to preload this surveymonkey form with a preload gif while the form loads in my jquery dialog box

17660572
hide	show
another solution would be to show hide your animation before and after each ajax request via a ko.observable boolean but if you are doing a lot of different ajax requests from different models it will become a mess

17660625
ember.js	backbone.js
i personally am not a big fan of iframe s and would recommend that if you are truly looking for a load in place type solution that you research a more client-side solution than asp.net webforms using updatepanels such as jquery ajax templating knockoutjs backbone.js angularjs or ember.js

17660629
inherited	subclassing
in fact having sem2 as a subclassing of sem1 breaks the general guidelines for inherited since sem2 is not a sem1 there is no is a relationship

17660642
for-loop	arrays
a collection is basically an arrays of results so you would have to iterate over it with a for-loop or something

17660663
post	get
this file will receive via post or get

17660720
addeventlistener	onmouseup
everyone i know uses addeventlistener and i m the only one using onmouseup

google-chrome	firefox
i want to have a php code where i could filter 3 different browsers firefox google-chrome ie

17660748
google-chrome	firefox
i want it so that if its firefox and google-chrome it doesnt load an iframe on the website

17660758
implements	extends
don t extends jframe have a reference instead composition over inheritance and don t implements in top classes actionlistener instead use anonymous class or inner classes

17660794
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome all works well but in firefox the cache will not overwrite even if the files are modified

17660819
gitx	repo
gitx seems to indicate that the current position of master has no history as if all the files in the repo were added in that one most recent commit

17660841
min	max
your error is in max and min definition that need to be javascript date

17660850
children	parent
to get all parent and children from database i have these methods

17660850
children	parent
for render all categories with parent and children i have this

17660850
hide	show
if is selected some category is his subcategories show and another categories hide

17660858
put	get
when i put this into a module i get the error

17660866
constexpr	inline-functions
the interface for the client is more obvious --- an inline-functions won t silently become constexpr -required because it happened to work and someone used that way

17660907
folder	directory
in iis the default folder is c inetpub wwwroot if not maybe your server has a virtual directory pointing to another filesystem path

17660923
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you need to update your mime files of your web server nginx lighttpd or apache

17660930
onchange	onkeyup
so far i have tried onchange onkeyup and onkeypress but none of them appear to work

17660961
google-chrome	firefox
note this works perfectly fine on firefox google-chrome the only issue is using mobile browser iphone android

17660967
google-chrome	firefox
i just added two things both in google-chrome and firefox and it was working well

17660990
addeventlistener	onmouseup
this is because the onmouseup inline method is merely a shortcut to addeventlistener

17661037
setinterval	settimeout
if needed you can use settimeout and setinterval to check the variable again later or just wait for the callback function to run and handle it from there

17661045
wavefront	fbx
i use jmonkeyengine in my program and it does not support fbx file so i export fbx to wavefront obj file the 3d studio max also gives me the corresponding mtl file as well

17661047
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

17661174
build.gradle	gradlew
first i needed to modifying my build.gradle file to indicate that the correct gradlew plugin to use with my project was version 0.5.0 rather than 0.4

17661203
stdout	stderr
this will exec your python file and output stderr to stdout

17661222
calendar	gcal
it s in the gcal.js addon for hooking fullcalender up to google calendar over the gcal 1.0 api

17661319
put	get
when i put it in xml folder eclipse freeze get stuck

17661334
hide	show
or add a subview to the uicollectionviewcell to contain your content then hide show this subview as needed

17661338
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

17661366
trie	tree
the thought in my approach was to increase performance time instead of db querying while trying to minimize the hit to memory array instead of trie tree

17661377
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	subtract
it also includes the subtract multiplying divide and modulo operations

17661382
implements	extends
public class myhandler extends channelinboundmessagehandleradapter mypojo implements callbackinterface

17661410
rss	feed
i created a simple app to display nasa s image of the day from its rss feed

17661413
for-loop	arrays
you might have an arrays with indices 1 2 and 4 present but if you run over it with only a for-loop you will trigger a notice when accessing the nonexistant element 3

17661422
viewdidload	viewdidappear
one possibilty would be to move the pickimage call from the viewdidappear callback into the viewdidload callback

17661423
getter	setter
your best bet would be to abstract your session stuff by creating facade methods or getter and setter around the session variables rather than access them directly

17661444
int	chars
check above working at codepad notice size of chars is one byte it you replace chars with int in above program then every output will be multiplied by sizeof int on your machine

17661452
int	double
precision can be lost by converting bigdecimal values to the int float and double types used by math.max and math.min

17661476
int	chars
also note the htmlentities call in case your has weird chars or is not an int

17661494
verilog	hdl
error 10200 verilog hdl conditional statement error at led_shift.v 34 cannot match operand s in the condition to the corresponding edges in the enclosing event control of the always construct

17661498
put	get
the difference between your code and the original is that in the original the sprite is already all the way to the left so when the sprite scrolls you never see the white part of the next drawing and thus it does not look like it scrolls if you set the you will see the scrolling and you will undestand me better i believe also i only tried with different values in the original code but if you put 4 steps instead of 10 although you won t see the complete animation you will see an animation that is close enough you can also use 9 i will take another look at it later to see if i can get you a better answer

17661516
portrait	landscape
basically i have two screen layouts one for portrait and another for landscape orientation

17661534
google-chrome	firefox
setting timers is easy enough if you have a browser with a console take a look at the implementation in firefox and probably google-chrome too

17661549
post	get
i m new in facebook api and i m looking for php script which can get all post between two dates and display them in my site

17661580
for-loop	loops
you can do a nested for-loop cycling through the files in the outer loops and looking for the information line in the log file in the inner loops

17661580
for-loop	loops
changed the inner for-loop to use short filenames so that spaces in a path won t break loops

17661581
lme4	predict
the development version of lme4 has a predict function

17661640
noscript	meta
if you cannot use a http 301 or http 302 redirect you should consider using a script block to navigate to the url if script is enabled and moving the meta into a noscript block

17661668
onresume	onpause
but the camera instance is released onpause and a new one is opened onresume

17661676
hash	salt
other than your method doesn t require the salt to be stored with hash password i can t think of any advantages

17661679
move	drag
even after playing around with variables like the ball friction and different gravitational pulls the whole thing just floated around and felt very wobbly while i wanted the balls move only when i drag the time slider when they change sizes

17661686
portrait	landscape
the widgets for the same function should share the same id whether it s in portrait or landscape

17661693
try-catch	exception-handling
thirdly if you are still getting error surround your call to getmovie in a try-catch block catching a throwable instead of an exception-handling

17661696
children	parent
in this particular example we have a parent class and children classes inheriting from parent

17661715
imdb	freebase
this query will get you all actors with imdb ids in freebase

17661719
free	malloc
but if the malloc d buffer gets free when the data object is released as implied by freewhendone yes data2 will have trouble on its hands

17661747
tablet	galaxy
on tablet i use this the samsung galaxy on these devices install adobe flash player to a well does not work .

17661760
apache	nginx
the way i would do it for your setup would be to make nginx the default httpd by having it listen on port 80 then switch your apache virtual configuration to 8080

17661760
apache	nginx
basically you ll configure the new url to forward to your other server in nginx then have all other urls go to 8080 where it will hit your current apache stack

17661760
apache	nginx
if you were so inclined you could move your apache virtual servers down into the nginx configs but its not really necessary

17661760
apache	nginx
nginx reverse proxy on top of apache is a fairly common configuration

17661766
division	modulo
you could use modulo division

17661847
ggplot2	gtable
the gtable package is used internally by ggplot2 and can therefore be used to modify the layout of such plots

17661867
google-chrome	firefox
using jquery s .ajax or manually where the previous script node is removed from the head and a new one added which works fine in firefox and google-chrome causes memory to leak in ie

17661876
prepare	execute
whereas even if the prepare succeeds then execute may cause an error but that error is reported against

17661876
prepare	execute
it just saves the query string in the stmt and then the actual prepare of the statement is delayed until you call execute

17661876
prepare	execute
so the error if any is reported against whether it happens at prepare time or at execute time

17661876
prepare	execute
in this case no error was reported at prepare and but i got the same error as above at execute

17661916
width	height
now when i loaded the image there are no errors but the width height are all 0

17661928
prepare	execute
i thought prepare statement would handle it and there is in execute so that it matches the substring entered

17661930
width	height
this is to account for any scrollbars that may impact the available width height

17661950
folder	directory
the best i can output is folder which is created in my images directory

17662016
put	get
whether i put in my credentials or not i get the error the remote server returned an error not found. i have a combobox that gets loaded on page load event and it gets the data from the service just fine

17662019
width	height
calculate the aspect ratio width height or vice-versa

17662062
width	height
try implementing your own detection system or using an out of the box one because to rely on what the viewport determines your height width to be can prove tricky in the future

17662109
margin	height
i then set the bottom margin of that page to be the height of the application bar

17662111
put	get
i know my manager works because when i execute it in the shell i get the correct sum of my expenses -- i put in expense.price_object.price_sum and i get back decimal 254.77 -- but when i try to get that into my template it just shows up blank

17662115
prepare	execute
i can prepare and execute this query fine in plain pdo but running it through zend s tablegateway gets me this error

17662121
hash	salt
in general the user id isn t encrypted because there is no way to salt the hash of the user id which makes it vulnerable to attacks

17662141
prepare	execute
this means that any static sql statements ones that you don t execute using prepare execute or execute immediate will be checked and compiled when you create the stored procedure

17662160
inherited	properties
in a situation like this with two separate ideas pages and users i would use composition to share and access object properties instead of inherited

17662173
portrait	landscape
i have a device on which i set portrait orientation but it shows the activity in landscape

17662173
width	height
the device width is bigger than its height so it seems to be inverted

17662218
post	get
while writing the code and while reading the above post i guessed that my pub socket will never get polledin and that s what i am observing now when i run the program

17662230
gridview	linqdatasource
the gridview has a linqdatasource

17662234
move	drag
as i set the focus on the slider and move to right or drag the thumb with mouse the value gets raised by 0.1 as expected but sometimes it shows this kind of value 1.7000000002

17662289
min	max
in openmp 3.1 onwards one can implement for min max through reduction clause you can have a look at detailed example covering this in this link

17662297
uiview	subviews
so i took another look at my nib and noticed that the original subviews i used to create a uicollectionviewcell was a uiview

17662304
mouseover	mouseout
this.off mouseover mouseout dblclick

17662304
mouseover	mouseout
this makes things cleaner more scalable and easier to manage than calling something like .off mouseover mouseout dblclick

17662304
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseout	mousedown
just think if you added a new eventlistener like mousedown you would also have to edit your off function to .off mouseover mouseout dblclick mousedown and every other time you add another event

17662311
width	height
sweave has chunk options width and height for the dimensions of the images

17662311
width	height
attention one thing that gets easily confused are the width height parameters of the r

17662311
width	height
the sweave options width and height are passed to the r graphics devices and hence affect

17662311
width	height
for your quoted example width and height are both 6 the default

17662311
width	height
the sweave chunk options width and height control creation of the eps or pdf file or both

17662326
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
make sure you create bufferedwriter and bufferedreader objects from your socket s getinputstream or getoutputstream methods

17662329
width	height
problem is your has no width and height set

17662393
int	chars
i suppose int is 16bit therefore the shift of 16 or 24 will result to 0 as the the rule in ansi-c is that the byte of in reallity an unsigned chars should be expanded to an int

17662445
division	multiplication
using float pi causes the multiplication division which was done in double precision to reduce its precision on saving to a float

17662445
int	double
note int float and double range and precision are machine dependent

17662452
google-chrome	firefox
1st try examining the css using developer s tools in google-chrome firefox

17662531
folder	directory
i want to create a folder in a directory but if i do c users george appdata roaming myprogram this only woks for me it will not work with everybody that i send it to

17662537
profiling	debugging
but what i use to allow activation of compiler options in a more generic way is to define variables for specific features for example warning debugging optimization and profiling and set these according to the compiler currently used

17662538
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
basically i am using an objectoutputstream objectinputstream to communicate via the client server

17662538
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i have thousands of lines of code working perfectly fine around this objectoutputstream objectinputstream setup so i must be able to still use these streams after an upload is complete

17662538
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
to access the files the one being read on the client and the one being written on the server fileinputstream and fileoutputstream is used

17662538
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
this does not conform to my understanding of objectinputstream objectoutputstream

17662603
filtering	grouping
notes i use grouping concat because at the end of all of this my goal is to return not so much the products that match these categories but based on the filtering i want to return another list of categories from the products that match this criteria

17662713
folder	directory
i set my working directory to the parent folder for r

17662724
folder	directory
copy st-res folder from your sencha cmd directory for linux home bin sencha cmd ur-version-name stbuild to your project directory

17662739
post	get
in addition since you want to find the related to this article post you have to also get the current post categories

17662739
post	get
then for the second part where you want to include the related post you can get the category ids related to the current post and create the query you need

17662749
post	get
i am actually working to implement somehting using this library and if i get it to work properly i will post my code

17662868

pop-up	dialog
i ve been trying to figure this out for a while but no luck i would like to pop-up a file open dialog which i have been able to do with a function i found online and then use the file location further down the line in my script but i can t figure it out

17662949
filtering	grouping
are there any known issues in solr 3.6 where when grouping filtering query fq is applied with faceting the facet counts are coming back wrong

17662955
openssl	crypto++
as openssl didn t work for me i googled my way through qca crypto++ mcrypt and some public librarys i found

17662960
spaces	delimiter
now i want to break these strings and create a column based on the delimiter which is spaces

17662993
width	height
in the onsurfacechanged method use the two int parameters width and height to calculate the best size for your preview

17663067
button	checkbox
click the button after checking some checkbox and look at your console to see the results

17663110
slideup	slidedown	fadein	fadeout
my goal is to use jquery s slidedown with fadein or slideup with fadeout

17663110
hide	show
when a user clicks on show 1 div2 should hide and fade which it does

17663110
hide	show
my problem is while an div2 is animating the slideup with opacity 0 and a user clicks on show 2 which should hide div1 and show div2 some dirty inline styles are stuck on the object which throws off the full effect desired

17663110
hide	show
i need the stop so the object can hide show depending on the button clicked

17663147
filewriter	bufferedwriter
for plain character output prefer a filewriter enclosed within a bufferedwriter for performance

17663221
post	get
and then get the post value

17663252
ada	pascal
if you want to be able to use actual enumeration literals as strings in your code or during i o with language support then you need to use a language with enumeration type support such as pascal or ada

17680621
post	get
if you get the page where the first one is displayed then you post to the second page and finally post to the last page

17680649
hide	show
you could change the text of each line to show politics hide politics as appropriate toggling the description to show what will happen when the user selects that item

17680656
qstring	qdebug
try using qstring tostdstring or you can also use qdebug instead of cout

17680764
algol	smalltalk
this is called duck typing and is what separates smalltalk -inspired languages like ruby from the more formal simula or algol influenced languages like c++

17680771
portrait	landscape
i have an application thath retrieves json from a rest api with some html content i show on a html widget and i need all this links retrieved to be opened outside application on system browser mainly due to inside app is very very slow to open and my app is locked to portrait and links should be viewed on landscape

just remove .metadata folder in your workspace directory and restart

17681048
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox they do not work

17681058
google-chrome	firefox
this works beautifully in firefox and google-chrome but the minute i try it in ie8 or ie7 everything works fine but it seems that the selector is not functioning as the class isn t being removed

17681109
uiview	subviews
i m trying to perform an animation from within a uiview subclass on one of its subviews

17681127
interbase	firebird
do not attempt to access a firebird or interbase database via any form of mount

17681132
setinterval	settimeout
to solve this you could use cleartimeout after the animation has finished and replace setinterval with settimeout

17681156
jax-ws	jax-rs
if sending the ajax post by usual jsf means uicommand component jsf.ajax.request etc in flavor of etc is really not an option for some reason left unspecified in your question then you d indeed better create a separate servlet or even jax-rs or jax-ws webservice listening on those requests and returning xml json etc

17681209
vb.net	vb6
well the first method was added to attract vb6 programmers to vb.net because that was how it was done in vb6

17681227
superclass	subclassing
for example use getbookid in the subclassing rather than attempting to access the superclass s private field directly

17681227
superclass	subclassing
however this allows a potentially arbitrary number of subclassing to couple directly to your superclass s representation

17681283
free	malloc
the solution to this problem is to create the item list on the heap either via new in c++ or using malloc remember to delete or free

17681334
preventdefault	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
for some reason if you preventdefault in the mousedown handler the mouseup one starts working

17681358
for-loop	loops
possibly using a for-loop or a while loops

17681360
versioning	upgrade
however when you go to your mac build server and update xamarin to the alpha versioning then open a xamarin project in visual studio it will prompt you that the build server and pluggin are different versioning and will allow you to upgrade

17681387
hide	show
ignore the value in each cell of the row but i want to hide the row if a 0 and if it is 1 the row will show

17681448
post	put
problem fixed...the most recent version of mcr as of this post has a major error in which some process looks for a homes directory with the .matlab directory in it...some programmer must ve just put an extra s in there equaling days of pain

17681448
folder	directory
creating that directory under 777 permissions and putting the .matlab folder in it fixed the problem

17681475
for-loop	loops
you can use another loops in your for-loop

17681486
folder	directory
when i first started writing php to interface with the s3 api i was expecting to be able to iterate over a directory and the files in each folder

17681543
floating-point	fractions
ps--i am well aware that ieee standards require that calculations be performed as though floating-point values represent precise power-of-two fractions but few people seeing the code as being set f2 to the representable power-of-two fractions which is closest to being one tenth of the one in f1

17681543
floating-point	fractions
because of imprecision the code cannot fulfill that purpose perfectly but in most cases it s more helpful to regard floating-point numbers as representing actual numerical quantities than to regard them as power-of-two fractions

17681672
int	chars
ok no problem with int but the problem is when i can use chars

17681689
move	drag
in a simple html page all work fine but in extjs panel when drag a node in addition to move that also activates pan i would not disable the pan

17681701
floating-point	integer
remember that numeric variables in r are floating-point not integer by default

17681708
filewriter	bufferedwriter
i ve tried solutions like mocking the file and mocking as many of the properties that i can figure out as much as possible an then also writing into it with a filewriter bufferedwriter but those don t work well since they need canonical paths

17681742
implements	extends
you could extends formhelper to add implements this functionality if you intend to use it elsewhere

17681751
post	get
one possible approach would be to make your form post return immediately and when the status request shows completion start up a new request to get the data that it knows is waiting for it on the server

17681778
fadein	fadeout
with jquery you also can use fadein and fadeout functions for smooth transition

17681779

17681872
rss	feed
i know how to get category specific rss feed but couldn t find a way so that i can get a list of all categories available on the website

17681939
rss	feed
i personally prefer json over rss feed

17681947
post	get
firstly i can t get it to redirect with a post request - it s always a get request

17681949
put	get
the sharedqueue gets filled up with the messages that i get from the mq infrastructure as below.it will put the messages to sharedqueue

17681961

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this menu works in real-life testing google-chrome firefox safari but when i run the cucumber tests the menu is empty

17682073
implements	extends
you should first have your thread classes extends thread instead of just implements runnable then call this instead

17682100
mouseleave	mouseenter
my problem is that if i mouseenter manually another item the triggered with code above item doesn t mouseleave

17682100
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseleave #currentitem a when another item has a mouseenter triggered

17682100
mouseleave	mouseenter
when that menu item triggers mouseleave mouseenter #currentitem a so the item is always triggered when nothing else is

17682154
jdom	xom
although i m not entirely sure about the size that these files may reach but i would be highly suprised they would be 1mb so a java dom parser as jdom or xom might work as well but i d have to load all these files at the same time or iterate in pairs

17682160
post	get
i ve read that for some reason ie needs to get a certificate before it can do an http post so i have http gets running before my post request but now the get is erroring out

17682160
google-chrome	firefox
as you would expect this works fine in google-chrome and firefox

17682164
put	get
when i put i get the error query 14 11 the ships via group hierarchy is used more than once in the crossjoin function

17682200
width	height
when you start messing with the width make sure you set the height to 100 to maintain the aspect ration

17682217
post	put
i ve been doing that but noticed that the parameters are being put in the url unlike a post request which means they will show in the logs

17682275
nerdtree	rails.vim
that s nerdtree for the directory navigation and rails.vim is the de facto standard rails plugin

17682322
width	height
even if the user changes the width or height of the size you return it has no impact on the mysize struct in your class

17682322
width	height
original answer given the assumption that width and height were properties of the user s class

17682322
width	height
you can compute the size on the fly instead of storing it based on your width and height

17682322
width	height
another option is to recompute your size in your property setter for width and height

17682332
yacc	bison
i am using pebl software that is programmed primarily in c++ although you do not need to know c++ to use pebl but also uses flex and bison gnu versions of lex and yacc to handle parsing.

17682371
fadein	hide
and when i use .fadeout and fadein instead of hide and .show

17682375
apache	nginx
i have a django project provided by nginx for static elements that proxies to apache for dynamic content on a ubuntu server os

17682375
decoder	encoder
my guess is that the encoder and decoder for python and c are different

17682393
post	get
this means i can t use get i should use post instead

17682393
post	get
since this would cause the url limit to be exceeded and get to be used instead of post

17682393
google-chrome	firefox
and it works in google-chrome and firefox but it doesn t work on ie

17682430
jar	war
as it is explained here i understand a war package is not a jar containing libs but a package to deploy a complete application

17682437
fadein	fadeout
add the fadein as a callback to fadeout

17682481

17682767
express	node.js
i m playing with node.js express jade and mongodb

17682775
stdout	stdio	stdout	stderr
the only interaction between the vm and the logs is if you enable stdio conversion setprop log.redirect-stdio true and then write to stdout or stderr but i doubt this is what is happening here

17682787
keydown	keyup
try keyup instead of keydown

17682799
put	get
i tried just having to get a portion of the texture and using gltexsubimage2d to put it there it doesn t seem to work right

subtract	add
scan right by one column - take your score subtract the score for the left-most lowest index column and add the score for the neighbouring column to the right

17682866
subtract	add
proceed with step 2 until you reach the end of the row then scan downward one row subtract the scores for your top row add those for the row below you

17682872
serializable	deserialization
i was facing the same problem in the serializable and deserialization of a custom class

17682873
keydown	keyup
use keyup instead of keydown

17682952
udp	tcp
be sure to evaluate the benefits of udp vs tcp

17682955
google-chrome	firefox
you can use the google-chrome developer tools or firebug firefox to see what values are being returned

17682961
udp	tcp
i feel here udp is might be better compared to tcp

17682989
inherited	properties
it creates a constructor that you can use again and again to create new objects using new that can inherited the original function s properties

17682998
post	put
i think it will be easier if you just put the php code and the html into one file and make your form post to it self...that way your php variables will be accessible from anywhere within the file....and you can now intelligently mix code and markup to achieve what you want

17683012
put	get
however when i try to use the access token to upload a video i put it in the authorization bearer header i get an error 401 unauthorized with the description token invalid

17683049
listadapter	spinner
in the kv file a spinner button above the listview selects the sort value and on_release makes a call to root.beer_sort which changes the listadapter named beer_la data

17683059
children	parent
additionally you are using weights in some of this parent layout s children but you have not specified a weightsum total in the parent linearlayout

17683059
children	parent
make the parent weightsum 7 and make sure you distribute this as desired to the children

qstring	qbytearray
in my programm i need to serialize json array and convert it to qstring qbytearray but i didn t found any serialize or encode methods in those classes

17683133
children	parent
the children are deleted before the parent and it is a single database roundtrip one call to savechanges with of course three delete statements in a single transaction

17683133
children	parent
using tolist is necessary here because calling remove for the children also removes from the parent s children collection

17683133
children	parent
the order in which remove is called for children and parent doesn t matter

17683156
put	get
to safely use the in-context cache use regular model key get and put operations with these flags use_memcache false use_datastore false use_cache true

17683166
sudo	nohup
sudo nohup supervisor myapp.js

17683192
hide	show
when the form is submitted i trigger that video to hide and show another div that contains 2 more videos

17683205
post	get
the reason htmlhelper -created input fields and validation will still work when calling view without the model from your post method is this if they can get away with it the helper methods don t use the model s properties at all

17683224
int	double
on 32 or 64bit systems the aliases like long or int may vary but a dword is still a double word

17683241
camanjs	pixastic
in addition to camanjs pixastic is another good image filter library

17683258

to use interpolate you can either build an arrays inside your for-loop that matches the expected arrays or call a.year and a.value instead of and

17683259

however i want to use a common post action and common actions don t get declared -- in fact if you try to create a post action in open graph manually you get the error a custom post action is restricted

i want to have at least one task ready for each thread but not too much more as to not starve other workers

17683336

put	get
so thanks to rob keniger i ve managed to extract the channels but if i try to put them back together with other channels the images get stretched horizontally and have rgb stripes in it

17683410
width	height
also you can experiment with different bounding box sizes bounds of an object rather than creating the bounding box of the object equal to its width and height

17683446
width	margin	box-sizing	margin
you could for test change display of table to not have to set width and deal with padding margin or box-sizing

17683468
jobs	cron
i cannot find a good google article to know every small detail about cron jobs and using them in asp.net coding with c#

17683468
jobs	cron
note that i am using heliohost which supports cpanel with 2 cron jobs per 24 hours

17683488
post	get
to allow this to happen in one page through post or you could use ajax technically you need a combination of a get and post version of the method and to construct your view model correctly

17683511
put	get
you either set a class member flag boolean mttsinitialized and check this flag everytime you call speak or put the code to get the data to be spoken in oninit

17683538
avr	microcontroller
having done more microcontroller work lately pic18 and avr i ve tended to size everything just because you become so space conscience

17683553
post	get
secondly i would imagine your form will get submitted via post always there is no point attaching a click event on the submit button

17683575
post	get
i thought i d post it here as well to see what i can get

17683605

min	max
you can fix this by setting the x axis min and max of the visible area mrenderer.setxaxismin min

17683688
for-loop	arrays
you can also set a variable maxcount 0 maxindex 0 and write a for-loop to cycle through your freq arrays and find the maximum value

17683703
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown	mouseout	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup

activitya extends activity implements ongestureperformedlistener

17683726

google-chrome	firefox
this problem exists in google-chrome and also on my iphone not in firefox firefox seems to work properly and there are no errors in the dev console in google-chrome

for every post found in text_posts the post would again have to be found in post to get the text field

i need a map where i put different types of values double string int ... in it key can be string

if you have the same id on multiple elements while it may work now on the browsers you try you have no guarantee it won t break in the next rev of jquery or google-chrome or konqueror or ios safari

17684121
min	max
max and min will still allow the user to type in numbers in excess of max and min which is not optimal

17684134
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions sum min max count and so forth

17684151
post	get
you send http get params in the url and not as an encoded part of the request body like post change your python to look like this and you should get what you are after

17684173
union	distinct
the inline view aliased as g doesn t have to use union all operators you just need a rowset that returns exactly 3 rows with distinct values

17684186

filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs	xfs	btrfs
filesystems ext3 ext4 xfs - none of that fancy cow stuff you see with zfs and btrfs

17694395
filesystems	xfs
everywhere i read jbod is better then raid in hadoop and that the best filesystems are xfs and ext3 and ext4

17694395
lvm	mdadm
i see jbods going 2 ways either each disk going to a seperate mount or a linear concat of disks which can be done mdadm --linear mode or lvm i bet can do it too so i dont see the big deal with that.

17694395
filesystems	btrfs
filesystems that use cow copy on write like zfs and btrfs just slow down hadoop but not only that the cow implementation is a waste with hadoop

17694395
lvm	mdadm
so if you had sda and sdb and sdc as your data disks in your node you would make em appear as some entity1 either with the hardware of the motherboard or mdadm or lvm which is a linear concat of sda and sdb and sdc

17694395
lvm	mdadm
and then of course i can combine then to become one entity either with logical volume manager lvm or mdadm in a raid or linear fashion linear prefered for jbod ....

subtract	add
i decided it made sense to add and subtract offsets but not positions

17694668
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
however it did make sense to add an offset to a position to get a position or to subtract two positions to get an offset and even to multiplying an offset by a scalar to get an offset

17696107
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	addition
but the number 33 and a few other equally good numbers like 17 31 63 127 and 129 have nevertheless a great advantage to the remaining numbers in the large set of possible multipliers their multiplying operation can be replaced by a faster operation based on just one shift plus either a single addition or subtraction operation

17696125
int	double
primitive data types like int double etc do not consume end of line therefore the end of line remains in buffer and when input.next executes it consumes the end of line from buffer from the first input

i would suggest creating a container view to hold the picker and the toolbar subviews then show hide the container view with whatever animations you like instead if where you currently show the picker view

17696182

in my scenario i ve a mvc on iis serializing objects from entity framework where i ve overridden gethashcode and equals methods since the id of those objects is immutable once committed to the database

17696871

if you use a key value store i would imagine you would do a lot of lookups for the children and this could be a long list so your key would be the parent node and your value the children and you could end up with a lot of movement and querying of the table

17697660

can be arbitrary and don t have to correlate in any way with the names of your instance variables unless you override getter and setter for property s but that s another story since you still have to implement the method yourself and you can do whatever you want in there

17697984
getter	setter
note that for this to work you do not have to declare or implement the setter and getter for these variables

17698010

here i use function but return only filename.txt e.g in firefox and if i use this same code in ie and google-chrome return c fakepath myfilename.txt

17701123

17701686
next	except
except the case statement doesn t terminate after executing the associated list - bash just continues testing the next pattern as though the previous pattern didn t match

17701687
width	height
when you try to -- forcefully -- convert this single channel image from yuv 4 2 0 to a multi-channel rgb opencv library assumes that each row has 2 3 of the full 4 4 4 information 1 x height x width for y and 1 2 height x width for u and v each instead of 3 x height x width for a normal yuv therefore your width of the destination image shrinks to 2 3 of the original width

17701687
width	height
it can be assumed that half of the data read from the original image comes from unallocated memory though because the original image only has width x height uchar s but 2 x width x height uchar s are read from the memory

17701687
width	height
if your uchar buffer is already correctly formatted for a series of bytes representing yuv_nv12 4 2 0 subsampling in the conventional width x height bytes per channel all you need to do is to construct your original yuvmat as a cv_8uc3 and you are good to go

17701687
width	height
yuv_nv12 data comes with width x height uchar s of y followed by 1 2 width x 1 2 x height of 2 x uchar s representing uv combined

17701687
width	height
you probably need to write your own reader to read y u and v data separately and to construct 3 single-channel mat s of size width x height -- filling in the horizontal and vertical gaps in both u and v channels -- then use cv merge to combine those single-channel images to a 3-channel yuv before using cv cvtcolor to convert that image using cv_yuv2bgr option

17701693

17702353
sdl	ncurses
while i m comfortable using ncurses and sdl independently i m having trouble figuring out how to embed the sdl graphics within an ncurses window

post	get
i would post what i ve tried to get the last little bit of the equation but none of them work obviously haha

17702845
post	get
without knowing too much about silex or php in general i would recommend using the esi constructs only for the cacheable get request that loads the form so that you always get a fresh csrf token and include the fragment using php include when responding to the uncacheable php post on form submission

17702885
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome i.e it hides text before img.png

copying	overwrite
somewhere in there i m guessing a subroutine will be setting up the environment for the new process and along the way will be copying the 600-byte string passed in as a parameter buffer into what may well be a small ish fixed size buffer on the stack of the new process and presumably overwrite the return address of this setup function with many copies of the stack pointer from the original call

17704180

anyway we only copy certain file types out and .cshtml wasn t in the list so yeah no view folder in the output debug directory

superclass	subclassing
well each subclassing will chain to a superclass constructor

17709257
superclass	subclassing
you can t catch any exception thrown by that superclass constructor within the subclassing constructor as the chaining to the superclass constructor must be the very first thing in the constructor body - you can t even start a try block

17709269
try-catch	exception-handling
but you cannot use a try-catch block surrounding the super call to handle the exception-handling as the super has to be the first statement in your constructor

17709287
put	get
i have a trigger that takes the old values from the orginal tabel and put these values in one cell on another table except the date and user when any updates occurs the orginal table has attributes which is null when the raw is inserted like updatedate and updateuser so when this raw is updated those two attributes will be update to the current date and user who did the update so the trigger should get those two parameters when they are null should get the inserted values and when they are not null should get the new values however the trigger s syntax is correct but the result is incorrect

if you write responsetext to a htmldocument object you can work on the tags with the usual methods like getelementbyid or getelementsbytagname

17709333
sse	avx
i m aware of the existing penalty for switching from avx instructions to sse instructions without first zeroing out the upper halves of all ymm registers but in my particular case on my machine i7-3939k 3.2ghz there seems to be a very large penalty for going the other way around sse to avx even if i do explicitly use _mm256_zeroupper before and after the avx code section

17709333
sse	avx
i ported an sse2 intrinsic version directly to avx to do 8 elements at once over sse s 4 expecting to see a significant performance increase but unfortunately the opposite happened

17709333
sse	avx
as if there s a massive penalty for sse to avx if i prime the avx version first with a trial run the avx execution time drops to 12 microseconds while doing the same thing with the sse equivalents only drops the time down by a microsecond to 14 making avx the marginal winner here but only if i cheat

17709333
sse	avx
i considered that maybe avx doesn t play as nicely with the cache as sse but using _mm_prefetch does nothing to help it either

don t worry about how to parse this data this code would be shared between the abstract-class which can parse the things that are true for all cat subtypes and the subclass will parse out the rest of the needed data

17710062
strtol	atoi
the atoi function is subsumed by strtol but is retained because it is used extensively in existing code

17710062
strtol	atoi
if the number is not known to be in range strtol should be used because atoi is not required to perform any error checking

the pom.xml file error is saying that eclipse s maven plugin m2e does not know what to do with the copy-dependencies unpack goal

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
that means if the superclass has an initializer method initializers are just methods and your subclassing does not override it then your subclassing will inherited that superclass s initializer method

free	malloc
in fact you should really never use free or malloc in c++

17711510
free	malloc
a good explanation for why you should never mix new and free or malloc and delete is that new and delete call the constructor and destructor free and malloc have nothing to do with that they just allocate and deallocate memory especially for built in classes this is bad because you don t know what is supposed to happen in std string s destructor or constructor it might be possible to make it work with your own built in class but don t do it

maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml
you can use maven-dependency-plugin in pom.xml to manage jar package

this works fine in google-chrome but in firefox the iframe appears over the top of the menu

in your controller you can get the value of userid as post

17713990

when you treat two vectors as quaternions and multiplying them you get their cross-product in the x y z part and you get their negated dot-product in the w part

17713999
super	extends
recall the pecs producer extends consumer super rule -- you have an extends wildcard here unbounded wildcard is for most purposes the same as extends object so it is only useful as a producer

17714008
guard	simplecov
looking for that on the command line given gives you the hint that it was invoked from guard so you can just skip simplecov if that s there

17714018
try-catch	exception-handling
what you need is to capture the exception-handling with a try-catch block and either save the error to a log or display it on the screen

17714039
serializable	deserialization
deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable

17714048
serializable	deserialization

folder	directory
all screens of the installer reflect the selected language and my language .jar files are being created and put into a folder in the installation directory

17714063
apk	dex
dex is packaged inside your apk btw apk size doesn t vary much as zip compression helps usually as classes.dex which later on when you install the apk in you device android might optimize it for that particular device a.k.a

17714063
apk	dex
so to verify that your final cached dex actually changes and is the responsible for this size change by say just adding animations you can find it either by unzipping your apk or inside your device i always find the second option more exciting

17714081
width	height
i tried in css top 10 but this is based on the height of the screen not the width

17714141
punctuation	words
i m thinking about having the function look at each words and determining if there is a punctuation mark in it by starting at -1 index of -1 and then splitting the words from the punctuation as soon as it hits a letter and not a punctuation mark.

17714145
terminate	timeout
change those values to how long you want but the more commonly used method is for example 60 seconds then the server sends an empty response terminate the connection then the client restarts a new request which will also last another 60 seconds etc.. cause i believe otherwise if the user doesn t end the request but actually closes the browser for example you would have a lot of useless open connections that are waiting to timeout

17714145
google-chrome	firefox
also i would like to tell you that one method fits all works but isn t always good browsers like google-chrome and firefox can use fancier methods like server sent events or web sockets there s a lot of parser libraries that check which functions are supported by the current browser and uses the best one if you re going to use server sent events for example which aren t supported in ie yet you could easily handle that with something like this example and fall back to long polling only in ie

17714158

you want to look into using asterisk + freepbx together they form a very solid foundation and api to work with ivr s and anything else you could want

17714296
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for example let s say you have a tabbed app uitabbarcontroller that you want first to show a welcome view for signing in or signing up uinavigationcontroller

17714296
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think you should set the uitabbarcontroller as the rootviewcontroller as the core of the app is tabbed but if user credentials are needed then set a uinavigationcontroller within the uitabbarcontroller hiding the tab bar to push the welcome view and navigate to sign in sign up view controllers

17714296
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
firstly if user credentials needed set the uinavigationcontroller as the rootviewcontroller to show the welcome view and navigate to sign in sign up and once user credentials successfully provided or account successfully created switch the rootviewcontroller to the uitabbarcontroller to show the core tabbed app

17714296

width	margin
it will have a top margin equivalent to 10 of it s containing block s width

17714476

17714889
try-catch	exception-handling
wrapping every method in try-catch assumes that you definitely know what to do after any exception-handling has been thrown

17714950

use these in oncreate before setcontentview

17715342

17727355
getter	setter
make sure you have the public getter and setter for your properties in your entity

17727372

17727757
post	get
well you get all the required information in the blog post the sqale methodology is perfectly explained on the official sqale website

17727789
heroku	openshift
the only disadvantage i could find on openshift is that it seems that the deployment takes much more time then on heroku and there is considerable delay on the first time you address the website but after the first time is working faster - not related to browser caching if you think this is the issue

17727789
post	put
i know there are a lot of post about those issues and how to deploy and everything but i just wanted to put some order into it

17727797

you don t say what type of unix linux you are running but on my ubuntu hosts this works good for last boot times

17728085

17728107
hide	show
i want it to prevent the show hide script from executing if the same link is clicked a second time

17728124
int	chars
if you are seeking to extract the int up to the first non-decimal chars you can simply cast the string and mysql will do the rest

17728144
udp	tcp
btw you can estimate the packet loss using udp packets.the packets loss rate for udp and tcp is not the same but it gives you an idea

17728154
websphere	ibm
i prefer c ibm websphere appserver etc

17728196
google-chrome	firefox
the reason for it to work in firefox is simply because firefox has a different implementation that allow ui events to execute in-between so to speak canary and i believe google-chrome as well has an experimental mode that allow ui updates to be executed on a separate thread

17728214
mdpi	hdpi
a fullscreen background maybe but all your ui components should be fine with just an mdpi hdpi xhdpi version

17728216
nfa	dfa
actually you can generate infinite number of dfa s from a single nfa each of which differ in number of states

17728244

jar	war
the war file has a jar file server-artifact.jar

17728385

17728500
folder	directory
i just can t figure out how to get a count of the number of times a specific folder name occurs in the directory

17728537
post	get
my post from yesterday was asking more about doing this in the most efficient way...today i got to thinking about it and idk if i ll really be able to get away from doing it for each element.

17728568
fileinputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	objectoutputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
hashmap is serializable so you could just use a fileinputstream and fileoutputstream in conjunction with objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

17728573
portrait	landscape
i can get this to work but once the ipad rotates from landscape to portrait and therefore reduces the width available to the middle label the middle label content gets cut off

17728573
width	height	portrait	landscape
if i give the middle uilabel a height constraint of less than or equal to 250 the height it needs to show all content in narrow portrait mode once the ipad orientates back to landscape the label content expands to fit the new width but also no longer aligns nicely with the tops of the other labels on either side

17728581
multiplying	subtract
adding or subtract and even more multiplying or dividing should be expected to create inexact results

17728608

17728608
subscript	superscript
however with my current implementation all superscript and subscript characters lose that formatting

17728623
background-color	transparency
when i do a system.out.println to the value of option.getcssvalue background-color it returns transparency for all my option elements and rgba 51 153 255 1 for my modified option element which when converted to hex is #3399ff a blue colour

17728638
dropbox	evernote
apart from evernote i am able to find dropbox also has api to store simple data and what i am looking for

ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i downloaded qt 5.1 directly from qt-project.org and installed as admin with sudo on linux mint 12 based on ubuntu

17728699
chown	sudo
i forgot to say - as hostilefork mentioned in comment - sudo chown -r +rx opt qt 5.1.0 gcc examples was solution to this problem

17728699

nsstring	nsdata
note that you can convert nsdata to nsstring directly using

17728772

no matter what i do removing all gmail accounts and signin a hotmail account with mail app this code launches gmail by default and do not show or let me choose my universal mail app

17728884
hide	show
however if you re really insisting on doing this and you ve written copy constructor copy assignment you haven t show us for correctness then i find that the extra work in the destructor actually hide what s really happening and provides little value at the expense of code obfuscation

17728916
post	get
every request is a post request so that the token does not get saved in the browser s history

17728920

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
for whatever reason the animation functions flawlessly in google-chrome and safari but fails to animate in firefox

17729043
for-loop	loops
but for loops variable i where you declare it before the for-loop or inside doesn t matter because it will be allocated on stack only once

17729054

because you can interrupt the show hide and have the animation execute but then it will pop into place at random moments

17729561
for-loop	loops
my idea of how to do this was have a for-loop run through my vector which stores numbers 1-10 in words and when it finds an index which contains a string which matches the users input it uses the for loops counter variable

17729592
for-loop	loops
the only thing i ve came up with and i ve noticed other people said to do is a for-loop of files in the directory sorted by date and then just get the first file and break loops

portrait	landscape
zooz for iphone currently do not support landscape and will always be in portrait

17729861
portrait	landscape
in order to enable zooz in a landscape iphone app you should show zooz from a portrait only view controller

portrait	landscape
this way your app stays in landscape and the zooz ui is portrait

17729877
superclass	subclassing
my preference is to avoid direct field access of fields in a superclass in a subclassing because it reduces dependencies on the implementation of the superclass

17729877
getter	setter	public	protected
what i prefer to do is to encapsulate field access inside getter setter methods and to intentionally make them protected or public so subclasses can override them explicitly

17731457
hide	show
i ve been searching for a good trick to make a hide show content or a list with only css and no javascript

17731457

17731465
getter	setter
i have tried js methods to watch modifications of object properties such as this one there are many but all work on the same principle of setting setter and getter which works the first time and then subsequently breaks the app afterward

17731465
getter	setter
apparently assigning setter and getter cause the system to stop functioning

17732570

17732603
width	height
everything under .drag-drop is supposed to be absolutely placed so the height and width of .drag-drop become zero

17732613
submit	submission
i would be tempted to bind to the submit event of the containing form and use the concept from _.debounce to limit the repetition of submission

17732653
children	parent
absolute positioning removes the element from the layout therefore the children are no longer part of the calculation of the parent s sizing

17732675
width	height
it looks as if you re using a category extension to set width height on views as well as center them in their parent

17732696
superclass	subclassing
help me understand how to use the superclass variable in the subclassing and being able to make changes to it i am making a clone space invaders 2d game using sdl library

17732832
squash	merge
squash back to a merge commit requires just a bit of care

17732836
onclick	onsubmit
however instead of using an onsubmit or onclick you d use

17732844
udp	mtu
i m using udp via the standard socket library so i had hoped to be able to read say 64kb off a socket i m on an infiniband network so the mtu can be quite large into a location at some offset into the memory-mapped region

17732862

17732933
hash	salt
when writing a record to the database hash the ssn along with the large salt value above to generate a field that is searchable but not recoverable without obtaining the salt and brute forcing all possible ssns and aes encrypt the raw ssn value with a new iv stored alongside to generate a field that is retrievable with the key iv but not searchable because encrypting the same ssn twice should yield different output

17732933
hash	salt
when searching just hash the search value with the same salt and look it up in the db

17732969
for-loop	arrays
since the for-loop does not discover the arrays s length method i do not consider that to be proper introspection

17732970

17733087
stdout	stderr
and the stdout stderr pipe must be closed

17733087
stdout	stderr
in order to put the command in the background both stdout and stderr must be closed

17733087
stdout	stderr
a lazy alternative approach is to simply redirect stdout and stderr to dev null

17733124
build.gradle	gradlew
with newer versions of gradlew and the android gradlew plugin you just need to add the following to your build.gradle

17733176

17733301
subtract	add
i would assume that this is done to force you to consider what the units of the duration you want to add subtract are

17733304
inherited	properties	nsstring	nsobject
example if there is a class named car which has a properties named carinfo which provides the carâ s make model and year of manufacture and the carinfo contains the data in nsstring format it would be very helpful if nsstring class methods could be called upon the objects of car class which actually inherited from nsobject

17733357

one can add and subtract seconds to from seconds

17733480
hide	show
without position the right 0 that i added in the other question hide title bar and show close button in jquery dialog has no effect which explains why the button appears on the left since that is where it would naturally appear in normal flow

another alternative would be to use date calculation functions like cdate dateadd and datepart to calculate time values

17733536
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
now i want to upload the same cert to amazon-web-services iam so that i can use it for by beanstalk load balancer

17733567
int	chars
since this is a union and all of the members in the union only use no more than 3 bits from an unsigned int the size of the union would be at least the size if chars plus padding as required by your system if any

17733633
post	get
i ll let you know how it goes and post updates here with examples as i get something working

17733690
post	get
in the example above the get request to login is successful but returns the improper form action webapp login the form submits a post back to the same url

17733765
breeze	datajs
i am working with the new vs2013 and created odata controller with 2 models store and products as client i have used ko breeze and datajs

17733774
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the icons are clickable in firefox and google-chrome but they are not clickable in safari

17733798
google-chrome	firefox
i had a similar issue with firefox and google-chrome

17733800
maven	pom.xml
if you donâ t like the pom.xml file name the location of your user-specific maven

17733808
express	node.js
i m running jade as a templating engine with express node.js and whenever i get a syntax error in my .jade file i get a report like this

17733815
for-loop	arrays
so i used the answer for this question to handle instance id s in my classes and it works if used in a for-loop but not with normal arrays syntax

17733855
innodb	myisam
in my case the type of cmsplugin_filer tables was innodb while other tables engine was myisam

17733875
distance	polygons
i subclassed a clregion to support polygons via overriding containscoordinate to use ray casting logic instead of the original distance crunching logic

17733889
min	max
whenever you reach a change was increasing now decreasing or vice versa you have found a relative max min respectively

17733889
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop to iterate a boolean flag to check against whether you were increasing or decreasing and the obvious knowledge of both your current and previous index in the arrays to check store

17733894
hotmail	outlook.com
outlook by which i mean the desktop application rather than outlook.com the hotmail replacement is pretty much the worst email client when it comes both to supporting all kinds of basic html css features - campaign monitor css compatibility chart - and more modern stuff like media queries - this is because outlook 2007 2010 and even the 2013 version all use the microsoft word rendering engineâ

17733913
getter	setter
these methods are known as getter and setter because unsurprisingly they get or set a variable

17733913
getter	setter
ruby includes three class methods that define these getter and setter for you attr_reader defines the getter attr_writer defines the setter and attr_accessor defines both

17733916
fadein	fadeout
oh i should mention this is javascript based animation using jquery fadein and fadeout

17733997
chunked	transfer-encoding
though some http requests can be answered with a transfer-encoding chunked header that makes the content-length useless

17734010
google-chrome	firefox
when i try this in firefox ie and google-chrome it works fine

17734117
getter	setter
these are getter and setter methods

17734117
getter	setter
this will give you both the getter and setter methods for the name attribute

17734118
put	get
you can put them in app.config web.config in the appsettings section and use the configurationmanager to get he values as shown in the example below

17734126
google-chrome	firefox
dr - jquery plugins are working in firefox but not in google-chrome

17734140
tar	gunzip
my files are 25mb each so i think the best way would be in a piped stream with the tar module similar to how you use the gunzip from node.js s built-in zlib library for .tar.gz

17734173
width	height
i needed to add a width and height to the li and then display block and height width 100 in the span

17734269
mouseover	mouseout
i could probably make this work easily with background images but i thought i might be able to do it by setting the width on the li to 0 and the a to some set width then with jquery animate the width of the parent li on the mouseover and mouseout

17734311
nodejitsu	heroku
heroku and nodejitsu will host this for free until you have users coming out of your ears

17734351
sorting	filtering
third as you have pointed out already sorting and filtering becomes both a strain on the resources and requires a lot of coding

17734357
int	double
well first off types like int float double long and short are c primitives not objective-c

17734357
floating-point	integer
basically each numeric type can be placed in one of two categories integer types and floating-point types

17734357
integer	unsigned
so a signed integer or int can represent a certain range of negative or positive numbers traditionally â 2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647 and an unsigned integer or unsigned int can represent the same range of numbers but all positive 0 to 4 294 967 295

17734427
ssl	https
since version 3.0.5 maven checks the ssl certificate on https connections

17734473
post	get
when i navigate using the back button from say form2.php to form1.php on my iphone the request is an http get for form1.php rather than a resubmit using http post

17734473
google-chrome	safari
note this happens whether i m using google-chrome or safari on my iphone

17734473
google-chrome	safari
load shaun fi in safari or google-chrome on ios

17734480
apache	nginx
as i understand it - the biggest advantage in using nginx is that apache opens a different thread for each http request - which might load my server very quickly while nginx uses some other technique event driven in order to take the maximum out of my server s memory and hardware

17734480
post	get
in all the post i ve found that the way to use java on it is to wrap the application with nginx + tomcat or other javaserver + java - so if i understand correctly - i will not get the nginx advantage since the tomcat will open a new thread for each request in order to use the java web service

17734489
sudo	passwd
i added sudo to the build dependencies but for some reason a passwd request is opened

17734526
onchange	onkeyup
as you can see it works with the onkeyup event dispatched from the input as a person types you could change this to use others such as onchange for example there are subtle differences this seemed to be the most dynamic for the short example

17734567
min	max
for a geojson featurecollection containing only point features a proper bounding box isn t returned specifically the x-values of the first and last points in the collection appear to used instead of the min and max x-values for the group of points

17734567
min	max
the bounding-box coordinates returned thus includes the min and max y-values but not the largest and smallest x-values

17734574
width	height
i ve tried using this little bit of code to set the width and height of a the main game room in a setup object before switching to that room

17734580
subtract	add
i want to turn my data type exp into a map where the function names add subtract etc are the keys and the values are the number of times they occurred in an expression

17734614
put	get
then using the users access token i am attempting to call the api to put a new password but i get an error 403 not authorized to access this resource api

17734614
put	get
when calling this api with get i am able to retrieve my user information successfully but trying to put a new password or any other field for that matter fails

17734615
ant	maven
haven t used ant in years not since i switched to maven

17734625
put	get
however when i put the code into a class inside a library that the main class uses that s when i get the segmentation fault

17734746
width	height
i need to get the x y width height and page number of each individual character in a pdf ideally as percentages

17734778
getter	setter
having seperate getter setter or having combined accessors is a cultural preference

17734778
public	protected
the latter point is especially important where fine-grained access control and permission systems are used in languages like java c# c++ with visibility nuances like private protected public etc

17734778
getter	setter
as these languages have method overloading writing unified getter setter isn t impossible instead it is a cultural preference

17734778
getter	setter
analysis of alleged issues with combined getter setter

17734778
getter	setter
setter calls go through the getter code path

17734778
getter	setter
the grepability is not impacted by using combined or seperate getter and setter and only touches on autogeneration

17734832
redhat	fedora
i do not think there is anything wrong with qt 4.7.3 as the code compiles correctly on msvc2010 and fedora 9 gcc version 4.3.0 20080428 redhat 4.3.0-8 gcc both compile against qt 4.7.3 without incident

17734841
int	chars
then you create another stream from those two chars which you stream into an int using the hex manipulator to convert as hexadecimal

17734846
switching	screens
but even if i change the switching to false every time i log in the settings screens the value is true

17734859
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine in the last version of google-chrome for ubuntu firefox but not opera

17734980
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if i enable rewrite logging then i can see the .htaccess version being worked through but nothing from the httpd.conf

17734985
dictionary	map
once the correct scene object has been found in the dictionary map returns it

17735000
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in the both viewdidload and viewwillappear the frame property is nil

17735088
do.call	lapply
therefore i would use lapply to strip the values from each column of the data.frame that are na s because each one will be returned as a list element and you can still use do.call assume your data is called df

17735093
portrait	landscape
i m close with this but when i rotated with the touch 90 degrees along the x roll or y pitch then spin the phone from landscape to portrait 90 degree yaw rotation the matrix doesn t rotate properly it starts rotating what i think is on the x and z axis

17735102
hash	md5
the main reason for this is that it is virtually impossible to calculate the original password from the hash value generated by md5

17735102
hash	md5
md5 creates a hash value and it basically a trap door function in other words it is a one way function

17735137
debian	linux
i have vim version 7.3 with the spf13 bundle running on debian linux

17735169
min	max
so your input is taken as 360 and you won t get the max min you expect

17735184
mcc	mex
activate_matlab.sh m3iregistry mexopts.sh deactivate_matlab.sh maci64 mw_mpiexec deploytool matlab mw_smpd engopts.sh matopts.sh optsetup.sh insttype.ini mbuild registry lcdata.xml mbuildopts.sh util lcdata.xsd mcc worker lcdata_utf8.xml mex ldd mexext

17735223
folder	directory
i copied all the dll files from c emgu emgucv-windows-universal-gpu 2.4.9.1847 bin x86 to a folder called includes in my project and updated the copy to output directory option for these dlls to copy always and it got rid of this issue

17735237
ssl	https
2 you would need to set up a secure api on your web server protected with an ssl cert and https connections from your android app

17735283
width	height
one solution i have read say to wrap the inside of the cell in a div with relative positioning but that doesn t work because the div doesn t fill the whole cell even with height and width set to 100

17735295
hash	salt
this would provide more security than a simple hash especially as you can t salt the value otherwise it wouldn t be searchable

17735351
children	parent
trying to get the parent div to slide to the left when one of its children is clicked

17735375
int	chars
the literal removes the first two chars of any string int if its a number

17735395
innodb	myisam
it originally used the myisam engine for all the tables but due to foreign key requirements i changed all the tables to innodb and added foreign key and unique fields to the relevant models

17735429
pull	push
to the new ssh url in the repo but now i can t push or pull

17735444
loops	while-loop
that s the really simple fix the slightly more drastic one is to switch your while-loop to a for x in range 0 l-y loops

17735447
min	max
which suggests that the following line would do it but it does not work for me - the plots visible min and max are not modified based on this call

17735447
min	max
any tips on updating the graphs xaxis max and min values would be greatly appreciated

17735536
jobs	cron
despite the fact that i don t have to do that when logged in and it s the same user running the cron jobs

17735537
google-chrome	firefox
hi i am trying to change the css for a select element and it works fine in firefox but it doesnt work in google-chrome

17735569
findstr	ipconfig
probably netsh or ipconfig with some findstr can get you on polling the status

17735599
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome gets a valid event object with the correct button values in the dragover event however i found that firefox did not

17735619
move	drag
the problem is the window itself which drag move about when touchmove_ing

17735662
srp	principles
in this way you re not violating srp or other solid principles

17735679
free	malloc
it could definitely be done by allocating largish contiguous blocks of memory with malloc or similar which are kept track of and then something generates a correct pointers to the next batch of free memory inside of the block

17735683
short	base
in short i would like to create a base template and another custom

17735745
mouseleave	mouseenter
thank you all for contributing i have got an answer to my question after gathering more specific information from another question i ve asked in regards to mouseenter mouseleave events answer

17735749
post	get
now this is exactly what i want to get when i send a post request to my phantomjs webserver

17735761
division	multiplication
this suggests to me that if i were to create a class to represent a matrix then the order of multiplication would be left to right the reverse of what is desired since the example with floating point operations and division is evaluated left to right since the three operations have equal precedence

17735764
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the cookies are set and read properly on my local mac machine in google-chrome firefox safari and also on my virtual windows machine in google-chrome firefox

17735798
centos	linux
i setup my symfony project version 1.4 on centos linux vps following all the instructions

17735849
vb.net	vb6
we are using blackbaud s raiser s edge re software written in vb6 and vb.net as far as i know to keep track of our membership and donations

17735886
post	put
in a classic setup where the current page contains a form that post data to the same page for validation - put all the php validation and processing code at the top of your script

17735899
switching	screens
i have two screens and have the dev tools on one screens and the page on the other but i need to see when the div is coming through on the html as i step through the code and it is quite cumbersome to switching tabs after each click

17735944
getter	setter
my personal preference is to avoid explicitly declaring and using ivars at all unless i m overriding a property setter or getter because that way on the implementation i can tell at first glance which variables are local to the function or object properties

17735948
phpmyadmin	adminer
run this against your database using adminer or phpmyadmin

17735978
post	get
however since get post etc are executed last my middlewares do not have access to these

17735979
width	height
i have a responsive video container that isn t 16 9 and i d like the videos inside it to stretch to 100 width and 100 height even if it breaks their original aspect ratio

17736054
post	get
a good convention is that if you issue a get request you re asking for data but if you issue a post request you are adding data in your case creating a new favorite

17736064
folder	directory
karu s solution moves the config and system folder to the current users directory which is fair-er game

17736065
stdout	stderr
there are two channels through which something can send a message to the terminal one is called stdout which is used for most general output and the other is stderr which is reserved for errors and warnings

17736065
stdout	stderr
the number associated with stderr is 2 stdout is 1 so this is saying redirect all the messages on channel 1 to dev null and also do the same for all messages on channel 2

17736100
post	get
so currently i send an http post request to a server where i get a token back and then make another call after that to get the amount of list items the user has lets say games

17736152
builtin	isinstance
builtin functions isinstance and issubclass

17736168
folder	directory
for jfilechooser the default directory is typically the my documents folder on windows and the user s home directory on unix

17736175
division	modulo
you can do this by successive division by 10 and modulo 100

17736206
pop-up	dialog
use a dialog and not a pop-up

17736214
int	boolean
i used try and catch of a int but im not sure what to do with a boolean

17736268
awt	swing
don t mix awt and swing components

17736343
try-catch	exception-handling
this no longer requires you to handle an exception-handling and so the try-catch is not required now

17736356
button	checkbox
what happens is that 1 the user clicks the button to begin the export process then 2 the user either saves or downloads the file to their desktop 3 the file takes a considerable amount of time to render the basic cells 15 seconds then once the basic excel file renders 3 the spreadsheet renders the checkbox render time takes anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes depending on the speed of the computer and appears to hang until the checkbox appear like they appear in the gridview

17736358
folder	directory
the following works perfect simply drag and drop the folder to setup directory use the windows explorer not the solution explorer

17736383
range	minimum
the way i see this your first value in the array is always your initial relative minimum and maximum since you have absolutely no basis of comparison from the get-go unless you prime both relmin and relmax to 0 or define a range to find your relmin and relmax

17736396
google-chrome	firefox
jquery s .hide and .show work great in firefox and google-chrome but no luck in ie

17736456
width	height
i looked at the values of the box the x y -1 -1 and height width are also -1 -1 which is confusing seeing as the box is completely visible

17736467
folder	directory
first i have about 100 folder in a directory - i d like to place an folder in each one of those folder

17736468
width	height
this ensures that the image will cover the entire area in your case the image will almost always retain its height until the width of the banner becomes greater than the original width of the image then it will start to expand in size to fit the width

17736479
hide	show
you could have the already on the page tied to the model and hide show it with javascript

17736486
apache	nginx
why php is has this advantage because when using nginx instead of running php as a module of apache mod_php we install a separate server php-fcgi or php-fpm so it s independent of apache s method of spawning workers or threads or whatever

17736542
squash	branch
to my mind a simpler approach is to do git rebase -i squash as described effectively rebasing the branch onto itself

17736550
width	height
change the values of the height and width as you see fit should work

17736565
zoo	xts
perhaps using xts or zoo might be easier i am not sure.

17736570
width	height
the only problem is i cannot get the width height declarations to work on inner-wrapper div with the display table-cell property

17736572
disk	ram
if postgresql is set not to flush changes to disk then in practice there ll be little difference for dbs that fit in ram and for dbs that don t fit in ram it won t crash

17736579
ppm	pbm	ppm	pgm	pbm	pgm
i m trying to hack-up a program to read a pbm pgm or ppm file and render the image to the postscript output device using the image operator

17736581
hide	show
now you can set arrows options show hide directly in html like this

17736584
put	get
i keep coming up with thread errors and the information does not get put into the text fields

17736633
versioning	upgrade
as selenium and phantomjs have both upgrade to newer versioning

17736654
rubygems	rvm
i just setup an ubuntu 13.04 server and installed rvm 1.21.11 ruby 1.9.3-p448 and rubygems 2.0.5

17736662
mouseup	mousedown
i know a click event is a sequence of simple events mousedown mouseup click

17736696
getter	setter
these are called accessors or setter getter

17736705
width	height
the next step is whenever you add a component to the container you ve to use setbounds x y width height method on that component

17736705
width	height
you only used setlocation method without setting the size of the button you have to use setsize width height method also if you want the button to be displayable

17736708
dbcontext	objectcontext
i was able to smoothly re-reference to my new project convert my project to use the new dbcontext instead of objectcontext and removed the ef4 class library that held my old model

17736772
unsigned	short
the maximum value for an unsigned short 16 bits is 65535

17736788

17736867
post	get
ok even though this question was posted a long time ago i had the same problem and found a way to get keydown events working though it might not be what you re looking for i ll post the code to help future people with the same problem

17736867
keydown	keyup
just change the keydown for another attribute like keyup pointermoved pointerpressed and change the class keypressed to the name of the function you want to be fired the moment you get an event of a corresponding type

17736884
post	get
the line resources post in routes.rb generates the show post route for you test it by removing the line post get post id . format posts#show and then running rake routes on the command line

17736890
free	malloc
i have a library that replaces free malloc and a couple of other functions by using a define in it s header

17736914
hex	binary
setfill like most ostream modifiers hex dec left the binary one precision iirc too keep their value once you change them

17736914
std	ostream
std ostream the class cout is an instance of has internal formatting values

17736975
folder	directory
ok per the comments this modified version of your script disables access to create folder within the target directory whilst the dialog is active then removes the block at the end before the function completes

17736979
fadein	fadeout
position of my main section is absolute and it can t be changed cause i got jquery script on it fadeout fadein

17737042
boost	stl
another option - make sure the #include for this library are always after the #include for boost stl whatever

17737082
google-chrome	safari

stdio	gets
in fact gets has been removed from stdio since c11

17737112
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to read in arrays through a for-loop do some calculations on them and plot the result on a 3d graph but it gives me the error

17737123
width	margin
instead the non-em content begins at the 70px margin em-blcok width has no effect

17737178
division	modulo
the use of the modulo will be invaluable here - it performs integer division and returns the remainder of the quotient - kind of like short division

17737178
for-loop	loops
one last thing - you should only need one loops - preferably a for-loop since you know exactly how many elements you re going to iterate over

17737194
width	height
able to have a height width padding etc

17737199
google-chrome	firefox
tested on the stock browser dolphin google-chrome and firefox

17737280
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on google-chrome but it doesn t work on firefox

17737287
hide	show
new js to show or hide load more and show less

17737296
width	height
sure enough 215 is the height not the width

17737337
hide	show
i m using this horizontal list view and if i start with no items in the listview adapter the emptyview show and also if i start with items in the listview adapter it hide the emptyview but my problem is that the empty view will never show if i start with items and remove all the items from the listview adapter and will stay there if i start with no items and try to add items to the listview adapter

17737344
google-chrome	safari
so on google-chrome and safari my shoutbox completely vanishes after the page has loaded most of the time

17737412
width	height
i wanna copy the design style into android devices say the previous 30 by 30 button takes 30 640 4.6875 of the screen width in iphone 4 retina and 30 960 9.375 of the screen height then i expect it also takes 4.6875 of the android device screen width 9.375 of the screen height

17737433
superclass	subclassing
say i have a superclass animal and subclassing cat dog bird

17737440

i am using v3 api for google maps and every time i run my application in google-chrome application works in firefox and ie9 10

17737452
cos	atan2
library for fancy math functions like atan2 cos etc

17737487
quad	nurbs
in general you ll get more pleasant results if you smooth a quadrangular mesh instead of a trimesh - when you subdivide quad the results are very similar to nurbs curves whereas smoothed triangles always tend to look look like old-fashioned 1990 s game graphics

17737508
rss	feed
i m trying to create an auto-refreshing rss ticker feed where response.php parses the rss feed and the html file displays the output

17737537
width	height

width	height
you also need to be aware of the box-model - the sub elements width is 250px but if have a 250px wide box and use css to add 10px padding either size the display width will be 270px because it s the width or height plus any border plus padding

17740119
box-sizing	border-box
this can get really confusing - what you actually want is something that s still 250px wide with 10px left right padding within it - often it s easier to turn this behaviour off - as in my example - with box-sizing border-box

google-chrome	firefox
checking out the user agent styles for google-chrome and firefox they both add a display table

the functions you are looking for might be int8 number int16 number uint32 number any of them will convert double to an int but you must pick the best one for the result you want to achieve

17741457
int	double
remember that you cannot cast from double to int without rounding the number

17741457
int	double
if i understood you correcly you could create a function that would simply remove the comma from the double number by multiplying your starting value by 2 n and then casting it to int using any of the functions mentioned earlier performing whatever you want and then returning comma to its original position by dividing the number by 2 n

temporary	tablespace
when creating an extremely large index consider allocating a larger temporary tablespace for the index creation using the following procedure

17741650
temporary	tablespace
create a new temporary tablespace using the create tablespace or create temporary tablespace statement

17741650
temporary	tablespace
use the temporary tablespace option of the alter user statement to make this your new temporary tablespace

17741650
temporary	tablespace
then use the alter user statement to reset your temporary tablespace to your original temporary tablespace

17741650

using this procedure can avoid the problem of expanding your usual and usually shared temporary tablespace to an unreasonably large size that might affect future performance

in the end i changed my unsigned 64 bit integer into a fixed width hex string and saved that as the key as it seemed to be most convenient at the expense of some space

17746713
interpolation	splines
apache commons math has implementations of linear and splines interpolation that appear simple functional and trustworthy

17746808

i also tried to hide button in viewwillappear viewdidload or vieddidlayout subviews also unsuccessful

17746854
superclass	subclassing
having same field in subclassing hides the superclass field

17746882
free	malloc	int	chars
the part is true that you have to free each struct type individually as they have been malloc -ed individually and each memory block has been allocated specifically for that type.also on some systems chars and int have different storage sizes but you can try a solution like phillip provided

17746883
hide	show
that needs to show or hide activity by city

17747107
pull	push
pull first then push

17747158
sorting	filtering
a 1d median filtering on a point x works by taking n 2-1 of the adjacent values sorting them and returning the median value

17747206
width	height
another idea is to call findmatchingcontrols as shown in coded ui conditional check on a method is not working then use the properties such as some of x y height width to select the wanted control

17747254
width	height
you need to add dimensions width height

17747339

also you want character level n-gram or words level n-gram

17747972

if you have an array of bytes that are part of a little-endian single number you can use the bitconverter class to convert them to a 16 32 or 64 bit signed or unsigned integer

17747993
post	get
this is as expected as i haven t implemented get on the webserver - but i get no response at all using the following snippet to post to the same port

unsigned	short
there is no marshal.copy overload that takes an unsigned short array

17748311
integer	unsigned
this will copy the unsigned 16-bit integer values into a signed 16-bit integer array but the underlying byte values will remain the same and the unmanaged code won t know the difference

17748320
put	get
if there is no space then put will block but take won t get blocked as it s by design waiting only if the queue is empty obviously not the case here

i ve played around with it and it seems to always start happening after i ve used the value for a grid row height or a column width

17750615
maven	pom.xml	maven-install-plugin	pom.xml
old installations of maven are somewhat likely to suffer this issue as maven 2 will use any version of a plugin that it has unless a version has been explicitly specified in the pom.xml but maven-install-plugin is included by default and it s quite possible for a pom.xml not to explicitly specify it at all as it was in my case

put	get	post	get	post	put
within the library i created handlers for each request get post put del

17751234
post	put
i have managed to put together a way to achieve this thanks to suggestions in some post and the use of jquery.simulate.js used to run official jqui tests and i can procedurally start the sortable drag process in pretty much all browsers except ie8 and below simulating the events like so

17751234
move	drag	mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup
problem in ie8 or below after the interaction with the outside handle and simulation of mousedown and mousemove events the drag is indeed correctly started but as soon as the user really move his mouse in any way shape form the drag stops or cancels as if the mouseup event had ocurred to finalize it

17751315
coalesce	isnull
and so the coalesce and isnull allow me to turn that into a single set of data like this

17751333
google-chrome	firefox
checked this with firefox and google-chrome - instead of opening the pop-up on new window .it uses same window

subtract	add
alternatively subtract https add git replace the first with done

17751481
width	height
i particularly curious about width and height css properties which i define for images

17751491
hide	show
an alternative may be to hide the standard chart labels and put singletons below the chart to control the show information

17751497
cut	dash
if there is no dash it returns 0 - in which case your substr statement will add 0 and your -1 which adds up to -1 and if you use a negative number with substr it will search from the end of the string instead of the beginning - which is why your string would get cut off

17751506
inherited	properties

17751581
width	height

as for width height on these should be done via the attributes rather than style and the analyzer should not complain about that -- in fact it should encourage you to use those attributes

17751630
post	get
basically it generates a hash based on a string and secret key and this hash is sent along with the form as a hidden field http get if the value is changed by the customer then the recalculation of the hash http post will be different from what is stored in the hidden field then you know that someone change the value of that field

icmp	tcp
a typical implementation will use icmp echo requests if the privilege can be obtained otherwise it will try to establish a tcp connection on port 7 echo of the destination host

17751692
icmp	tcp
as tcp ip is designed you re in no way guaranteed to get hop-by-hop reachability information by using normal icmp tcp transmissions so there is no reliable way to get that information

17751692
traceroute	packets
the traceroute command can get semi reliable information on a hop by hop basis by setting ttl on the packets it sends but isreachable is a quick and dirty way to check reachability and does not use this technique

17751767
implements	extends
i can simply define a new class aclassconverter extends the abstract one and implements the specific convert method

17751821

build.gradle	gradlew
i had to change the dependencies in the build.gradle file under src dir not gradlew dir

17755609
google-chrome	firefox
this works on firefox google-chrome and ie

17755609
opera	safari
i haven t tested on opera or safari

17755666
min	max
i get loffx and loffy 1034 1029 -5 - 2 all kinds of nombers uncut by max and min

17755706
int	boolean
if it is true a boolean true a nonzero int etc. then expression1 s value is computed and takes the place of the entire conditional expression

17755706
int	boolean
if expression0 is false a boolean false a zero int null pointer etc. then expression2 s value replaces the entire conditional expression

17755744
rss	feed
if i remove the last else part then the program runs fine and prints the items from watch list found in rss feed

17755744
rss	feed
my goal is to be able to print only those items from rss feed that not found in my watch list array.my watch list array has around 700 items in it and rss feed around 1000 items

17755746
children	parent
i want to sort it such that the parent appears just above any of its children the parent being a rollup and the children being features

17755746
children	parent
then you can easily sort it out and have parent appearing just above children

17755787
integer	fractions
integer division is division in which the fractions part remainder is discarded

17755790
for-loop	arrays
the reason you get the last value set as the maximum every time is because you set every element in the arrays to the last random number generated on the last iteration of the outer for-loop

17755802
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

17755850
post	get
exactly how that work will depend on your infrastructure but you ll probably get and post data to a web server using http

17755914
min	max
make sure that you re actually using the min and max functions from and not some macros defined elsewhere

17755941
mp3	ogg
for firefox convert your mp3 to ogg and use ogg

17755941
mp3	ogg
for chrome mp3 works fine but it also works with ogg so if you convert to ogg you don t have to worry which browser needs what

17755972
portrait	landscape
the easiest solution to your current approach is probably to ensure that getitem int returns different values for the landscape and portrait orientations

17755975
multiplying	add
the unix time includes milliseconds in this case so you also need to multiplying by 1000 or add 999 to the end

17755988
lisp	smalltalk
btw ruby smalltalk and common lisp off the top of my head also have similar non-local returns

17755993
hide	show
i found many places that explain how to show hide div content with css and javascript but that is not exactly what i am looking for

17756032
onresume	onpause
although it s against my ideal i do avoid the constructor for initialization of the activity members and rely on onresume and onpause for resources that my app is dealing with

17756032
onresume	onpause
they would have a close method that you have to invoke at the proper time onresume or onpause

17756036
hide	show
if you have strong ideas about your ui then in my opinion your best bet is to write your own custom presenter - then you can open close hide show whatever you want

17756037
mouseup	mousedown
instead of mousedown mouseup try using

17756042
folder	directory
i have a base directory that contains several thousand folder

17756051
int	double
of course this double or quadruples if using int the number of bytes you have to write for very little benefit

17756058
post	get
the app uses afnetworking to get and post to the server

17756058
post	get
as i am developing it i make post to test and see if http requests are working- and they do but i have all of these test post that i would like to get rid of

17756063
hide	show
from what i understand from my code and my intention is hide filessend and show senddev

17756063
hide	show
does anyone know why that hide show might not be working

17756085
listview	gridview
also wants to change listview background may be there s gridview that why background property not working

17756088
min	max
i ve tried several min max and row partition iterations but the results have left off several qualifying entries

17756113
udp	tcp
you can use both tcp and udp connections with the chrome.socket api but this is only for packaged apps apps that are bundled in a container to be run as desktop apps

17756116
post	get
probably the fastest way to help you get your tests running is for you to post your code as part of your question

17756138
put	get
also i put breakpoints inside methods containsprefix and getvalue but they never get triggered

17756173
weblogic	geronimo
edit 2013 07 21 i recalled that weblogic server had sophisticated startup facilities that might be useful in achieving the init only once in the cluster logic that i want to do in my geronimo tomcat cluster

17756174
google-chrome	firefox
it s working fine in firefox and google-chrome

17756208
floating-point	integer
to parse a string into an integer you can use parseint but if you don t care whether it s an integer or floating-point there s no need to do anything - it will automatically convert when you try to use it

17756211
multiplying	division
now when multiplying the result after division you actually multiplying the error

17756234
udp	tcp
udp is a layer over ip as is tcp

17756234
udp	tcp
you can t work in raw sockets in java but you can work in udp and tcp

17756248
filtering	grouping
there may be more going on if your filtering is set on details3 grouping that is looking to differentiate the different values you could be grouping a b etc.

17756248
filtering	grouping
i would ensure the set is simple to start and has one filtering on a parent grouping to start of just what you want to determine

17756248
filtering	grouping
set it s filtering and if you then get expected results add a parent grouping to that of extra predicates

17756275
tinyint	boolean
instead boolean i ve used tinyint

17756305
hide	show
you have to add these fragments to the view they are meant to be displayed in before calling hide and show functions

17756313
free	calloc
i m writing some code that depends on calloc and was wondering it would be safe to repoint the pointer to stack space if calloc failed then set the pointer to null before the call to free or skip it altogether

17756322
getter	setter
create a runnable and use the setter and getter you define in said runnable

17756325
maven	pom.xml
better if you have a multimodule maven project with a parent pom.xml you can use this with maven dependencymanagement xml node

17756346
namenode	checkpoint
namenode will allow only that secondary node u mentioned other than that it wont allow anothe secondary namenode to checkpoint it

17756370
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you can also use viewdidappear or viewwillappear

17756392
width	height
the only problem was that i didn t set the preview width and height

17756392
width	height
this meant that the height and width i allocated for the array proportional to previewwidth previewheight tended to be a lot larger than the size of the actual data being returned proportional to the default preview width and preview height

17756426
dictionary	map
of course the above two approaches could be combined 1 - a getvalue function that use a per-type extractor similar to controlcompanion but independent of a control instance looked up by a map dictionary based on the actual type of the control object

17756426
dictionary	map
if one didn t even want to maintain the map dictionary manually assembly reflection could load these per-type extractors automatically - oh the possibilities and possible complexity

17756429
width	height
i hard-coded in the width and height to force the scrollbars to appear

17756533
move	drag
specifically when i click and drag to move the panel instead of following the mouse the panel just sort of stutters and the text changes to a value of 10 changing whenever i move the mouse

17756562
hide	show
i ve written some jquery to handle this which makes use of show and hide

17756587
put	get
so i have put the full stack of errors i get on each command

17756652
umask	mkdir
when a new file or directory is created the permissions are determined by taking the permissions specified in the call to creat or mkdir and then masking off the bits that are specified in the umask

17756669
pygtk	pygobject
a good way to turn up examples using the introspected bindings offered by pygobject 3 in contrast to the old static bindings offered by pygobject 2 and pygtk is to use gi.repository as a search keyword

17756722
superclass	subclassing
table per subclassing - one table for the superclass and a separate table for each subclassing

17756722
superclass	subclassing
table per concrete subclassing - separate table for each subclassing no table for superclass

17756770
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
so unless you really need to support ie 7 or below use regular xmlhttprequest and xdomainrequest

17756776
ssl	https
lwp protocol https socket ssl connect attempt failed with unknown error error 14090086 ssl routines ssl3_get_server_certificate certificate verify failed at usr share perl5 lwp protocol http.pm line 51

17756776
versioning	upgrade
looks like the issue has nothing to do with the ubuntu versioning but the new packages i get when i do apt-get upgrade on the 12.10 box i didn t do that and it was working

17756783
fast-forward	merge
fetch won t update your local branches unless you also pass it a refspec and it will only do a fast-forward or forced update in such cases not a true merge

17756816
hide	show
below is code written by another user on here to show hide a div with a random delay between 4- 8 seconds

17756892
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview commiteditingstyle uitableviewcelleditingstyle editingstyle forrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

17756895
getter	setter
it may have a number of getter and setter methods for the properties

17756914
int	chars
the above code can easily be adapted to sort arrays of chars instead of int

17756935
ssl	https
it also can depend on the version of net https and on whether or not io socket ssl is installed

17756935
ssl	https
net https will prefer io socket ssl which uses net ssleay over net ssl which uses crypt ssl

17756935
ssl	https
more recent versions of net https have improved how it works with io socket ssl

17757029
jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
i can recommend wicket you won t have licence restrictions it s an apache licence and it s a time resistent solution jsf are too complex for simple use cases and struts is quite as complicated but a rather old technology

17757045
width	height
i utilized things like width height and clear for this css

17757046
int	boolean
you can use sharedpreferences to save any primitive data boolean floats int longs and strings

17757086
children	parent
i want the child divs to fill up the width of the parent the combined width of the children should be the parent

17757103

17757114
imagemagick	wand
i m using imagemagick with wand in python to convert images and to get thumbnails from them

17757137
fadein	fadeout
fadein fadeout and load are sync in jquery so you need to place them in callback of each other

17757147
submit	submission
this may cause duplicate submission when the form does submit however so be careful

17757149
subtract	add
in order to find combinations subtract the first number of the list from the target number and search the rest of the list for combinations that add up to the difference

17757154
submit	submission
this may cause duplicate submission when the form does submit however so be careful

17757167

pretty much all i am trying to do is upload an image from my computer to my home web server the same way i do with ftpwebrequest but want to use httpwebrequest or something similar

17757192
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
note drop-shadow works only with webkit engines opera google-chrome and safari - thanks to eliran malka for pointing that out

17757305
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
rootviewcontroller is a property of uiwindow of type uiviewcontroller

17757327
prepare	execute
the repeatedly part is so you can execute a prepare query again with different values possibly relieving the rdbms from having to re-parse and re-optimize the query

17757395
hide	show
i want to search by text entered in textbox and show the result after clicking a button and hide the records that doesn t match

17757397

17757413
google-chrome	firefox
my css works correctly in firefox and google-chrome

17757424

17757494
webclient	webrequest
i have used both webclient and the webrequest webresponse ways without success

17757519
implements	extends
basically you will need to either extends thread or implements runnable in both classes then move the work you are doing into a method with the signature

17757519
implements	extends
if you extends thread you can just create a new instance of your class and call .start and if you implements runnable you can create a new instance of thread passing an instance of your class to it and then call start on that

17757555
integer	unsigned
change the format string to u and it will display the unsigned integer value

17757562
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
this jquery xmlhttprequest object or jqxhr

17757630
client-side	server-side
well i don t think you can write to the modelstate dictionary using javascript because it is a client-side language and c# razor are processed on the server-side

17757706
serializable	deserialization
in practice it means if you alter the class somewhat which can include things that don t simply add instance variables things that you wouldn t think would matter for serializable deserialization your deserialization will fail because the deserialization of your serializable objects will now yield a serialversionuid that is different from the one calculated for the class you re hydrating it into

17757742
javassist	cglib
perhaps it is possible at runtime too with javassist or cglib

17757826
sudo	passwd
some commands need super-user access i prefixed them with sudo and it will ask for your passwd

17757875
ubuntu	debian
i ve already tested this o ubuntu 12 debian 6 and 7 and the same numbers are displayed

17757885
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the code provided by roko user2469528 worked a treat so thank you but it seems to be ok only in google-chrome which i use in checking my work but not so in firefox ie and safari i just noticed it

17757885
firefox	safari
but not so in firefox safari ie10.

17757887
googletest	cppunit
latest eclipse cdt kepler may be even juno supports c++ unit testing with various frameworks cppunit googletest btw

17757888
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested in the browser safari google-chrome though and the issue is still there

17757891
width	height
this site will be responsive so the fully loaded images height will vary based on browser width as they have a max-width 100

17757950
int	double
the other potential problem is that args.length is an int and you are using it in division with a double

17757950
int	double
although java will probably do the right thing here you are safest to explicitly cast any int to a double before using it in such a calculation

17757952
hash	md5
and md5 isn t an encryption it s a secure hash

17757973
width	height
you have an overlay of width and height 100 and a transparent background of black color position absolute

17757979
post	get
because this is like we are sending a get post request to the server every single time the user time a character

17758015
implements	extends
i have a class customcanvasview extends view and i ve implements clicking dragging and pinch-zooming for the class

17758015
gesturedetector	onlongclicklistener
from what i ve read in various posts everyone has a different way of doing this but the general consensus seems to be that i should use either an onlongclicklistener or a gesturedetector

17758059
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade to the latest versioning of phonegap 2.9.0 to fix this but no luck

17758088
post	get
i need to get the last post id from wpdb

17758111
hash	salt
in theory you could generate a rainbow hash table for each of the unique salt in the database use this to crack your users passwords and recreate them in wordpress with a salt-less hashing

17758117
spaces	delimiter
keyboard.next only reads until the next delimiter token so if you want to capture 10 grades separated by spaces you need capture the whole line like

17758148
build.gradle	gradlew
if so you can add those groovy files to the compiler resources list in intellij via gradlew by adding this to build.gradle

17758165
setinterval	settimeout
the problem is that you have to wait a little for the page to load out and javascript works asynchronously so you have to use setinterval or settimeout see

17758176
spaces	linefeed
adding spaces in between the linefeed does not change functionality

17758221
hash	salt
all passwords need to be salt in order to hash them securely

17758452
int	chars
and where ever i read every node in the trie would consist of an int variable which would mark the end of an word and would also consist of 26 pointers each pointing to nodes in the lower level assuming the words only contain small letter chars

17758464
geocoding	geocode
the cheapest geocoding api that can return a formatted address similar to google would be geocode farm

17758476

when you get the current user information put it in the session instead of pulling it from the database which is what it sounds like you are doing correct me if i have misunderstood the issue

17758489
post	get
second when using the form element you have to specify whether you re using a post method or a get method

17758515
getter	setter
computed property which acts like a standard getter and setter but defaults to the value from defaultpath

17758516
oncreate	onnewintent
put the extra data handling codes in both oncreate and onnewintent not in onresume

17758547
bash	zsh
as of some time now i have been very tempted to switch from bash to zsh

17758554

17758603
g++	gcc
you could first compile your code files with individual compilers gcc for .c g++ for .cpp g77 for .f and nvcc for .cu

17758626
folder	directory
i therefore opened monodevelop from the working directory that contains all of these package folder and i still get invalid references

17758626
folder	directory
i think this is probably because the project is looking for package_name reference but the folder are name package_name.version in the working directory

17758639
width	height
eg - x 10 y 10 label test width 100 height 100

17758660
children	parent
then you can have an id column on the entity table which is unique and foreign keys from the children to their parent instances

17758667
post	get
i really love that async await style but i don t know how to get the redirected url after a post get request

17758680
g++	gcc
at least as far as i know gcc g++ doesn t provide an equivalent to that though

17758681
put	get
when run through haddock the functions get and put show up but they are using the default documentation from monadstate

17758704
children	parent
if i understand your question right you can target the parent li and then override the children s color

17758719
nasm	fasm
so i understand that there are many assemblers such as masm fasm nasm etc

17758723
ssl	https
i don t know the details of the https .herokuapp.com stack but i m not surprised at all that it can service quite a bit more https traffic than a cold ssl endpoint elb

17758746
integer	unsigned
you could decide to start a new series of enumerations using a second 32-bit unsigned integer to store the bits

17758780
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
when selecting the first option in the uisegmentedcontrol the uitableview is displayed again

17758780
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
the uisegmentedcontrol scrolls with the uitableview

17758848
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

17758848
comparator	comparable
hence in your case implementing comparable and overriding comparator is enough

17758868
dictionary	map
i think you have the dictionary backwards switch the order of the key values so that you map a key string to a list value

17758896
int	double
by default java look on any number as on int or double type depending on if it has or hasn t dot

cmmotionmanager	uiaccelerometer
i have fixed all accelerometer issues by switching from using uiaccelerometer to cmmotionmanager

17759060
hide	show
if you want to hide or show an element conditionaly you should use the reactive behavior of meteor add a condition to your template

17759108

if that dosen t work then i would printf c to the screen right after it is returned from fgetc

17759140
hash	hmac
checksum - this is a hmac hash to make sure the request wasn t tampered with

17759177
inline	inlining
as far as inlining is concerned while the constant cannot be inline in the bytecodes because of the jls rules about what a constant expression is the jit compiler s optimizer would be permitted to do this and may actually do it .

17759190
serializable	deserialization
basically you only want to deal with serializable when an object is saved and deserialization when an object is loaded

17759219
hide	show
i have an img element with a ng-src attribute that will show hide if the models image value exists something like the following

17759223
hide	show
now we need to make the status bar hide and show when we switch fragments

17759223
hide	show
we keep track of the page number using onpageselected and use it in onpagescrollstatechanged to dynamically hide show the status bar depending on which fragment is currently being displayed

i suggest you look at javascriptmvc libraries like backbone.js or ember.js they are perfect for the kind of app you are building they can help you develop cleaner code in large multi-state web apps like this

17759527
getter	setter
on the javascript side you can wrap up this data structure in an object and use getter and setter to dynamically update the heap

17759539
int	double
i have moved through the int and am now up to float and double data types

17759553
